Each and every character is dealt with utmost care and every character has a definition in the story. All the stories of each character has an ending. All good actors. Anand Devarakonda was just above average. Need to improve maturity and expression wise. The fathers character is a stealer of the show. He was so great and wonderful acting. Best thing in this movie is the leafs father and mother character. Overall a very well directed film by Vinod."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Malayalam film industry is making these kind of movies and we are missing them in telugu...

We quickly loose interest in the characters. There's no flow or rythm to what's happening in the movie. Coming to the love story we get exactly what we saw in the trailer there's no extra thing in their story. Yes the Nativity is shown nicely but there's nothing strong for showcasing the village or its beauty. Same in the case of acting, main leads tried to act but there isn't anything to act for. The only new and good thing I liked is few charcters and thier storyline. Even though we have seen these types of troops a lot these days but this film showed them in a new way."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Absolutely brilliant, lovely direction, brilliant casting, everyone acted naturally, you will be a part of it throughout.

Kudos to Director for bringing best out of every character. But still this is Long Short Film."}, {"id": 21, "text": "This movie is a delight. Kudos to the debut director for managing to distill the nuances of a middle class life. The movie kept me glued to my seat until the end and I enjoyed every moment of it. The cameo of the director at the end is the cherry on the cake. The story grows organically while giving the necessary credence to the character development and doesn't include the usual commercial elements of contemporary movies that prop up the unrealistic plot lines. The movie is well directed. The background score is superb and it will be crime if the crew behind this movie do not churn out more of these gems."}, {"id": 22, "text": "A beautifully made film.

The screenplay is structured in such a way that there are flavours of emotion on screen from one scene to another, from one character to another. It was as if witnessing Dileesh Pothan's freshness splattered on Telugu cinema!Overall, Middle Class Melodies clearly states that the Telugu Cinema and her audience has changed by a huge magnitude, which is exciting indeed! Funny that both the brothers (Anand and Vijay Deverakonda) chose a food-oriented script as their second film as (one of the) lead actor (remember #PelliChoopulu!)Full Review - naveensankaran.home.blog/2020/11/21/middle-class-melodies-heart-warming-piece-of-work/"}, {"id": 28, "text": "Direction and screenplay is just amazing. I haven't seen such a movie in last couple of years. Dialogues are so natural and humorous. You don't think the actors were new. Everyone took part so well. I watched this movie twice. I haven't waterbed any movie twice in last 10 years including bahubali BS. I wasted 120 USD on bahubali to watch with family.

To me, this movie is just had an ordinary Indian story - Nothing unique - Nothing great, just showing a regular Indian life. Anyways, 4 stars for decent acting and humour."}, {"id": 46, "text": "Beautiful writing!! Direction, cinematography, editing and music are good! All the actors nailed the characters..parents of the lead pair, friends and paalu poseti thatha belonged to us..though anand needs to improve on his expressions and dubbing."}, {"id": 47, "text": "There is nothing interesting about the story , no one knows the conflict, few sequences and some scenes are good, All actors did great except Anand Devarakonda, Goparaju Ramana did exceptionally well as Anand's father. Varsha Bollamma is a performer. Locations are very good, Editing is good, cinematography is ok.

I mean better than recent roasted movies.A middle class guy with an idea setting up a hotel in a town. did he success in pursuing his dream? is the remaining part of the film. that's it! Simple. But, Scenes are good for showing the middle class situations.The script is well written. But, coming to managing the script, director Vinod anantoju is didn't do it well.First half is good, even though second half is snail's slow, it's watchable."}, {"id": 60, "text": "The first this that has to be appreciated about this movie is the taking and quality of cinematography.

Anand devarakonda not even less than his brother vijay and heroine acting is superb and the secens between hero and his father were awesome and fully comedy movie good direction good screenplay....."}, {"id": 64, "text": "Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best movies in Telugu(or maybe all languages) that I have watched this year. The movie stays rooted throughout and completes the character arcs well.It brought back memories from my days in Vijayawada, especially the Guntur slang which is not artificial or forced but fits in perfectly and organically. The slang and mannerisms are on point for almost everyone except Anand, who kind of struggles in getting the accent right.In terms of performances, the lead actors Anand and Varsha have done decently well and for his second film, Anand does a great job in picking such a film and staying as much as possible in a realistic character. The artists in the roles of Anand's father Kondalrao and friend Gopal along with Gautami have also managed to steal the show. The comedy was also well knit into the story and had me in splits at multiple places.Overall, it was satisfying to watch a movie that is breathe of fresh air among the star-studded disappointments from Tollywood that have strong elevations of the hero but weak, predictable and repetitive stories. Adding to movies like Pelli Choopulu, ENE and Agent Sai Srinivasa Atreya, this gem of a movie joins the list."}, {"id": 65, "text": "Kudos to the director for being so authentic to the characters and the nativity of the world around which the story revolves. Except the hero everyone where pretty good their performances. However, heros performance in this movie waa far more better than in dorasani, he has improved himself but still the uncomfort of lack of screen presence sustained from dorasani, he still get the nack of pulling audience to his emotions. Its actually a emotional story and it required a pretty good actor to whom the audience must travel with but he doesnt seem to grab such attention from the viewers infact hero friend, heros father and divya(cell phone shop girl) had succeeded with the same. Especially the father, he just eats up the screen whenever he is in the frame thats what an actor brings to the table for a pretty good story. Music was soothing. Coming to the direction, director has done a very good job. The story, screenplay and direction were so good that you will not get distracted much from the story. Last 20minutes reminded me of the nature of malyalam films where the story changes completely due to some kind of butterfly effect. Varshas character seems to be extrovert in the movie because usually introverts loves to chat with a person rather than speaking to them directly but she does that vice versa. Overall a pretty good one. Lucky fellow sai devarakonda... Banking some good stories under his account."}, {"id": 66, "text": "One of the very good movies I have watched in the recent times. I have watched quite a few famous old classics of world cinema during the last few months and to me this movie proudly stands as one among the best. Any good movie should primarily be capable of capturing the hearts and attention of the audience, stirring the emotions in the process. Any delicacy, if it does not leave a sense of satisfaction after you have finished, is of no good, even if it is made of the finest ingredients and served in the best possible setting. This movie leaves you satisfied. Mind you all the actors are new and the director Vinod Ananthoju is doing his first film. He deserves rich praise for his directional talent. The storyline, cinematography, music, songs, dialogues are all excellent to say the least. With no costly settings or even make up, what the film has achieved is simply superb. Anand Devarakonda has given out a mind boggling performance. I believe he has brought out his heart in the character. Varsha Bollamma, Chaitanya Garikipati, Divya Sripada, Goparaju Ramana, Prem Sagar gave their best performances. I hope and wish that Tollywood should draw inspiration from this film and spend more time on producing good quality films."}, {"id": 67, "text": "FILM: Middle Class Melodies (Telugu language; Watched it on AmazonPrimeVideo platform)Contains: Hotel business, love story and middle class melodiesCan I watch\ud83e\udd14 : Just go for it...been ages since I loved watching a film again and againDirection : Director vinod ananthoju narrates it so well that you will fall in love with the film.
