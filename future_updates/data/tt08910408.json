This movie is inspired by true events and tells the life of Komitas and his work. Knowing it's based on true events, it's a lot to take in watching his upbringing as an orphan and the time in which he grew up and the hardships he faced that we cannot fathom today. It was hard at times to watch the atrocities he (and countless others) lived through as an Armenian man during a time of mass genocide against himself and his people. Highly recommend!"}, {"id": 20, "text": "The story of an artist, composer and priest who stayed forever in history. The story of Armenian genocide in 1915 which should never be forgotten.

The film is about one of the music geniuses that is known, and his music is being taught in so many European music schools. The voices and pictures are so real to me, and i think the director did a great job trying to picture the life back then. Nothing is surreal in the movie except it could be more violent to picture the events better."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Great movie ! Put it on your list of movies to watch !"}, {"id": 24, "text": "What an amazing masterpiece! Solomon(Komitas), an orphan, who studied in Armenias' religious center and later went to Berlin to continue his studies. With his music and lectures he influenced many well known musicians. His work will live continuously. It's unfortunate that because of the Armenian Genocide Armenians lost most of his work, his inheritance. Also very sad how he mentally couldn't handle witnessing the Armenian Genocide. One starts to wonder how much his eyes have seen..."}, {"id": 25, "text": "I highly recommended this movie, such a brilliant movie"}, {"id": 26, "text": "Touching story based on real events.
