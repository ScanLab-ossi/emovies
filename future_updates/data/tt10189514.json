The various hurdles he faces and how he overcomes it is the rest of the film. Everybody likes motivational films because after watching it one gets a sense of hope and positivity. The film shows maaran's road to success as bumpy as possible until the end. The performances are the main highlight. Suriya sir is fantastic as maaran. Aparna balamurali comes with a good debut in tamil. Urvasi is brilliant as usual. After long time, I am seeing paresh rawal in a negative role and he was very cool in it. Mohan babu shines in his extended cameo. Cinematography is also very good. Film is predictable but the direction compensates it. On the whole, soorarai pottru is a comeback of suriya after several debacles. Hope, he comes with more promising films."}, {"id": 245, "text": "Started watching without any expectations but it nailed it..some centiment scene looks soo real and surya acted very well..

Review menu icon Profile image Bharath krishna 4 days agoMan what a great movie.I felt so inspired and Surya juts nailed it..a huge come back and beecr expected return of Surya and the direction n cinematography was good.Sudha did a great job of portraying Gopinath's life in a very rugged way and the character of maara and his wife along with his parents and friends were strong and those two gentlemen who played as his friends were absolutely a great pair and surely cannot be neglected at all.The scene where Surya was cheated by,his wife,the whole world turning against him was the moment we saw surya's eyes filling up with tons of emotions such as fear,sad,lack of confidence,anger,lost, desperate and literally a man would have turned weak but the moment where he puts it all together and continues to do what he is meant to do as a tribute for his father,his village, his motherland and most importantly his passion was Incredible.Another scene that gave me goosebumps was the moment our dearest Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam sir was portrayed in the movie as a saviour,angel and guardian of faith and we all must be truly lucky to have lived in an era where that kind and generous man walked this earth spreading peace and love.Made us realize how many people were ready to push us down when we want to make a difference in the world and it's all because of money, jealousy and ego.Let our great nation dream big and have a greater vision and let all those who dreamt to be what they want to change this great for for good n be successful whether they are from a village or city or slums,poor or rich or middle class.Vande Mataram. 221 people found this helpful.

It's one of the finest movies ever made in recent time,to be specific,the best among all the OTT releases!! the movie really deserves a thundering applause.The movie deals with the story of low cost aviation.Suriya Sir,portrayed the protagonist Nedumaaran so convincingly,he breathed n lived the character. A common man, who dreamt of making poor people fly,how his dream came true after so many impediments,the story is about that.It's a journey of a man who never gives up even after facing hindrance time and again.The scenes in which Nedumaraan(Suriya) vented his anger and frustration is truly commendable. An out and out inspirational movie.Never felt bored,was glued to the screen. At the end,feeling sad as it was not released in theatres. \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude14 BUT one thing I can assure,SURIYA SIR is back after lukewarm film like NGK(though he was as usual awesome).

First of all, those expectations and comparisons are 'pointless and invalid', because this movie is already revealed to be a fiction of certain original events but not entirely a true story. Breaking the cost and caste barriers is what the plot line is and it actually starts with the protagonist who doesn't even support any caste. But there are few, who badly wants to portray the caste of Mr.Gopinath so accurately and bring back the caste discrimination. This movie is just to portray the struggles of a common man against the capitalistic ego and inspire the hard working people.

Review menu icon Profile image haritha harry 2 days agoA sparrow cannot become an eagle but my son will change that!THIS MOVIE IS A JOURNEY. Please don't miss it. Amazon Prime finally brings it home and how!Although I'm disappointed we don't get to watch this in theatres among all the crowd cheering, I'm grateful the makers of the film decided to bring such a brilliant story to life. I hope this movie will also push people to read the biopic as well.This movie will take you on a very intense ride, which might stick with you for a long time. The aspirations of a comman man to achieve something close to impossible, the anguish of a son to start a revolution and the longing of bringing a dream to come to life, it has EVERYTHING.At some point in life, all of us would have been victims of some power in life, we couldn't overcome. This movie restores that faith, that no matter what, don't give up. It also emphasizes that when someone has the faith in you, you'll fly!Coming to the performances, Suriya is outstanding in every frame. For me, this has to be one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. His performance will leave a huge impact, especially the scene where he needs to fly home to see his father.Aparna as the female lead is one the most empowering characters ever. In a world of women always choosing to play the annoying arm candy, be Aparna! Her chemistry with Suriya is impeccable.Most memorable character would be of the mother of Maara. She is very moving and will bring tears in almost every scene she's in.I cannot vouch for the dubbing, I have watched this in Tamil. The VFX could have been a better in some places but that is a very minor glitch compared to everything else in the movie.

There are some predictable scenes in the movie which could have been avoided. 2. Paresh Rawal plays the typical non south indian villain (new trend in south indian films).

Maaran (Suriya) - based on Air Deccan founder GR Gopinath and his book, Simply Fly - wants to create a low-cost airline. Bommi (Aparna Balamurali) wants to run a bakery. The loveliest touch is when they make a pact (her suggestion) that their earnings go into a common pool. It's not his income or hers, but theirs. I don't think I've seen household financial decisions being depicted on screen ever, less so when the couple is yet to get hitched. The Maaran-Bommi scenes are the best thing about Soorarai Pottru, directed by Sudha Kongara. (She's a friend. I had a look at an early draft of the script.) Suriya has many big acting moments here, and his most brilliant one is in the scene where - despite that pre-marital pact - Maaran hesitates to ask Bommi for money. Her business is soaring. His is just not taking off.

Cinematic liberty is utilized to the perfect level, knowing the limit to which audience will be okay to believe, placing an important part of the flashback in the President-Meeting scene is a perfect example of that. The film never loses its focus from the story, on-point. Intensity-level of certain situations is sure to increase our pulse rate. There's so much that is going on-screen and the beauty is it's so clearly conveyed and the flow is seamless. Dialogues add so much value to the subject and they are very naturally placed, word choices and the slang too. Amidst the bunch of memorable scenes, business meet with villain in his flight, Udipi Hotel sequence, All India Radio interview and the climax stand out.#GVPrakash's musical treatment is rich. The songs have impressed already, visually-good too. Except for a couple of minor facts that the opening number could have choreographed in a better manner and some songs have been cut-shortened in the film. The camera work is outstanding. Set work, costumes and make-up are apt for the timeline of the setting. Some tiny jump cuts looked odd, otherwise, the film has been neatly-edited. Feels slightly stretched towards the end.

Easily the best of 2020, this is not just another film. This is a masterpiece. Based on Captain Gopinath and his struggle to launch Air Deccan, the cheapest airlines in the world against the tycoons that have been pumping profit into their pockets with their airline business. This film is a rare gem that has nailed every aspect. Surya, after a long gap returns and he does it with such a bang. He does take you on a rollercoaster ride, makes you cry and makes your blood boil. Aparna Balamurali finally gets something to show off her ability. The character she plays is not just another woman character to romance the lead. She is a pillar that props up the lead. The other pillar? The mother, played by the great Urvashi. Karunas, Vivek, Krishna Kumar, Gnanasambandham have been incredible. No matter how short the roles are,they do make an impact in the story, perhaps guide the protagonist and support him in his journey. Mohan Babu as Naidu was a pleasant addition. Adding goosebumps when the protagonist lose all hopes. Paresh Rawal- in his Tamil debut- does a brilliant job as the ruthless cunning antagonist. Vijay Kumar- the dialogue writer- deserves an applause- every line was fuel to the fire that burns up in veins of viewers. Sudha Kongara- the director- shows us she can make biopics that can give you goosebumps, a film that you ll remember, a story that can inspire you to dream the impossible, a movie that engages you for two and a half hours without letting your attention go astray."}, {"id": 1462, "text": "Plus PointsSuriya gives one of his career-best performances with this film. The intensity which we have been missing in Suriya's recent performances is brought back superbly by the star actor. From scene one, Suriya is magnificent as the restless soul who wants to fulfill his dreams. Be it in the interval scene where his dream is shattered or the climax episode, where he goes through a roller coaster of emotions, Suriya steals the show and will arrest you with his performance.One of the biggest pillars of the film is the heroine Aparna Balamurali. She gives solid support to Suriya and plays the doting wife's role supremely well. The way she looks, expresses her emotions, and showcases solid chemistry with Suriya is the major asset of the film. Mohan Babu does not have much screen time but in the three scenes he gets, the legendary actor impresses and brings depth to the film.One can not forget the emotional aspect of the film. Sudha Kongara's writing is so strong that every emotion works in the film. The husband-wife angle, mother-son relationship, and conflict between Suriya and Paresh Rawal, all these episodes have gripping emotions.Paresh Rawal is classy in his role and brings a lot of depth to the film. The production design is solid and visuals of the bygone era have been showcased in a superb manner. The film is filled with several goosebump oriented scenes and will impress you with its engaging narration. Minus PointsThe film runs on a very serious note and that is the reason some of the regular audiences who expect something from Suriya will be disappointed. Also, the pace of the film is a bit slow as the story unfolds leisurely and in detail. The first ten minutes post interval becomes dull with too much melodrama. There are no special twists or turns in the story and the proceedings are straightforward.Technical AspectsThis film is super strong in terms of its technical Aspects. Music and BGM are a major plus as GV Prakash fills life into the proceedings. The camerawork is astonishing as the village set up and aviation backdrop are showcased nicely. The VFX used for the film is also top-notch. Satyadev dubs for Suriya and it takes at least ten minutes for you to adjust to his voice. But once that is done, Satyadev does so well. The lyrics, Telugu dubbing, and costume design, everything falls in place perfectly.Coming to the director Sudha Kongara, she has proved her worth once again. The manner in which she mixes facts with nice fictional elements was so good to see. Sudha stays true to the emotions and showcases gritty drama which is the biggest highlight of the film. She makes us root for Suriya's character right through the film and this is where you get connected to the emotions of a man who dreams big and shows how things are achieved. VerdictOn the whole, Aakasam Ne Haadu Ra is one of Suriya's best performances to date as he lives in his role and takes us on a roller coaster of emotions. The setup, amazing performances, superb production values, and engaging drama light up the screen from scene one. Barring a slightly slower pace, this is one of the very well made films in recent times and makes up for an inspiring watch. Don't miss it."}, {"id": 1463, "text": "Roosevelt once said, The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. Surya's new movie Soorarai Pottru can be handily deciphered using that quote.Well, the story is loosely based on the life of G.R Gopinath, the founder of Simplifly Deccan, formerly known as Air Deccan. But the story penned by Sudha Kongara took the liberty of changing the whole atmosphere to suit the cinematic language, where Gopinath became Maaran along with the portrayal of other characters.The story is no different from the usual inspirational movies that garner the viewer's appreciations. The story goes like this. A man from the lower section of society tries to achieve his dream, and while striving to make it a reality, he had to follow a path of thorns and sharp stones. Yes, it's the same old story.However, the characters are strong and their profundity makes the movie engaging. The stellar performances from the likes of Surya, Aparna, Urvashi, Paresh, Mohan Babu and many others take the movie to another level. The music by GVP is also worth mentioning. The soul of the movies like this finds the way with tunes like this.The presence of bold female characters and depictions of lower Indian society tries to talk more than the story of a person trying to fly high. Certain caricatures like Ballaiyya (Vijay Mallya) and the likes of many others are in the movie.Since the movie is loosely based, let's say that these characters are arranged for enhancing the cinematic experience. Wait, there is a scene from one of these characters that give goosebumps. Watch the movie and experience it. Let's keep it a secret.Apart from prominent features, I felt a lack of WOW factor at times. Especially, the climax should be more worked in that way. But Sudha's version went for melodrama in those places. As mentioned earlier, this story is meant to be an inspirational one, and when such a story is presented on-screen it should be able to provide in full with horripilation. But that was missing from the climax.Meanwhile, when we look at the bigger picture the movie as a whole is thought-provoking and enthralling that compels the viewers to experience the hardships that Maaran confronted in his way to achieve his dream.This is a movie that deserved a theatrical release. Sudha Kongara's directorial debut provided a quality OTT release among the likes of many who provided lacklustre experiences to the viewers. As a fan of the OTT platform, I expect much more quality movies to reach the comfort of our home."}, {"id": 1464, "text": "I am not much fan of south indian, never saw them tbh.

Was this movie a good time pass and entertainment? Yes, it was - mainly because it has played to many formulas - an overly idealistic male protagonist, love that blooms against all hardships, a super brutal villain, blow after blow to good people, and good triumphing over evil. This is the basic hero victory plot that many movies try to follow - but thanks to tight writing, good actors, and other camera elements, it succeeds here.That said, to follow this formula, the writer has taken huge liberties with logic and realism. I don't expect movies to have complete logic and be totally realistic, but I do expect a good portion of these in a semi-biopic. Also, by following the cliched arc, the director has let go of a more nuanced character development. The protagonists are all oh-so-perfect. The antagonists are laughably over-the-top horrible. The wife is loyalty and encouragement personified. The villagers are all touchingly generous. Please give us a break.I am okay with people saying they liked the film. I am just concerned that most of them claim they identify with Maran and they are inspired and such bs. Anyone who wants to become an entrepreneur or change the world or some trope like that - please take this film with a pinch of salt. Everything is a lot more grey in reality.

She has got a lot of technicalities wrong.1. How do you find suriya doing all the work? 2. How does he barge into the atc room just like that and give orders to the pilot? 3. No aircraft without prior permission is allowed to land on an air force base just like that. 4. The investigation that Mr.Naidu conducts is a joke. 5.

One of the things I loved about the movie is that it featured a strong female lead, which was long overdue especially in tamil cinema.Such nuanced acting and so many complex emotions were beautifully portrayed by the amazing lead. Surya has proved himself yet again as a versatile actor. His eyes carry so much emotion. It was amazing to watch him in his element. I don't think I have ever cried so much while watching a movie. Every obstacle Maara and his gang had faced seemed so personal; I did not feel like a observer watching them from afar, but I felt like I was there with them, sharing their emotions. Surya definitely deserves a national award for this movie in my opinion.The fact that this amazing movie was based on the story/life events of a real-life hero is even more amazing. We don't realise that we take things for granted and forget the hard work and sacrifice of some unsung heroes that went behind the things we enjoy today. This movie has opened my mind to a whole new perspective, and I would definitely think about Captain Gopinath's resolve the next time I get to travel on a plane."}, {"id": 1472, "text": "After some years,surya's rebirth as maara.thanks and kudoos to sudha mam.Perfectecly blended script and execution.Even though the real hero himself said that it's heavily fictional(must need for a commercial film),film makes all of as to think why we can't win our dream at some point of life.Surya sir performance as maara is outstanding especially his acting with eyes,and 7 minutes single take scene\ud83d\ude18.And all co-stars ,including aparna madam,urvasi madam and all others nailed their space.Thanks for GV sir for perfect music and it's one of the soul of this film.Dop ,even though we miss that shots in silverscreen,they are beautiful and blended to film.Art department, recreation of old days are very well executed by them,nice observation and great execution.salute.Overall the only negative i feel was.......

Here is a beautiful movie on one such man, Maran, ex-IAF pilot who dreams to fly high in life and at at he same time provide the poor air travel with in their reach. Want to see a movie with Songs, foreign location, fights, punch dialogues? Sorry, then this is not a movie for you! This depicts the struggles of a man in real life who wish to change aviation history. Yes, the story might have been based on real life events of Gopinath who was the first to provide economy air travel (and others) by starting Simplifly-Deccan, but the struggles they encountered to provide the facility under tough airliners competition is not just Simplif(l)y! Surya has done an excellent job in bringing to life the character to steal the show. It is another feather in his cap. Aparna Balamurali as his wife Bommi, who teases, pleases, gives ample support to be with him as a true wife and companion during his struggles. Director Sudha Kongara whose Irudhi Sutru (Final Round) was a hit, has again given a different movie and she needs to be appreciated. Urvashi as Surya's mother, Paresh Rawal as Villainous Paresh Goswamy, the Jas airline owner, Kaali Venkat, Karunaas, Krishna kumar as Che, his friend have done their jobs well. Mohan Babu as Surya's commodore has a pleasant role at the end. Technical values are excellent. G. V. Kumar has provided necessary music suitable for village background. The drawback of this otherwise good film is the length. It could have been trimmed further to bring it under 2 hours. There are many touching scenes like villagers sending money to Maran's account, Surya's desperation to reach the village to see his dying father's face, his initial failures and so on.

We hear the engine sound in the title card and the swift departure takes away our breath. We are introduced to Sundari played by Aparna Balamurali on a train to meet Nedumaaran Rajangam. The character seemed to be a rebel in the beginning, but later we find him to be a calm person who bursts off when suppressed downright. The characters are given to actors who know their job very well. Urvasi, Aparna, Maaran's friends delivers a great performance on screen. Paresh Rawal, Achyut Kumar delivers antagonist role very well. Special mention is needed for 'Poo' Ram who plays Maaran's father. Karunas gives some pleasant jokes in the film. Meanwhile Nedumaaran Rajangam played by Suriya will stay in the hearts for a long haul. This will stay as one of Suriya's career best performance among Nandha and Pitamagan. Sudha Kongara's screenplay and direction, steer the film. One can argue that she alone holds the complete film in her shoulders. GV Prakash Kumar's music is highly enjoyable and sticks to the mood. The cinematography and the overall color tone are just splendid. I personally wished the climatic sequences were a bit more lengthy since it would have been helpful in getting Sudha Kongara her a standing ovation like how she got in Iruthisuttru.

This is the idea that Sudha Kongara wants to tell to us with her recent outing Soorarai Pottru. Based on real stories, the film follows the protagonist's dream of making every common man fly. The film is held up by Suriya Sivakumar's real to life depiction of Nedumaaran Rajangam and the way he handles both emotional and dialogue based scenes are a treat to watch. He carries the whole film on his shoulders and does so well at it. The supporting cast (Paresh Rawal, Urvashi) are well picked and give support to the main lead but fail to do so at times. Aparna Balamurali portrays Bommi ,a similar character as Nedumaaran ,does her job fairly well. But the lead characters as a pair don't have that chemistry that you expect. Cinematography is excellent and editing is efficient even when the songs are not needed for the story ,is placed forcibly in the screenplay. Background score by GV Prakash Kumar gives that peppy and arrogant tone to the movie which elevates the experience by a mile. The details in the film are a plenty and brings the feel of that 1990-2000s vibe. The story is overall a very enjoyable experience but there are some instances in the film when you feel bored or not into what's happening on the screen. With the intent and story there, I would have liked a more complete product. The film has some issues with dubbing as the dialogues are in a strong Madurai- dialect. But if you are feeling low or is in the mood for a film with a strong core story , this one's a treat to watch."}, {"id": 1479, "text": "The very first scene itself was like any Vijay movie. The airport does not give permission to land Surya's flight (due to Villain's influence) in Chennai Airport. If they still land the plane in Chennai Airport, their plane might be impounded (again due to Villain's influence). So, Surya advises to land the plane in Tambaram airforce runway. Surprisingly, by the time the flight reaches from Meenambakkam to Tambaram, Surya somehow reaches Tambaram just in a bike. I thought only Rajni and Vijay could do this. Now, welcome to the list, Surya! Surya himself drives the plane at a point of time, he is also a flight mechanic or engineer, he is also CEO. What not! After seeing an overwhelming positive response, at least expected the movie to be realistic. Do know that some heroisms are added to make the movie lively, but since the movie is based on real-life incidents, too much heroism was bad. Whole of Surya's village paying for him also sounds unbelievable. Reminds me of Sangamam movie. I also did not like the emotional scene where Surya is not able to pay for flight. Actually I believe that army officers who can fly engines are well paid and It's bit unbelievable that he did not have money. Considering that he had money, but did not take the money to airport is also unlikely, as in an era where flights were less common, he should have assumed the worse case of unavailability of economic class ticket and took more money. That scene was not okay, at least for me. But I liked the scenes which involved the heroine. It's nice see a determined character as a heroine in movies rather than trying to portray them as cute idiot dolls. Music was decent. The yellowish shade of cinematography was actually not pleasant to watch. I think they are good for movies that show the underworld, not for the ones like this. Over-all the movie was okayish. But I'm glad that this movie worked out for Surya. He was waiting for a break for a long time."}, {"id": 1480, "text": "With Soorarai Pottru, writer-director Sudha Kongara once again shows that she can make strong underdog stories in the commercial format. I can confidently say that this is the Suriya movie that we've all been waiting for. As Nedumaaran (a.k.a Maara), he brings his A-game in every scene, whether it be romancing Sundari (Aparna Balamurali, in a memorable role), breaking into tears with his mother (played to great effect by Urvashi), or going neck-and-neck with Paresh Goswami (Paresh Rawal, as the baddie). Vijay Kumar's dialogues lend the screenplay a very natural, credible, and relatable flavor (nee oru socialite, naan oru socialist, nammaloda airline vaanathil parakkapora oru Udupi hotel, and more).The supporting cast is an efficient lot here. Mohan Babu, Karunas, Vivek Prasanna, Kaali Venkat, Vinodhini Vaidyanathan, and Prakash Belawadi all get decently written scenes. Soorarai Pottru has more to do with Nedumaaran's quest to launch a low-cost airline that's accessible for every Indian, but it's also a solid family drama. The intricacies of Maaran's and Sundari's relationship are woven beautifully into the screenplay which moves at a brisk pace. Yes, it does have the mass masala moments and angles, but unlike in say a film like Kaappaan, they blend well to take the story forward rather than appearing tedious.Paresh Goswami feels a little like the corporate version of Hari Dada (from Pa. Ranjith's Kaala), despising the idea of poor people taking flights and foiling every move that Maaran makes. Suriya and Rawal play each other off well, making every scene of theirs worth a second viewing. But Goswami, on his own, is pretty dull and cardboard-like. He doesn't seem to have anything to look forward to, except ruining Maaran's life and this makes him one-note. The film also plays the safety card of letting us know in almost every frame depicting the IAF that it's all fictionalized, even with two disclaimers at the beginning and a closing card that says 'based on several true stories from low-cost aviation'.Coming to the technicalities, the CGI plane crash looks slightly messy (but not as bad as I was thinking it'd be) but the rest of the film holds up with its dazzling production design, glossy visuals (by Niketh Bommireddy), and mood-setting music (by G.V Prakash Kumar). Soorarai Pottru is one of those movies that could have been infinitely more enjoyable if experienced on the big screen purely owing to the big acting moments that Suriya, and to an extent Aparna, excel in. He is probably the only one among the present crop of Tamil superstars who can really add intensity to emotional scenes. For that and a mostly engaging narrative, Soorarai Pottru is worth sitting down for."}, {"id": 1481, "text": "Praise the Brave heart'sFilm : Soorarai potru Director : @sudhakongaraofficial Dop : @nikethbommi Music : @gvprakash Cast : @aparna.balamurali @actorsuriya#sooraraipottru #aakashameneehaddhura One of the brave and best attempt Film of the year with limited commercial dosage, you got it?

Just one word for this film AWESOME. A biographical genre which mostly lacks correct sense of inspirational content (refering to negative characters), emotional intelligence and perfect dramatic value finally gets the most balanced product in Tamil industry. Soorarai Pottru is inspired from a true story of a common man who dedicated all his efforts just to make common people fly in airlines and finish the casteism of rich and poor. The writing is top notch not just because it is a tale of heart-touching journey of one man but because it is a film of all people who supported him and had faith in him. The struggle level in this film is on such a hectic level that one might have given up long ago but this man was blessed to have highly supporting wife, mother, friends and his own troops who stood with him against powerful enemies. Every character in the film is beautifully written with detailing to the core and easily connectable nature whether it is positive or the negative one. Suriya in lead role is unstoppable right from the first scene. His different looks, different reactions, difference situations and different expressions could be felt as if he was living the character in real. I haven't seen him doing so deep study of a character in any of his film. Paresh Rawal and Aparna Balamurali are terrific in strongly written roles. The music is good too and unexpectedly not cliche as we see in most of south films which ruins the tempo and mood of film's concept. This amazing script needed a skillful brain to handle it skillfully and to not ruin it by making it typical commercial film of south and god bless Sudha Kongara, who had exactly the same skills. The only thing missing was structural development during airlines constructions, it didn't show much about it when it was the most vital part of the story. Overall, A FILM OF THE YEAR.

The director really deserves applause. First of all, Big Salute Director Sudha Konkara.Usually when we watch a biopic you feel a little bored. The reason is that the gimmicks seen in the movie do not occur in normal life. Soorarai Pottru is different from this.The Man who said that airplanes are for the common man who has made it possible for people to travel by air for a single rupee. And it is the life of Air Deccan founder G. R Gopinath. His life must have been quite cinematic.Sometimes there are some small compromises when making a real life movie! But director Sudha, her writing, making, Vijay Kumar's dialogues and GV Prakash Kumar's music take the output of the film to another level.Let's take a brief look at the story. The protagonists are the protagonist who has a big dream of starting an airline that is affordable to the common man by avoiding intermediaries and the heroine who lives with a relatively small but strong desire to start her own bakery. The challenges they face, the larger the size of their dreams, the less likely they are to come true, but the human instinct to face the challenges is all accurately drawn.One of the best characters of the actor Surya. What sets Surya apart from other contemporary actors is his acting style which gives him unjust power. His performance, there are no words to describe it. Another testament to his range as an actor.Aparna Balamurali's character was amazing. Aparna, who was the heroine along with Surya was excellent.Urvashi's performance was not surprised because She has proved many times as a wonderful actress. That sentimental scene that performed magnificently. And finally a scene where the lady pilot who flew the flight looks on in amazement.A Movie that can be seen with eyes and mind full.

I have not seen anything like this in tamil cinema before. I wouldnt say that it really inspired me... But, I was pleasantly surprised to see a film with great direction. Surely, Sudha Kongara is a great director. Her meticulous work clearly shows. For Sooriya, after Anbuchelvan and Sanjay Ramasamy, Nedumaaran Raajangam may be a good meaningful character in his career (after a looooong time). Dialogues were very impressive. And the film has many interesting moments. All the actors in the film have given great performances. G.V.Prakash's music was apt for the film, with Veyyon silli standing out. The song transports the romantic feel to the audiences. Making a movie on aviation is not that easy. The flight scenes were terrific (that too, the first few scenes were awesome .. the team has rightly understood that these scenes are the plus of the film and has rightly kept one of these aviation scenes as the opening for the film). Another thing I liked was that everything about the aviation business has been shown clearly - all minute details, the problems faced, the competition in the business. The heroine character was very interesting and I think that, that character has been created the way it has been, to maintain the raw tone of the film. Aparna's performance was terrific. Urvashi's too....One great thing about the film is its pace. It is super fast and uniform from start till end. But, still,I feel that, if the film had been edited differently (still maintainig the fast pace of the film) and few other minor issues fixed, this film could have been an outstanding,oscar-worthy film. My understanding of what Sudha wanted to show us in the film is that when a socially responsible person who has affinity towards his town and town's people (something that he has inherited from his father), who also happens to be a pilot, goes through a bitter experience of not being able to get a flight ticket when he desparately wants to, the result would be that he would make it his life's ambition to make flight journey a possible one for the middle/lower class people. Thats what happens here with Maara. Basically he doesnt want flying to be a prospect that only the upper class people have. In other words, when a need arised or when someone was having a lifetime dream to have a flight journey, Maara wanted to make it possible for them to do so. He did not want class or money to be a barrier in having a flight journey. And most importantly he wanted to connect the small towns and cities through flight. This would make India look more developed and sophisticated. This can be seen as an improvement to our society. This is probably what Sudha wanted to tell and if this had been presented in this manner as such, I think it would have been more acceptable. But, here it has been presented in a slightly different manner - the focus was only on Nedumaaran wanting the poor people to fly. (As though one fine morning he woke up and started wondering why poor people are not flying and he badly wants them to experience the flight travel...As though this is the pressing issue that poor people in India are having now). The film does show his experience as a pilot in defense team and also shows the incident which made him want poor people to fly... but, its all disjointed... so,the way it has been presented now, it makes one think - ' why should a poor guy fly? What is the need? why would a poor guy bother about flying when he has other pressing issues'.Though Sudha has pointed this out herself in the film and given an apt reply for it, through Maara's character, we cannot avoid thinking 'all of these struggles to achieve something luxurious like flying? As though struggling for basic necessities like water and food...' Is this ambition worthy of this much of struggle? One cant help thinking that the same amount of struggle and energy could have been spent in achieving what is 'necessary' for poor people. All of this because of the disjointed narration. A few more drawbacks I noticed .... As the film progresses , somewhere we start feeling a little bored. This is inspite of maintaining the fast pace evenly through out the film. It feels a little monotonous and a little confusing after 1 and half hours of the film. And I felt that the villain character is very caricaturish. For a film that is aimed at being close to reality, this kind of villains dont really fit in. Another minus point is that, though Sooriya is terrific in scenes where he has to display his determination, his ambition, his frustration, his sadness, his love and the fire in him , he doesnt look convincing as a villager. In all the family scenes, he alone looks aloof. For the most part, he looks like someone who just returned from Harvard university and just got introduced to his village family and is wondering what village life is like. The rest of his family and Aparna's family are very convincing as villagers. And they are the ones who give the audiences the right feel and tone for the film. Maybe if this had been corrected, the film and the character would have touched our hearts, the way it was meant to. For, the very pulse of the film itself is the protagonist's character - an 'ordinary villager' coming from a 'middle class' family having big ambitions and that too with strong determination, dedication and perserverance. So, Sooriya, acting like Anbuselvan-trying-the-rustic-looks (or may be like the young Sooriya from Vaaranam Aayiram) is not doing any good for the film. Overall, it was a surprisingly good film. But, it could have been a gem of a movie , if these few problems had been taken care of."}, {"id": 1494, "text": "Soorarai Pottru is a Tamil movie available in Telugu and Kannada too on Amazon Prime Video. Watch for the good performance by Suriya, Aparna Balamurli, Paresh Rawal, Prakash Belawadi, Achyuth Kumar.Even though I watched in Kannada, the movie was perfectly marched for example all boards and minute details were in kannada felt so good. Effort to detail was clearly seen. Even subtitling work and voiceover was good. Songs too.There is quite a lot of drama, many tears, a near-crash and of course, actor Suriya's trademark swag.While perhaps not as dramatic as the film, his vision really did change life in India forever, and he ideas set in stone what most of us take for granted today - a flight to almost any major city in India, for a price every middle-class salaried person can afford.Born in 1951, Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar Gopinath was raised in a small village named Gorur in Karnataka and is the second of eight children. His father, a school teacher and a Kannada novelist, believed that schools were a system of regimentation and decided to teach his son at home.Capt Gopinath reared cattle to sell milk, got in poultry farming, silkworm farming, then turned a motorcycle dealer, an Udupi hotel owner, a stockbroker, irrigation equipment dealer, an agriculture consultant, a politician and finally an aviation entrepreneur - struggling, falling, rising, falling, rising again and taking off.Few nuances were good in movie but real life is a different ball game or to be honest a game of balls.. \ud83d\ude1cWatchable, inspiring and decent film making."}, {"id": 1495, "text": "Soorarai Pottru is a good watch that you should definitely see , there are amazing performances from Surya and Aparna Balamurali whose characters Nedumaaran 'Maara' Rajangam and Bommi have an extremely logical and real relationship.Paresh Rawal plays the villain and i found this to be miscast in some regards because while his expressions are good , he is very obviously being dubbed over and it is sometimes a little jarring.It is a dramatized biopic of Capt. Gopinath who founded Deccan Airlines , it is possibly the best biopic of sorts in Indian Cinema save Paan Singh Tomar, also while im no expert i wanted to note that Niketh Bommireddy the cinematographer is amazing here , also one added detail that i liked was that there was a dialect they used for Surya's character which was Madurai Specific the songs are average but you can skip most since they dont have an effect on the actual movie one the two friends played by KrishnaKumar was very impressively acted. The movie in some parts is obviously dramatized but is still impressive overall I'd give it a 7.8 or 8. Aparna Balamurali who usually plays a side is given a important role and i couldn't tell this was her first big role because of how amazing it was,it is extremely cheeky, they have a guy named Ajay Balaiyya who is very obviously a parody of Vijay Mallya, the villain named Paresh something is a clear parody of Jet Airways Founder Naresh Goel"}, {"id": 1496, "text": "Sudha Kongara's Soorarai Pottru released amidst a lot of hype, embarking to tell the real-life story of the pioneer of low cost aviation in India-Capt G R Gopinath of Air Deccan.And Suriya and company deliver with aplomb in an engaging, inspiring biopic that entertains and leaves you in awe. The director deserves praise for carefully etching out every character, be it Suriya's mother played by an in-form Urvashi to even Kaali Venkat as the lead protagonist's cousin.Aparna Balamurali is a delight in every scene she's in an delivers a captivating performance. But at its core, Soorarai is all about a compelling lead role from Suriya, who brings in the amount of energy and verve we last saw from him in Vaaranam Aayiram.Hoping he continues to pick better scripts so that we can all enjoy his tremendous acting chops.Recommended"}], "reviews_amount": 1497}
