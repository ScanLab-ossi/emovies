The concept is fresh, a top notch Cast and Crew with an amazing Screenplay. The climax of the movie is another thing that needs a mention. This movie has a meaningful concept. 2 sides of the same coin showing different perspective is another masterpiece. Every character in the movie is nearly written is another plus. Arvind Iyer is another Gem of this movie. The technical aspects of the movie is as well top notch.A must watch for all the movie buffs. A movie with a concept and a message."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I haven't got bored in entire movie. It was smooth like butter. Hero done a natural act. Liked uttara Kannada language in between with little humor that's like a pinch of salt to make movie tastier. Achuthanna is a star now. Worth to watch movie to relax"}, {"id": 3, "text": "The plot seems very interesting to begin with, but it's stretched too thin with concepts and styles of too many people. While we can see good actors, they fail to perform in important scenes due to bad screenplay. Too many irrelevant scenes filled, characteristics of actors which neither adds to the plot nor adds to humour. Some Spoilers ahead: 1. Movie about mental health but friend's mental health completely ignored 2. Doctor was supposed to be funny but given a serious role 3. Cooking was another central theme but it's hardly used in the cinema 4. That lady's past is useless 5. Forced costumes for the hero. Bheemasena shown as a fighter not a cook.

Her transformation to different shade and expressing variety of emotions has been really great. One of the big advantage along with her good acting skills is that her sweet voice. Trust me Aarohi's voice will add to the beauty of the film. Her performance in the films like Drishya, ShivajiSuratkal deserves appreciation and this BheemaSenaNalaMaharaja performance adds to her list of best performance.

If you have watched the trailer then You might have seen the abstract of the film but to see how they have effectively implemented you must watch the movie. Wonderful acting by everyone especially child artists. Any film freak would predict the climax twist because the director gave hints from the beginning of the film may be the director's motto was to make a feel-good movie not a suspense or mystery genre movie.

Nice story, bit lengthy screenplay but didnt affect much Music is the real hero of the movie I felt weird about the characterization of Vedavalli as it mostly revolves around her, but as the play goes on it is justified why it was designed as that. Arohi Narayan - I am not sure if any actress might have done this great.

Music, Location and Camera Work have been far more than excellent. Switching between the extreme emotions by characters is slightly hard to digest, but as the film goes on Viewers gets adjusted to the wavelength. Dialogues simple and straight forward. Song lyrics with variety of genres are so catchy and will be remembered for long time..Twist in the climax is absolutely unpredictable and its the greatest part of the film. I was awestruck while watch first time. 2nd half has done the complete justice and worth watching.Every Artist has given life to their characters, including the lead and Supporting..Story narration by Karthik Saragur is at next level.. His hard work and sincere efforts are visible in every frame."}, {"id": 64, "text": "I have been following this movie for more than a year, not sure why it was delayed and not sure how they completed in lockdown and released it so quickly.. Was very happy when I learned that this movie is being released.Saw the teaser didn't connect with it, the trailer didn't help either..After all this, I decided to watch it only because it contains names like Heamanth Rao, Rakshit..Firstly, storey doesn't stand truthful to the Name... Big let down..It feels like an arcade puzzle where its Forcefully tried to fix, where pieces are not even from the same game....Main characters Lattesha, veda, lalli, Dr. Arohi, Fransis and Kenda, nothing actually develops.. you wont relate or like any character except the Achuth sir...Its a movie where always something is happening, each characters is running on its own and you are never comfortable...Having said that, last 15 mins makes you feel a bit different than what you felt for the last 2 hours. Only for that and music, 5/10 rating.So, we can watch this one time on OTT but I wouldn't want to pay for a ticket if it was released in the cinema."}, {"id": 65, "text": "The film's title is an attraction for promotion and not something that has it's roots or it's base in the story.The story is about trying to regain a woman's memory and nothing of sorts in connection to anything that is food as per the trailer. The trailer was horrible though and yet I watched the film keeping my faith in the Paramvah logo but in vain. The film tells a fake story throughout the film only to make it look like a suspense/ thriller at the end which totally washes away the little bit the story's holding throughout the film. The last 10 minutes were depressed and forced writing. The characters are written very poorly. The entire film had unnecessary number of supporting cast and extras. The dialogues are also blunt. The underwater scene is very poorly written. There was no character's struggle there. It was the most important moment in the character's life and yet so badly done.The acting is very bad by most of them barring Achuyt, Aravinnd, and the chubby child artist who plays the leading lady as a childhood version.The cinematography has some decent individual shots which make it's own track in the film and doesn't blend with the story at most times. The famed cinematographer Santhosh Sivan always has some pretty shots in his films and they are always beautiful to look at or to get immersed in it but many at times, they take you away from the story of the film. Everything that happens, everything that is made, everything that is worked for/at including the music must be to make the story move forward and nothing else. If it doesn't, then no matter how divine that shot, sound, music, act is, it HAS to be edited out.What works in favor of a film that was expected from the trailer is the music. Chandan's music is soothing and the lyrics are also beautiful. Though Chandan's music does work in favor of the film, it is not helping him as a musician because his music seems repetitive. The song Kanna Muchche straightaway took me to 'Ee sanjege'. The resemblance in the melody is uncanny.The film has a look alike base line structure in it's core idea to that of the Hindi film 'Kahaani' where the entire film we hear a narration (and actions in between) only to be deceived at the end. (A past moment) When stroked with this question of dishonesty, the director Sujoy had buttered it up in a way to make the audience confused.This film running for 140 minutes is just an elongated 'part visually pleasing' lengthy short film of around 60 minutes. I was disappointed not just with the trailer but with the film too. An off beat/ off track Kannada film needn't always be delightful. Unfortunately, most are blind to that fact."}, {"id": 66, "text": "I was very eager to watch the movie as early as possible so joined a group of our relatives and started watching from 12 00 midnight on 29th though I was feeling sleepy and tiredDue to fatigue and drowsiness I couldn't watch with the required concentration as a result of which I felt left out of the show and started to feel bored.But there came a very surprising, an unexpected twist in the story in the last part of the film that made me very alert and interested in it.So I watched it again two more times and now I appreciate the wisdom , passion , dedication and labour behind this work.The way the story is conceptualized, and narrated is very interesting. The movie is a blend of dreams, stories, dramas and reality which is a unique experiment.Coming to the work of the crew cinematography, music, art costumes editing etc are good. The performance of all major and minor characters is impressive.I was impressed and touched by the way the songs of our own Ankanayaka master and famous Kannada poet Sri Parameshwara bhatta are used in the film.#Thanner# #meedre# song of Ankanaikaru depicts the simple philosophy which majority of the simple and down to earth people of our country believe in where as the the song #Odalemba gudiyolage# is about the adoration and trust which a wife has on her dependable husband with divine qualities which every wife wishes to see in her husband .The movie showes how an intense love story can be told without allowing sensuality or lust to creep in. This makes it a very special one for me.This movie is certainly not for those who watch it just for some entertainment or to pass some time. It has enough in it to capture the attention and win the hearts of those who respect life and art based on and near to life."}], "reviews_amount": 67}
