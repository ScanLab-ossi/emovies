I find him so unbearably untalented, that I can't understand how did he manage to end in those movies), the plot is just ridiculous. Imagine you have an overpopulated planet with almost no more oxygen and water, and ZERO plants. According to this brilliant director and writer, you can save the entire planet with a couple plants sent from the future by a psychotic emotionally unstable crybaby. This amazing director thinks that with some emotional music and a couple liters tears he can compensate his incompetency. Unfortunately he can't.

The Dialogue was wanting, and to be honest, too much crying going on, far too much! It is one of those sci-fis were you have to ignore the science, just accept the plot holes the inaccuracies make. The acting was pretty stiff. It tried hard and probably the effects were the best feature of the film - which is a bit worrying.

The Sample libraries, that have been used to used for the score are not a good fit to the pictures, way to loud and slick.

Didn't had too much expectation at the beginning having seen the low score but I was very surprised by the positive message of the movie and the finale. Probably many that gave a low vote didn't understand why to trust people you must not trust people and sometimes the solution to a problem is not a solution because is not a permanent one but a quick fix. I higly recommend this SF movie, the first in decades that doesn't start with a scene of sex, doesn't wrap the story around a beautiful girl, doesn't need to insert an alternate gender to fill the holes of the story and where the end doesn't seems a tale written by a 4 years old child. For me 10/10. A movie is about a story, not explosions, automatic machine guns and damsel in distress to make it understandable even by the unfortunate minds.

The movie has a solid story line and the actors were playing without any major hickup. I liked the atmosphere in the movie. There was something positive shining through all the time. Bad days but it's gonna be fine. No messing with our logic of time, so nothing new in this case. It sticks to the rules and doesn't try to make any stupid new advancements into that direction.Well, for a Sunday evening to relax and just let it flow it's a solid movie. Low budget, yes, but personally I don't care, some movies don't need all that FX that is thrown at us all the time. Plain, solid, good.If you need constant action and fighting and people jumping from houses and land on their feet, this is not for you."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Won't change the world, but the effects are good and plentiful, the acting isn't so bad it takes you out of the movie, and the plot just about enough to keep you interested.

It had a nice premise, and started out just fine. But the minute time travel was introduced it went from ok to very bad. The acting was ok by the main actors but phoned in by the supporting cast. Special effects were great for a low budget move. But all that was ruined by horrible plot holes and crippling ignorance of how time travel works. But the problem is, like with all the other bad time travel movies, in the fact that the plot would not work if the time travel problems were corrected. Not only that but the motives of all the characters were strange and not realistic (the thoughts and conclusions of the characters can only be reached if they read the script). They even ignored cause-effect, rules of nature, and others. Truly a shame. Great potential, but wasted in execution."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Could've been a nice action/mystery sci-fi (maybe not Alien, more like Stargate) - but nooo.

Here, they insisted on talking.

The actors portray your everyperson - they aren't superheroes, there's no use of over the top CGI, just a well written, thoughtful piece. I do have some bones about timescales, the physics, biology, and chemistry, but that's true of most sci-fi offerings. If you're looking for a blockbuster, this most assuredly is not for you, but if you like poignant storytelling, it's pretty good.

Whereas 12 Monkeys is a fine, imaginative and suspenseful movie (okay, Bruce Willis travels back in time instead of travelling to the future like our emotional hero in this story), 2067 fails on almost every level: boring characters, boring dialogues, and the story drags on and on and not much is happening. The production is pretty solid, and that's it.Conclusion: I really don't know what kind of audience would like or is interested to watch such story/movie. And to all those reviewers who talk about the important message of the movie - that message is on air in today's media on all channels 24/7, and a rather boring affair with a mostly sleeping audience won't save the climate. In my opinion not to make this movie (all that energy saved - production, streaming, driving to the cinema etc.) would have contributed more to saving our planet ;)"}, {"id": 40, "text": "Artificial oxygen. That was my first clue that this was going to be nonsense. There's no such thing. There is only oxygen. It's an element, not a product. However you obtain it. However you extract it, it is still just oxygen. So the conceit of people being allergic to artificial oxygen is just utter nonsense.Then there's the crying...There isn't one character in this movie that doesn't blub their way through at least one painful dialogue exchange. The main character is practically in a permanent state of distress that is just exhausting to watch. It's just too much.Then there's the acting, or rather, lack of it. The two main characters (when not crying like babies) are decent enough, but the rest are B-movie category at best, and amateur dramatics at worst. The evil lady leader is particularly good at scenery chewing. And yes, she tears up at points.Then there is the usual time-travel nonsense that is badly thought out and realised, with things happening before they could possibly have occurred and paradoxes galore.But the crying is the worst part. It just never ends and overshadows everything else to such an extent as to make the movie unwatchable and tedious.Realistically, this is an episode of the Outer Limits, or Twilight Zone, padded out with unnecessary emotion and lack of thought. A trial of the senses to sit through.And the ending...Having altered time, our hero travels a few hundred yards from the ruins of the time machine building to find a shining city where ruins once stood. So these people, having been saved by his actions, couldn't even be bothered to restore the site of their redemption and restore it to glory? Couldn't be bothered to turn it into a monument of sorts? They just left it as a ruin? Come on! That's pathetic writing!SUMMARY: Crying hero. Crying villains. Crying extras. Lots of crying. Overly melodramatic interactions. Nonsense time travel dynamics. Nonsensical basic science. Some truly awful acting. On the same level as After Earth but did I mention there was more crying?

No. The film, while definately low budget and some (as another review put it) anonamous actors was very well paced and kept me interested. Are there plot holes? Sure as in EVERY movie. Does an equivalalent of a cell phone still work 400 years later on a nuclear battery? Does a city run by a massive nuclear power cell still run 400 years later without any sort of maintenance? SURE DOES! Skip any questions you might have and just be entertained. Ending has a slight little twist, but it is an interesting take on what might just happen.

WTF did I just see? If the acting was worse then than script is just impossible to tell. I can not believe that Australian movies are actually getting worse because over the past decade they have been horrific. Why are Australian taxpayers supporting this sort egregious and totally asinine garbage? I know that it is because we just have to have a film industry attitude but then why make krap like this? I sort of know the answer because I actually know a fair bit about the people in the OZ film madness and those that work for the SA film corp are just about as low as you can sink.

Science fiction movies, primarily from the 1950s and 1960s, in which you could tell Godzilla was a man in a rubber suit, or see the strings suspending the rocket against the black backdrop of outer space. This film, made in Australia, is a modern version of Cheapness. The time machine at the center of the story appears to be a large piece of concrete piping decorated with blinking lights and plastic tubing. There is absolutely no CGI and only one or two soundstage sets. Paintings are used to depict future cityscapes. The story is disconnected, the script straight-up-corny, and the antagonists predictable. But, if you relax and enjoy, without looking for the lack of continuity, it's entirely enjoyable escapism.

The loss of the ability to escape the near dead planet did. As humanity had no other choice to get rid of capitalism and consumption to the edge of extinction.If the movie was about the sci-fi aspect only we would have gotten a somewhat explanation what did save them, but this movie is about LOST hope and finding it again.

More and more I am seeing people thumbs down reviews because they don't AGREE with the reviewers opinion about the movie, versus whether the information is helpful or not. So I will provide 2 reviews in 1.NO SPOILERS: This is a slow burning, true SciFi with visually appealing graphics. I wouldnt categorize it as stunning, but its well done for its budget. The acting is good. The plot is interesting. Though the movie doesn't have a lot of action (until the end) the movies overall ARC is satisfactory. For someone who's looking to pass the time, this movie will generally entertain. &gt;&gt; End standard review&lt;&lt; In depth review &gt;&gt;SPOILERS&lt;&lt; I absolutely LOVE this movie! True it is a little slow in the beginning; but in my opinion, that adds to the crescendo. The acting by the main hero is fine, though not Oscar worthy. But none of that matters.To me, what matters is the soul of this movie. The director took the standard time-travel and addressed the paradox it would create. Almost every loophole was addressed! From the strange bracelet being the key to activating the machine, his father's suicide because he refused to agree to the villains plans, the overprotective nature of Jude- whom felt responsible, the bones of his past self being the evidence of the paradox, to Ethan's final act of sacrifice by sending back new life.The loopholes not addressed... that gave this movie a 9 instead of 10. 1. CONTINUITY- Ethan sent back the message AFTER Jude broke the paradox. That doesn't make sense. Ethan would have had to send the message before the paradox was broken. As for Ethan &amp; Jude's final argument... it was supposed to happen back in 2067....but having it in 2467 could, arguably, be what started the break in the Paradox? 2. SCIENCE- when Ethan had to depressurize the chamber in order to reset the core he passed out. But that is unlikely. Ethan grew up with fake &amp; critically low oxygen.

Consider the fact that there are a number of movies that concern the future. Most of them depict an apocalyptic vision of a world that ends miserably, a world where many has destroyed everything with no hope of redemption. Then there are those movies that start with this premise and yet offer a spark of hope. 2067 is one of those films.Set in the year 2067 we are presented with a world where global warming has left the planet destitute, where there are no more plants and the only way to survive is breathing artificial air. But that air supply has its side effects with people suffering and dying from what they call the Sickness. There seems to be no hope left for mankind.Enter Ethan Whyte (Kodi Smit-McPhee). A tunnel worker for the city's power plant Ethan is the son of Richard Whyte (Aaron Glenane), a scientist who committed suicide when he was younger. Before doing so he presented Ethan with a gift, a mechanical bracelet that attached itself to Ethan painfully and cannot be removed. Working alongside is his best friend Jude (Ryan Kwanten). Ethan is working to elevate his position to get a better air quality for his wife Xanthe (Sana's Shaik) who is suffering from the Sickness.Ethan is called in to talk to the head of the corporation in charge of a research organization called Chronicorp where his father worked, Regina (Deborah Mailman). She explains to him that civilization as we know it will soon be wiped out. But there is hope. The project his father was working on was a time machine and a message sent via radio wave to the future came back with a simple message: Send Ethan Whyte. Now the team has gotten the machine to the point where they can send a human and in response to that message Ethan has been chosen with the task of finding a cure in the future and bringing it back.He will land 407 years from now and there is the chance that he himself might not make it back. He chooses to do what he must and save the world. He enters and is sent forward only to arrive to find the world a different place. Vegetation is everywhere but there is no one there to greet him. He explores and with the help of a handheld computer finds a bunker with a skeleton sitting outside with a bullet in the forehead. The name tag on the uniform reads Ethan Whyte.Things get stranger as he does what he can to survive. Eating berries he thinks are safe he is poisoned but before he can die Jude shows up. He informs Ethan that they knew from his vital signs being transmitted back that he was in trouble and fired up enough juice to the machine to send him to help. Now the pair must find out if there is a cure and where everyone else is. But is there anyone? And who was it that shot Ethan?The movie plays out with these concepts of time travel, corporate mind-think and just who and who will not be saved as it plays out. Progressing forward the story switches concepts from the survival of mankind to trying to play with time and being able to affect the outcome. Is that possible or is time set in stone? Can Ethan and Jude play with time and save the world or is there no hope of doing so? And if it can be changed should it be?The movie is extremely well made and looks fantastic. The sets that range from post-apocalyptic trash tossed world to clean cut research labs to a world covered in green all are amazing. The direction by Seth Larney in only his second feature is exceptional. Larney also deserves credit for an interesting and compelling story. Lead actors Smit-McPhee and Kwanten do a solid job here as reluctant heroes. On the whole the movie presents a nice slice of science fiction that uses a story rather than effects to propel it forward. That's a sign of a true classic.Many may not pick this one up to watch and that would be a mistake. With the number of poorly made films being made on the fly these days this one is worth watching.

Why couldn't anyone just kill the kid and use his blood to run the machine? Or tie the kid, take him to the machine anytime and do the blood test against his will?

Although the movie sugar-coated it with bitter and salty flavor.Some reviews said that the ending is inconclusive. Well, I can't see that.

I forget the city name but it's somewhere around Brisbane Australia.Now the plot starts here and it's terrible. There are no plants left in the world and have been none for 20 years. There is also no oxygen, and this at least makes sense as oxygen is highly reactive and would quickly disappear if there were no plants constantly producing oxygen.They do somehow have some kind of fake oxygen, they call it synthetic oxygen, and people are allergic to it. Allergic to the poisonous deadly element OXYGEN. Seriously, if people were allergic to oxygen they'd just die as oxygen is pretty important for not dying.So, there is fake oxygen provided in tanks and inside buildings, and there is also better quality oxygen available which people are less allergic to. Less allergic to less fake oxygen. The element oxygen is less deadly if it's good quality oxygen.So they invent time travel and shoot some whiny kid 400 years into the future to find a way to cure people of the deadly oxygen illness.In 400 years forests have grown back and there are butterflies. On a planet with no plants and no oxygen, the Earth has become a forest and butterflies have evolved again - after all they were definitely extinct on a world with no oxygen so they had to evolve again from scratch.Obviously the forests re-grew and covered the earth and re-filled the air with oxygen on a world with no plants no viable seeds and no oxygen, and only then did any living bacteria evolve to the point that butterflies evolved again.Even the little things were bad. For instance, the approach to the city is to walk to a waterfall over a huge cliff and then look down at the city from an area with no route down without climbing.Loads of bridges lower down, so why pick a route that has no way down, then backtrack and scramble down a steep cliff embankment to get there instead of one that actually goes to the city entrance points or even roughly the same elevation. For the panoramic sweeping reveal shot.It must be that because it happens a lot. I mean oddly a lot. A lot to the point you notice that this happened way too many times.The cgi was excellent, as was the set design, props, pretty much the production values as a whole. It's a shame that such good work was ruined by a terrible script written by someone who had no idea what they were doing or talking about, a plot which makes literally no sense to anyone with a functional brain.

I saw this film only because I love Sci-Fi.While the story is emotional enough and there's lots of crying, it also is quite messy and the plot is full of holes. Many things don't make sense, but you can still let that go. What actually hurts the film is the way the sci-fi element is written in, time travel is messed up to the point of 'whatever'. It is kinda similar and simplistic like in the Back to the Future films, but this one also pulls elements from other time travel films and tries to mix them up, I mean, they really overcomplicate stuff and try to mix together Terminator-like causality loops, with some hints of Predestination (2014) and a couple of other TT films. I am willing to look away when it comes to a shoestring budget, I love low-budget sci-fi. But the story really was a mess, and it seems like bad directing also hurts the acting. Every character seemed to know everything they need to know and to do, Ryan Kwanten acted like he knew more than the viewer is supposed to, but in the end, I guess it wasn't the case. I can't say I hated this film, but there's just nothing to grab onto. The story is very messy, I didn't quite buy the world they were living in, and the time travel causality loop concept is brutally violated. I'm not going to dive deep into the story, but, I mean, please have one of the two things, either have the simplistic change the past to change your future you came from (which is not sci-fi proof but works in a relevant set-up). Or if you're going for a loop that has already completed itself, there can't be another Ethan that just vanishes, there can't be a destroyed city that miraculously changes into safe heaven. It doesn't work like that. Summing it up, I tend not to recommend this film, but it's close to 50/50.

Well Covid-19 and the upcoming mandatory vaxx are the tools for that, this movie and others like it, are created to help create some kind of compliance.Obviously that is the last thing we want to do, obey these genocidal monsters.On top of it all the movie is complete unrealistic, the plants of this earth would not survive without humans and animals since plants need CO2 (CO2 is one of the basic Ingredients needed for photosynthesis to occur) to grow, and we and the animals are their primary source of nourishment. Thus, the planet without us, would simply stay barren, forever.That said, there is a very surprising ending to it all, an ending that changed my vote from 1 to 3, as well as this review.

The movie went from being a dystopian movie where mankind is threatened by imminent extinction, to becoming a ghoulishly boring family drama about a young man trying to reconnect with his long-dead father.Simply put, the movie plummeted from being watchable to becoming something that was less than mediocre. And it didn't help much on the overall enjoyment of the movie that the storyline just spiraled out of control and became a confusing mess that made very little sense.The acting in the movie was adequate, and I do enjoy watching unfamiliar faces and talents on the screen, which was something that 2067 definitely had. I wasn't familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list here. It was just a terrible shame that the performers were severely hindered in delivering good performances from the lack of proper script and storyline.Visually then 2067 definitely was interesting enough.

Plots involving time travel and alternate realities are not on top of my list, but they are close to it. My review, of course, needs to be interpreted against this personal preference. (But if you don't enjoy science fiction, what's the point of thinking about watching this film?)I hesitated investing almost two hours into watching this film because of many bad reviews. Actually, I started once and stopped after ten minutes - big mistake! On the second attempt (yesterday), I gave this film an actual chance. (The same is true for some good literature: You have to try twice. I was unable to read Buddenbrooks by Thomas Mann the first time, but once you give it a proper chance, you may come to realize how great it is.) THIS FILM IS NOT AS BAD AS MANY REVIEWS SUGGEST. The story is a fine piece of science fiction. The ending is satisfying (and it's a welcome change compared to some other films that are trying to set up a sequel or feel smart by leaving you guessing at the end). The protagonist is someone you can relate to once you get into the spirit of the story. The pacing is fine, as are the changeovers from one act to the next. There may be plotholes, but I think that almost any intelligent movie has, and the writer/director could eliminate any hole with pretty much one sentence (as is often done in series such as all Stargate installments); thus, I don't need the sentence, I just make up my own mind about it (after all, science fiction fans are supposed to be cerebral people), and enjoy a good story without needing to criticize any aspect that doesn't seem obviously logical on first thought.Obviously, this is not Interstellar. And yes, some acting and make-up are a little weird. It is also not Europa Report - 2067 does indeed lack the almost flawless scientific feel that you would expect in hard scifi. But neither are the categories this film is supposed to be in, and one needs to approach this film with realistic (i.e., not blockbuster or game-changer) aspirations. I think it is proper to reward the makers with a rating that takes account of this fact. After all, given the many exchangeable ideas and films that are around, this one is a nice gift to scifi fans who crave something different. I hope that future (and, maybe, even better) projects are not hindered by the bad reviews.

From the room shaped as a brain, where through this process they kept layering knowledge in him, oh well i should really not spoil so much!Now let's get to the message, because like Tenet, this movie was about sending a message. If you focus on the details, you might miss the entire opera.It seemed cringey a bit, in the beginning but as the movie unfolded, it kind of made sense to just not fight it, and try to roll with the idea that you are indeed what's most important, and just ... listen and not get in the way of yourself. Because ... that's kinda what it's all about in the end. You.Also you might have missed it, but it was probably worth sacrificing an entire civilization - for you, over and over again, until you get it to feel right.The rest things in the movie are all there is, just visual representations.

I admit that it's not a colossal big budget Sci-Fi like Blade Runner but as an indie film, it was damn good. Kodie Smit-McPhee was actually really good in this, contrary to everyone ranting about how terrible he was; he wasn't terrible. It was a good solid Sci-Fi film with a remarkable message about the state of the world and the devastation that the human race is causing to the eco-system. 2067 is a not a run and gun fast-paced shoot'em up type of Sci-Fi film and if that was your impression, I'm sorry that you're disappointed. This is more about one person's struggle with accepting his place in the world, and how his identity was shaped by the decisions of his family and himself. 2067 is a more emotionally driven humanistic type of Sci-Fi. While it ticks all of the boxes of what a film in this genre should be, it uses these stereotypical sci-fi themes to illustrate a story about a kid who lost his parents and suddenly found himself alone in a dying world. It goes through his struggles of self-identification, and recollecting his memories to understand the decisions that were made for him and the weight that those decisions would have on his future.The backdrop is a world in 2067, which as been devastated by environmental destruction to the point that there is no longer any natural breathable oxygen. Ethan Whyte a city worker in one of the last existing urban colonies, relies on injections of artificial oxygen created by Chronicorp, a company that his father once worked for. This company, which is also developing a time machine to figure out how to send people to a better more sustained world, receives a message from 400 years in the future which simply states, Send Ethan Whyte. This message has great implications as the experimental time machine cannot successfully return someone without having an anchor (a person) to activate it on the other side. This is the catalyst that sets off the film.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Despite it's science fiction elements, on a humanistic and personal level, the struggles of Ethan Whyte are relatable. Kodie Smit-McPhee, a relatively young actor, did a phenominal job as did the supporting cast. The setting and, in particular, the musical score throughout the film were also very well done."}, {"id": 173, "text": "I don't normally write a negative review... as I like even the most odd B-grade movies. But this is a unique one.Though I can't rate it a one. There is some merit to it.The film has a nice concept. Many big ideas. Overall, on paper, it probably seemed like an amazing idea. All the basic fundamentals are there. But the production was all over the place. There was A LOT of ambition and you can kinda see that. The music and CGI are actually not that bad.On a technically standpoint, it's not ''bad'', just missed the mark and wasn't able to fully show their cards the way they wanted to, or in someways, they didn't know how.There were a lot of hit and misses.For example; casting. The cast was overall, average. Some were good and some were just outright... a one foot splinter sticking out of an unfinished grand piano. There was one particular character who was obviously designed to be the posh Company Director that every syfy has, ever. And dear lord. Whenever this actor was on screen, it suddenly turned from cinema film to weekday TV Auzzy soap drama. It was just completely out of place, bringing down the production value on screen completely. I've never experienced this with a film.The characters also had no real synergy or connection with each other. They weren't exactly bland, but we never really got to connect with them either.The special effects on the other hand, were actually pretty good. There was a lot of potential to create a vast world within the film, but they wasted it. And the most impressive shots were only used a handful of times. They had a lot of grandeur and ambition, but I feel that it was limited by budget. The film sets up an amazing set, that is never used.The story was also a hit and a miss. The plot twists were good, but the building blocks leading up to the climax... ultimately made no sense.The film felt like a dream project you started. You start with this small idea, which just grew and grew over time, into this massive snowball. And you want to make it into a snowman, but it's just so big, you don't know how to actually contain all that snow. And by the time, you finish building the snowman? It's an unpolished mess with cracks and holes everywhere.That's what this film felt like. And I just checked the wiki while I am writing this sentence. The Director came up with the idea in 2005. So I guess I'm not too far off.Overall, I personally give this a 5/10. It was still watchable. And I still enjoyed it to a point. Will I ever watch it again? Probably not. Most likely by 2021, I'd have forgotten that I ever watched this film."}, {"id": 174, "text": "Oh dear... 'artificial oxygen'. When this is a key part of the premise, you know things are going to be annoyingly lazy on the science side of the science-fiction!The time travel paradoxes could actually resolve (at a stretch) under certain interpretations of quantum observer effects. I'm pretty certain the writers didn't know this, though! If they had, they could have put in some additional actually interesting plot using the side-effects, with the bonus of actually explaining the rules for the universe of the story along the way.Nice visuals, well above what you would expect on the budget. Overall premise had great potential, frustratingly squandered by lazy+unintelligent writing and especially dialog well over the boundary into purple prose. And please save me from yet another protagonist with debilitating daddy issues!I don't need my 2 hours back, but it certainly lacks any re-watch value. Not even worth a fan-edit, which could probably bring the move up from a 3 to a 5 or even 6: just relocating a few of the emotional scenes (not necessarily bad in themselves) to before the (literal) ticking clock starts, and tightening out most of the runtime padding would remove a lot of the more frustrating-to-watch aspects of the film."}, {"id": 175, "text": "So this film, it looked great. Great set design, great CGI, very interesting visuals. Unfortunately, the plot sucks. In a time travel movie, you just have to set clearly defined rules and adhere to them. This movie does not do that. It nevers sets any rules, and what you do find out about how this version of time travel works, gets basically thrown out the window towards the end. I liked the idea of setting the film in the future, and then time traveling not to the past, but the further future. Great concept, but horribly executed. It's the fact it's a movie basically all about time travel, yet they screwed up the time travel. What's left? Good performances, but unrealistic characters. Lots of reusing footage too. You keep seeing the same scenes but with more revealed, yet, it doesn't make you want to see those scenes in full. You'll likely just not care. A time travel movie should probably get the time travel right, but it doesn't. Even a child could see the flaws in the plot and even though it seems to be more concerned with being a character study, I think it failed at that as well as having a bad plot. This movie isn't terrible, but it's not good."}, {"id": 176, "text": "I wanted to Like it as I am a Big Fan of Sci-Fi, futuristic flicks, but couldn't.Any sci-fi movie pleases me and entertains me as i love the 99.9% of them.But not this one.Because 2067 its so poorly acted, and its plot is too poor.Perhaps with better actors and a better script, this film could have been entertaining and cool.Of course, we should commend anyone who tries his/her best to produce a good movie.That being said, i regret to tell you not to waste your hard-earned money purchasing a ticket to watch 2067.Really not worthy of your time. You might even be compelled to leave the cinema.Yes, that bad it is. Sadly."}, {"id": 177, "text": "OMG I'm still laughing at the reviews for this, the story is mind blowing a realistic sci-fi movie oh dear. I did actually enjoy this movie but it was a struggle with all the wobbly melodrama &amp; the hokey science, the time travel aspect is straight out of 12 monkeys &amp; predestination. Ok so all the oxygen is gone &amp; people are breathing man made o2 through masks while outside but not in buildings? So if there's no oxygen outside, why isn't air rushing out of rooms when doors are opened, didn't see anyone go into an airlock. The ending is also very suspect, no more plants are alive in the world due to lack of oxygen so sending back a couple of tons of extinct plants from the future aren't going to survive without oxygen long enough to replenish the worlds oxygen supply, just silly. This is simply a by the book drama, one overly dramatic scene leads to the next with God awful stringed instrument music. Cinematography is very good, cgi &amp; special effects are ok. Better casting choices &amp; a much better writer or even just a better thought out story &amp; this could've been a pretty decent movie, no better or worse than what's coming out of the Russian film industry."}, {"id": 178, "text": "I find too many bad reviews on this movie and yet the artistry and backdrop work is amazing. It seems everyone in 2020 is destined to be negative about everything and that is not cool. Just chill out emotional police. Kodi Smit-McPhee has never been a lead in his own major film and if he was it wasn't too catchy like this one, We all know him as Nightcrawler from the marvel universe from X-Men. There was talk here and there for him to have his own movie but it never happened. Ryan Kwanten once again did a great job and his acting was on point especially psychologically, what people are complaining is not the actors fault but the producers doing the final cuts and they cut half his dialogs and it looks like half ass acting. Deborah Mailman was phenomenal like usual and she played this evil empress like the black queen! OMG was I so angry at her and at the end we all got our justice. For an instance I thought this movie was going to end in a bad note where all of humanity would die off and it was cool. Well that was not cool for me I almost turned away. What a great crew and great job they must of spent way more money than they should on this productions."}, {"id": 179, "text": "Long time ago Seth and Dave were hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road. All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon in the middle of the road. And he said: Pitch me the best indie sci-fi in the world, or I'll eat your soul. They each said. Okay. And they pitched the first thing that came to their heads, Just so happened to be, The Best Movie in the World, it was The Best little indie movie in the World. It was destiny. Once every 4 hundred years or so, Needless to say, the beast was stunned. Whip-crack went his whoopy tail, And the beast was done. He asked them: (snort) Be you time travelers? And we said, Nay. We are but writers. This is not The Greatest Indie Sci-Fi in the World, no. This is just a tribute. Couldn't remember The Greatest Indie Movie in the World, no, no.TL;DR Production is excellent and it has all the elements to make it into a classic but somehow they messed it up. Good one time watch but a bit slow and overly dramatic at certain points. If you can ignore major science plot holes this will get you your sci-fi fix for a couple days."}, {"id": 180, "text": "This low budget Australian movie cleverly immerses you into a world, or one world across two different times.So the plot is that they plan to save the world by stealing the Infinity Stones with a time heist , wait that is the plot of Avengers: End Game, no in this one they have to go into the future to find the solution to today's problems, because they believe if the world of the future exists, they must have solved the problem, but all they really needed to do was get everyone to play the same song together at the same time, no wait that is the plot of Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music. Maybe it was going back in time to be both their own mother and father, or was that the plot of Predestination.So the real plot is that they want to go into the future to get the cure for the problems of 2067. But there are a few plot twists and turns. It is a bit stretched (remember, low budget movie) and a bit melodramatic at times, relying on a lot of cliches about time travel to try and say something about the world's current times (something about nature of human selfishness).This movie divided both critics and audiences with some loving it and some hating it. I feel that I am somehow in the middle. I think that is mostly because it is a bit cliche, or that I have watched too many time travel movies. It is worth checking out just to make up your own mid."}], "reviews_amount": 181}
