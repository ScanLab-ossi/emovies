A gritty movie that is thrilling and suspensful without the glitz and shine, the need to embelish real life and have super happy endings. Just solid performances and what could actually happen. They clearly had pilots, pschologists and police advise them. There may be holes, but they were inaccurancies above my level of knowledge. Had me enthalled, better than its reviews, but not for everyone, if you like your movies realistic and/or like planes this one is for you."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This movie gives an amazingly realistic look at the interplay that exist in actual hijacking scenarios. It is slower in pace and grittier in appearance and direction than what many expect from a Hollywood movie of this type and could be seen as more of a fictional documentary which I expect is the reason for the shockingly low reviews seen. However in my opinion the acting and direction of this movie make it one of the best in its genre and well worth watching."}, {"id": 3, "text": "This somber film isn't very expansive with about 15 characters in total and the entire film takes place in the pilot's cockpit. But where this film becomes robust is through intensity from a terrifying scenario. What I enjoyed about the \ud83c\udf9e is it didn't try and create any false narratives or stupid ideas that most movies insert into scripts for cheesy entertainment value. No the lead character although under immense pressure followed suit with what most people put in that situation would do. Yes I would reccomend this movie it's not a bang bang thriller to fly through on a Sunday afternoon what have you but it's definitely a late-night dramatic flick that moves the needle provoking solemn reflection by it's end."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Overall a very solid movie.

Hollywood truly doesn't understand that these days. This film is a realistic view into this situation and was executed very well. Hollywood please take note of how this film succeeded where you fail so many times before."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Hijacking before 9/11 and hijacking after 9/11 mean two very different things. Condoleezza RiceAnyone aware of the possible mishaps of air travel knows from 9/11 that hijacking is about the worst possible scenario. New director and co-writer Senad Halilbasic have crafted 7500, which depicts in painful realism the overtaking of a German shuttle between Berlin and Paris. With 85 passengers, the plane has a heavy human load.The safety checks for takeoff by young first officer, Tobias (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), are mundane but nonetheless ominous because we know what the film is about. Adding to the forthcoming anguish, a flight attendant, Gokce (Aylin Tezel), is Tobias's fianc\u00e9, with whom he shares a child. It's not difficult to guess the role she will play in the vicious negotiations to open the cockpit door.In a lack of creative casting, the Islamic terrorists are mostly Arab with the vague notion of using the flight as retribution for Western sins. Much more imaginative is Vollrath setting the majority of the action in the cockpit, creating a claustrophobic dread as if we were witnessing the opening of a casket.The camera is almost always on Tobias as he flies the plane (the captain is dead) and struggles physically and mentally with the terrorists. Levitt is dexterous and sympathetic as a character given the moral choices inherent in losing lives to save lives. Also, he must stop the terrorists and save the plane. Because they want to crash into a populous area, Tobias has even more heavy lifting.Although the action is limited to the cockpit, it's a thriller that relies on the built-in tensions of flight after 9/11. No minute is dull because humanity's safety is at stake. Just don't show this thriller to someone who has never flown, or better, has no notion about the evil men do.While streaming this tense thriller from the comfort of your home, be aware that when you fly, all comfort, physical and psychological, may not arrive with your baggage."}, {"id": 9, "text": "This film kept popping up in my browser so decided to watch it. Glad I did. Had me glued to the screen all the way through. Filmed entirely in a planes cockpit which in itself was different.

Recently, I find nothing goods to watch anymore, I have seen thousand of hijacking movies, series,..and agreed that this one belongs to one of them.. This is just a small B movie with few actors involved, a good pace and thrilling moments, Joseph Gordon Levitt alone which I admired could easily handle this standalone movie. But the other cast are not dissapointing at all. People are complaining they seen this kinda movies thousand times before and yes that's correct. The story are similar to any other movies, but why don't we just try to give this a chance and sit back , enjoy the thrilling rides. I'm giving this 10/10 cause I enjoy this small films franchise, and this one does not dissappoint me at all. Overall it is worth it."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Loved this. Unexpected but gritty and compelling. Ending threw me a little bit still loved it. Enjoy."}, {"id": 12, "text": "The beginning of the film is very immersive, makes you feel like you are in the plane, this is what a movie that's entirely in one place should do. Simple things like visions of the cameras of the airport and plane, the pilot and the co-pilot talking to the people who work in the airport and the flight attendants, some peoples would find that boring, but that's what makes you fell like you are the environment of the movie.When the kidnapping of the plane begins, the film is still immersive, but when the characters start to became stupid and some characterizations who are supposed to be something, like the wife of the main character, all end on basically nothing, then the movie become boring and empty.All that said, Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a good performance."}, {"id": 13, "text": "7500 develops anticipation and builds tension from the opening frames, simulating authentic security camera footage of terrorists getting through airport security, and onto a German airline passenger jet headed to Paris. Once aboard the plane, Vollrath uses a real-time scene structure (similar to Mendes' 1917) from the viewpoint of the cockpit and the American co-pilot played with understated perfection by Gorden-Levitt. The film takes hold of the viewer and doesn't let go - the entire film plays like a reenactment of actual events (this is fictional story). A fantastic 1st film effort by German Screenwriter/Director Patrick Vollrath."}, {"id": 14, "text": "... once they realised the extremist recruiters had not read 'Hijacking for Dummies' the authorities were able to play their patronise the terrorist card with aplomb."}, {"id": 15, "text": "The tension that this film creates is palpable and it does this without resorting to the usual Hollywood cliches such as over the top musical cues for anything vaguely dramatic, claustrophobic and carefully restrained cinematography (no CGI plane shots from every angle) and without dumbing things down for the audience. This is also by far the most realistic depiction of an airliner cockpit in any movie that I've seen and they clearly did their research when making sure they get things as accurate as possible for this film. Even the sound of the engines on takeoff is exceptionally realistic without the usual almost rocket launch sound effects while the plane is heading down the runway, followed by absolute silence while the plane is cruising. It's quite obvious that this is a real A320 (or variant) cockpit and it shows. So as someone that is sick of Hollywood dumbing down aviation scenes in movies, this really stands out and the amount of work and research that must have gone into this is incredible. All in all an excellent film."}, {"id": 16, "text": "You know that if Gordon-Levitt is going to assume a role, it just has to involve a great script and first-class production. This does not disappoint.If you think there is little new that anyone can bring to a plane/terrorist/hijack story -- you are dead wrong. Gut-wretchingly tense and terrifying from the start and doesn't let up."}, {"id": 17, "text": "As others have said, this movie was practically a one-man play. I'll say off the bat, this movie is not my usual taste in movies. There was enough jargon and enough numbers to make my head spin. Much of it was subtitled and I'm not a fan of foreign films. I'm a horror buff and this movie showed, instead, the banal cruelty of humans over humanity. While I am not one that requires a film to have a happy ending, all wrapped up in a bow, this movie had a bleak, abrupt ending leaving the viewer aware that no character would have a happy ending if the film were extended to show their lives.Despite all that, I was blown away by the intensity of the film. At no time was I left with more than a second to catch my breath before the next thing happened. Even when the probability of an event was telegraphed to the viewer (such as when the plane is about to crash), the tension is high and the viewer is all but begging for something, anything, to happen to end the suspense. Even when an event reaches an inevitable conclusion, the viewer is never let down--the tension just increases until everything comes to an end and only one sound remains, in the darkness.I'm certain that there are many flaws. I've never given a 10, because there is no such thing as a perfect film. I am giving it a 9 because one character came skirting close to being a stereotype in an otherwise wonderfully character-driven plot. One thing that made this movie sing for me was that there was no super character. The captain was an older man who bravely sought to keep his first officer and passengers calm. The first officer was an ordinary man who was easily injured and who often fought from a position of physical and mental weakness. The hijackers were just average people, caught up in zealotry. The one we see the most was just a boy who was too afraid to die.This movie is not a shoot-em-up movie. It's not a traditional action film, because it takes place in the confines of the cockpit. It's got a body count for the type of person who wants one, but most of the killings are off-screen and those that are on screen are swift and brutal with a minimum of blood. This movie is not for the person who wants loud explosions or chase scenes. What it is, is a fantastic examination of characters experiencing fear. Fear, after a certain point, contaminates every action and leads to the inevitable conclusion.Wow.See it. If you like character-driven movies, you won't be disappointed."}, {"id": 18, "text": "I've not seen anything this good since Das Boot. 7500 is outstanding, Gordon-Levitt blew me away, I'm still stunned and I'm not sure I will sleep tonight."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I really enjoyed this movie. Interesting that it was shot entirely in the cabin. I'm not about to review but I want to say to the critic who suggested duty free is handed over when boarding the plane, I suggest you do your research and I assume you haven't travelled outside of the US.

Jokes aside, the movie is more than serious and really tries to portray happenings as close to reality as they can get. The acting is great and while some things are heightened for effect, you can see things going down the way they did.This is not easy to watch (it is not meant to be), but if you are into thrillers taken from real life and drama unfolding in front of your eyes, this is a movie to remember and watch of course. There might be decisions being made that you would not have taken, but don't forget we are talking about humans and everyone is wired differently.

Quite brutal in places but not over the top.Like some others I watched it later at night and it added to the drama.I'd have scored it higher if it wasn't for a few silly mistakes. Flight time from Berlin to Paris is 1hr 45min so the time in the air is probably 1hr 15 min max. There are a ton of airfields that could be landed at in an emergency. Also, there would be no special requests from the passengers to attend too as the most you'd get is a quick snack and one drink.All the same. Really enjoyed it.

No Hollywood script writers, or big ego directors. fingerprints were on this one.

Far too many wtf scenes in this one, which will have have you laugh and cringe and throw your arms about.

I expected excitement and all I got was JGL in the cockpit, in fact viewers should know going in that the camera doesn't leave the cockpit for the entire movie.

They pound while killing hostages. They pound while threatening others. They pound and try everything to break in. It never got tedious, because it was realistic. Second, some people hated the ending where you feel sorry for the terrorists. Not at all. One terrorist ended up helping JGL and literally SAVED is life. If someone helps your hero, then it's cool to feel for them The film is not set up to sympathize with the bad guys...just one of them who ended up a hero himself. The other 3 got what they deserved. Third, people hate the way JGL piloted and things he should have done, etc. He seemed to be following the book. You can't get anymore by the book than letting your fiance die rather than give in to the terrorists. I would have made the passenger announcement sooner: Attention all passengers.

After 9/11, no one would sit idly by and allow this to happen while only 2 terrorists were in the cabin with small glass shards.This is more of a slow burn, mindless movie with bad guys banging on the flight deck door for more than an hour.

It's tight, lean, extremely well-acted, by all the actors in it. Most of the action takes place in a very small space, and most of the action is among only a few actors. Even the voices of the police are off-screen. For this all to work requires wonderful acting, wonderful directing, a really great script, and a stellar understanding of human behaviour/thinking - both of the characters and the audience. I'd also like to note that it was a good idea to cast an American actor in this film. *I* would have watched it if it were a German movie with subtitles, but a lot of people would not.

That is the set up. That is all you need. Then it start with a crash, a big crash! We start a ride of tension that takes place in a cramped cockpit with only the darkness outside the windows to give us any sense of distance and pounding on the cockpit door that is like some drummer channeling a drug addled beat only he understands. 7500 is code for our plane has been hijacked. The pilot is dead, one hijacker is unconscious in the cockpit, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as the co-pilot, owns this role and shows himself as one of our best actors. The other doesn't really come into the picture until the last third, Omid Memar as Vedat shows himself as a strong young actor pushing the tension on a roller coaster as Gordon-Levitt tries to bring the calm.

Gordon-Levitt gives a strong and believable performance throughout and makes the movie.I dropped a star as two problematic parts of the movie (which are needed to carry it forward) had me screaming at the screen as stupid errors on the part of the pilot. Number 1 was even making contact with the hijackers through the cabin announcement in the first place and telling everyone they're about to land, and number 2 was not killing outright the hijacker in the cockpit instead waiting for him to wake up and start attacking people again. Perhaps if we saw that Tobias had slit his throat with the glass it would have been a more convincing assumption that the hijacker was out for good, only to start twitching and wake up later in the movie.I can overlook what I consider to be silly mistakes for the fact that there wouldn't have been much else of a movie if the Tobias had just shut off the screen and landed the plane.Technically it dealt with the riggers of piloting an aircraft accurately and genuinely, although I was about to assume they had forgotten to lower the flaps as the pilot should have explained that before final approach, rather than 2 seconds before the plane was about to stall.There's no over dramatic score, no hyped up visual effects other than what can loosely be seen through the cockpit window, and it feels as though we are seeing everything from the first officers perspective. It manages to make the cockpit feel cramped and realistic.Overall I would recommend to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers, and congratulate Joseph Gordon-Levitt for another great performance in a very compelling and unique take on the classic aircraft hijacking scenario, based entirely from within the cockpit. If the pilot can't see what's going on in the rest of the plane, then we don't see it either.There are no stupid plot twists or the kind of nonsense you would expect from an action movie designed for people with short attention spans. It's a straight up realistic first person hijacking scenario from start to finish, where good people die needlessly and few come out unscathed.Highly recommended."}, {"id": 116, "text": "This film start with a video footage of a bunch of passenger at the Berlin airport, and the introduction of a co-pilot Tobias scene!

He delivers a fabulous performance filled with emotion. And for a feature length debut, the film is quite good. The premise and motivations are simple, but extremely effective and stimulating.The movie starts strong, getting in to the action right away and keeps the tension high for the first half of the film. While the second half of the film isn't bad by any stretch, it is a lot lower energy than the first half leaving the film with a strange sense of pacing which detached me from the ending.If you are into a low-action/thriller with a great character study, then I would recommend. I would say if you are interested, then it is worth a watch.SPOILERS: The first 55 minutes is the plane getting hijacked, which is amazing and invigorating. But following the betrayal in the cockpit, the movie begins to slow in pace drastically. While there is still tension between Tobias (JGL) and the young terrorist, it feels like the climax has already occurred, which made my engagement go down.Tobias regains control of the plane 53 minutes in, right after the younger terrorist kills the older one. After this, and especially after Tobias lands the plane, it felt like the action had ceased and the stakes where way down, which made the last 20 minutes of the movie feel like it could have been 5.All in all it's impressive that the whole film takes place in the cockpit, which allows you to really be in JGL's shoes, and his performance is amazing. But the ending really soured the after taste. Personally, if you shaved 15 minutes off the end and added that time into the middle and beginning the movie would have been a more effective use of the hour and a half. It feels like a 50 minute short film that they turned into a 80 minute film.But beyond all that, the movie is still an impressive debut with a strong leading role that is worth at least one watch."}, {"id": 157, "text": "Just know going in, that this is a small film.

There's nothing here that sticks out from a storytelling perspective. (-) The staggeringly slow-paced final act didn't exactly work for me. It took away the wind in my sails, to be honest.

For example, the co-pilot's attitudes during the narrative are absurd and not compatible with a real situation. It is even comical to watch the actor dramatize an issue that should only be dealt with from a technical point of view, according to the existing global air safety requirements.

And for pulling off the risky style of movie-making, I give it a 9."}, {"id": 187, "text": "I almost hate to slam 7500, because there are some very commendable aspects. It may surprise you to find that in a review carrying a 7.0 rating, I plan to slam the movie, but that's where I'm headed. I hate what it seems to advocate. I like many things about how it was put together.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is very convincing throughout. I have nothing but good to say about his work here. Also, if you enjoyed Locke, with the technical challenge of staging an entire movie in a vehicle moving down the highway, you're likely to enjoy the accomplishment here, of staging almost an entire movie in the cockpit of an airliner. It's very convincing and well done. (I do recall one odd exception. They continually refer to a runway at 2-7-R. In every conversation I ever had from a cockpit, runways were rendered using international alphabet, which would make this one 2-7-Romeo. Have things change?)Other than JGL and the handling of the cockpit setting, I don't have much good to say about it. It's certainly not about doing the smart things once you have attackers get busy on your airplane. It might be a very effective presentation on why no one in the cockpit should ever have been disarmed on any aircraft.I saw a lot of grumbling and 1-star reviews, and I think that a lot of it came from folks not realizing why they felt so cheated at the end. Some acknowledge the technical correctness of a lot of the cabin business. Some found it good for roughly the first hour, but then found it annoying or silly or depressing or several other things, but I think they missed the most important reason for all of that. I'll get to that.I rated the movie based on how well it's made, not on my opinion of what it tries to do. If you like its message, you'll experience it as a good movie. If you think the message is naive and risky at best, and perhaps downright irresponsible and deadly, as I do, then you will not agree with the rest of what I have to say.To start with, you can't fault a movie because it's characters don't make what you think are the right choices in rough circumstances on the fly. So, I groan at some of the actions taken, but they are believable and even likely. Sometimes you make a movie about bad choices to make people think hard about what the good choices would be. That's legitimate. That's not this movie, although it certainly can serve that purpose, even if unintentionally.My strongest complaint is that they are trying to get me to be sympathetic towards a young man who, in my scheme of things, has thrown himself far past any possibility of deserving more than proforma sympathy. I'm sorry, a bit, that he got himself into the situation, as I would be sorry for any young person who didn't have the judgment to do smarter things. He chose to do deadly, awful things, so my sympathy is limited to that formal regret, and not one drop more. Let's review briefly what we see him do.He's not really much more than a kid, but we would call him a young man, I think. We see him acquire the materials for deadly weapons. (It's quite clever, and one of the best points of the film, and it should serve as a warning to airlines.) We see him participate in rushing the cabin. He stands by while his accomplices in the main cabin brutally murder more than one person on the plane. He later enters the cabin with his own deadly weapons.We do see him a bit distressed by the murders. After he sees the plan falling apart, after being upset by watching murdered persons die, he finally seems to regret that he took part in the whole thing, especially that part about him having to die as part of the plan. He calls mom - no joke - and cries that he just wants it all to end and he wants to come home. Mind you, he calls while holding the surviving pilot hostage in the cabin of the airliner he helped to hijack and for which he helped supply the weapons used to commit the murders. Somehow, even with all that, we are supposed to have some sort of sympathy for the guy and hope that maybe he lives to surrender.I make no apology for preferring a very different outcome.When the attacker who first made it into the cabin was subdued - only after fatally stabbing the captain multiple times - he should not have been simply restrained and left to regain consciousness. He should have been dealt a final and fatal blow to ensure that he could not possibly be any further threat. As I said, that's a different movie, and they weren't wrong in any sense to write that their character did something else.This is, however, my review, and I will use the point - not killing the lead attacker, even after he brutally stabs the pilot - to underline that sparing him leaves the remaining pilot at risk again, and leaves him at the mercy of the young man when he eventually gains entry into the cockpit. What should have happened was that the surviving pilot (JGL), after killing the lead attacker (my version of the story), as he allowed the young man to enter, he should have positioned himself at the ready to use the same fire extinguisher to bash that skull and eliminate that threat.It is movie illogic to leave that primary attacker alive, period, and then worse to leave the young one alive as well. However, both had to be done, since this story needs the primary attacker to stick around and terrify the young one by working hard to carry out the plan to crash. It also had to be done in order to have the young one stick around and show us, after everything he had done or helped to do, that he was, I guess, not really a bad person.Apparently, we are supposed to accept that he is very agitated and afraid now, and so we should care about his life now. (JGL, by the way, does a genuinely nice job of being the character who would try to warn the young man as the police gather outside the plane and the young man holds a blade to JGL's throat. I hate that they want us to care in that way, but I have only respect for JGL and his approach through the film. Here, his attempt to calm his attacker, to keep from provoking him, but also to prevent him from making a threatening gesture sure to be seen by the police - JGL's attempt to juggle all that is a lovely piece of work.)I think it's a terrible message (oh, he feels so bad now, we should hope he survives) and very likely to be far more deadly in the real world what we saw in the movie, where several folks die.If you think the message is just fine, you'll surely enjoy the movie. If you think it's dangerous at the very least, then, like me, you may cheer when finally, at long last, someone outside the aircraft, trained and ready, does what I think was the right and necessary thing and eliminates the young man's ability to harm anyone ever again. I was so frustrated by the time we got there, that I really did, I admit, cheer that the right thing finally got done."}, {"id": 188, "text": "I liked the movie since I like all movies related to aviation or space.

I had a good time with 7500, it was definitely flawed and simple in some ways, but it had some very unique and interesting elements, so let's talk about it.First of all the cinematography and use of sound was great, with the film also having a unique perspective for the main character. The film's simplicity with it's cinematography actually worked really well for this type of movie, the use of camera footage for the people on the plain and within the airport was really interesting and set the mood and tone well for the movie. The film also had a very unique perspective for the main character which was really interesting, Almost the entire movie was sit in the cockpit of the plane, this was really interesting as it felt very claustrophobic and uncomfortable to watch knowing that the main character is trapped inside one tiny room, so this really made the audience connect with the main character and see the movie through his eyes. The use of sound was also great, the consistent banging on the door and use of shouting in the other rooms on the plane did a really good job at making you on edge, not knowing what was going on outside the cockpit or if the Hijackers will get through the door was cleverly done and always made you on edge, the film itself because of this managed to achieve a really good uncomfortable tone, and as the stakes were raised and the noise got louder the slow building of tension was executed very well.However, my first two negatives would be the slow pacing at the beginning and the odd creative decisions with the villains. The beginning of the film was fairly slow and until the twist of the Hijacking can be considered fairly boring, it was a lot of sitting around and just talking, which for me effected the consistency of the pacing and the narrative leading into the inciting incident. I also found that the film had an odd creative decision with the villains, they revealed who the main villains were before they were even on the plane, which I personally found slightly odd and I would of set that up differently within the script to make it more shocking to the audience when the twist happened.My next few positives would be the character background, likeable main character, and the main performance from Joseph Gordan Levitt. I thought the character background for Tobias, was good and made the audience understand his character more and raise the stakes. When you learned about his family he has the relationship with the mother of the child, it made you want the character to make it to the end, they did a good job with making you feel something for the character and even with the dialogue with Vedat (Omid Memar) made you understand the characters a lot more and what their lives were like outside of the plane. The main character of Tobias was also very likeable, he had a charm to him that made you take a shine to him when he was on screen, he was also clever and made good decisions that protected everyone on board the plane which made you respect him as a person as well. The main performance from Joseph Gordon Levitt was also great. His performance felt very natural and organic considering the situation his character was put in, you believed every emotion, and the slow decline of his mental health throughout was very believable.My final two negatives that lost the film a fair few marks for me, would be the film's lack of depth to the plot or characters, and the inconsistent and unclear character intentions. The film despite having interesting and unique components creatively was very simple and lacked any form of depth to it's plot or the characters, this was due to the actual lack of characters and to much focus on getting the visual and technical creativity down instead of balancing it out with a strong narrative and script. Finally there was some very inconsistent and unclear character intentions with the character of Vedat. He must of switched between playing an antagonist and protagonist at least 10 times. One minute he was helping and negotiating with Tobias, and the next he is trying to kill him. This irritated me as I really didn't know what to think about that particular character.My final two positives would be the unexpected plot twist and the villains linking to today's issues. The film spent such a long time going through the procedures of the how to run the plane and focusing on the main character, that when the terrorist Hijacking started to happen it took me by surprise, so despite the characters not being a shock the actual event was executed well, the Villains were also good in terms of the links to issues in today's society. They seemed to be a part of a terrorist group, and the dialogue that they mentioned about Muslims an people of colour being killed and mistreated almost made you understand why they were doing what they were doing despite it obviously being wrong, but due to the current political climate this was a nice touch to the movie.Overall, 7500 is a good enough time and an easy watch. With a great lead performance and unique visual creativity. But sadly, it's visual and technical creativity weren't enough to distract from the film's simple plot and characters and lack of balance between a good plot and script and good visuals."}, {"id": 194, "text": "Yes, it might be an accurate depiction of what happens during a plane hijack but, this was just awful!

By filming more or less the entire movie from the perspective of the cockpit, the audience gets a window into the claustrophobic pressure of life and death decisions as well as the difficult commitment to duty and protocols that a pilot in such a circumstance can face.The performances by Gordon-Levitt and Memar were gripping.It's an underrated film but I highly recommend it."}, {"id": 245, "text": "I really enjoyed this movie.

The sound of the non-stop banging on the door gave me the goosebumps. I think this movie give a good representation of what could happen, fortunately without all the Hollywood bombastic.

Apparently the co pilot, played by Levitt is involved with one of the flight attendants.So the plane takes off, and shortly into the flight some guys rush the cockpit when one of the flight attendants opens the door. The Captain is stabbed, but Levitt manages to force guy # 2 out of the cockpit and lock it, and grabs a fire extingusher and bashes guy #1 in the head. Captain is still alive but bleeding. 1st officer Levitt levels out the plane and reports the emergency.There's at least one more guy outside trying to break into the cockpit. Levitt secures guy #1 pretty tightly it appears.+1 Star for the cockpit fight and securing.+1 Star for Levitts wife telling him not to open the DOOR. And For Levitt not opening the cockpit door. He did what he had to do.Oh nice, the passengers rush the door. But Guy #1 wakes up and escapes and knocks Levitt out. So Guy #1 lets in Guy #4, but guy #3 gets taken out by the passengers. Now the passengers are trying to break into the cockpit. Once the #1 Guy is back in charge tho he's definitely the #1 guy. He has the prepared speech he reads about how they will crash the plane. But Daniel, Guy #4....he freaks out. He doesn't want to die. So he stabs guy #1 with one of the glass knives they've been using. He kills guy #1 , and frees Levitt. Levitt levels the plane in time to keep it from crashing.And then after the landing and the passengers get out, then it becomes a 1 on 1 with Guy 4 and Levitt. And guy 4 wants a tanker to refuel the plane so it can leave. Of course it ends the only way it can, they shoot guy #4 . The police come in and lead Levitt out past his dead wife.And that's the end. They don't say if Guy4 lives or dies. Pretty Decent flick. Guy 4 of course was just a stupid kid. And the Captain, he was a brave guy, but stupid for letting himself bleed out.

Best movie I've seen in months."}, {"id": 335, "text": "This is one of those really, really stupid movies that has any sensible person shouting at the screen. I cannot believe that so many reviewers apparently couldn't see this for the crap that it is.I would agree with many others that it started well but, I guess at about the 25 minute point, it truly lost its way and quickly became quite unbelievable and utterly nonsensical.The problems with it:1 NEVER EVER EVER EVER open the door into the cockpit when there's a hijacking going on. Even more importantly, if you have a hijacker who's already on the flight deck, make very sure that he's put out of action permanently, not just unconscious. If you kill him to stop him regaining consciousness and posing a further threat, there isn't a court in the civilized world that would convict you. So, if you can kill a hijacker, grow some gonads and just do it2 conversations between aircraft and air traffic control are ALWAYS, and I mean ABSOLUTELY ALWAYS, in English. All over the world. Full stop. No question here. There is absolutely no way that ATC would communicate in a language other than English with air grew or with hijackers, especially as in this case where the co-pilot has told ATC that he speaks only English and doesn't understand German. At various times in this movie, ATC was speaking to the co-pilot (Levitt) and also to the wimpy hijacker in German. This would just not happen. ATC and security services would definitely have wanted the co-pilot to know what was happening3 where did all the passengers go?? When the co-pilot announced to the passengers that there were two hijackers that were still a danger and that they were armed only with glass, what the Hell did the 80 odd passengers do? I assume they sat there being wimps and watching movies. Sure, there may have been more than two hijackers at that time, possibly three left but please, don't try telling me that the passengers couldn't have rushed the hijackers and overpowered them. End of hijacking. We never heard a sound of passengers trying to defend themselves as they did on Flight 93 on 9/114 I agree with what others have said that it's inconceivable that a flight from Berlin to Paris could not have landed either back at Berlin or at any number of other airports in Germany very soon after the first sign of the hijacking. Frankfurt would have been no more than 100 km away by that time and then there would have been Potsdam, Magdeburg and Wolfsburg also only a short distance away and I'm sure with airstrips suitable for this aircraft's landing. The fact is that our outstandingly stupid friend the co-pilot could easily have landed the aircraft safely long before the fat terrorist regained consciousness, again ignoring the possibility of putting fat terrorist out of action permanently if the co-pilot had had some guts.I understand that if co-pilot had done any number of things that were clearly necessary, the movie might have run 35 minutes and that all the stupidity really only served to lengthen this dumb movie to 92 minutes, thankfully including end credits.I am reminded here of a TV mini-series called Into The Night which is showing on Netflix. That one also started well but it quickly descended into perhaps even greater improbability. Ultimately, it was even worse than 7500 since it ran for four hours. Even 92 minutes of 7500 was way too much for me.Here's to hoping that airlines not only teach air crew how to fly safely and responsibly but also have something in the selection process requiring air crew to show some courage in a hijack situation and not act like wimps.It's just as well that I only spent the equivalent of $US2 for the DVD of this load of old rubbish. It's a movie that I'll lay down and avoid from now on.JMV"}, {"id": 336, "text": "Was very disappointed from the movie, it was pointless.

It really is a taut, claustrophobic thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat, its insular story pushing forwards at a pulse-pounding rate. It's also incredibly grounded, filmed using a special 'long take' technique that ekes the most out of its cast (which includes an especially on form Gordon-Levitt) by putting them in a situation that closely resembles the one their character is in - minus the actual danger, of course. The movie is highly compelling throughout, gripping you right from the moment its focal hijacking starts. It's exciting, distressing and intense. It does rely on some unfortunate and outdated stereotyping, but it also tries to inject some nuance into its narrative, especially as it approaches its somewhat unexpected finale. Though it isn't all that memorable or deep, it's a highly enjoyable and engaging in-the-moment experience. 7/10"}, {"id": 346, "text": "I really liked this movie.

It's obvious that 7500 strives for the intensity and realism; it doesn't try to entertain, but to show what it could be like in one of these scenarios. I've seen other movies like 7500, where they portray terrorist hijackings on a plane, but 7500 is the best one I've seen so far.At some parts in the film, it drags for a little too long, especially in the last scene. And for me, the intensity was lacking in that final scene, as it's pretty clear with what's going to happen next. But in other instances in the film where a scene is just as long, if not longer, the pacing is perfectly fine, because the intensity is at its highest.I think what makes 7500 so intense was how realistic it really is. The dialogue, the violence, and the reactions of the characters are all down to earth. I also like how the film is told through the perspective of a pilot. I mostly see movies like these being told through a group of survivors, so seeing it being told in a completely different lens definitely freshens things up.The acting was great too. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance in 7500 really shows off his talents as an actor. I would put 7500 in the top 3 of his performances, because it's really that impressive. What I love so much about the overall performances, was how everyone else's performance was equal to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's. The cast is no means A-list, but they definitely gave performances that match that talent.Overall, 7500 is a very simple plot that perfects everything that needs to be perfected.

But it does not want to make the attempt."}, {"id": 365, "text": "This film takes the airplane hijacking genre and portrays it from an original perspective - strictly that from the cockpit and JGL. I really wanted to enjoy this film a lot more than I did because I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who I feel was in hiatus for a while) is absolutely brilliant and, as expected, he is fantastic as the main protagonist on flight 7500. However, despite its ambitious approach to tell a generic, formulaic story with a slightly different spin, the script is far too predictable and the film very quickly loses steam towards the end of the the second act to its conclusion. 7500 hits the ground running but can't sustain the pace for the entirety of the film (disappointingly). I can't necessarily recommend this one unfortunately despite a short runtime but I was really rooting for it to be better (and some of you may actually find it exceptionally better than I did)."}, {"id": 366, "text": "The film was very procedural and had lots of unnecessary scenes and unimportant dialogue. I'm sure this was made not only to pad the run time but also to make it feel more realistic. I was fine with that mostly, it also did feel like many moments were improvised, and that's alright as well.The problem was that we don't really know a whole lot about our main lead and about the kid. There's very little information about the kid and Levitt does not interact with his girlfriend a whole lot. Instead, we got lots of technical scenes (which were interesting in a way if you fly a lot), and some repetitive scenes of Levitt trying to risk it and attack the hijacker kid but still not doing this.I've seen similar scenes handled better in a cheap series (with the same amount of realism). Literally, a frightened kid with an AK takes hostages in a store and a cop is talking him out of it using everything he's got (even lying and deceiving) before getting the kid (who was innocent but got into a bad situation) finally breaks down and cries dropping the gun and going completely unresponsive.I'd love this film much more if the ending would've been more ambiguous and our main lead would've stayed more in character. The ending they have chosen is just lame and bland. Why not do something crazier, why not let Levitt kill the kid bloodily in an act of revenge out of pure misery and hate and then come to realize what he has done when the boy got the call. Or let the boy kill him and get shot, how about such a realistic and dark ending? And why would he try to save the boy anyway? He must be devastated because a lot was taken from him, why is he trying to save the life of a boy who almost killed him a couple of times? What a weird anti-violence message.Overall, while the realistic approach was interesting, I'd still love this more if they would have more emotional fatigue and a better ending.

If I had bought a regular/full size bottle instead of the novelty sized 'Nip', I would have had to hand it over and have it stored belowdeck. The size bottles he bought were definitely big, too big for carryons. I'm also curious about where they actually broke the bottles and didn't attract attention. Also, 85 passengers is a lot of ppl to fight back, especially when he radios the cabin to tell them their major advantage over the loser wanna be hijackers.

He is co-pilot on a flight from Germany to Paris.The movie starts with a lot of technical information about planes. Then the movie moves quickly to terrorists trying to take over the flight. One gets into the cockpit and kills the pilot. At this point, it is pretty basic....the other terrorists try to enter the cockpit...banging on the door over and over and over. They kill passengers including his girlfriend.The real standout of this movie is Omid Memar who stars as Vedat (one of the terrorists). But we learn he is only 18 and conflicted about the behavior of the other terrorists. He makes a connection with Levitt's character. The last third of this movie is just the 2 of them and Vedat is seen as just a kid. Levitt's character ends up caring about him in the end.The problem with this movie is that for a 90 minute movie, it feels like it is twice as long. There are long periods where nothing is happening.

He is brilliant in his portrayal of a very young and frightened hijacker. Although an unfamiliar face, I am sure this will lead to much success in his future. It should be noted about 90% of the film is contained in the airliner cockpit. This fact compounds everyone's fear; it becomes more palpable. I was reminded of the big budget film Apollo 13 (1995). Although the plots are very different, the claustrophobic atmosphere is quite similar. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this film. It allowed Mr. Levitt to display his full range of talent. I have always liked him. Of course, Inception (2010) comes to mind.

One has to look at this film for what it is and not what you may be expecting it to be. If you look at this film solely from the point of view of the co-piolet which is what the film is about then you'll understand that it's not trying to tell a political story or give you insight to why people hijack planes. The runtime is 90 minutes and I was never bored during this entire time. I felt every emotion the protagonist felt and I was totally involved in his plight. No film is perfect and this film is no exception but it made a favourable impression on me that I felt the need to leave a review. This is a little gem of a film and definitely worth 90 minutes of your life if you like these small gritty intense sorts of films.

Being based on a horrific true event made it all the more powerful. That film can't be topped. So what's a filmmaker to do? Change the approach.Full credit to the director and the backers who took a risk to bring us this scenariio in a totally new and disturbing way. What we can't see is more horrific than what we can. Some of the best horror films used this approach. Alien being one. The horror was mostly off-camera. We never really saw the thing until the end.Those who dislike this fall into two camps. Those who don't like to see any Middle Eastern type figures as bad guys in films and those with such review titles as OMG! and oh lord, what just happened? How the quality of film reviews have dropped ever since phones became the review tool of choice. These people are not of discerning sensibilities and clearly don't understand human behaviors such as fear and stress. The stakes are as high as they can get. The tension is incredibly taut.

This film was quite realistic but nobody seems to actually want to experience real life. I do understand that some people watch movies for escapism and that's fine but if you read the synopsis it's clearly not that type of movie.JGL did very well in my opinion. Great even considering the tight space the movie was shot in. He made smart decisions, used his training, tried to keep calm. But that's not good enough for idiots who just want constant action and for the good guy to kill the bad guy like so many pointless movies out there.Maybe the haters don't like that one of the hijackers is given basic human emotions and clearly isn't just a mindless monster/soldier for the enemy.

The violence may not be very graphic, but the feelings are violent, sharp and heavy.

I care very little for action and explosions and movies like the modern Star Wars and Hollywood stuff. I really enjoy stories, acting and a realistic approach to emotions and natural interaction between people. Quirky one-liners belong in comedies, which this has none of.This movie hit all the right buttons!The setting, location &amp; the way the people interact together felt like this was a real event. This movies has a kind of approach that reminds so much of the Norwegian movie 'Nokas' in its almost biographical approach.When looking over the movie' synopsis; I almost skipped it because it sounded like it was about an American saving the day (I have NOTHING against Americans, I'm just tired of Hollywood stories that are unrealistically heroic); and I was extremely surprised by the outcome. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does an amazing job here, never did I feel like the emotions he was portraying were out of place or unrealistic.I felt immersed from the start until the end. It felt like the camera rolled literally for 1 1/2 hours without any cuts. The editing was extremely tight and realistic.

For me, that's gold. Bravo!Most air-hijacking films go for summer spectacular status with thrills and spills and vast heroism (re: the previously mentioned 'Air Force One', as example). 7500 takes the rarely taken path -- what would it be like to be the surviving co-pilot in that situation where you simply must not 'open the cockpit door' but be aware of the carnage happening in the passenger area?Maybe the negative reviewers prefer their heroes more like Harrison Ford, and find Gordon-Levitt too subtle.

With the claustrophobic intensity of Talk Radio, the scope of Airport, and quiet intensity of The Fugitive, this film is what seems like a good first effort.We need good disaster films.

Back in the day, you could've seen the three films Earthquake, Network, and Airport all at the same theatre depending on your mood and company for the night (of course these were not all out at exactly the same time, but you know what I mean).Now it's so hard to find anything new, anything that really grabs you. This is NOT a great movie. The story loses steam near the end, and lacks the twist I was expecting.Also, without hurling any personal insults at Joseph Gordon Levitt, let's just say he, and Keanu Reeves may have been switched at birth.If you are a Joseph Gordon Levitt fan, you might hate this film, and that is just fine. No great effects, time travel, or any other customary JGL fare here.Do I think Harrison Ford could've done better? Yes. Do I think Al Pacino could have done better? Yes. But those are high bars, and Joseph Gordon Levitt is far from terrible.Having said that, however, the script and direction seemed worthy of either of those two stars, and that's saying a lot.The film does an excellent job of explaining the mechanics of the action. It really does keep you on the edge of your seat, at least for the first hour.The last half hour, well, that left me scratching my head.

The runtime absolutely flies by.Before watching '7500' I thought the title was in reference to the flight number of the aircraft featured in the movie. I thought this was strange because there was another movie called 'Flight 7500' back in 2014 which I thought this movie was doing a disservice to by choosing the same name. Apparently however, the 7500 refers to the transponder code used to indicate a hijacking, which at least means they didn't just steal the exact same flight number out of the thousands that were available, but does still leave the fact they trampled on that film's title a little only 5 years on. I never felt like any character was safe in this movie and I love that in a film. Even Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character didn't feel safe to me.

Decide for yourselves and don't believe the low-numbered reviews."}, {"id": 414, "text": "* There is no end credit scene *Patrick Vollrath in his directional feature-length film debut and crew brought a unique intense thriller. The story is about a pilot maintaining control while terrorists hijacked the aircraft. There have been many movies with the same topic, but this one was so freshly told. The perspective was brilliant and very realistic, one gets used to having the viewpoint from the passengers but this film was angled at the cockpit. The suspense was incredible, especially the curtain scene, despite knowing what was bound to happen it was still hair rising. The decisions the pilot had to make for the safety of the passengers were hard to endure and the tension escalates each time he has to make one. This was not an action film, there was no hero, what this film gave was a feeling of a true scenario of a man struggling with protocols and emotions.This movie didn't have any music and as much as I love the scores, this time it didn't need one. By not having any music the performances had to be at its peak and it definitely was thanks to the lead actor.The cast was great, and no matter how small the role they all did magnificently. The lead actor, Joseph Gordon-Levitt had the weight of the movie on his shoulders and his performance was mainly projecting being on pressure and it was done superbly to its core."}, {"id": 415, "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. The first airplane hijacking movie I remember seeing was AIRPORT (1970, with Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin). Since then, it's been a recurring, relatively common cinematic topic blending our natural fears (flying and terrorism) with our love and admiration of heroic people, as seen in such films as EXECUTIVE DECISION (1996) and AIR FORCE ONE (1997). Writer-Director Patrick Vollrath (first feature length film, Oscar nominated for his excellent 2015 Live Action Short EVERYTHING WILL BE OK/ Alles Wird Gut) and co-w Sanad Halibasic use some of the familiar tropes we've come to expect, but do so with a unique twist ... the camera never leaves the cockpit (at least until the very end).Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Tobias Ellis, the co-pilot to Captain Michael Lutzman (Carlo Kitzlinger) on this scheduled short flight from Berlin to Paris. Tobias is an American based in Berlin, living with his Turkish girlfriend Gokce (Aylin Tezel) and their young son. Gokce is also a flight attendant on the flight, and the two have attempted to keep their relationship a secret from their co-workers and employer.The film opens with a quote usually attributed to Gandhi, An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. We then get a couple minutes of Berlin Airport security footage as passengers and their carry-ons proceed through security lines. We hear no dialogue or sound. The first actual scene puts us inside the cockpit as the flight crew arrives.Not long after a smooth takeoff, the terrorists rush the cockpit when the flight attendant is delivering water to the pilots. A fight ensues resulting in injuries, including to both pilots. The crisis quickly escalates as Tobias has to take over flying the plane, while dealing with the pressure of a life-altering dilemma: does he follow protocol and keep the door shut, or does he hopefully save passenger lives by opening the door? The tension mounts as Tobias (and us) views the actions of the terrorist through the small cockpit monitor.The film's title is derived from the pilot's Squawk code of 7500, which notifies the Air Traffic Controller of a hijacking-in-progress. As we learn, these aren't the usual hijackers. These are extremists who are avenging the deaths of Muslims. These terrorists prove they aren't afraid to kill, and proclaim they are not afraid to die. Well, all except one of them. Nineteen year old Vedat (Omid Memar) is the terrorists' translator, and he's left frantically trying to make the best of a bad situation, despite no real plan. His clouded-thinking exacerbates the situation as he tries to deal with the police negotiator.What gives the film appeal is the 'camera in the cockpit' trick and the tension of the moment. The space is cramped and claustrophobic. Showing the crew going through the pre-flight checks allows us to get our bearings in an unfamiliar setting. To this non-pilot, the sequence delivers a very authentic look and feel. Spending the entire time in a confined space recalls such films as BURIED (2010), LOCKE (2013), and Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT (1944). Joseph Gordon-Levitt carries most of the film with his performance, as he's rarely off camera. His temperament during chaos is fun to watch, but the final act is just a bit overwrought, and some of the good from the first two acts unravels a bit. Still, the close-quarters of a cockpit makes a unique viewing experience, and one that has us asking how we would react in this situation."}, {"id": 416, "text": "Every now and then a film comes along which doesn't put a foot wrong. This is one of those films. Absolutely nothing irritates. There are no scripting contrivances, missteps in the direction, unrealistic setups or dud performances.What this film provides is a relentless exercise in realism - it asks the question How might a hijacking play out from the point of view of the pilots? and then sticks committedly to honouring that perspective with a detached, cold eye. In this respect, Patrick Vollrath's direction is superb - in allowing the performances to lead the tempo, the tone and the framing, Vollrath produces something that feels almost real, such is the refreshing absence of aimless flash.Central to the film's success is an excellent performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who does so much with fairly minimal dialogue and a tiny set in which to operate. Every thought, decision and emotion is there on his face, every acting choice spot on. The rest of the cast are all very good indeed, and are well used, even if they don't have much screen time.7500 packs a hell of a punch, and it will stay with you long after the credits have rolled."}, {"id": 417, "text": "I understand why people are rating this so low... they're used to big budget, ridiculous Hollywood films, which fall well short of the realism bar.

It's a compelling edge of your seat thriller which is, in parts, scarily accurate. In terms of realism, it's pretty decent! Just a few actual inaccuracies and questionable timescales.Procedure would be just to turn off the cockpit video and land, and whatever happens, happens. But, if he did that, the film would be 30 mins long - and where's the excitement in that?JGL shows his weight in gold in this film. While it won't win him an Oscar, it really does show that he's a fantastic one-man-band of an actor; convincing throughout and relatable.

Anchored primarily by Joseph Gordon-Levitt's central performance as Ellis, the movie has nearly all of its scenes confined to the cockpit of the hijacked aircraft. Much like Locke, Wheelman, or Phone Booth, the movie travels familiar territory but views it from a different angle to give it a unique perspective. From the boarding process, to the hijacking, to the proceedings that follow, we the audience along with Ellis never leave the cockpit and only have a partial picture of what's going on at any given moment. The movie is the directorial debut of German filmmaker Patrick Vollrath who was nominated for an Oscar for his short film Everything Will be Okay. Vollrath makes good use of his cramped space of the cockpit, and while I wasn't especially engaged by the story or by individual sections, I felt that Vollrath was able to capture the feeling of isolation and powerlessness that one would feel while in the driver's seat of a hijacked aircraft.7500's strengths lie in its central performance and its craft. While the story follows many of the beats one has seen in various hijacking thrillers, the movie is well paced and maintains a tense atmosphere that makes it worth a recommendation."}, {"id": 419, "text": "What worked: the movie was pleasantly good since I had not expected much from the movie. It's a well executed movie with a good balance of thriller and drama. It is not over the top movie. What worked really good is the nature of the movie, the lively rather than theatrical set, mood and tone. The situation is tense, the climate is set beautifully and the set of events are natural and convincing. The team worked great, great mixing, screenplay and direction. The narrative as a whole worked good especially because of the simplicity and authenticity of the overall storytelling.What did not work: although the movie has very few scenes or situations that can be argued and disputed, which is a good thing. But one thing that stood as dramatic is the character of the teen age boy which ends up in the cockpit. I would have been happier if that character was written differently or maybe excluded or any other scenarios leading to the finale. I mean it's a well calculated plan and one of them deceiving and pulling back is a bit theatrical considering the amazing screenplay it was overall. Again, it's little thing that stayed with me, besides this it's a very well made movie.Final verdict: recommended, even better if you don't watch the trailer or come with no expectations"}, {"id": 420, "text": "7500 was directed and written by Patrick Vollrath, co-written by Senad Halilbasic, and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Omid Memar, Murathan Muslu, Paul Wollin, Aylin Tezel, and Carlo Kitzlinger. It is about a co-pilot having to save the passengers and crew when his plane is attacked by terrorists.Plotting is as thin as you can possibly get, although that makes the goal of creating a compelling journey much more difficult. Pilot Michael, co-pilot Tobias, and flight attendant Gokce (Kitzlinger, Gordon-Levitt, and Tezel) are taking off on a flight from Berlin to Paris; when in the air terrorists Vedat, Kenan, Daniel (Memar, Muslu, and Wollin) rush the cockpit and stab Michael. Michael dies and Kenan is knocked out and tied up in the cockpit while the others try all methods to get into the cockpit. Tobias maintains a connection with the hijackers by speaking to Vedat.Characters are all pretty thin, but 7500 relies more on performances in the here-and-now than background about what came before. Tobias is young, yet very experienced in flying. He likes what he does, loves his son and tries to keep his personal life to himself, but his girlfriend and flight attendant Gokce makes that difficult sometimes. Vedat is the only other remotely fleshed out character, being caught up in a plot that he wants nothing to do with. During the events his allegiances waver and he forms a shaky bond with Tobias. Performances are strong, with everyone being solid in their roles; but Joseph Gordon-Levitt is truly electric in the movie. Tobias's efforts to be less sociable during work are weak, as he talks to his pilot, ramp agent, and girlfriend. Gordon-Levitt's emotions run rampant as he has to deal with a seemingly impossible situation. He gives a truly fantastic performance.A thriller's pacing and logic are its greatest asset, and 7500 both, but in uneven distributions. The first 15 to 17 minutes are deliberately slower than what comes after, and the instantaneous shift from a normal day-in-the-life for the co-pilot to complete nightmare works well, although some of the first few minutes could have easily been cut down to help add to the suspense and take away from unnecessary length. From around 17 minutes in to 45, the movie excels in serving white-knuckle suspense. After the power dynamic makes a major shift, the movie fails to stick the landing. The logic is sound for the most part but there is an attempt made to generate sympathy for Vedat that just does not work at all. It is a major misstep that does a huge blow to a movie that by this point has fallen into a slump.Technically the movie is solid, the single set being indistinguishable from a real life cockpit of a plane; to a ground animal like myself anyway. Sound design is a large part of 7500's authenticity, bringing the sounds of terror and machinery to life with ease. A couple of fight scenes exist in the movie, with almost all of the time spent watching one also being spent deciphering the action, with close-ups and cuts galore. The setting does limit the view of the action, but there are definitely ways around the obstacles (like the second half of the script) that the movie does not tackle.Vollrath's feature length debut is well directed and elevated by Joseph Gordon-Levitt's great acting and a fantastic 30-ish minutes partway in, but a first act that lingers too long, a misplaced bid on sympathy, and a weaker second half, 7500 misses the mark.58/100"}, {"id": 421, "text": "GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite a strong performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, this seriously minded movie becomes a standard hijacking tale without the action hero heroics.JIM'S REVIEW: 7500 is the code word for unlawful interference and this new action thriller starts off very promisingly as an authentic by-the-number treatment of a plane hi-jacking and its consequences. However, the film peters out long before it lands.After a three-year self-imposed hiatus from acting, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is literally in the driver's seat and it's good to have this versatile actor back. He convincingly plays Tobias Ellis, a co-pilot on a flight from Berlin to Paris that does not go too smoothly. After a short lift-off, the plane is seized by terrorists and Tobias is left in this closed cockpit to take charge of the situation.Tensions mount quickly and first time director Patrick Vollrath creates a claustrophobic thriller devoid of typical heroics and ramped-up conflicts. His film is suspenseful without being overly melodramatic. This is not your standard action hero flick as the director strives for realism and authenticity in his narrative. Unfortunately, his screenplay adds little to enthrall with its sparse dialog and underdeveloped characters. This all leads to a rather anti-climactic denouncement as the story idles along about the midway mark. One expects more intrigue and Hitchcockian twists which never arrive.Still, Mr. Gordon-Hewitt is quite good in his reactionary role and Omid Memar avoids the cliches as a stereotypical Muslim terrorist character. There is much to admire in this realistic take on the action genre, but the film just doesn't reach the heights it could have achieved. If only 7500 would have considered a few necessary rewrites before beginning its descent to moviegoers everywhere...now that would have been an interference worth waiting for!"}, {"id": 422, "text": "This was an Amazon Original movie and I usually like to watch the streaming services films. When I watched the trailer at first I was overly excited because the movie looked engaging. While I enjoyed the acting and some of the thrills.

It features main actor Gordon-Levitt who everything runs through and is filmed entirely in the cockpit. There are no other scenes anywhere else and that itself was my first problem with this it got clausterphobic too quick. My other issue with the film is gets extremely draggy the last 25 or so minutes. Its literally like watching paint dry and it was filled with useless banter. It was almost as if they were trying to use filler to put the movie at the alotted hour and 30 minutes.I also hated the ending completely I thought maybe after all that happened.

It all seems like a pretty standard flight, until the aircraft is unexpectedly seized by a group of fanatical terrorists, who Ellis seals off by closing the doors to the cockpit. However, when they force entry and both sides take casualties, Ellis finds himself in a tense battle of wills with eighteen year old terrorist Vedat (Omid Memar.)Films have changed dramatically over the last twenty or so years, and so have the means by which they are accessed. While Hollywood was the only go to place for big, mainstream features not so long ago, today online streaming services pose just as big a competition. And so to has the style. While 90s Hollywood was known for it's big, theatrical outlandishness, today a bigger dose of relatable realism is expected. While back then, 7500 might be used as a thrilling description of how many feet a plane might be up in the air, today's more down to Earth (not the most fitting description, I know) audience get to know it's the emergency code for a hijack situation.At just over an hour and a half, debut feature length director Patrick Vollrath has a very constrained timeframe in which to create a genuinely unsettling, claustrophobic atmosphere, with engaging characters you can feel for, and it's no small feat that he's managed to do this on top of forging such a realistic scenario. Despite being best known for teen dramas, lead star Gordon-Levitt delivers a revelatory performance here, displaying a remarkably human reaction to getting caught up in such an unpleasant, unexpected situation, complimented by much lesser co star Memar, who manages to make the young hijacker strangely sympathetic as the two have to see it out to the end.It all has an independent, anti Hollywood feel to it, and it's all the better the more it feels this way. A highly worthwhile, pleasant surprise, that will restore your faith in creating genuine tension and emotion. ****"}, {"id": 424, "text": "Last seen on the big screen in 2016's so-so Oliver Stone picture Snowden, its been quite some time since we've last seen the ever likable Joseph Gordon-Levitt on screen.One of the most consistent and relatable actors working today, Levitt is always a solid presence, whether his front and centre or part of an ensemble, so any chance we get to see the actor ply his trade in a leading role is a good occasion for cinema fans.Returning to the film world after spending some time away with family, Levitt has given debut feature director Patrick Vollrath a solid foundation on which to build his airplane cockpit set thriller in, but this tension building exercise never gets off the runway as we instead rely solely on Levitt to help get us through.Playing 30 year old co-pilot Tobias Ellis, Levitt is given little backstory or material to work with as Ellis finds himself battling a group of violent terrorists who have stormed his plane and thrown his seemingly care-free route into disarray as the terrorists try to fight their way into the planes control room and enact out their devious deeds.A unique set-piece if not a unique set-up, 7500 fails to wrangle the tension or energetic direction needed to make such an isolated and confined story work as Ellis battles the various terrorists operating in his aircraft and try's to defuse the situation whilst managing to still fly the plane.Films such as Buried, The Guilty or Phone Booth, which all share similar DNA to Vollrath's Amazon distributed thriller all manage to use their small-scale locales or situations to build white knuckle tension or deliver shocking twists and turns but 7500 never does that, it plays a relatively straight bat and never deviates from a fairly predictable course that it sets out upon from very early on.It's a shame, as Levitt's solid work alongside a gripping script and unpredictable directing could've made 7500 a thrilling delight thousands of feet up in the air, but it remains grounded throughout, unable to take to the skies.Final Say -Joseph Gordon-Levitt tries his hardest with the little he has to work with but 7500 is a mostly thrill-free affair that is about as exciting as an airplane dinner.2 pieces of glass out of 5"}, {"id": 425, "text": "I hope all planes have a cockpit door that's as entry-proof as the one in this movie...the bad guys tried everything but a bazooka to get in there, but all to no avail. The only suggestion I have is for the airlines to consider adding an additional security feature or two: like a trap door that drops the would-be cockpit breachers straight through the bottom of the plane and into the atmosphere...and if that's not feasible (I guess the other passengers might object to being sucked out of the plane along WITH the bad guys), then how about some Indiana Jones/Raiders of the Lost Ark type of deterrents, that the pilots or outside crew can trigger, that shoot poison darts or taser-type electrical barbs into the high jackers? And while we're spitballing here, how about just cutting to the chase and making it standard airline policy to issue each passenger a fully-charged taser as they board? That, along with keeping an ample supply of handcuffs onboard, should put a quick end to anyone misguided enough to attempt to harm a plane full of innocent people! And as a side benefit, passengers would now have a proper, measured response to fellow travelers who irritate them by hogging armrests, reclining their seats to obnoxious degrees, or (personal pet peeve, here) ordering smelly fish during mealtimes...viola, problem solved!Oh, and the movie was pretty darn good, too.MFF/Hawaii 6-26-20"}, {"id": 426, "text": "This film hit Amazon last week and has a big star in Joseph Gordon-Levitt in it so I was interested, I have now watched 7500 and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees an American pilot forced to attempt to save his passengers lives when his plane is taken over by hijackers. Main Character As mentioned above Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the lead character and he is just fabulous here, this is easily one of the best performances I have seen all year. The guy is just a movie star and he just nails it here, you feel so much sympathy for him and he manages to make you care about him in literally every scene that he is in. He delivers a very powerful performance and he carries this movie and drags every little bit out of every scene that is possible. Supporting Characters There is one of the terrorists that Levitt has to connect with and for a young foreign actor I thought he did a decent job. He does shout a bit much, but the film does a good job with his character as you see he maybe isn't into the terrorism as his older partners and that makes it an interesting scenario. I mean there aren't too many other supporting characters here but they all do good jobs and add to the emotion for Levitt which means they manage to do their job well. Story The story is really thrilling for me, the fact that the film takes place in just a cockpit of a plane adds to the intrigue as it makes you feel very clostraphobic and like you are stuck in with Levitt. This feels like a very real scenario compared to something like the Liam Neeson film Non-Stop which has a similar premise which is absurd. It takes it's time and puts you in the shoes of Levitt and makes it a character piece in a really intense film. But I felt like this film could have done a bit better with the terrorists motivations as it isn't explored at all. Also the ending is quite abrupt, I get why it is like it but I could have maybe done one or two more scenes with Levitt to truly finish his story. Script The script is great, there is so much fantastic drama and intense scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. I also love the fact that when some characters are speaking German there are no subtitles so we don't understand them just like Gordon-Levitt, it puts you in his role and makes you as confused by certain aspects which was a fantastic choice. Also when the humour is used at the beginiing of the film it does a good job in building the rapport between Levitt and his colleagues. Style This is one of the reasons I feel like this film has been criticised, it is methodical and a slower pace. Do not expect this high octaine action film, expect a slower intense character study that will grip you. But this film is 90 mins long and honsestly I could have done with an extra 10 mins which could have fleshed it out a bit more and raising the overall quality. Overall Overall, this might be the sleeper hit of 2020 for me, other people might not enjoy this film but I was gripped throughout. If you are looking for an intense slighlty slower thriller then 7500 is a must watch."}, {"id": 427, "text": "I suspect that like most frequent flyers, I approached this with more than a little trepidation... Unfortunately, it is too far-fetched pretty much from the outset, and I soon stopped worrying about onboard security and started wondering if Joseph Gordon-Levitt was auditioning for the Samaritans! The plot revolves around some would-be hijackers who attempt to storm the cockpit of a flight bound for Paris. After a bit of a battle we find ourselves in a bit of a Mexican stand-off with JGL trying to do what he can to land his plane and stop the terrorists from killing the passengers. Luckily, one of their number isn't quite so keen on a dying just yet, and so there is a glimmer of hope should our heroic pilot manage to talk him round... The whole thing looks like it was filmed in a flight simulator; and though the star does try to hold it together, neither he nor the dialogue are particularly convincing - especially towards the latter parts of the film, where there just doesn't feel like there is any real sense of suspense. To be fair, I am not sure that too much more could have been done with this - the story was almost as boxed-in as the pilot, and I thought it struggled to make it to 90 minutes."}, {"id": 428, "text": "'7500' is a movie that gathers all necessary elements that are vital to the scenario, adds breathtaking performances by all the cast, especially Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, confines viewers' imagination to the claustrophobic space of the cockpit, dreadful emotions choking passengers and pilots alike while their guts are being turned upside down under the heavy stress of the situation.It's a movie that depicts the sadness and hopelessness of a hijacking in its raw emotional form without the need of a big budget and flashy screenplay.It's a movie that rely on realism from take off to emergency landing, awesomely developing and providing first hand accounts of the protagonists and antagonists involved.It's a movie that shows the painful yet vital task of the police force and SWAT team, needing to work hand in hand, be synchronized, all the while relying on psychological factors in maintaining the so hard negotiations. A very underestimated yet very important part of a negotiator's job, who often puts all the power of persuasion that he's got on the table.

It's completely relentless and will pound on you over and over and over until the movie ends.Having never been on a hijacked aircraft I can't speak of what it feels like, but my guess is it could be a lot like the tension in this film.That part works beautifully and is mastered close to perfection here.For the aviation-geeks; yes there are a few moments where you need to just go with the flow. But those moments are few and for the most part this is kept within sanity and reason.The actor-performances are all-around great and believable.The visuals are very good. Making flight-movies that look like actually flying is not easy, but this film pulls it off. No 'crappy' CGI is used and I'm guessing the director opted to avoid scenes that would be too difficult to get to look realistic (The; 'less is more' option) So no 'smart' outside scenes of flying aircraft or anything like that. For the entire movie we are 'along for the ride', onboard this hijacked aircraft, and get to experience the whole thing from 'within'.That raises the level of suspense really. Enhances the drama and makes the whole thing feel that much more 'in your face'.This movie is worth watching.Final note; had I been the pilot I would have dumped cabin-pressure and just let the hijackers pass out... and of course lost all the passengers at the same time too.

The performance from JGL was fantastic as expected as well, played the pilot really well. Clearly put in a lot of researchWhen I realised that the whole film is based from the pilots perspective I had mixed feelings, as it's great to see the hijacking side of things from behind the cockpit doors only, but I was concerned that there would be a lack of action due to the camera essentially being in the same room. But I think on the whole it worked out really well, kept me in suspense and was just a good story to watch. My only issue (not a major one) was that the ending was a little underwhelming. Obviously we all know the plane will land, but I dunno. Expected another 5 minutes or so after.But it's very good, a hidden gem that's sat on Amazon Prime definitely! Give it a watch."}, {"id": 431, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I'm a hardcore fan of one-location, claustrophobic thrillers. If the atmosphere is suspenseful and tense enough, it can elevate the film in unimaginable ways. I'm also easily entertained by movies set on a plane like Non-Stop or the classic Snakes on a Plane. 7500 spends pretty much its entire runtime inside the cockpit of a hijacked plane, going for a more realistic depiction of the point of view of the pilots. It combines two aspects that I deeply appreciate in film, making it a really captivating subgenre. However, is it any good?Story-wise, it doesn't truly create anything extraordinarily unique. Although I appreciate that it doesn't follow the over-the-top, absolutely crazy action sometimes displayed in this type of movies, which can be way too exaggerated, defying all laws of physics and reality. In this case, the viewer gets to see how things develop solely through the eyes of Tobias as well as his cockpit screen and audio. So, don't expect an action-packed flight because 7500 is far from that. It's a technically unusual take on a story told several times in many different ways.The best aspect of the film is the one I was looking forward to the most: the atmosphere. Patrick Vollrath, debutant writer-director, can generate enough tension and suspense to grab viewers for the first hour. Tobias finds himself with extremely challenging moral dilemmas, where there's no right answer, and all have severe consequences. Watching this part of the screenplay play out is the most exciting component of the movie, which is elevated by the fact that all occurs inside the claustrophobic cockpit.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has been away from the central spotlight since 2013's Don Jon, delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. He keeps the film flying by continuously acting the hell out of his script. Without his emotionally convincing display, 7500 would crash into a thousand pieces. Omid Memar is also really good as Vedat, even though I find him a bit over-the-top during a few dialogues. Everyone else is kind of dispensable, having in mind this is a protagonist-centered piece.Technically, as I wrote above, it's different from the ordinary hijacking flicks. Besides the exclusive cockpit POV, it plays out very close to real-time, meaning that even though the movie has the common editing cuts, it feels like the ninety minutes are indeed ninety minutes. There aren't any long takes that I noticed, but the editing (Hansj\u00f6rg Wei\u00dfbrich) is so seamless that it creates a real-time environment, which helps to give the film a quite realistic vibe. Despite all of these qualities, 7500 struggles to stay above ground.The pilot's POV isn't captivating enough for a feature movie, at least not in the way 7500 tries to do. For a film focused mainly on the titular character, the latter lacks depth. Tobias's backstory is as generic as it could be, which doesn't help me care that much about him. The narrative follows a formulaic, predictable path that packs a couple of supposedly shocking moments, but these are so foreseen from the get-go that they lose some of the impact. It's a premise that allows for some nerve-wracking suspense, but overall the screenplay lacks a more profound exploration.In addition to this, the Islamic terrorists stereotype deeply hurts Patrick Vollrath's intent. It's been 19 years since 9/11. There's no need to make the hijackers constantly yell Allahu Akbar. The biggest sin of 7500 isn't the lack of character development, but their superficial, stereotypical representation (not only the hijackers). Hopefully, it won't get online backlash because it's far from being a bad movie...All in all, 7500 needs an impressive Joseph Gordon-Levitt to keep its cruising altitude, but it still goes through too much turbulence. Debutant writer-director Patrick Vollrath delivers an unusual take on the subgenre, by depicting the hijack of a plane exclusively through the pilot's POV. The claustrophobic, suspenseful, tense atmosphere of the cockpit allows for some genuinely nail-biting scenes, but its lack of character depth diminishes the otherwise emotionally compelling moral dilemmas the protagonist has to deal with. Despite the excellent technical effort, the narrative still falls into a predictable path, possessing the conventional plot points, which reduce the level of interest. The Islamic terrorists stereotype deeply hurts the film since there's no need to make the hijackers belong to that religion for the hundredth time. I might recommend it to anyone who's looking for an airplane thriller. Just don't expect a brilliant execution.Rating: C"}, {"id": 432, "text": "I went into 7500 with low expectations as an experienced airline pilot with over 15 years flying the particular aircraft featured in this film. I find most aviation movies are over sensationalized or somehow miss the mark. Even Sully, which is by all accounts a good film, doesn't replicate the flying experience despite its technical accuracies. 7500, however, is able to reproduce the atmosphere of the working environment of an airline crew. From the dialogue with ground staff to the perfectly engineered sound effects, the setting almost made me able to smell and feel the airbus 320. Furthermore, in the lead up to the drama, the director somehow was able to capture the pace of the day and portray life as an operating Pilot.Once the drama unfolds, I can't attest to the realism. But it does play out harrowing questions I've asked myself when I allow my thoughts to ponder terrible hypotheticals from time to time.Through the film, despite being set in my native setting ,I was reminded of the claustrophobic tension I only felt while watching Buried. The combination of these two factors meant this film left me profoundly impacted and thinking about it for days.Perhaps the drama plays out too long and the realism does loosen slightly as the pilot prepares to land, but don't let this detract from the masterful portrayal of modern civil aviation. This is a must watch for aspiring pilots."}, {"id": 433, "text": "7500, without a doubt, offers an action-packed story which will leave you tensed without disappointment. Throughout the film, Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a stunning performance and illustrates the character of airline pilot Tobias Ellis exceptionally well. Furthermore, the performance of Omid Memar who performed as Vedat executed an influential role of a troubled boy who demonstrated strong emotions and unquestionably kept the mind wondering throughout the film.Moreover, the framework of the film was fantastically set out and even still with it set just in an aircraft, it supplied a chilling atmosphere which left you suspecting what happens next. Additionally, the story itself is well formulated, though in some scenes it drags along too much, yet, more action could have been implemented where possible.Overall, the film was great and had well-built up scenes throughout. Yet, the ending was frustrating and could have provided a more in-depth understanding of what happened afterwards. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this film to anyone because it is positively a surpassing film."}, {"id": 434, "text": "I have a soft spot for films which are set in mostly one location, as well as films which put the characters in a dangerous situations. 7500 blends both of these elements together, and managed to create a hyper-realistic film.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of the most underrated actors of this generation, and he was terrific in this film. He managed to pull of all of the emotional scenes, and we believed the terror that the character was in because of how phenomenal Levitt's performance was.7500 was an extremely tense film, and, like I said, extremely realistic. It takes the same premise as a film like Non-Stop, and portrays it in a way which we could actually believe would happen. Whilst I appreciated this about the film, it also meant that the narrative wasn't as entertaining as it could have been.I also liked the fact that it all took place in the cockpit of the plane, because it really gave the film a claustrophobic feel. There are some moral questions which Levitt's character has to answer, and I enjoyed the way it was presented because it's asking the audience what they would do in his situation.It sounds like I am praising 7500 too much for the score I am going to give it, but it's just not as entertaining as I would have liked. The film is exceptionally well made, with tense scenes, slick direction, and a few emotional moments which worked, but it's also a film I will probably never rewatch.I like films of this genre to have a bit more entertainment value, but I appreciate the craft that went into it. Overall, 7500 was a decent one-time watch, and a recommendation from me.SCORE: 68%"}, {"id": 435, "text": "I'm not sure if there is an IQ table of Hollywood stars, but I would reckon if there is then Joseph Gordon-Levitt would rate pretty highly. Whenever I see him interviewed he comes across as a highly articulate and intelligent bloke. And that intelligence filters through into his choices of movie role. If you look back at his filmography on IMDB the first thing you notice is that his output is pretty sparse and selective, and the next is that the projects he's done mostly deliver a pretty strong hit rate: 500 Days of Summer; Inception, Looper, The Dark Knight Rises; Don Jon.... the list is impressive.Here he stars (and really stars) in a small German film. It only had a $5 million budget and in some ways it shows: the speaking cast totals about a dozen; the single location used is the cockpit (an Airbus A320 simulator somewhere? Or a set? The production design is so good, it's difficult to tell) ; and the score is so minimalistic (a solo piano piece over the end titles) that it doesn't even merit an IMDB music credit!But in many ways this is a case of 'small is beautiful'. For this is an extremely tense and claustrophobic action picture.The Plot: German Captain Michael Lutzmann (Carlo Kitzlinger) and American Co-pilot Tobias Ellis (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are about to pilot an Airbus A320 on a routine flight from Berlin to Paris. By coincidence, also on the flight is Tobias's partner and mother of his son, stewardess G\u00f6kce (Aylin Tezel). Shortly into the flight, three terrorists - Kenan (Murathan Muslu), Daniel (Paul Wollin) and youngster Vedat (Omid Memar) - take over the aircraft. Tobias issues a 7500 (hijack in progress) code. All that is protecting the injured pilots and the security of the 80 people on the flight is the cockpit door.The film starts slowly, building atmosphere through the pre-flight chit-chat between the pilots and a leisurely take-off. I loved this development of character by Oscar-nominated shorts director Patrick Vollrath. But when the action starts, it starts with a bang and continues in truly tense and visceral style. There's a sense of creeping dread when you realise the terrorist's use of hostages to get the door open, and of who the hostages might be.I note that one of the thanks for the film was director Paul Greengrass, who of course made the outstanding 9/11-themed United 93 back in 2006. It would be fascinating to understand whether this was a thank-you for the inspiration the classic film gave Vollrath, or if there was some practical consultancy undertaken there.Star of the show here is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who delivers a peerless performance as the pilot under extreme stress. Veering cyclically through terror, emotional breakdown and calm 'training-kicking-in' modes, it's a performance that is almost Oscar nomination-worthy in my book. He's on screen for virtually every shot of the film, and really earned his fee here. He makes for a very believable pilot.I've read other comment that says the terrorists are rather 2-dimensional in their attempts to do a 9/11. And to a degree I agree. A nice angle though is the relationship that develops between Tobias and young Vedat in the second half of the movie. There's a 'Stockholm Syndrome' vibe going on here, but this never quite gets resolved satisfactorily.As such, unfortunately this 'back 9' never really quite lived up to the promise of the first 45 minutes for me. And as a single-location story that had nowhere else to go, the abrupt ending will not be to the liking of some I'm sure.Not to be confused with the 2014 horror Flight 7500, this is for once a B-movie that's real nail-biter. The movie doesn't pull its punches, and although there is little of the more graphic violence actually shown, the mind can fill in the gaps effectively which makes for some upsetting moments. Although it never quite lives up to its early promise at only 93 minutes it is strongly deserving of your attention. The movie is available for viewing via Amazon-Prime.(For the full graphical review please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

Here are my thoughts.7500 is a thriller about a plane flying from Berlin to Paris that gets hijacked by some Islamist terrorists. If you haven't rolled your eyes already, then you should be good watching this.Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the young co-pilot on the flight who has to fight the hijackers and get the passengers to safety. The film is directed by Patrick Vollrath who co-wrote the script with Senad Halilbasic. As you can tell by the short synopsis, the script isn't very important. This film is all mood and tension. It does that really well. When characters are actually talking, it is more cliched and less successful. Gordon-Levitt acts out panic well and he summons that adrenaline-fueled bravery that is needed in this situation. Since he spends most of the screen time alone, his ability to convey a sense of dread is important. It is impossible not to feel that.This setting in 7500 helps keep the tension high. The majority of the film takes place in the cockpit. Gordon-Levitt's character can only see what's happening in the rest of the plane from the security camera in the cockpit. The helplessness adds to that sense of dread. The good editing and the runtime of 7500 being less than 90 minutes makes it feel even more urgent. Realistically though, why was this movie about Islamist terrorists hijacking a plane being made and released now? It feels like it is 10 years or so late, and the story of the hijacker and the hijacked has not evolved any sense even those same movies from the 1990's. 7500 doesn't bring anything new to this story.If you have less than 90 minutes to spend, 7500 isn't a bad way to spend it. It is very tense and it flies by in a clip. There is nothing new about the story, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt give a good performance. A handful of popcorn will do."}, {"id": 437, "text": "7500 Review For the first half I was sitting on the edge of my seat; a great thriller. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great as the co-pilot as was the age 18 terrorist (Omid Memar). I was so caught up in its anxiety, at times I had to walk away and not watch the screen while listening. Like all good thrillers, I found myself screaming at the characters on the screen, Don't open the door, Don't talk to them, Turn off the camera, Stop crying, Pay attention to the other guy! as the action ensued. As things became totally out-of-hand for the co-pilot, I was beginning to feel like C-3PO; doomed. There came the time, however, that I started screaming at the terrorist, Don't do it, don't do it! as the obvious ending approached. Instead of looking at this as a script weakness, I found that the director did an excellent job making the audience feel that they were actually in the cockpit and taking on the lives of the two antagonistic characters. I don't think any adult, much less young adult, would exercise common sense when under that kind of internal, external, religious, and family pressure. The script did call for the co-pilot to calm the terrorist through some personal sharing but stopped short of helping him see there was another way out. You have to pay close attention but this movie showed us all we needed to see, despite the sudden but expected ending."}], "reviews_amount": 438}
