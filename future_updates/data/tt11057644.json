It's total hokum, with some of the worst acting, scripting and direction I've seen in a long time. And possibly the lamest bad guy any movie has ever had. Ever. Seriously, he's completely pointless. And everything else... well you get the idea."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Really liked the original but struggled through this one."}, {"id": 3, "text": "II thought it was worth watching.

The Christmas Chronicles 2 fails on every level."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I think people are thinking too much into the first film. This is a great family Christmas film. Kurt Russel has done it again with playing an outstanding role of Santa Claus."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Even children would be hard pressed to find this entertaining. It is inane. The children in this movie are not at all endearing, just annoying. The plot is ridiculous and the writing terrible. But I will say this, it is right in line with the year 2020."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I thought this was a great return to the world of Santa Claus, and a pleasure to see more behind the story of Santa.

The second however !!! Painful Lack of imagination, poor storyline leaves you falling asleep. Every Xmas I'd watch the first one happily, the second once is enough. Never to be viewed again"}, {"id": 12, "text": "This is so bad I doubt it will ever become 'so bad it's good '. From less than 5 minutes in it was obvious this was a desperate rush job. The script was appalling, drawing from every Hallmark moralising trope. The story made no sense and rewrote the origin story of Santa only getting the Turkey part right. The new characters, omg could they have found actors less wooden. At some points it felt they were reading the script as if it were the first time they'd seen it. Falling asleep midway means you miss nothing but the end is just torture."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Plot is boring and predictable, acting is bad.

The acting is really bad, the kids are highly annoying and the whole setting doesn't even have that Christmasy feel. The plot is also very very bad. It just doesn't have that vibe. I rather watch Home alone for the 20th time than putting up with this junk. I did like the first one so I had high hopes.

It was corny!"}, {"id": 17, "text": "I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the first one. I couldn't wait to see the 2nd one when I heard it came out. It was absolutely painful to watch from the very first minute. I would give it a -3 if I could. It's almost like a bunch of toddlers wrote down ideas and put them in a hat to be picked for each scene."}, {"id": 18, "text": "If you loved the first film and are of a stable mind then I'm pretty sure after watching 20 mins of this garbage, you're gonna wanna watch 'A Serbian Film' on a constant loop just to get the visions wiped from your mind. Kurt Russell nails it again.....but even Santa can't eclipse the awful story and bad.....oh so so bad acting from the other players in this film. So you're better off dunking your gonads in a blender....and putting that bad boy on 'LUDICROUS SPEED'. Your choice."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Christmas Chronicles 1 was an instant classic, The 2nd one was a serious train wreck! The start of it was already off cue but I kept an open mind about where it would go, after about 20 min I caught myself thinking about other things, by about 40min I was completely bored with it, we watched it as a family and by the 1st hour our entire family was showing signs of disinterest. We are at 1hr:32min with 23 min remaining and I don't think this is going to get finished.They introduced wayyy to many new elements, concepts and stories for the viewer to be able to follow. They tried way to hard to be politically correct. The production is good, set design is good but everything else fails. I don't think we will ever re-watch this again."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I loved the first Christmas Chronicles. This second may be the worst movie ever Horrible writing, horrible dircting. Oh goodness, this is awful. Netflix should pay me for watching this train wreck."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Teddy made way for Julian Dennison (this kid plays himself), Tyrese (what is he doing in this movie?), and Tyrese's kid. The story was very thin, the movie lacked the Christmas spirit of part 1, the writing/dialogues were cringing. Kurt Russell was not near as good as the first movie."}, {"id": 22, "text": "I really didn't believe Christmas Chronicles Part 2 was a good idea since the first one was already so good. It turns out this sequel is almost as good as the first one but just in different ways. Although it was literally all over the place, I have to say I like it. The airport scene was everything. In my honest opinion, Christmas Chronicles has culminated into something really magical! Did anyone have tears as I did lol? I will watch it again as we approach Christmas."}, {"id": 23, "text": "About 40 minutes into the movie, after already asking to turn it off once (I asked her to give it a chance, having high hopes it would improve after how great the first was), turns to us and says, I feel like this is just a bad movie...can we shut it off now?"}, {"id": 24, "text": "After the first one I expected this to be a good fun Christmas movie,how wrong I was. Terrible acting and shocking story line. I thought Jingle Jangle was bad. I'll stick to Home Alone 1+2."}, {"id": 25, "text": "If you enjoyed the rhythm, jokes and overall excellent delivery of TCC, well, get ready to be disappointed. The feel and rhythm are simply gone. Instead, a ridiculous and laborious story (yes, even for a Xmas flick) that never make sense, and never bring an once of satisfaction. Heavy special effects makes it close to Trolls sometimes... The singing scene in the airport would be great for a tv ad. Huge fail, and beloved Kurt Russel cannot save the movie. 2 out of 10."}, {"id": 26, "text": "I am not even sure what I just watched. I loved the first movie and have been waiting for this one to come out. It was terrible. The acting was garbage, Teddy was only in it for 2 seconds, villain plot was lame. He barely had to redeem himself in the end and it was like nothing happened, all was forgiven.Then it felt like a mix if Gremlins and Back to the Future concepts tossed in. So strange. I would have rather they did the whole movie back in time with the dad. It would have tied in more with the first movie.The first movie gave you that magic of Christmas, waiting for santa vibe. This was just a mess."}, {"id": 27, "text": "I loved the first one, but this is a terrible follow up. This is weird and bad."}, {"id": 28, "text": "I was so excited to watch this with my daughter because the first one was really cute.. except the troll elves ruined both movies, in our opinion. But the first one still had the feel good vibes of a Christmas movie.. this thing was just a jumbled mess of poor acting and scattered plot lines. I actually fell asleep throughout parts. I watch a lot of poorly acted cheesy Christmas movies on the hallmark channel and even the worst ones were mikes better than this waste of time. So so disappointed. A fine example of choosing to make money over making a quality movie. Bah Humbug"}, {"id": 29, "text": "Ashtonishingly bad. The first movie even seems fine conpared to this one. I knew right away it would be a long two hours when the movie was introdused with the villain bitterly talking to himself. The plot us unsalvageable and gets worse by the minute. Dont even get me started on the acting: terrible. Especially mrs. Claus, and the two kids are just annoying. Dont watch it, unless you drink everytime you see bad acting. Then it might be watchable, but you wont be able to remember it the next day, which is probably for the best. Lastly the random music act: just no."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Such a disappointment, especially after the first one. What was with using Julian Dennison.

The story is garbage, the actors don't seem to care. The cgi is awful, and the ending,......well if you don't want to switch it off cringing there's no hope for you. Had such high hopes but it seems Netflix wanted a sequal but didn't really want to pay for it. The singing part was gratuitous and nowhere near as well thought out as the original. I hope there isn't another"}, {"id": 34, "text": "If you liked the first one, do yourself a favour and watch it again; this new on is strictly for kids, and a pc correct audience.

We get Mrs Santa Claus as well, which didn't help at all. Script is paper thin. Kurt Russell was a shadow of himself compared to the first movie.

I couldn't put my finger on what exactly they were going for."}, {"id": 54, "text": "After watching the original, a couple years ago, I was pretty anxious to sit down with my wife and kids to watch this one. It was so disappointing. It felt like it was pushing for more of a younger viewing audience, but at the same time it had a very dark feel, including a very strange and out of place witchcraft moment. There were some extremely corny scenes, terrible acting, and a Santa sing scene that was so cheesy that my nachos were jealous."}, {"id": 55, "text": "There was so much wrong with this movie. Just terrible on so many fronts. I'm trying to think of a bigger train wreck of a Christmas movie and can't come up with one. Do yourself a favor...just rewatch the original and enjoy yourself!"}, {"id": 56, "text": "The first film was fun to watch. I really enjoyed it when I didn't actually expect much from it. This time around it was just painful. The story is boring, the acting is really bad, the fat evil elf was cringey. I don't have anything nice to say about this stinky movie, save for the fact that I really like Kurt Russell and it was nice to see Goldie sharing the screen with him again. Other than that, this film is not worth your time. You're better off watching the first film again and forgetting that this one even exists."}, {"id": 57, "text": "When I saw that Chris Columbus, the producer of the first Christmas Chronicles, decided to take the director's chair for this huge, steaming pile of #2, it explained everything. I can just imagine him saying, The first one was so successful, probably because I'm so awesome. Clearly I can give the world an amazing #2. How hard can writing and directing be, anyway? Let me just sit down and push this #2 out in 20 minutes.The only reason I give it even three stars is because Kurt Russell does an amazing job as Santa yet again. Also the production value is pretty good for a Netflix film, which I guess is to be expected when a producer decides (demands?) to also write and direct.Before I continue, let me first admit I fell asleep for the middle half of this. It was that good. Now let me also say, I am confident I didn't miss anything substantive.Now to the nitty-gritty:The plot: contrived and nonsensical. Why do so many Christmas movies have to save Christmas at such an absurd scale? The first film was fun because the kids got to help save Christmas, though Santa was never really in trouble and was working instead to save the kids. This also could've been a story of redemption, but instead it was just an opportunity to shoot scenes from Gremlins 3: Attack on Mrs. Claus's Village. No, and just ... no. And these were just the problems with the plot I was awake for.The acting: cringeworthy to straight-up awful, with the exception of Kurt Russell. Darby Camp is as meh as she was in the first. Many of us were excited to see Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus. I think we all assumed she'd be great as a foil to Santa. Columbus must've assumed she'd be great also, and therefore gave her absolutely no direction. Was he afraid to l challenge Goldie to actually act instead of reading her lines from a cue card in a disinterested, monotone voice? For the villain, did Columbus simply tell Julian Dennison to pretend he was still Firefist in Deadpool 2? Was it Columbus's vision for everyone to be one dimensional and uninteresting?Production values: beautiful yet incongruous. Beautiful sets in pretty good CGI do not a worthwhile film make. Most of the fun of the first one was that it was set in the streets of Chicago. Everyone can relate to that. This one seems to need to invent more nonsensical folklore about the North Pole just to prove that it can be done in CGI. No thanks. Nothing about this production pulled me into the story.The wrap-up: my whole family enjoyed the first one enough that we were excited for this one. In fact the first one is on our annual list. Chris Columbus's hubris sent this #2 down the toilet and we cannot forget it's stench quickly enough."}, {"id": 58, "text": "Was so looking forward to CC2 i found it had too much technical magic located in one place would have preferred more of Cancun.has an irritating Elf/boy who was played by a New Zealand actor why ? Also found the new man in the mothers life was jumping on the PC bandwagon if you ask me best part was the airport scene and the girl meeting her dad as a boy CC1 i can watch over &amp; over CC2 wont watch again ..Kirt Russell as Sabta is Brilliant."}, {"id": 59, "text": "I loved the first one and have literally watched it a few dozen times. Last year I could practically recite it, my kids loved it so much. And my husband and I genuinely enjoyed watching it. This one, though. Painful to make it through. My kids barely could stay focused once the popcorn was gone."}, {"id": 60, "text": "Kurt Russell was the best Santa ever in the first movie - so let's ditch that. The siblings were a good team, realistic and loveable - so let's replace the brother with a Herkel. The plot was fast-moving and brought the trio into contact with Iots of funny but believable characters and situations - we need to avoid that at all costs. The first movie was about the magic of Christmas and the joy of believing - we need more of a History Channel / NPR vibe this time. And a plot worked well last time - so let's wing it without any writers this time.Mission accomplished! A scary, dull, anxiety-ridden, incomprehensible Christmas tale for the children who survived 2020. In a horrible, miserable, awful way this is just the movie for this year."}, {"id": 61, "text": "The first one was a combination road trip / fish out of water / adventure story. Santa's encounters in our world with people who don't believe in him were comical, the two siblings struggling to find common ground and come to grips with the tragedy in their lives... it was a great story. This one goes the route of introducing a villain. A bland villain with no real motivation. Most of the story takes place in a CGI North Pole. The sibling connection is gone as the older brother is swapped out for a new kid with no back story or personality to engage us. There are a few sight gags. The most entertainment you'll have here though is identifying which plot elements are lifted from better movies."}, {"id": 62, "text": "My cringe is cringing after watching this movie. I want to remove my eyes and throw them at the fireplace. So many wrong messages given through the storyline, terrible acting, extremely boring plot. First film was fine though."}, {"id": 63, "text": "The acting was so BAD, It was painful to sit through the first 30 min. Goldie Hawn was bad as was the Children. The plot was , well, im not even sure of what the plot was. and lets not forget, it's 2020, so lets not forget we have to make it a race thing as well. i turned it off after 40 min. don't waste your time with this train wreck"}, {"id": 64, "text": "While Hawn and Russell are clearly having a blast, the XMAS SCRIPT FROM HELL offers a really creepy elf (with what seems an Australian accent?) but no X-Mas spirit whatsoever. Another franchise down the drain as the creators completely lose touch with what made it work in the first place."}, {"id": 65, "text": "Not impressed. The acting is marginal, the special effects are blah and the story is ill conceived. Don't waste your time."}, {"id": 66, "text": "Why did this even get made? There's nothing in the form of spirit or artistry offered here! The story is flourishing with creativity in places that is just held back by such a lack of thought or interest with how to bring this to life in any memorable fashion. You wouldn't believe how senseless such a route narrative becomes, but these people found a way.The production might top a Disney live action venture for how hideously clinical it is. CG is grooooosssss, nothing is real. I'm sure when they're not behind or in front of green screen it's all on some sound stage. And the cast might as well all be manikins, seriously Goldie has the same expression the whole time."}, {"id": 67, "text": "I absolutely loved this movie. It captures the feel of Christmas and family. It made me feel good and that's what I like about movies."}, {"id": 68, "text": "Let's face it, it's hard to come up with a whole concept of a story for Christmas while still keeping the traditional Christmas magic in the story, but this show manages to excel at it. It's warm, funny, and filled with charming characters. watching it made me feel like first time we watched Polar Express."}, {"id": 69, "text": "Just enjoy it people, there where just a few new movies this year and most of them are at best good.I really like TCC 1 and I like the sequel even more.

I absolutely loved this movie. It filled me with Christmas spirit and transported me back to what it feels like to fully believe in Santa.

Don't get me wrong, Kurt and Goldie are fine (look like they're having fun with it), but there are just way too many campy moments in the dialogue.The story needed major overhauling and a drastic reduction in the amount of CGI.

Above all there is very nicely presented the theme of a change/transformation which teaches you a lot about feelings and yes, indeed about the spirit of Christmas!

Number 2 wasn't a family movie, but completely aimed at very young children. Kurt Russell is a brilliant Santa, hence the 2 points. But Goldie is just wooden in this and constantly talking like a teacher does to kindergarten children. The villain has a strange accent that simply doesn't make him natural for the part. It's definitely not a film for all ages like the original was and it's a shame as the original was very good.

Me and my wife both really enjoyed the first one and were excited to watch the 2nd one the next night and both struggled to make it all the way thru. Our 3 year old and 6 year old boys both love the 2nd one but I honestly find it unwatchable, and won't ever make a point to watch it again! Truly find it hard to believe this was approved for production, it's almost like someone was forced to put a part 2 out on a moments notice.

Probably the most cringing scene was the conversation between Santa, Mrs Claus, and the 2 children regarding Santa's village. Santa states he found the location, the Elves built everything and that Mrs Claus decorated a few of the shops. Suddenly the forced inclusion children ask If Mrs Claus decorated shops why isn't is called Mrs Claus' Village? and from then on it's referred to as just that. Since the Elves built everything why isn't it known as the Elves Christmas village? Santa has turned in to a moron that can't think for himself because he's a man!

I loved his eccentric elves! It wasn't just some meaningless, sugary movie. It dealt with loss, acceptance, selflessness and faith/hope/belief. Christmas Chronicles 2 has none of the above. No depth. No fun. No chemistry between the returning or new cast. Even the always charismatic Tyrese seemed off. The kids don't talk like real kids, as they serve up misplaced talking points. Santa Claus gets a shallow backstory, which really serves as a lazy backstory for the villain. The actor playing the villain ruined Deadpool 2 for me, and he was equally bad here. He's one-dimensional and can't act. As for the Northpole, Mrs. Klaus is the brains behind the operation, we're told and retold. If I took a shot every time Mrs. Claus was mentioned, I'd have a nice buzz going. 40 minutes into the movie, I called it quits."}, {"id": 105, "text": "He was a very annoying character.

This has nothing to do with the first one, which had adventure, comedy and a strong message about believing, and tradition. In this one the predictable plot about and elf gone rogue is supposed to be the center of the story, but also the cliched rebel teen girl, and the cowardly kid that finds the inner courage he always had. It is very hard to balance all plot points so the movie tumbles as a result. Then add on top that Santa's village should be renamed Mrs Santa's village, all the deers are now female (with male horns, mind you, maybe they are trans) and the little actor representing the black community is terrible and you'll see why the bad reviews.

This follow-up introduces additional characters including the quite engaging Jahzir Bruno (who is quite decent with a pump-action pop gun) as Jack; Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn - who has a mean way of getting kids to eat their greens) and a rather annoying Julian Dennison as the rogue elf Belsnickel who is intent on taking over Santa's toy making world. I hate puppets in films, by and large and at times this reminded me of Gremlins (1984) with a few Ewoks thrown in for good measure, and the tempo is a little more sinister as some of these elves are a just a bit too scheming. Kurt Russell is still having a ball, though and his energy and mischievous spirit keeps the role alive. The last twenty minutes give a little more for the adults watching to get into (there's even a fun sleigh duel with a nod to Spartacus (1960)) but I found the other characterisations to be a bit twee, flat even and the plot has a rather more derivative inevitability about it.

What parent does that!? That is neglectful at best. If they wanted to spend time with each other, they could have left the kids at home where they know their way around.The one thing I don't get: why the heck are two widowed parents leaving their underaged children unattended while they go to the ruins alone for a full day!? It's way worse than the first one in the sense the first one didn't have the parents neglect their children by leaving them alone in a completely different country! I mean at least in the first movie, the mom was working and the kids were homeSecond, Teddy made the first movie memorable. The character development of Teddy in the first movie made it magical. Then this movie ditches him and portrays him as I'm going to ditch you guys and talk to girls and that was it.The character development in this story was poor to say the least. The bad guy didn't have much going for him in the regards of why he actually turned evil or cursed. Kate was annoying. She turned into a snobby teenager and didn't have any character development besides meeting her father when he was a kid then magically became better to everyone. Yes it was the whole saying goodbye to dad thing but really how she acted was not ok from the beginning and Santa treated it as well she's a true believer and didn't even talk about how bad her attitude was towards her mom's boyfriend or his kid. It was wrong. The boy didn't have much going for him, he was the scaredy cat boy that instantly became the hero that didn't worry about anything with little to no effort. The courage cookie wasn't really needed because that was too much of a cliche used in every form of media.The scene with Doug was too cliche too. If Doug could see a true believer because his family is full of them, then why did it take his daughter so long in the first movie to realize she was a true believer? And how could he just tell from a sad looking girl that she was a true believer? It just was too predictable and forced in a way.The singing scene was ok for the first minute but then dragged on too long and no one questioned it, not Kate or Doug or anyone elseThe elves got annoying. fast. Unlike the first movie, this one was like 99.5% elves and even in the first one the elves were cute but annoying but this movie... was mostly annoyingI did appreciate the attention to detail though, like how the TV stations were in elvish and things like that.The movie's story was good, but there was just a disconnect from the first movie's magic. Most sequels have that issue and I really hope they take into consideration the positive feedback and the negative feedback (not hate) people are giving them if they ever plan to make a third movie. Make the magical development of the first movie instead of fancy effects. That's what made the first one so magical.Though an elf trying to destroy Christmas was something I never seen before, so originality is on their side, but just not the magic or wholesomeness from the first movie."}, {"id": 110, "text": "The Christmas Chronicles 2 is a sequel to the 2018 film The Christmas Chronicles featuring Kurt Russell as Santa Claus.

And why does he speak English with a kiwi accent when all the other elves just speak Elvish? I get it that the real Belsnickel would have been super creepy and not family friendly. I'm just so confused that they used that name. That aside, while the movie was obviously centered around Christmas and Santa lore, I forgot a few times that it was a Christmas movie or had anything to do with the first movie. It was just strange.

Girls need to learn to be good and be lovely/loving, but boys need to be brave and heroic and fight in battles with toy guns? Feels like this film sponsored by the military!-Get em young! Christmas is apparently all about mass producing presents (and fighting brave battles) rather than the focusing on the Christmas values which are scattered in coarsely for good measure.

Teddy is leaving with his girlfriend to go snorkeling, the parents are leaving for Tulum for a night and leave the young kids at a kidsclub (wth?!).

And despite what some others say, everyone in the cast did a really good job with this one. Kurt and Goldie are always great. Darby Camp is a gem! Production values were excellent.For me, the problem was the story. It completely lost the feel of the first movie. I know, I know -- It wasn't supposed to BE the first movie! I get it. But when you watch a sequel, you do it because you loved the elements that made the original what it was. You want that feeling again. And that feeling is nowhere to be found in this one, sad to say.This one just went way too dark for me. I don't care there was an interracial couple. It never occurred to me to be bothered by that. But the first movie had a sense of the believable to it. Most of it took place in my world, not Santa's. I connected with it. It resonated. It had adventure, humor and wonder. A sense of amazement. But it was amazement at something amazing that had entered into our common little world.This movie takes that away. It takes us into an imaginary world, which is amazing for the characters, but not so much for us. I want to see how Santa negotiates the world I live in -- not how people negotiate the world Santa lives in.Fierce giants cats attacking people and reindeer? Elves going insane and attacking each other and everyone else? An evil enemy bent on Santa's destruction? There was nothing like any of that in the original movie, only people who didn't believe in Santa.Tell a new story. That's fine. But do it with the feel and texture of the first story you told.

That's not a bad thing, but as just about every review I've read for the movie here on IMDb has stated, it takes a back seat to the prior film. The story reunites Santa (Kurt Russell) with his young protagonist Kate Pierce (Darby Camp), but for some reason leaves her brother Teddy (Judah Lewis) on the sidelines for this adventure. Well, we know why the film makers did that but it just smacks of pushing an agenda. Fortunately, Kurt Russell is still in fine form as Santa Claus, with the movie delving a little into his back story starting out as St. Nicholas. I would have been disappointed if he didn't get an opportunity to sing in this one, although it would have taken a lot to top the Christmas Time Pretty Baby number from the first picture. The Spirit of Christmas tune didn't have the same punch here but on it's own was pretty good. This story had a villain by way of an elf who turned human when he broke the elves code hundreds of years ago. With the help of a wildcat named Jola and the scoundrel elf Speck, Belsnickel (Julian Dennison) wreaks some havoc before finally getting imbued with the Christmas spirit, courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn). When it was all over, he got his wish and turned back into an elf again, but to my mind, that had to be a dubious honor."}, {"id": 192, "text": "Obviously not as good as the first.

The elves were great to see again, but weren't as fun as last time.In the original CC, Teddy and Kate were the main characters. This time, Kate goes it alone with her potentially future step-brother, not even including Teddy on the adventure.I struggled to stay awake at times, and you might, too.

The little heroes, Kate and Jack, are played by Darby Camp and Jahzir Bruno. Jahzir was a natural. His performance was least contrived and a sure bet to delight the young viewers. Although the first Chronicles appealed to a wider audience, this film is particularly suited to the point of view of a much younger viewer. The most notable difference from CC1 is the attention to detail in the creation of a fantasy world. There are so many homages to children's classics: E.T., Star Wars, the Grinch, even Diego from Ice Age, a feminist's statement for the egos of little girls, and many more. I enjoyed trying to spot them. The other characters, Mrs. Claus and Santa, embraced their characters with relish (that's my homage to Grease). Goldie's midas touch was perfect as only she can do. Kurt's Santa hit all the right notes. Unlike Whoville, Santa's Workshop was pretty well dominated by CGI. But how else could the Aurora Borealis come to life? The kids are going to love this! I did.

His acting was awful. The middle of the film song was good fun as Kurt got to sing with the legendary Darlene Love.Topped off with a few laughably forced indentity politics lines to hack away at the great original film, this is the sort of film you stream on Christmas Day while the whole family are over and you're not really paying much attention to what's on tele, but you want something seasonal on your TV to look at."}, {"id": 298, "text": "I thought this was sooo magical.

I remember old Nick/Disney live action shows that had better acting/script.The story in general was just too predictable and, well, modern. Typical villain with angry personal issues trying to steal Christmas... wait, that sounds familiar... Anyway, very poor acting with him, severe lack of emotion. Same with the kids, it all just felt so fake.I'm keeping this very brief for obvious reasons, but this movie was plagued by 2020's trending social issues and trying to be as inclusive as possible. Modern political issues are best kept out of warm hearted family movies.All in all, a one snd done movie, if you make it through the whole thing.

Firstly, the main character is gone, Teddy (Judah Lewis)... but he's the lucky one because those who are present are all only half-there. There's no family thread, except one that gets sloppily bookended to the beginning and end with the care of a 90's sitcom (essentially a Full House subplot quality, teen girl temper tantrum). The first film they were dealing with a recent death, a cynical world, the son slipping into a realistic life of crime. Where do we start out here? On vacation??? Yes, their first world problem is that Kate (Darby Camp) is upset her mom is dating an awesome guy. I say problem, but this isn't really dealt with as she immediately gets away from the entire cast of her family to have a separate adventure hanging out with Santa (Kurt Russell) and wife (Goldie Hawn) in a bland mess of cliches that only a very young child will like (it does have bright colors flashing).The rest of the film is a sloppy CGI romp through the North Pole, feeling much like the mess of Santa Clause 2 &amp; 3, super villain and all. We're told the title Christmas Chronicles is no longer their video camera footage (as video camera films are no longer popular) but a series of novels (no doubt to establish a possible franchise and bunch of sequels). The film isn't set in a realistic nowadays world, but 100% in a fantasy, so essentially a totally different type a film and NOT a continuation of the first film. This would be like Christmas Vacation being set entirely in Clark Griswald's sex dream and acting like it's a sequel. It makes no sense. The elves are more like Gremlins (thank you Chris Columbus, just make Gremlins 3 already) than the edgy but sweet creatures from the first, with a goofy drug Elf-bane explanation of why they are snarling.A bland villain pulls the plot along screaming all the way, instead of the protagonists (which should lead it). Their only motivation is to stop the bad guy, whose motivation is to stop the good guy. That's it. Spy vs spy. That's the movie. Absent are the bystander characters that made the first film fun, the cops, the waitress at the restaurant, the guy who stole the car first, the people in jail. We don't get any characters to really see their transformation due to their seeing Santa is real, ya know the magic of the first film. Santa is still cool, but without his sarcastic edge, snappy lines. In short, the fun is totally gone. It's got 10x the effects and none of the heart or story-building that made the original worth watching over and over. Terrible. Absolutely inexcusable. Watch the first one, ignore this one &amp; future sequels."}, {"id": 313, "text": "Although it does provide some nice Christmas colors and things to look at, the unneeded sequel to Netflix's somewhat decent original Christmas flick, is sadly nothing but a hollow film with corny dialogue, mediocre acting, and a convoluted story. I love Kurt Russell, i've been a fan of his work for years, so it saddens me to say that even he isn't enough to give this film the life it hoped for. He stars again as Santa Claus, bringing all he can to the table, but between the horrible dialogue and acting, not to mention the fact that this film is dragged out at least a half an hour more than it needs to be, it sadly just isn't an enjoyable film to watch. I didn't mind the original flick, I wasn't as impressed with it as many other people I know, but I at least found it entertaining and with some good little positive moments. This film however, as sequels usually do, decides to go for the bigger is better type scenario and make everything at least twice as sweet, making it an overly sugary film that is just to corny to bear at times. The acting, besides Russell, is honestly really bad. I don't necessarily have an idea who the worst actor is, but i'm sure in the scheme of things, Tyrese comes quite close (also, why the hell is he even in this movie?). The CGI is incredibly obvious throughout, and there are a few touching moments, but in the end, the film is just too much to of a burden to be worth it.

I'm thrilled that they expanded the series a bit and we got to enjoy Goldie more this time around. I'm also glad that they had the same kids (plus the cute new addition) because it bothers me when sequels ditch the original actors.The Christmas Chronicles (1 and 2) is truly a fun, heartwarming movie that you can snuggle up on the couch and watch every single holiday season.

One of the main reasons: don't take out a main character or give them less screen time.

Why not wait till he's available then film?Nothing is worse than seeing one of your favorite character be nixed in a sequel. For the Christmas Chronicles there are three characters you NEVER nix: The brother and sister duo. And of course Santa. Now this one has added Mrs. Claus. So she'd had better be in the next one if Netflix makes it a trilogy.The storyline was good. It was made so they can branch off from this sequel to make new movies in the future. The acting was good. I was so shocked to see Tyrese in it. Give him a larger role next time. Let him meet the Clauses. That would make for a interesting movie!

I had a number of problems with it, but I was constantly entertained.I've seen the original film a couple of times now, and really enjoyed the narrative but it had some definite screenplay issues throughout and it turned too slapstick for my liking in the third act. Those problems carried over into the second film, but they were all the way throughout instead of just being confined to one act.The narrative was also considerably weaker than the first film, although I did like the sentiment behind it and the backstory for the character of Belsnickel was compelling. Just like the first film, it had some important messages for children and I can see them being thoroughly invested in the story.There was definitely some plot elements borrowed from Back to the Future, and it felt shoe-horned in but it also surprisingly worked for me.The acting was strong, especially from Kurt Russell as Santa Clause, but I was very disappointed that Judah Lewis as Teddy was barely in the film. They chose to replace him with the character of Jack, and the relationship between the main trio and Mrs Clause wasn't as strong because of this.There are some very prominent screenplay issues, and a song that takes place in an airport that didn't work for me. They also doubled down on the slapstick humour for the sequel, which I really disliked.Chris Columbus directed the film, and he did an adequate job. It was competently put-together, albeit with some issues, but it's definitely not his strongest film to date.Overall, I had a number of issues with The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two, but I was never bored. It was always entertaining, and so I can't get my score too low.

It was a decent film with the original Santa Clause Movie (Tim Allen) vibes, so naturally I was looking forward to the sequel. How WRONG could I be. The only plus sides to this, is the fact Goldie Hawn plays a larger part than the first. So where do I even begin to describe this mess? Firstly I feel that they expanded the target audience to include 3 year olds and pre school children. This becomes a massive problem when things become ridiculously stupid within the movie and people with half a brain don't really see the entertainment value or logic. The acting is also debatable right from the start. The young boy, I don't feel was ready to start acting in a big film role and the girls was questionable too in some parts. Who ever decided on a sequel completely rushed the job, and who ever gave the script the OK should be sacked. The cgi was also 5/10 at best. The plot was nothing unseen before, but the execution was absolutely shocking. I literally don't want to spend any more time writing, as I've just wasted 2 hours already.

In turn it has no soul.Just look at the Logan airport scene where all the planes are delayed and the passengers are grouchy.

I feel there is definitely a distinction between the two. Elf, home alone and loads of the classics are great Christmas movies not just kids movies.That being said there is a lot to enjoy. Kurt Russell is excellent again (although less standout moments than the first movie) this time joined by Goldie Hawn as Mrs Claus. The cgi is for me whilst looks a bit silly character wise is seamless with the real sets and characters, very impressive in my opinion. Also the story whilst not being the most clever or original constantly lightly pulls on your heartstrings which provides a enjoyable watch.Worth a watch, has the Christmas spirit you want and better than the average Christmas attempts, but most likely falls short of getting into many Christmas rotations going forward."}, {"id": 321, "text": "'The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two (2020)' is certainly worse than its predecessor, never quite capturing the feeling of a proper Christmas caper. To be honest, it doesn't really feel like a Christmas film at all, despite all the festive milieu inevitably associated with Santa and his elves. Speaking of elves, the furry little freaks are given a lot more screen-time here than they were in the first flick, running amok for a majority of the movie and mugging the camera for all it's worth. They're actually quite unsettling to see in a strange way; they're cringe-worthy and overbearing, with weird visual-designs and grating vocals. After a while, it starts to almost hurt when they appear. Of course, the elves aren't the only issue with the film. Firstly, it takes absolutely ages to get going; it's almost an hour before any real stakes are introduced. Secondly, the actual adventure feels oddly rushed and underwhelming. It doesn't feel cohesive and its relation to 'saving Christmas' actually seems pretty weak. Finally, the finale is so sugary that you can almost feel your blood sugar rising. I mean, I know it's a Christmas movie and there are supposed to be hokey lessons learned but, come on, saccharine doesn't even begin to describe the auto-tuned ending. Having said all that, the thing isn't a totally terrible time. It's bad, don't get me wrong, but it isn't boring. Occasionally, it's almost fun - and I do mean almost - to laugh at. It's trying to do the right thing, too. Its highlight is actually one of its newcomers: a polite and generally personable young lad who must learn to do things independently (and that he may not actually be allergic to lactose). It's a breath of fresh air every time he comes into play. That's not to say that the other actors aren't doing a good job, though; Russell and Hawne are doing exactly what they need to. Like I said, it's not a terrible experience. It actually tries to deal with some almost 'mature' themes. It's nowhere near as good as the first, but it seems to be skewing slightly younger anyway. Perhaps it will appeal solely to little kids, rather than entire families (though the grown-ups will still have to sit through it). 5/10"}, {"id": 322, "text": "This film had a lot of potential to be great. The story itself was really cool with a villain that is almost constantly being developed throughout, with the inclusion of a lot of Christmas mythology, and with just enough changes to the characters to make them feel like they've grown. It ultimately falls short with poor acting, poor writing, and mediocre editing.They hired an experienced cast that have all given great performances in the past and then chose to only use mediocre takes in the film. Julian Dennison succesfully portrays his character as mischievous prankster that wants to get back at the north pole for betraying him. Unfortunately, in any important story moments he just kind of comes across as a whiny kid that got no attention.Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn give good performances, but are limited by the writing. Sometimes the film will just cut away before the resolution to an important conversation. Usually Mrs. Claus has to act like she's in a commercial for Christmas. I think the writers knew the target audience was kids so they didn't feel the need to make the script good.There are a few instances where the film just cuts to one kid at a time and gets a reaction from both of them. This really destroys the pacing and comes across as the director trying to sell us whatever the characters talking about like in a toy commercial. That said, it probably works wonders on kids.If you are a kid, you'll probably love it because its exciting, understandable, and relatable. If you are an adult, the bad parts will probably stick out like a pumpkin under a pine tree, but you'll still find it to be funny and entertaining most of the time."}, {"id": 323, "text": "When I found out that they put out a part two of The Christmas Chronicles, I must admit that I was rather looking forward to watching it as the 2018 movie was rather spectacular, and a much needed addition to the holiday movie genre.Alas, The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two, while it is entertaining and watchable, does suffer from being a sequel. This 2020 movie from writers Matt Lieberman, Chris Columbus and David Guggenheim just didn't have the same punch or adrenaline, nor the same wholesome family feel, that the 2018 movie had. Now, don't get me wrong here, because The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two is definitely an entertaining and enjoyable Christmas movie, no doubt about it. It just didn't stand out as being full up to scale with its predecessor.The storyline was good, although lacking the spark that drove the 2018 movie. What the storyline in The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two suffered from was that it was being a bit too generic and it seemed like director Chris Columbus was just playing it way too safe and settling on a formula that have already been used and used again in Christmas movies year after year.It should be said, though, that actor Kurt Russell is so well-cast for the role of Santa Claus for these movies. He has that special charisma and appearance that just makes it work so well, plus he is just outstanding in that role and costume. It was nice to see Goldie Hawn appear in the movie, though it was hard to remove focus from that stiff upper lip she has now. Actress Darby Camp and actor Jahzir Bruno, playing Kate and Jack respectively, also performed very well in the movie, clearly enjoying what they were doing in the movie. It was nice to hear the iconic voice of Malcolm McDowell make an appearance as well.The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two is definitely a watchable movie, albeit it is a sequel after all, for better or worse.My rating of The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two lands on a six out of ten stars. Well-worth sitting down to watch, especially if you have already seen the first movie, and if you have children at your side as well, because the movie appeals to viewers of all ages."}, {"id": 324, "text": "I feel like I've been making this argument a lot lately, but I'll say it one more time for the sake of this review. Christmas movies, especially when it comes to stories based around Santa Claus, seem to be very few and far between. Back in 2018 when The Christmas Chronicles hit Netflix, I found myself really enjoying the light tone and good-heartedness of the entire film from start to finish. For that reason alone I was looking forward to continuing the mythology that was explored. Well, The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two has now hit Netflix and while there are some very fun, family adventure to be had, it has definitely lost a bit of the magic that made the first one so enjoyable.As soon as this film began, I started rolling my eyes, wondering just how low it was going to sink after the first scene. Starting with a mysterious young man as it's very clear that his goal is to stop Santa and cancel Christmas, I found myself wondering why yet another holiday film was using a story like this. To the film's credit, there were multiple times where it proved me wrong and actually had a decent backstory for why certain things were happening, but it wasn't to the point that it changed my mind. I still found this film to be incredibly lacklustre in terms of storytelling. Where this film does soar, just like the first film, is in the wonderful casting of Kurt Russell as Santa.This time around, the kids from the first film are a little older and more mature as performers. I found that to be a breath of fresh air, especially when re-aqauiting themselves with Santa. With the addition of young Jahzir Bruno and a much more significant role for Goldie Hawn, there wasn't much to complain about in terms of the cast. Although, Tyrese Gibson plays a very small role here as a new father-figure type and I just didn't buy him as that character at all. I like him as an actor, but I don't think his performance fits this film. So as far as watching a likeable cast goes, The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two hits a home run for the most part, especially when looking at it as a holiday film that was dropped on Netflix. Diving deeper into why this film didn't work all that well for me; I must admit that its predecessor had a very firm grasp on pace. The first film is nearly 15 minutes shorter than this one and has a much more meaningful story to tell. Sure, there are some very nice character moments and a little time travelling portion that put a little smile on my face, but it just wasn't enough throughout this nearly two-hour film to win me over. Another thing this film does is feel the need to repeat some of the best moments. The first film had a great, fun karaoke sequence that morphs into a flat-out musical number this time, which was fun, but the screenplay just felt like it took story beats from the first movie that worked and tried to inject a few new elements.In the end, I think what frustrated me the most about this sequel was the fact that the story of the first film was so enjoyable and I loved the world they put together, that this film really didn't do much with any of that. It instead took a very standard villain premise and ran with it. Although the first one didn't have me shouting to the rooftops that people desperately need to see it, I still had some mild expectations for this one and I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little letdown. If you loved the first film, you'll probably find some enjoyment here, as I did, but it just didn't work as an overall standalone film or great sequel to me. So you can take that as a very, very loose recommendation from me if you've seen its predecessor. The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two is now streaming on Netflix."}, {"id": 325, "text": "Christmas is having problems this year, when Kate is unhappy about her moms new boyfriend, and an ex employee of Santa is plotting to ruin Christmas, will it be saved in time, or be lost forever?This follow up is just has good, it explores more on Santa, and Mrs Claus plays a bigger role this time. Kurt Russell gets back in the role of Santa like he never left, and Goldie Hawn brings a delight to Mrs Claus also. The story is very well told, and effects are beyond amazing. There are few little surprises along the way. But I'm telling you like enjoy the second ride."}, {"id": 326, "text": "What is it with Netflix and disappointing and unnecessary sequels? The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two is worse than its predecessor in pretty much every way. It's never as charming or fun, nor is it quite as heartwarming or enjoyable. However, it does manage to be entertaining almost throughout, which, I suppose, is all it really needs to do.Whenever I watch movies like this, I try to take them a little less seriously. After all, what's the point of criticising a film like The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two? It's meant as a bit of cheer and fun for the whole family. Kids will undoubtedly like this, and I think that most adults will have a fun time as well. And if it weren't for the fact that this movie had a more enjoyable prequel, I probably would have liked it more. I suppose that what I'm really complaining about is just my own disappointment.The first part of this saga was better than I ever dared to imagine. It was cheesy and charming, and it made me smile and laugh on multiple occasions. Unfortunately, it feels like all those things are toned down in this one. There are way fewer laughs and heartwarming moments. Something that ends up being quite problematic for this type of film. The lack of these qualities seems to replaced with a far more ambitious story. I have zero doubt that most kids will find this story more than entertaining enough. However, watching it as an adult, I can't help but feel that the sacrifices made for the story weren't worth it. It's also abundantly clear that the story is aimed at younger audiences. With references to Instagram and drones and gaming, it's doesn't take a lot to see who the target audience is.This brings me to what was perhaps my biggest problem with The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two. The need to modernize everything. I have a quite strong dislike for these unnecessary references to things that are thought to be cool. Especially when the references add nothing to the story. And even more so, when they feel forced. There are a few moments early on in this film that matched this description. Luckily, once the story gets going, this need to make everything feel up to date is forgotten. I mean, it's a movie about Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus, and Christmas. That should be enough on its own right?At the end of the day, though, this movie manages to be entertaining and fun enough to make it enjoyable for the whole family. Kurt Russel is still the driving force in this film and a hoot as Santa Claus. While The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two isn't as good as its predecessor, it still does its job of creating Christmas cheer and providing you with a fun time."}, {"id": 327, "text": "It's hard for me to determine if anyone would actually like this due to the insane change in energy from the first one. That's mainly courtesy of Kurt Russell and many of the things he does and lines he spouts in the film. But if you're able to make it at least until the kids make it to the North Pole, I'm sure you'll enjoy the remainder of the film. Russell still has consistent quality in his performance of Santa and bringing Goldie Hawn along for the ride was a nice addition, obviously having a lot of chemistry between the two on screen couple as they are a real life couple too.Something that was a bit frustrating was replacing Judah Lewis with Jahzir Bruno who seems to be trying a bit too hard. He is playing the kid of Lewis' and Darby Camp's mom's new boyfriend, Tyrese freakin' Gibson. Mainly we follow Darby Camp but considering the length of the film I would've liked to hop between another, more interesting, character. There's also a quite lengthy, and bonkers, scene where we go back in time to an airport that easily could've been cut. I completely get why it was included however in the end I question if it was even necessary.If you're a fan of 'The Office' you'll definitely be familiar with the villain of the film, Belsnickel, played by Julian Dennison who was in 'Deadpool 2'. He's an elf that was transformed into a human for being naughty and the visual effects for the elves still look horrible. Overall Dennison was okay, I didn't like a lot of the one-liners they gave him, and the bad lines as a whole is something that sadly carried over from the first one. And instead of producing this time, Chris Columbus directs his first movie since 2015's 'Pixels' which was so bad. I can't hold too much against him for that because he's made the first two 'Home Alone' movies and the first two Harry Potter movies which I criticize a lot less than most do. The story is much more contained due to the fact we spend the majority of the time at the North Pole. And the production design on the village was really good; it reminded me a bit of Hogsmeade. I don't see another one of these movies happening but who knows. As for this, if you can make it through the first roughly 20 minutes with no complaints, I'm sure you'll have a good time in the end."}, {"id": 328, "text": "The Christmas Chronicles movies are fine, they're entertaining but forgettable. Yes, the original is better but that's not saying much really.The acting is good mainly Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, they have good chemistry since they're a real life couple and I enjoyed Overboard which I seen twice. I knew from common sense Judah Lewis would barely be in it but I still wasn't pleased. Some may feel the black kid overacted.The script was paper thin, I think it was quickly written. The villain's backstory was rushed but I wasn't expecting a good villain anyway. The time travel subplot was entertaining but forced.The humor is fine, it's lackluster. This movie is a little cheesier than the original mainly emotion wise. The elves has more screen time so there's more slapstick. This movie is more concerned with being whimsical than funny.Overall, Christmas Chronicles 2 is just okay like the original. I figured it would be weaker than the original. If you disliked the original, don't waste your time. If we get a third movie, hopefully Teddy is a major character."}, {"id": 329, "text": "I like The Christmas Chronicles 2 because it is a heartwarming film, full of magic and adventures which makes it so fun to watch. Santa Claus is not the typical Santa we are used to seeing in other movies. This Santa is a type of daredevil Santa.If you watched The Christmas Chronicles in 2018, you must know that Kate (Darby Camp) and her brother Teddy (Judah Lewis) are friends with Santa Claus, played by the one and only Kurt Russell. Kate's mom and her boyfriend Bob (Tyrese Gibson) take Kate, Teddy and Jack (Jahzir Bruno), Bob's son, to celebrate Christmas in Cancun, Mexico. Kate doesn't want to be there as she misses her dad who passed away two years ago. An evil kid named Belsnickel (Julian Dennison) wants to destroy Santa and uses Kate to get to the North Pole to do his dirty deed. Jack follows her so they both end up at the North Pole and that's when ALL the adventure begins!My favorite part is when Jack picks two of Mrs. Claus' special homemade cookies - confidence and bomb. When he needs confidence he forgets which one of the cookies is confidence and almost eats the cookie bomb. The graphics and digital effects are amazing. The reindeers and the cougar look real. The music is very appealing in every scene. The costumes are very seasonal. Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn) gives this movie a special touch, which makes this film different from the first movie. Mrs. Claus creates Santa's Village and takes good care of it. The movie mentions how it should be called Mrs. Claus Village, which gives this character the importance she deserves because, in reality, she is the person behind Santa, supporting him, taking care of him and his business.The moral of this movie is to move on, be happy and let others be happy. Throughout the film we learn that Kate doesn't like her mom's new boyfriend and doesn't want Bob substituting for her dad. Santa shows her that family is everything and that they matter the most, so why not cherish that her mom is happy because she found love again in Bob? Kate needs to accept that her mom loves Bob and that doesn't mean she stops loving her dad. She needs to understand her mom deserves to be happy. Life continues; people need to move on.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18, plus adults. The Christmas Chronicles 2 comes out on Netflix on November 25, 2020, so get your hot chocolate and cookies or popcorn ready to enjoy this magical film!

I mean c'mon, seriously!?If you seriously take that stance, especially on a Christmas film, you need to take a long good hard look in the mirrorPersonally I found the sequel better.The original felt lack luster and like a canned paint by numbers experience.I loved this one as it felt like an actually Christmas adventure full of smiles, laughs, action and fun.I laughed, I loved, I cried...

Director Chris Columbus is a job well down after directing previous movies like Adventures in Babysitting, Home Alone 1 &amp; 2, Mrs. Doubtfire and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Goldie Hawn delivers as Mrs. Claus since she did appeared in the first movie as the end and Kurt reprising his role as Santa Claus as well. the story was okay despite Katie now a 13 year girl on a family vacation with her older brother, along with there mom and her new boyfriend, a new character for the film name Belsnickel who's the villain of this movie since he once was a elf and turned human after doing naughty tricks compared to something like in the Care Bears like from the Care Bears Movie 2: a new generation and there's even a sub-plot in which Santa Claus and Katie Pierce end up traveling back in time to Christmas eve 1990 in which Katie's deceased Father Doug was a young boy in which Kate meets is like something from a scene in Back to the Future, plus Malcolm McDowell who plays as magical elf Hakan is marvelous. if you like any good sequel to a christmas like Home Alone 2: Lost in New York and the 2 Santa Claus movies with Tim Allen, check this out even if you have kids will truly enjoy it along with the first movie."}, {"id": 332, "text": "I saw both movies back to back and the only reason i went stright into the second one despite being so late at night was because i enjoyed the first one so much.

Goldie Hawn looked like an animated corpse who could barely move her mouth. Judah Lewis who gave a great blanace in the first movie was almost completely missing, and the scenes he did have came across as a stepford boy who'd be more at home in the Brady Bunch.And yes, they shoehorned diversty in there with a crowbar and the little kid was as annoying as anikin in phantom mence. I'm only giving 3 stars because at least Kurt Russell stayed true to his character and i guess Kate Pierce while bland did too.If you loved the first, don't watch this"}, {"id": 333, "text": "I really enjoyed the first Netflix-produced Christmas Chronicles film from 2018 and with my wife today having spent all afternoon on her labour of love, setting up our Christmas tree this year, I was certainly enthused about our watching together its sequel as the first of no doubt a few seasonal films we'll likely catch this month.Sorry to report then that the follow-up just wasn't anywhere near as good this time around. The main characters are pretty much the same although with newly added P.C. casting as the young white girl Kate from the previous film, again played by Darby Camp and even younger new black boy Jack, played by Jahzir Bruno, end up back at the North Pole with Santa and Mrs Claus, the real-life Mr and Mrs Kurt Russell, i.e. plus Goldie Hawn, this time very much a 50/50 partnership, so much so that even Santa's Village is rechristened Mrs Claus's Village. It turns out that Kate's dad has died and she grudges her mum finding new love with her handsome black boy-friend, father of Jack, as she still clings to the memory of her old dearly-departed dad.The wider picture this time is that Christmas is threatened this year by a rogue elf-turned-human, Belsnickel who finds a way to turn all the happy little elves into nasty Gremlins, almost fatally injure Dasher the reindeer and steal the Christmas Star too. So Santa teams up with Kate and Mrs Claus with Jack in separate adventures to literally save the (Christmas) day and of course resolve Kate's issues with her old man with a Back To The Future twist I saw coming way in advance.On the positive side the CGI depictions of the magical village, the elves and Santa's sleigh were again all rendered superbly, Kurt and Goldie (even with her pneumatic lips) are cute together as Mr and Mrs Claus but the story this time was just too obvious, with its blatant references to Home Alone, The Wizard Of Oz and B.T.T.F. as well as being cliched and lacking in depth. I also predicted to the second just when the big musical interlude would pop up but also felt that if you have the great Darlene Love in the cast, surely have her sing her Spector-produced classic Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) and not some mediocre Spirit Of Christmas number instead. Oh, and if like me, you got bored with all the overdone SFX which overwhelm the story at the expense of plot or characterisation, you can amuse yourself by playing a game of Spot the Blatantly Obvious Product Placement).Listen, it's approaching Christmas and I really should be feeling charitable at this time of the year but watching this, especially remembering the quality of the original, was like eagerly opening one of your presents on Christmas morning and finding it's just a pair of new socks."}, {"id": 334, "text": "Bad watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend unless you just LOVED the original.If you loved Kurt Russell and the Elves, then you're in luck, because there is a LOT of them in this.

It is hard for me to pick which is better, part one or two, but they are equally fun. My family has enjoyed both, so thank you! As for the performances, the actors are all great. The story on this sequel is great, and you can tell that Kurt Russell put his time into developing the back story with Chris Columbus. I am even reading that Kurt was so involved that even helped with some of the writing!They (Kurt and Goldie) are both great actors that I have enjoyed with all of their films over the years.

Even when an actor only had 3 or 4 scenes they're still stiff, awkward and poor.

At the mid point the main young actress meets a random boy, you can guess who the young boy is even before she meets him.The cginin parts is very good, but others it's very very poor for a 2020 movie. The ending of the movie is almost spoiled due to the poorly crafted CGI.Nevertheless... Kids won't notice all of that.

Except for Kurt and Goldie, those two are truly Hollywood royalty.."}, {"id": 337, "text": "The original Christmas Chronicles was a lovely, unsuspected surprise. In it, Santa was portrayed as a mysterious, mischievous elf focused on a mission of great importance. Kurt Russell played Santa with an impish glow in his eyes that let you know Santa was always in control, even as he pretended not to be for the benefit of his underage sidekicks. Gone is that magical confidence and mystery, now replaced by the standard Hollywood caricature of white suburban, clueless, failed father figure.More egregious is the nearly complete elimination of the wonderful relationship between siblings Kate and Teddy which mended so beautifully in the first film. Teddy disappears for most of this sequel's runtime to make way for Jack, the annoying, nagging, soon-to-be stepbrother whose main character arc seems to be about conquering... I dunno, Hypochondria? Fear of heights? Or perhaps just self autonomy in general? Not that it matters, his character is handled so poorly he becomes irrelevant to what little story we're given.Most irritating is the addition of Julian Dennison as a morbidly obese elf /estranged son archetype determined to destroy Santa's North Pole operation in order to... make daddy notice him and rule Christmas from his own stronghold at the South Pole. Dennison is a curious case. A quick search through IMDB doesn't reveal nepotism or any other explanation as to why he he is allowed to appear in front of a camera. He clearly doesn't belong. His earnest, saccharin line deliveries are unintentionally hilarious. Woefully miscast in Deadpool's sequel, here Dennison's appearance is bordering on offensive. Seriously casting agents, what are you doing?Clearly a sequel COULD have been written that made good use of these new diversity-fueled casting choices. Sadly no attempt was made. The makers of this film seem to believe their inclusion should be enough. The twinkle in Kurt Russel's eye is gone. Now his eyes seem to be apologizing for this abysmally depressing failure of a holiday film."}, {"id": 338, "text": "A disappointment, all in all.I very much enjoyed the first film, but 'The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two' is a much weaker entry. Kurt Russell, though still enjoyable, isn't as entertaining as in the 2018 film. It is nice to see him reprise his role though, likewise with Darby Camp, Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Judah Lewis.New additions include Tyrese Gibson, Jahzir Bruno and Julian Dennison. I'm a fan of Tyrese from the 'Fast &amp; Furious' franchise, but he is underused here; when he does feature, he's quite laidback. Bruno is alright, while Dennison is hit-and-miss; he has one or two good moments. Goldie Hawn, meanwhile, has an expanded role.The elves are as great as before, as are the special effects in general. I'd say they are probably more creative with this premise than they were with the 2018 production, but ultimately it doesn't come out as strongly - this one doesn't feel as Christmassy as its predessceor.
