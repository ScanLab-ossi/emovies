{"name": "The Rhythm Section", "titleId": "tt07134096", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "The Rhythm Section, for all intents and purposes is and functions (however poorly) as a revenge genre film. The problem with the movie lies in the fact that in spite of a meager attempt at training our would-be assassin for 8 months, she has the skills of you, the movie goer. Now imagine yourself as an international assassin. That's about how good she is. So If you think you'd enjoy seeing the beautiful Blake Lively get her ask kicked by 10 people, this is the movie for you. It's almost like reverse action. I've never quite seen anything so one-sided before, and it seriously makes me wonder why it was even made.This is not Peppermint."}, {"id": 1, "text": "The Rhythm section is a one woman show which Blake Lively delivers in a new way. She is a heartbroken girl who lost her family and trains to get revenge. Jude Law is a harsh trainer very believable on his role. I love that Blake always looks amazing whether blonde, brunette or red headed. She is such a good actress her junkie beginning in the film is just as believable as her high priced call girl in the middle but what I most liked about this film is it's very realistic! She doesn't just spin a guy and kill him she fights for her life as much as her prey does. I love how it's not easy for her to kill unless she ends up having to do it and most love how much she's learned after it's done! She's come a long way, now sober and knowing that the assassin life is not for her, I think this smart woman can now join the world again and live."}, {"id": 2, "text": "If you want a good nap, go and see this movie. It was unbelievably boring. I can't believe I wasted my money seeing this movie. Not even Jude Law could save it. The plot was so choppy and the scenery was nothing to write home about. Don't waste your money on this one."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I don't even know what I just watched. 60% of the movie is closeups of Blake Lively's face. It's like the story of the worst assassin ever trying to get to the bottom of a tragedy in the most confusing way possible."}, {"id": 4, "text": "A very forgettable movie that had no special moments. I was expecting a lot from this film but was sadly disappointed. Story is average at best, weird character development. Extremely disappointed in this film."}, {"id": 5, "text": "This movie had a little potential, though I feel the plot has been done so many times in much better films. One of my many issues with the plausibility of this plot, is how on earth is it so easy for Lively's character to sneak into all these supposedly high-profile people's homes? Seriously! Most of them had open doors and windows, and even though they supposedly had security detail, she ducks around a couple of corners and in through an open door or window??? This point was so distracting for me I couldn't pay attention to the other things happening?Also, it seemed way too easy for her to find B (Jude Law) for someone who went to great lengths to live off the grid, especially given that he was former MI -6 and would have been very good at hiding."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Better than profanol for quick easy sleep. Terrible acting,continuity,drab dialog. James Bond has nothingto worry about"}, {"id": 7, "text": "You knew the ending probably when you saw the trailer but definitely halfway through the film. All the while wondering how you got there. I like the idea of making Livley's character a reluctant assassin. She played the heartbreak and the torment very well. I feel the film just cut out too much of the story in favor of longer action sequences. (I understand this is why you go see a film like this) The switch from reluctant assassin to remorseless killer happens off screen??? Why??? We watched her bumble and stumble for two hours so that she could finally put it all together in a 3 minute seen at the end. I am lame and watch movies for the Triumphant payoff, at the end I didn't really feel that with Lively's character. The story telling wasted an incredible acting job by Lively. She put her soul into this film only for the actual film to have none."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Sorry this film was just so slow and boring and the music was even worse"}, {"id": 9, "text": "The Briar witch first hand cinematography tricks made me nauseous. The plot had promise but was filled with holes and inconsistencies. Not worth your time."}, {"id": 10, "text": "This could have been such a good film. Blake lively is fine in it but the problem is the slow, turgid and self indulgent script. 26 minutes in in the film hadn't started yet. Instead, we had all these long lingering shots of poor Blake lively being a hooker addict wallowing in the loss of her parents instead of becoming proactive and taking action. Both the director and screenwriter should've gotten a swift kick in the ass from the studio to tighten up their $hit."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Storyline contains a mystery, and a whodunit. Some of the action was good, and some was only okay. But gets six stars from me. Better than average action film."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Massive fan of Blake and her films but this is just horrible. Every single thing the character does in this film she does badly, Terrible plot and I can't get over how totally useless the main character is. Give this a miss."}, {"id": 13, "text": "New take on the age old revenge tale. Short running time unseated the narrative (studio interference perhaps) an unlikely directors cut would explain/flow a lot better. People looking for Bourne will be disappointed but Blake gives a solid performance."}, {"id": 14, "text": "This movie is not getting the reviews it deserves no way is this a rating of a 5 more like a 6 or 7. Very well done. Someone don't become a bad ass over night like in Peppermint movie. I found it to be more realistic then most. I hope to see a part 2 now that she hone her skill in part 1. But if they don't make a part 2 it was still a very good movie. Give it a try you won't be sorry if you know good movies."}, {"id": 15, "text": "There isn't anything special about the film. The acting is borderline OK and the photography is good. The direction is a little slow and there really are few tense scenes, when they should have been. The story itself is probably more realistic as the newly trained assassin does a poor job in everything she attempts. I thought there was way too much time at the beginning of the film and not enough action (tension) during the action scenes."}, {"id": 16, "text": "If you have seen the 1990 French film La Femme Nikita, where a drug addict is trained to be an accomplished assassin, this movie will remind you of it. But it changes the motivation from prison to revenge. I can't understand the poor reviews. Acting, script, cinematography etc are all good and it's worth a watch."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Runs like a brilliant le carre novel set in the now. Slow in the traditional thriller sense with well choreographed fights.Reminiscent of Cold War spy thrillers but ultimately one that takes it's time and broils our nicely."}, {"id": 18, "text": "The film builds really well and had me hooked in but it appeared to just continue to do that. I was left feeling like I was still waiting for it to truly kick into action nothing specifically was wrong with it and as a whole I still enjoyed the majority of it. I can't help feeling however that it was a little anti-climatic in the end."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I'll keep it short: decent movie, story line, and acting all frustratingly ruined by the stupid up close, shaking camera!

Why are these made in such numbers these days? Female director too... but why? Just because executives at studios are too afraid to say no to girls now? Is it that bad?

Don't bother."}, {"id": 24, "text": "So many armchair critics give bad reviews, take it how it comes, and stop comparing it to other films, only then will you enjoy it. My advice make a drink and enjoy it WITHOUT comparing it, yes it's not a Casino Royal but we'll worth a solid 7/10."}, {"id": 25, "text": "She's more than just a pretty face. Lively, born in Tarzana, CA, reverses the British invasion of Hollywood by credibly playing a Brit in this international flick that begins and ends in London. Once she becomes a trained assassin, with the help of Jude Law's character to avenge the death of her family in an airline explosion over the Atlantic, she truly becomes a tough character. This tale is riveting. My palms were actually dripping during the tenses moments, which were numerous."}, {"id": 26, "text": "When you go for a Blake Lively movie, you expect so much. The trailer seemed quite good. The acting was top notch. So what went wrong with the movie! The lead character wants to take revenge by killing terrorists. In such movies there is a underdog who is may be a bit weak but through his/her sheer intent, focus, clarity, will power and heart, at the end emerges victorious. And she does that by getting kicked from all sides, panics all the time, gets confused in the chaos created by her own self and escapes just because of sheer luck. One one side is revenge and her anger and pain and has the full will to kill the bad guys and on the other side when it actually comes to the killing part, she gets soft and ruins all her missions and keeps crying. You can never empathise with her or relate to her. Losing is not bad but having a loser attitude along with an egoistic attitude in the entire movie and just winning because of luck is not something i would want in my protagonist."}, {"id": 27, "text": "The Rhythm Section is trying very hard to be something it's not, a good film. While Blake Lively is doing her best with what she is given her character is dreadfully unlikeable and is not a protagonist that you can get behind. Along with odd and sometimes cringe worthy music choices during scenes, The Rhythm Section definitely belongs in the January trash pile."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Just asking, is the screenwriter communist? Great Cast, Horrible Screenplay, Worst Direction. Looks like good shots were only for Trailer, movie was aweful.

Maybe its low because it's not a Marvel or Stan Lee production? I really enjoyed it. A revenge/spy flick that is more believable than the average. Kind of harkens back to the original Jason Borne movie. Not the typical action flick with all the slow motions shots and ridiculous feats, she does not have an easy time, she's inexperienced, and she gets hurt. Supporting cast was good and the locations beautiful and interesting. All in all a fun movie."}, {"id": 30, "text": "From the beginning, a ludicrous premise: that a smart angry college girl can become a skilled CIA assassin simply by swimming across a cold river in her underwear and kicking Judd Law in the groin, you NEVER believe for a second that Blake Lively could even shoot a gun straight let alone gain the necessary skills to become a killer, being a talented thumb wrestler would be a stretch, save your money rent atomic blonde or red sparrow"}, {"id": 31, "text": "For me, the only good thing in this movie is the beauty of Blake Lively. I've put this movie in my watchlist hoping to see something special. Unfortunately, I got frustrated and disappointed because it is one of the disasters of 2020. The story is so much far from what it's supposed to be. I feel it's quickly written without consideration to twists or details. The characters aren't also well drawn and the plot is banal."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Scene after scene finish as ridiculous.

But, for that realism, I applaud the script; the acting, the intelligent dialogue. Also, the cinematography, and editing for the great angles (especially the novel car chase scene). The music &amp; sound effects were all creatively chosen, adding to the tension - well done. Finally, creative twists (scenes not seen in similar movies in this genre) to keep one guessing."}, {"id": 43, "text": "I really don't understand all the negative reaction to this film. I was gripped and entertained from start to finish. The acting, photography, editing and action were all first class in my opinion. I've knocked just one star off for credibility. I was particularly impressed with the car chase scene which appears to be one long take inside the main character's car. Highly recommended for people who enjoy a thoughtful thriller that isn't just non-stop action and takes its time to set up characters and situations in the first half.

In fact, very action packed &amp; fast paced. Except it's not. It's dreary &amp; plodding. It's slow, dry &amp; pretty flat for the most part. Even the action scenes which do happen aren't all that or a only great for a very short time before ending.The fight scenes were alright, as were the action scene like the explosions.

We could have got a great riveting action thriller but instead we got a messy underwhelming movie with sadly very little to offer.It does try to be a great film and thanks to Blake Lively and Jude Law, the film is manages not to crumble. Lively is great, she really does liven up the film. Sadly she has to work with a story which is very weak. Inhibiting her from her true potential.It feels like the film builds up and builds up and suddenly ends in the most underwhelming and quickest way possible.In terms of action, there is very little. The action scenes are filmed decently well. It's just after seeing action sequences from films in recent years like The Raid, Atomic Blonde and The John Wick trilogy. You can't help feel disappointed at the action.Overall despite glimpses of potential with it's style and narrative, the film falls flat.

She's messy and wildly imperfect.The movie is no masterpiece, but it was well shot, scored, and acted. The visual and auditory language of the film is well communicated.

The cast was great - the movie just didn't deliver."}, {"id": 54, "text": "If you want a brief advice. Run out do not pay a ticket nor lose your time to see this. Read above is the most boring action movie I had ever see; and I see a lot of crap. Do you want to know more; well let's start for the beginning. This is a very poorly attempt to remake La Femme Nikita. A movie I loved but it should had been some kind of great masterpiece because I saw many attempts over the years (this the four since 2018 I found) to remake and all (even on by its own creator Luc Besson) pretty unsuccessful. Stefanie is a drug addict prostitute whose parents and sister were kill in a plane accident. A whistleblower contact her and inform that it was no accident but terrorist attempt and a big cover up. She got trained to claim vengeance and kill the bad guys. Very politically correct.Well Nikita in the movie was drug addict and perhaps a prostitute but not a saint. She kills a cop in the first scene and her victims are never referred as criminals more than political assassinations. Nikita kills until find out she will be the next victim and run away. Luc Besson made an updated version calle ANNA which is not as good as the original but has better action and acting than The Rhythm Section. It was more about espionage but if you want another on vengeance look for PEPPERMINT which is more violent and far better acted than the other two.Regarding the acting; Blake Lively is usually good; but not here. She spent most of the movie in a catatonic face and looking like a carbon copy of Anne Parillaud and the other part looking as constipated. Jude Law does a routinary good work as well as Sterling K. Brown. On top of that Blake and Jude talk in a kind of forced Cockney accent that makes their dialogs quit difficult to understand.The plot lacks any originality or development. After about one hour where very little happens aside for the constipated Blake's face quitting Heroin with a couple of nights of sleep and learning run, swim or shoot in a few days.When after the training the action starts but is so absurdly orchestrated that makes even less sense. Spoiler here:Stefanie / Blake is unable to kill unless is in self defense so she has to fight with each victim until kill it.In brief; this is the kind of B movie that usually do not get a theatrical release.; do not misuse your money or your time on this crap"}, {"id": 55, "text": "Despite all the negative reviews, I decided to give this one a watch and I'm glad I did.

Charlize Theron is a much better actress doing her own stunts and looking badass. Blake Lively is not a good actress and definitely NOT a badass. I'm not going to get into the movie itself because it's that bad. I actually feel bad for Jude Law, he's a decent actor but why on earth did he say yes to this movie is beyond me.

The movie itself was well-scripted and well-directed - the villain was perfect, very good balance there.

There is a touch of humour between her and Jude Law but no vapid wisecracks or one-liners. The dialogue is lean, just enough to explain the plot, without trivializing the tragedy of the story with forced witticism. I sometimes needed to pause the movie to absorb revealed details of plot and character, so you have to pay attention. Interesting secondary characters, some repugnant and others poignant. The movie also provides some armchair tourism, presenting some beautiful foreign locales.

Whether it's a too-long car chase or the trauma of causing collateral damage (when her New York City john's two young kids are blown up with him by the Plan B car bomb after Stephanie gets cold feet about slitting his throat while the couple's in the buff), THE RHYTHM SECTION taps out a steady S.O.S. plea for more gats.

Maybe that's the reason it had less action than some expected. It was more about preparation and determination. Unfortunatelly people have gotten used too much to the image of a perfectly skilled assassin that they couldn't tolerate an imperfect amateur.

But even so, it reminds me of Luc Besson's film with the same ideas, Beautiful young woman with drug problems and prostitution, recruited by a former MI6, who trains her to transform her into a professional murderer, with the purpose that in addition to her revenge staff do your dirty work to you. Forgetting that a little about the film, Blake Lively continues to prove that she is not just a pretty face, she is a very good actress, the music produced by Hans Zimmer, even if he does not execute it, it shows in the distance, and the locals well accomplished .

This movie is based on the first novel in the Stephanie Patrick series written by Mark Burnell, who also wrote the screenplay for this movie. One of the producers is Barbara Broccoli of James Bond fame and me being a big James Bond fan, I was really excited to see this movie. But I must say, I was a little disappointed. It's not a bad movie, it's just not what I was expecting-it is a little slow at times. Blake plays an ordinary woman that spirals into depression after loosing her family in a plane crash. She starts doing drugs and soliciting strangers for money with promises of sex-some people call that prostitution. Anyway, things change when Raza shows up as a 'John' but he doesn't want sex. Instead, he tells her that he is a reporter and has evidence that the plane crash that killed her family was the result of a terrorist bombing. Blake wants revenge and finds Jude-an ex MI6 agent-to help her. He trains her and connects her with Sterling-an ex C.I.A. agent-that is now an information broker that has leads to the person behind the bombing. Even with Jude's training, Blake is no Bond. She messes up on more than one occasion-which tends to make her more believable-so maybe she gets better if there are any sequels. It's rated R for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 49 minutes. It was good but kind of slow, so I don't think I would buy it on DVD.

Both characters in each movie had their CIA/MI6 Trainers and Handlers guiding them through their tirade. Both movies concluded with a perception of a promising sequel(s).Some how American Assassin was able to accomplish the exact same thing while at a comfortable pace. Rhythm Section felt slow at long stretches during the same points of the plot as American Assassin. That's my personal negative opinion on this movie.I have zero issues with women playing these characters. I enjoy leading women playing in these movies. Blake Lively is and was amazing in this movie. As long as they're not agenda driven based on political theology and clearly pushing the fake gender war or purposely changing history or changing the long standing originality of a fairy tail with the sole purpose of inserting a different gender which has zero to do with the story. As long as the acting is great, plot is good, keep pumping out these strong women playing strong characters.With that said the timing of the release of this movie during Super Bowl weekend probably crushed any chance of sequels.

Jude Law did a good job as the former MI6 agent and the training scenes were believable. The producers didn't give the impression that Stephanie was suddenly made into an unstoppable assassin, just a competent one. It was refreshing for a protagonist assassin to be fallible and not indestructible (particularity after having just watched the ridiculous John Wick 3.) There were many tense, edge of your seat scenes to keep me watching. The car chase scenes were exciting and believable. The bus scene in Spain was excellent and the pyrotechnics were really well done (nice to see an exploding vehicle actually get ripped apart and not just rise straight up in the air like in so many Hollywood action movies) The end of the movie had an unexpected and satisfying turn.

She trains to become an assassin in order to get the revenge she so desperately wants. The Rhythm section was sadly just very mediocre with some good/interesting moments it just was very underwhelming and never really went anywhere.Starting with my first two negatives it sadly had a very dull opening and a very slow pacing throughout the whole film that didn't really work. The first half in general really wasn't that interesting and practically nothing to engaging happened. It was either bland conversations or just attempting to make us connect to the main character which they failed to achieve but I will talk about that more later. And the whole film in general was slow paced. Even when it became slightly more interesting the intense or action scenes were cut off quickly only to be replaced with some bland plot point afterwards, some films with slow pacing can work if they have a lot of drama involved but this film really didn't.My first two positives would be the use of flashbacks and the unique POV camera angles. I really liked the use of flashbacks to establish an emotional tone and the true effects of Stephanie (Blake Lively) losing her family and how close she was with them; these weren't overused they set the tone very well. And I liked the films interesting point of view shots with some intense or action scenes. This was a unique way of showing a scene from a character's viewpoint and for the most part was engaging and interesting to watch.Next the film did a pretty good job at building tension. When there was some intense thriller scenes, they did manage to do a good job at making you feel on edge and unsure about what the outcome would be especially with Blake Lively's character. They also did do a good job at sudden noises with the soundtrack when tension is building in order to make you feel uncomfortable or to make you jump especially with any bomb scenes.However, my next two negatives would be that the lead character was very unlikeable, and you couldn't really connect with most of the characters. Blake Lively's character for the most part of the movie although largely in the first half was not very likeable and difficult to connect with her which is a concern considering she is the main character. I got that she was still grieving the loss of her family. But she had no likeable qualities to her personality, and she was just an awkward and rude person, so it took a long time for me to connect with her. And the film never really allowed you to connect with any of the other characters either. Jude laws performance was great, but you never really knew much about his character apart from the basics so it was hard for me to connect with his character despite me wanting to, and they could of done some really interesting things with the journalist who helped Stephanie but he was killed off really quickly which I thought was a slightly odd decision and it didn't really take the plot anywhere.Next, I thought the film had a fairly well executed plot twist at the end. When they revealed that Sterling k browns character was the villain and the person behind all the attacks it actually took me by surprise, and I wasn't expecting it which was nice. Yes, it could have been better executed or more explained but at least they surprised me a fair amount.My final big positives would be Blake Lively and Jude Law's performances and the on-screen chemistry they had with each other. Blake Lively really did do an excellent performance even if her character wasn't the most likeable, she portrayed an incredibly realistic version of someone grieving and feeling guilty of the loss of her family, she did a very convincing job at showing us the pain her character was going through so hats off to her. Jude Law also despite not having hardly any depth to his character bought a breath of fresh air to the movie. This was a different kind of role for him but for me it really worked, and he should consider more roles like this. He made Stephanie a more likeable character and was a good motivation to make her try harder. And the on-screen chemistry these two had was great. They both worked well together and bounced off each other's jokes really well that worked for me whenever they were on screen.However, my final two negatives that really bought the film down for me was the underwhelming amount of action and the mediocre final act. The film lacked enough action to be considered this genre, and same with its thrills and emotion to be a thriller or a drama. It didn't have anything really going for it throughout making me question why it was released in this form. When they did try and go for more action even those scenes were underwhelming. The key reason for this being sadly Blake Lively. Her performance was fantastic, but she could not hold her own In the action sequences at all. Looking unprepared and awkward. This may have been done deliberately but I don't understand why they would deliberately have underwhelming action sequences. And the ending was just mediocre there was interesting enough plot twist but not really executed that well ending the film on an awkward note and the film just didn't come together in a satisfying way.Overall, despite good performances, unique camera work and well-established tones. The rhythm section is a mediocre, underwhelming mess. That lacks enough of any elements of the genres it was trying to portray to the audience."}, {"id": 117, "text": "Highly enjoyable film with an exciting sense of mystery throughout.

I am pleased I saw it through as it would have been a lower score if I hadn't, but I feel the film earned the score I have given.

After all of that we then get into some action finally, yes some of the action scenes are good but when it came to her trying to kill someone you could tell she wouldn't do it but it does change the usual cliche of someone from the bottom rising to the top &amp; becoming this crazy killer we are all use to seeing but you could just tell from her character she wouldn't.Overall its one of those films that no one saw advertised, had a low budget &amp; was never going to be a 10/10 film nor be in the top 10 best films, luckily i have the unlimited card so it doesn't bother us (My film group) but i wouldn't pay to see this.

For Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) to rise to the level of an elite assassin in less than a year, even with training, is too much of a stretch to maintain credibility for the story line. Her very first assignment resulted in a rookie mistake when she had the drop on Lehmans (Richard Brake) and blew it when he faked immobility. It reminded me of all those old 'B' Westerns when the hero has the drop on the bad guy and for some reason hesitates and gets snookered. And if you stop and think about it, her next couple of targets resulted in unsuccessful attempts, but the victims were dispatched by other means she had nothing to do with. As a revenge film, the story had some merit, but inserting Elvis's 'It's Now or Never' into the soundtrack only brought additional focus on the never part. At least Stephanie's final kill was achieved up close and personal, allowing for a twist in the identity of her intermediary contact Serra (Sterling K. Brown)."}, {"id": 148, "text": "The acting is good here and pacing keeps our attention. But director Morano is a rising star and I was hoping it'd be better.

Not only the confusion, but also the deprivation of ones imagination - the story pushes for the end and leaves nothing to long for. The false suspension in every fight scene may as well have been created as a way to portray her incompetence as an international assassin (the irony) and somehow invite us to her state of mind, however it failed to embark on that path from the very beginning.

Yes you could say that, but I stand by what I mean. Trust me it makes sense , well it does in my head.As mentioned in the title, the story to this film is just plain boring. Its unoriginal , cliche , stereotypical garbage......there is nothing that is new, fresh , interesting that is brought up in this thriller. The whole basis of the story is the a woman seeking revenge for the deaths of her family who were killed in a plane crash. Said plane crash was caused by a bomb , however investigators concluded that it was a fuel tank explosion!!! NO just no I am sorry , I know your not meant to bring logic or reality into some films but this is just weak plot building . Air crash investigators wouldn't mistake a bomb for a fuel tank explosion..........they just wouldn't !!! So I cant get behind that part of the story..........Then there is the extremely quick turnaround of the central characters life.......... in the space of 40 mins to 1 hour she has gone from prostitute barely surviving with guilt to swimming in a lake training to be an assassin. I get behind it...............and all of it unfortunately is just plain boring..........I was so bored watching it.......sorry.The characters in this film so desperately needed a more interesting story as its foundation to build upon. As also mentioned in the title , I have this strangely feeling that there is a lot of room for a sequel to this or at least the start of a film franchise. The ending of the film leaves the door open, not intentionally I don't think, for a sequel because the audience now has a whole film of character history/arc that future better films could use to build upon. You know what even more strangely , I would be really open to watching a sequel to this film.The main reason for that is Blake Lively , she is a leading actress full stop. She can carry the film along as the central character , her performance I thought in this film was very good. She had a lot of range from where the character started in the film to where she ends..........she can definitely handle the physical part of the role, to be perfectly honest her performance was maybe the only part of the film that I fully bought into. That is all down to Blake Lively !!Yeah Jude Law was also good in his small role, but when is he not good ???Overall though this film is pretty poor if your asking me......due to its mind numbingly boring story that is so paper thin , cliche and stereotypical........this film is such a bore to watch.....feels much longer than 1hr 44 mins.

The fact that there is plenty of violence in the film as well as ties to MI6 shouldn't mislead folks into thinking this is a high tech spy film though. In fact it's more of a revenge film.Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) is a young woman whose family is killed in a plane explosion as it is flying out of London. Three years later she's still living there working as a prostitute and strung out on drugs. One days she is approached by Keith Proctor (Raza Jeffrey), a journalist investigating the crash who informs her it wasn't an accident but a bombing planned by terrorists.At first not believing him she eventually finds him and visits him, seeing all of the information he has gathered thus far. The man behind the bombing was named Reza, now living as a student in London and left alone by the government as well as MI6. It seems they feel he is more valuable to them as a source to track down those responsible rather than taking him down.Pawning off what she can Stephanie buys more drugs and a gun with the intention of killing Reza. When she confronts him in a diner she can't bring herself to follow through. She heads to Proctor's apartment to let him know what happened only to find him dead. With a small lead as to his main source, she sets out to find the man with the information to help her plot Reza's death.Heading to a remote location in Scotland she finds B, Iain Boyd (Jude Law), an ex-MI6 agent who was Proctor's source for information. B informs her that it was her ineptitude that led to the death of Proctor. He also lets her know that the man behind it all is the elusive radical terrorists known only as U-17. Begging him to help her, to train her, letting him know that her life is now meaningless, he reluctantly agrees and the training begins.It's difficult and at first he isn't sure if she'll make it or not. Through sheer determination she does and the plan begins to take form. B tells her that the body of a professional assassin he killed, Petra Reuter, is still missing and they plan on her taking Petra's place. Using her as a pawn in the game of cat and mouse with the terrorists puts her life in jeopardy but she's determined to avenge the death of her family.Boyd puts her in touch with Marc Serra (Sterling K. Brown), an ex-CIA agent and information broker, to gain information that will lead her to U-17. Unable and unwilling to fund her search, she approaches the father of liberal Muslim reformer Abdul Kaif. Kaif was the target of the bombing with everyone else considered collateral damage. He refuses but when his wife overhears, she agrees to fund her mission. In return Stephanie/Petra gives her her wedding ring to hold as collateral.With funding in place she returns to talk to Serra to gain information and begins tracking down the various members of the terrorists' organization behind the bombing. With each person killed she comes closer to finding the identity of U-17 as well as losing herself in the murders she commits. Along the way she gets help from Boyd when she fails to follow through.But as is often the case things are not always what they seem. As the bodies begin to pile up Stephanie learns move about everyone from Boyd to Reza to Serra to U-17. The puzzle unravels slowly and the eventual outcome is not as predictable as you would expect.As I said don't go in expecting this to be a Bond film. Yes, there are car chases. Yes, there are explosions. Yes, there is gunplay and people die. But that's about it. With the exception of taking a novice off the street and turning her into a killing machine this film is more based in the real world, one where the leader of a terrorist group is more likely to hide his identity than announce it.Lively does a fantastic job here and it's a surprise that she isn't getting more high profile acting assignments. She does a believable job here changing not just in attitude but in look as well. Law does a fine job too in the role of mentor.The movie's only fault lies in the pacing. The first 30 minutes are grueling and take forever to get through. I understand it's setting things up but it could move faster. The rest of the movie doesn't pick up the pace much more but at least it includes a few action scenes. On the whole the movie is entertaining but look for a story with more depth than you'd expect and you'll get more from it."}, {"id": 175, "text": "I had a hard time with Blake Lively's English accent.

That's a quote from 2020's The Rhythm Section. Get it? Rhythm trades instruments for knives and guns with hollow point rounds. The tempo demonstrated here is mostly palatable.Anyway, The Rhythm Section is vastly underrated and kinda overrated at the same time. Many a spy/revenge thriller have come before it. Oh well. Rhythm has sloppy yet effective action scenes that come in fits and starts. The dialogue that emerges from the actors mouths is confidently pithy and that's a good thing.Sadly slotted into a January release and directed by a lady who has mostly been a cinematographer (Reed Morano), The Rhythm Section is about a woman who seeks vengeance for some terrorists who killed her parents in a past plane crash. Blake Lively plays said woman (Stephanie Patrick) and Jude Law (Iain Boyd) plays the ex-M16 agent who trains her to be an executive killer.Law and Lively give solid performances that heighten the almost a la mode material. Law channels his inner badass while Lively digs deep into character with nerve endings manifested. Normally elegant-looking and bright-eyed, Blake Lively appears a little weathered in Rhythm. I'm not kidding. Her persona was once a drug addict and a prostitute so the phrase, you look just like I feel gets a whole new meaning.Reflecting on The Rhythm Section, I was reminded of a more ratty Bourne Identity coupled with a modern-day version of 2005's Munich. In truth, Rhythm is a slow burn, globetrotter of a film with the occasional burst of extremity and a raw, in-your-face car chase that needs to be seen to be believed.

It could be me, maybe I was expecting a lot from this movie because it's directed by Reed Morano and because of its premise. I also read several reviews and saw that everybody compared this movie to a female-led James Bond. It's not. Not even close.It's a different demon of its own, and certainly not the first of its kind. Aside from the other films with a revenge theme though, the lead character is not a femme fatale, she's not a numb secret service spy gone rogue. This is a real person becoming an assassin. However the lead character, Stephanie, could have been explored a bit more. Right now, from where she's standing, the character still has some shallow parts. Stephanie's entire family was killed in a terror attack on an airplane and since then, she is feeling so helpless, and so guilty that she's essentially punishing herself by being a prostitute in a brothel in a North African country. She feels incredibly deep levels of loneliness and she can't find any motivation to live, along with the guilt of not being on that airplane with her now deceased family. Until she witnesses something that triggers something within her.The score is by Hans Zimmer which makes the viewing experience in a theatre really special. His character cues and use of different instruments based on the lead character's heart beat at that scene is very engaging. Which wraps up the title of the film with the premise. Rhythm Section refers to your heartbeat, so having carefully written music that reflects the premise really adds something special to the picture.Blake Lively is phenomenal in this movie. She really carries the entire picture whereas I found the antagonist/s to be somewhat dull and needing more development. They weren't interesting enough to carry the stakes higher and higher so the climax was not as surprising as the writer intended it to be, for me. Which bring me to Jude Law's character, which was a good one but again, could have been further developed to create a deeper connection with the viewer. The only character I cared for while watching the entire movie was Stephanie and I felt like there was so much potential for the other characters.All in all, Reed Morano's particular directing style gives the movie a scrappy look, which I believe is intentional. Perhaps the story parts that bothered me were because the screenwriter is also the author of the book this movie originates from.

Instead Morano's film is believable. Lively's bumbling assassin struggles just as an everyday person would if they'd been quickly trained to be a killer. Lively plays an unconvincing killer rather convincingly. Her character looks like she'd struggle to fight her way out of a wet paper bag never mind take on any bad guys. Stephanie Patrick (Lively) is so inept at her assassinations that she constantly nearly gets killed and leaves clues and her DNA strewn about the crime scenes as she goes about murdering her wrongdoers.Sadly even though the action scenes are realistically staged and superbly performed they are so few and far between, this film just becomes really boring really quickly. This is a sombre movie. Nothing onscreen draws the audience in. In fact it soon becomes hard to watch. Even the colour palette is muted and grey. I wanted to like this movie.

My only issue was the few questions I still had at movie's end.Blake Lively plays Stephanie Patrick, a young woman who lost her entire family in a plane explosion that was purported to be an accident. Out of the blue, when she's at her absolute lowest, a man named Keith Proctor (Raza Jaffrey) informs her that her family's death was not an accident and he knows who killed them. This not so subtle act set Stephanie off on a path of revenge.Her path led her to B (Jude Law), who trains her to be the killer she's going to need to be. After her eight month assassin crash course she goes out into the world to take out the people responsible for her family's death.She was less than proficient at killing and I appreciated that. For a person who's never killed before, even if she's angry, it's not a simple thing to just take a life. But even as difficult as it was for her, physically and emotionally, she still sallied forth to reach the principle actor in the bombing of her family's flight.So here are the questions:1.) Why did Proctor trust her enough to leave her at his place with a key? He just met her and he paid for that mistake with his life.2.) Why would B train her to be an assassin?3.) Why would B think that she was ready to be a contract killer after eight months of training?I have my theories with my main theory being that she was being set up from the beginning. I think B had a number of targets in mind and he couldn't get to them so he needed the help of a woman. Stephanie was the best choice because she could easily be motivated by revenge and she was expendable being that she was nothing more than a drug addicted prostitute. That's my theory and that is what would make it all make sense. Still, it's just a theory so I'm still left with questions.

Lively clearly wants to emphasise (once again!) her credentials as a true actress, and frankly (once again) she does well enough, IMHO. Certainly we get several transformations of appearance and personality that are dramatic and hard not to be impressed by.A bigger issue is with the film itself, which does not look cohesive as it chops and changes, is nevertheless NOT entirely without virtue, but does not seem quite sure what effect it wants to achieve.The first point here is that I was very much inclined to delete this whole thing within the first couple of minutes, because it did not seem really to be going anywhere Yet a few minutes further in it was completely clear that such drastic action would have been a mistake. Hence the first message is to not give up to quickly here, just in case - as it remains possible to regret that decision.In essence, the early scenes - dragged out as they may be - ARE worthwhile, and perhaps the main message of the film (or at least they SHOULD be). Paying some kind of homage to - for example - the 9/11 families, we see how utterly blighted survivors' and relatives' lives may be when they have lost others to wanton acts of terrorism with not fully explained circumstances. The degree to which Lively's British (!) character Stephanie is brought low by a catastrophe that ensued because the other members of the family made an adjustment for her - and she did not take the opportunity anyway - is telling.Tack on to that a further early part about a journalist's quest as to how it could be possible that the truth of the event being terrorism has been suppressed, and you then have further worthwhile (not entirely irrelevant-looking) conspiracy-theory comment. Unfortunately, then, this part of the film comes to an abrupt (dead) stop, before we head off in another direction (actually quite literally as London makes way for the Scottish Highlands (though it's in fact Ireland, but still pretty and inspiring)).Already, things are beginning to trivialise, but all hope is not yet lost... For this part of the film also has a measure of worth, as it sees an espionage veteran (played by Jude Law) train Stephanie up, having first got her back on her feet from drug addiction and general malaise. While it looks implausible, it has to be admitted that spy recruitment from the best universities among people with no family connections and little to lose is not an unknown phenomenon out here in the real world! A poignant bit here is how Stephanie is a beautiful young woman so troubled by the events that have blighted her life, and so gone off the rails, that she needs to be loved perhaps more than anyone, but cannot find that. It's touching. But it's not something Jude Law's character chooses to do anything about, in a perhaps unlikely and paradoxical fashion.After that, the movie has a number of other fine (occasionally quite gorgeous) locations, but has by then taken a James Bondish turn in other senses too. It never really recovers from that, and a kind of nadir is reached in a car chase not necessarily needed and certainly out of synch with the first half hour of the movie. Admittedly, even in this section we do learn a tiny bit about the perils of being a contract killer, and - just occasionally - Stephanie's dilemmas (and the inability to make the kill in one place at least) do somehow ring a little true. Mercy is thankfully a powerful force (even in someone yearning for revenge), though a true professional killer may not need to be troubled by it.Frankly, by this stage the movie has gone over into implausibility and does not satisfy very well ... and more to the point it is now so far from the original mood of the piece, that I personally found myself wishing for the return of what we had had earlier, which had a bit more subtlety and general merit to it.So, yes, someone who had lost their family to terrorism might suffer a great deal, might be minded to get revenge, might even achieve that revenge. But to do that by first training long and hard to become an assassin looks like one step too far into the unlikely or downright daft-looking."}, {"id": 226, "text": "A remarkable rehab clinic he's running.Maybe Blake should stop taking rolls with such dramatic water relations.She lucked out.Hey!

She sets out to find answers and justice. It's an intriguing if familiar premise, but is it worth watching?The GoodThe film has a small cast but it's leading lady carries the load easily. Blake Lively continues her upward trajectory after strong turns in The Shallows (2016) and A Simple Favor (2018). She gives a wounded performance as Stephanie, a woman whose spirit died along with her family; a still-living victim of a tragedy. Everything from her gaze to how she carries herself screams brokenness. I also liked Jude Law as Boyd, an ex MI6 recluse. He's a hard-ass mentor figure for Stephanie as he attempts to give her skills to survive on her quest for revenge. He's like Obi-Wan Kenobi if Old Ben was a jerk. He provides a more harsh, stark view of the situation, reality-checking Stephanie again and again.Another aspect of Stephanie I enjoyed was how inefficient she is as an assassin. After she completes her training and heads into the world to seek vengeance she proves to be rather ineffective. I thought she would finish training and immediately turn into a ruthless expert killer, but she proves to not be cut out for it. She lacks the moral numbness and skill to pull it off, which makes her more relatable. There's also a cool chase scene that's a continuous shot from within the vehicle. It's shot well and accompanied by a good score at times. I also appreciated the color pallet of the film, lots of muted, cold colors to reflect the bleak outlook of our protagonist.The BadThe movie has a good first act, setting up an intriguing revenge tale that fizzles out in the second. We never get to know Stephanie, she isn't given character development. She has a goal that she desperately wants to fulfill but she doesn't change as a result of achieving that goal. She's the same character by the end as she was in the beginning, only she's sober now. When a revenge film like this lacks action and style it must make up for that with character and story, and it fails on both counts. Altogether, it feels like connecting dots that never create a cohesive image.The talented Sterling K Brown is dragged into this to give information and wear glasses. He never feels like a character, he's more of a plot device. The score is good in a few scenes, but the soundtrack is off. Thirty seconds of a Velvet Underground song here and a Brenda Lee song there for fifteen seconds. It's like hitting shuffle on a varied playlist at random times. I also wish the filmmaker leaned less on flashbacks. They could have relied on the leading lady to convey the loss she feels rather than reusing the same flashback scene over and over. The script lacks emotional depth and consists mostly of exposition being traded between characters.The VerdictI don't recommend seeing The Rhythm Section. While it has a strong lead performance, the character and her story are never fleshed out, creating a rather empty experience. The film does offer a unique take on the femme fatale genre, but that's not enough to hold it up. The film is overlong and rather dull. Despite an intriguing start it never goes anywhere, and there's not much fun along the way to make up for it's lacking. It unravels into near-incoherence by the end, at which point you won't really care. You'll just wish you saw 1917 again.

Based on the trilogy of novels. About Stephanie (Blake Lively) who loses her family in a terrorist attack. Who goes out for revenge. Well this film fails to be worth watching with its uninspired story, boring characters, and a dull direction. Blake Lively is great playing a raw and torn up character. If you are looking for an awesome female action film I will suggest Atomic Blonde, Anna, or even Jennifer Garner's revenge flick Peppermint was even better than this.The plot lacks development and plot. The film begins with Stephanie, wasting away her life addicted to drugs and being a prostitute. A journalist discovers her and helps her with information about the terrorist attack that took away many lives including her family. She finds Iain (Jude Law) who trained her to be a skilled fighter and survivalist. Which then, he sends her on contracts to kill the terrorists that are responsible for the bombing.The plot is a bit boring for a revenge action thriller. Iain is sending Stephanie on assassin contracts. Trying to find the leader that was responsible. There is nothing worth mentioning about the story. It was lacking the emotional development building to even care about these characters.The direction is boring. The action was nothing worth talking about for those few scenes. It is kind of like an origin story with Stephanie being introduced to assassinating. She was vulnerable. She has difficulties in killing a bad guy. She does make some simple mistakes that would cost innocent peoples lives. Cause her emotions got in the way and distracted her.Blake Lively is good playing Stephanie. A raw and emotionally torn down girl. Jude Law was okay playing Iain, a former CIA who is obsessed in finding these terrorists as well. Sterling K. Brown playing a former CIA informant was just flat out one dimensional. And terrible.The fight scenes are forgettable. The brief car chase scene is boring. It had that one long take of a car chase but nothing worth mentioning.Overall, The Rhythm Section fails to launch an action series with Blake Lively. The story is boring. The direction failed with its boring action and forgettable characters."}, {"id": 255, "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. Kicking off a successful franchise that can sustain multiple sequels is the dream of most actors, writers, directors, and producers. When it clicks, a movie franchise can be a cash cow for many years. Unfortunately, it's just not that easy to create characters that viewers will invest in, or story lines that will keep those viewers interested. Author Mark Burnell has already published four books in his Stephanie Patrick series, and director Reed Morano brings the first one to the big screen. By the time the end credits roll, we have little doubt that franchise was the goal.An opening scene finds Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) pointing a gun at the head of a man who is unaware of her presence. A freeze frame shifts us to 8 months earlier. Stephanie is a mess. She is supporting her heroin addiction through prostitution, all with the objective of numbing her pain. Three years earlier, her family was killed in a plane crash. It's the kind of tragedy followed by a grief so devastating that Stephanie has basically given up on life.Stephanie is jolted back to life when a journalist informs her that it was a bomb planted by a terrorist that brought down the plane her family was on. Now, Stephanie has a reason to exist ... revenge. Clearly some suspension of disbelief is in order here. Actually everything about this story is a stretch from reality or even believability. Quick, name all of the heroin addicts who become world class assassins in 8 months. OK, that's probably not a fair question since you likely don't know many heroin addicts, and you hopefully don't know many assassins. But you get the point.The film plays like a brochure for a travel agent, as the story and Stephanie have stops in Tangier, England, Ireland, Madrid, New York, and Marseilles. Each stop is pretty brief - merely long enough for some killing. Of course most of the stops occur after former MI6 agent Ian Boyd (Jude Law) trains her on the finer points of being a contract killer. The training includes jogging uphill, a frigid lake swim, how to fight in the kitchen, how to get run off the road while driving, and the invaluable advice to shoot your victim twice (but your teacher only once). Oh yes, and she has to impersonate a presumed-dead assassin. Fortunately, Stephanie was top of her class at Oxford, so she is smart enough to make sense of all these things that make no sense to us.And another thing ... why do all these people have such perfect and complete files on their targets? Photographs by Glamour Shots, map coordinates to hideouts, and an alphabetical list of known accomplices are all quite helpful when former MI6 and former CIA agents (Sterling K Brown) are trying to get a heroin addict to do their dirty work. Brown's CIA agent turned 'information broker' is the oddest of many odd characters here. He lives in a stunning ultra-modern home and has no qualms about hitting on hot assassins that he knows only by reputation. Thanks to all those marvelously complete files, the only unknown here is the mysterious U17. Well, U17 seems to be mysterious to everyone except those watching the movie.Blake Lively is a talented actress as evidenced by her work in THE TOWN, THE SHALLOWS, and A SIMPLE FAVOR. She is simply miscast here. Despite the training her Stephanie received from Ian, we never once believe she is ready to kill all the bad guys. This contributes heavily to the lack of believability presented by the film. It's a serious story that is ultimately impossible to take seriously as a viewer.There is a difference in believable and stylish, and director Reed Morano certainly serves up style. She is known mostly for her work as a cinematographer, though she did direct the first 3 episodes of The Handmaid's Tale. Ms. Morano and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt hit us with some jarring camera work, and the musical inserts are just a tad too cutesy and obvious at their given time: I'm Sorry, It's Now or Never, and Where Did You Sleep Last Night? (a cover by Sleigh Bells).Having author Mark Burnell adapt his own novel may have been a mistake, as there are far too many plot holes and ridiculous moments for this to work as any type of thriller. Here are three examples: we never know why Stephanie didn't get on the flight with her family; it makes little sense that the journalist tracked her down; and is that supposed to be a twist or not? Given the inclusion of Bond producers (and half-siblings) Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson (stepson of Cubby Broccoli), we can safely assume that the vision was to turn Mr. Burnell's books into a franchise along the lines of James Bond and Jason Bourne - right down to the fight scenes and international settings. This film certainly sets things up for round two, and if that happens, let's hope more attention is paid to the script ... a crucial element if viewers are expected to buy in."}, {"id": 256, "text": "Could not make it to the end. Lively is not box office material because she's a so-so actress. Nothing great since Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants which was very endearing. A Simple Favor and The Shallows were great stories executed well, but people did not go to those movies to see Blake.She was probably the only name actress desperate enough for such a part, willing to score another one for affirmative action, diversity, and victim-hood. But she drew the short straw with this debacle. Most do not see heroin and other dalliances as inevitable choices after personal tragedy.I am biased. Atomic Blond is the gold standard now. It is the great spy/revenge film where a stunning Charlize Theron did her own stunts. She had long, unedited fight scenes. Plus, the story was brilliant and the ending superb. This one shows up the clunker actress as wrong for the part and not willing to go the distance in preparation. She does not have the physicality, presence, or skills necessary so it is over-edited.

In the case of this year's The Rhythm Section, it fits that description perfectly. This movie seemed promising to me from its trailers, so I was quite surprised about how I felt after watching it. While there is a lot of good hidden somewhere under the surface, here's why I feel this absolutely misses the mark and why I just can't recommend it to anyone.Following Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) after a plane crash killed her entire family, she discovers that it was a planned event and seeks out a man that will help her track down the criminals responsible. While that premise can lend itself to a very exciting film, The Rhythm Section is an example of how you can also completely miss the mark. Focussing too heavily on being dramatic and character-driven, this movie feels like an eternity to sit through. The pacing is horrible and the main character, even though well-performed by Lively, is just plain boring. This is the type of character that can win you an Oscar if written well enough, but everything about this movie felt under-developed.After the first act, Stephanie joins up with Iain Boyd (Jude Law), who helps her get into fighting shape. The problem is that the film itself is so convoluted that it becomes questionable as to how she even knows where to go in order to find him. On top of that, there's a character by the name of Mark Serra (Sterling K. Brown) who's introduced about an hour or so into the film, who feels like a character that has come from nowhere. All of a sudden, he's now pivotal to the story, with little to no development whatsoever. I found this to be very annoying and made no sense in context with the rest of the movie. It was clear that this character should've been a presence from the beginning of the movie.Director Reed Morano has been known for great, subtle camera work on films like The Skeleton Twins and Kill Your Darlings, as well as directing episodes of great television shows like Billions and The Handmaid's Tale. I actually believe the direction here was pretty solid, due to the great performances she pulled out of these performers, but it really came down to the screenplay for me. This movie is a prime example of needing more than one writer. Written by Mark Burnell, who also penned the novel that this film an adaptation of, it almost feels counterproductive when you make a movie and have the same writer choose what elements will translate best. Sometimes a novel just doesn't translate directly to the screen and this movie truly does feel like you're slowly reading a novel, which was a real shame.In the end, The Rhythm Section begins with promise but ultimately goes nowhere in terms of providing a satisfying experience for its audience. I found myself wanting to care about who she was going after, but the movie was too bogged down in being overly dramatic. Even in moments of action, it just had a very slow feel to it. Blake Lively and Jude Law were really good in the movie and it was well-directed for the most part, but wow was it ever boring, uneventful, and sloppily put together. I feel like an entirely different film could've been made from this exact same storyline. I can't get myself to recommend it to anyone."}, {"id": 259, "text": "... you would be inclined to set this movie within this scope of references. It is also a revenge movie as it is an 'origin' story of a Jane Bond type of character.What sets this movie apart from the ones mentioned above is a different pacing (for which some seem to fault it, yet, it is the movie's strength). The dramatic, fast-cut trailer sort of oversells the action, yet, it is a trailer, so viewers come in with certain expectations, naturally.Blake Lively plays a vulnerable woman, not a super-human assassin. She does not turn suddenly into one.In fact, all the fight and action sequences in this movie - as well choreographed and timed, as in any good action flic - have her succeeding, besides the odds against her. The action is based on unpredictability and accidents, which let her survive one more day, to move on.It is believable in a way many other movies (including the one's mentioned above) turn them into comic heroine music videos (Atomic Blonde), or a superhuman (Hanna), or into way to polished sequences, topping tops on top of tops, marinating in their own excellence (Anna, the god-awful Red Sparrow and of course Mendes' James Bond movies, etc, etc.)The overall story, while predictable, does not try to throw sudden red herrings at you, but stays the course to a satisfying ending. I have not read the novel by Mark Burnell (who also wrote the script for the movie).Make-up on the main character in the early part of the movie is remarkable. The music score is excellent, sound design is good, being part of the narrative.Cinematography and editing are well crafted. Blake Lively (whom I have not watched in her early TV career) owns the screen. There are two-three early, short scenes where she convincingly plays someone who was physically abused (by men) due to the circumstances we find her in (will not spoil it for you).The wardrobe of the main character stands out throughout the movie. Jude Law has a fun part in this one. All other actors doing a great job making their characters believable, with the little time they have on screen.If you like to watch movies more than once and even like to analyze them - frame by frame - this one is worth it."}, {"id": 260, "text": "The Rhythm Section (2020 release; 109 min.) brings the story of Stephanie. As the movie opens, we are in Tangiers and Stephanie has carefully entered a house and confronts a guy with her gun. We then go to 8 Months Earlier, London, where Stephanie is approached by a freelance journalist who claims to know what happened to the flight that crashed 3 years ago, killing all 239 people on board, including Stephanie's parents and siblings. After initially rebuking the journalist's approach, Stephanie changes her mind and decides to listen to him... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from cinematographer-director Reed Morano (she is best known for her work on the Billions and The Handmade's Tale TV series). Here she brings Mark Burnell's novel of the same name to the big screen. I haven't read the novel, so I cannot comments on how closely the move sticks to the book. What I can tell you is that the movie is a flop on every imaginable level. And this is not for a lack of trying. In fact the movie clearly sports a big budget, including multiple locations (London, Inverness, Surrey, Madrid, Tangiers). But two specific things sink the movie: first the script is incredibly weak, with a plot that makes no sense and/or has holes in it the size of Manhattan. At some point early on, Stephanie (played by Blake Lively goes to Inverness, where she encounters Ian (played by Jude Law). I'm sorry, but who is Ian? I was never able to figure that out. And the dialogue isn't much better. How would you provide closure? someone asks Stephanie. Violently, she responds. What?!? Second factor sinking the movie: much of the movie features extreme close-ups AND hand-held camera work, which makes for a headache-inducing cocktail. I feel sorry for the cast. Blake Lively, otherwise such a strong performer, tries the make the best of a terrible situation, but she simply looks lost (besides being twitchy a lot). Jude Law appears and then disappears.The Rhythm Section opened wide this weekend, and based upon the intriguing-looking trailer, and of course being a fan of Lively and Law, I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended dismally (exactly 2 people, including myself), and it appears the rest of the country didn't care much for this either, as the movie completely bombed at the box office ($2.8 mill., the worst opening weekend ever for a movie on 3,000+ screens). I honestly cannot recommend this movie in good conscience to anyone, but of course I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."}, {"id": 261, "text": "First Hit: This is Blake Lively's (as Stephanie Patrick) movie from beginning to end.Blake Lively can act, and here we see how good she can be.The story opens by letting us know that Patrick is a lost soul. She is slowly destroying herself by using heroin and supporting this habit through prostitution. We learn that Stephanie has turned to this life of self-destruction because she lost her entire family in a suspicious plane crash three years earlier. She was supposed to be on that plane.A reporter named Keith Proctor (Raza Jaffrey) comes to the brothel and buys time with Stephanie so that he can speak with her about what he's working on. Proctor is investigating who are the people who planted the bomb on the plane that killed her parents. Patrick, unsure of Procter's real intention, dashes out of the room and gets the house bouncer to physically throw Proctor out. She doesn't want to be reminded of her pain.However, Proctor left his business card, and as Patrick gets ready to hit up with another dose of smack, she decides to bolt out of the brothel ending up at Proctor's London apartment. The verbal sparring here is wonderfully done because Proctor holds his ground of just wanting to get more information and to give Patrick information about what really happened to the plane. Patrick, on the other hand, is utterly scared about having to face her own demons and re-live the emotional loss of her family.Proctor has a room where there is a photo of each of the plane crash victims along with piles of folders containing information and evidence about what really happened on that plane. It includes information about who ordered the bombing, who made the bomb, and who set it off.Getting the name of the person who built the bomb, Raza (Tawfeek Barhom), Patrick sets out to find him and get payback. But as she confronts Rasa face to face, in a moment of panic she cannot pull the trigger. However, because he's now been discovered, Raza finds and takes it out on Proctor.With Proctor no longer being able to help, Patrick uses one more bit of information from the files she took from Proctor's apartment, a location on a map. Traveling to this location in a remote norther area of Scotland, she finds Iain Boyd B (Jude Law), a former MI6 agent.She convinces B that she is going to kill the bomb maker and all the people associated with the bombing of the plane and asks him to train her. Skeptical of Stephanie's abilities, B relents and teaches her how to shoot, fight, and keep fit while also giving her information on where she might find Raza and the unknown mastermind.The thing that is most compelling in this story is how slowly we see Patrick's incremental change from strung-out addict (pale, thin, haunting eyes, and bruised up) to someone who is not a fighting machine but a healthier person. We see her dive to right the wrong to her family and assuage her underlying guilt for not being on the plane with them.Like an everyday person, Patrick never overwhelms anyone when she's fighting, she's authentically fighting for her life. She's appropriately scared and clearly driven. And this is what makes this story engaging as Stephanie makes her way to find and resolve her family's death.All the scenes are well shot from the car chase scene to her training with B to the bus explosion. However, it is the time with Marc Serra (Sterling K. Brown), especially their last scene, where we see that Stephanie Patrick has learned what she needs to learn about herself and her abilities. She has freed herself from her past.Lively is absolutely mesmerizing as this character. It is the grittiest role I've seen her in, and she nails it. Law is terrific as the elusive former MI6 Agent put to pasture. His direct approach to helping Patrick was excellent. Brown was engagingly cagey and incredible as the former CIA agent who sells information to bad people. Jaffrey was wonderful as the news reporter wanting to get to the truth. Mark Burnell wrote a powerful and pointedly direct script. Reed Morano got the best out of the actors while engagingly directing scenes keeping the audience fully engaged the entire time.Overall: I really liked the way this story came together and the acting, all around, was superb."}, {"id": 262, "text": "TRS was probably never meant to be another take at Bond?Jack Reacher or god forbidd - M:I genre. not that those movies are bad - they do deliver, but (apart from Casino Royale, at least in most parts) in a rather 'out of touch kind' of way. if anything, imho it was steered more towards Spy Games, perhaps with a tad more psychological touch.so has it worked out? yes and no. the movie could've benefitet from a bit more screening time - the first part takes time to develop the story, but once the main action kicks in, it ends quickly. I'd love to see more about Lively's character, Stephanie, development as an assasin/spy, although her first 'job' was really done well (cinematicly speaking). this movie was evidently cut to fit a given timeframe, and that leaves us with wanting to know and experience more about Stephanie.same goes with Jude Law's character, that's insturmental but the movie doesn't really even scratch the surface of this possibly very interesting and deep character. the mystery man behind the bombings - that was too fast too easy too. we haven't really got to know them, which is a shame really.at this point it would only be a 6, maybe 7-star movie, but Blake Lively made all the difference. her acting is superb, I had so much pleasure watching her playing without any false note. I hope this role is a breakthrough in her career, because she clearly can achieve greatness. it's easily a 9-star performance.there were complaints about camera work or directing here too - well, I really liked how certain scenes were filmed, especially the car chase, where a 'shaky' camera corresponded well with Stephanie's clear lack of skills, confusion and sort of helplessness. I like how she's being portrayed throughout the whole film, having this semi-detached experession of hers collapsing into insecurity and fear in a matter of a single frame.I bet if rewievs were kinder, this could be a start of a really solid franchise. I'd really like to see a more inteligent take on the genre, without a trillion-dollar budget, and all those breathtaking silly stunts, and mostly - a female lead character. but I guess my wish won't materialize, and I wonder how different viewers' and critics' response would've been, if this was another story about an ex-marine played by Wahlberg, Statham or someone like that...anyway, 6/7 for the film alone and 9 for Blake Lively make it 7,5-8 in my book. it's by far the best action/drama movie I've seen in a very long time, and one I'll definitely miss not having a follow-on."}, {"id": 263, "text": "I'm always a little skeptical when I see that a book's author has adapted his own screenplay. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all a screenplay has to be very different to a novel for a number of obvious reasons. Novels are about filling the void with endless details and painting a picture in people's minds using as many words as you can. Where as in a film the rule is show, don't tell. Meaning things should speak for themselves. This film has a lot of over-explaining and unnecessary dialogue. Secondly, authors get too attached to the material they've written in the book and want to force it into the film. This film wasn't too bad in that respect, although I would've killed for them to cut 20 minutes off the runtime so I didn't have to watch it.The movie sets up a premise, and we the audience feel like we should care, but the movie just makes it so hard to by being incredibly bland and uninteresting. It's like, okay this girl has a really interesting back-story and a good genuine reason to want some payback, so why do I not give a hoot? The characters feel like book characters. They are more interested in getting information out there, than actually being interesting to listen to and watch. The film also has almost zero humour and any that it does attempt is never funny.This was not the right type of role for Blake Lively. She has her looks going for her usually, but even that they took away from her in this film. She was extremely bland to watch and completely unrealistic in the action/fight sequences she's supposedly dominating. This film flopped extremely hard at the box office and it's not hard to imagine why. A terrible title, extremely bland trailers, no interesting actors and certainly no good word of mouth. Stay well away from 'The Rhythm Section'. This one isn't pretty."}, {"id": 264, "text": "Revenge stories are the archetypal foundation of the over-saturated celebrity-with-a-gun-and-a-mission brand of cinema. 'The Rhythm Section', which features Mark Burnell who wrote the book this film is based on as its screenwriter, sees Blake Lively as the distraught and downtrodden Stephanie Patrick, seeking vengeance for the death of her family in an airline crash which isn't what it seems. Director Reed Morano tries to convince us that this film is something more, something deeper than just the typical personal journey towards retribution. Yet 'The Rhythm Section' ultimately fails to find its own rhythm in amongst all the chaos and confusion.The film's first act is slow but grounded, laying the foundations of the story adequately enough to propel the narrative forward. We open with Stephanie, who has resorted to drugs and prostitution in the years succeeding the crash. But after a journalist comes to her with information suggesting it wasn't an accident, she seeks the help of a man known only as B (Jude Law) to exact revenge on those responsible for her family's death.Lively does a sound job of portraying this tortured soul but isn't allocated half as much time as necessary to really get to know the character. Superficiality and convenience take precedence instead; Stephanie's backstory is reduced to a series of what seem to be phone-camera montages of her late family, plonked carelessly into the narrative as flashbacks. To make matters more artificial, she manages to transform from a heroin addict into a trained - if heavily flawed - assassin in just 8 months, which demands significant suspense of disbelief (and not in the fun way that the 'John Wick' franchise requires with all its brilliant, hyperbolised killing-sprees).'The Rhythm Section' also lacks any sort of style or finesse. Admittedly, it's well shot - there is a stimulating car chase scene executed in one take - but for a revenge film such as this to be so brief with its action, it must make up for in character development and flair. Morano can't quite tune the film with enough precision to elevate a derivative and predictable plot structure and doesn't deliver on the hinted psychological impacts this lifestyle might have on someone who is clearly hanging on by a thread.The film, therefore, is as muddled and out of its depth as its central character - a serious story which is difficult to take seriously. Despite the author of the book penning the screenplay, 'The Rhythm Section' is a protracted ride which plods awkwardly towards an obvious conclusion, rarely swaying from the confounds of its self-imposed clich\u00e9-fest."}, {"id": 265, "text": "I just got out of Rhythm SectionThere is not much new here.

It's somber tone and pacing problems make this pretty boring at times. Due to its plodding pace, I was certain this clocked it over 2 hours... but it's about 1 hr 45.One of my main problems was Blake Lively, I didn't care for her character, in fact I outright disliked her!! Considering she is out for revenge due to her innocent family being killed, she caused a lot of collateral damage to innocent people.Huge nitpick for me was she left her blood and finger prints at a lot of the crime scenes and it has some awful precisctable dialogue.It does have some things going for it, I like how she never actually becomes a great assassin in fact she is pretty awful (as any normal person suddenly trying to kill people would be) and there is a good scene where Jude Law trains Blame Livley in combat and it's all done in one take.

In The Rhythm Section heroine Stephanie/Lisa (Blake Lively) loses family (father, mother and two siblings) in a plane tragedy and seeks revenge on those who plotted the crash. Kate Beckinsale and Angelina Jolie have played bloody roles before but not with such intensity and lack of style as Lively.As Mike LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle wrote about Lively: She kicks this superior thriller up an extra notch, to the point that it's not only worth seeing for thrills, but for her. Although the revenge tropes are well represented, she brings a seriousness and a rough charm to make her my favorite even beyond the many sparkles of Nikita.Using her default to drug abuse and prostitution as dramatic character points, Lively brings her character back, though never to the glamor of her characters in The Shallows or A Simple Favor. She looks like a shabby, grief-stricken woman with little clue about the dangerous world she has stepped into.Jude Law playing M16 rogue agent Boyd is effective as her reluctant mentor; it's just that Stephanie has a drive and intelligence that mostly doesn't need a male to give her success. Martial skills he gives her, but even he knows she will always be vulnerable Stephanie/Lisa, who has a better chance now to survive and even to cause mayhem, even though initially reluctant to pull the trigger.Director Reed Morano, after her Handmaid's Tale success, includes some on-point songs like I'm Sorry and Dream a Little Dream, and he has a chase scene as good as any even in Fast and Furious. The repetitious soft-focus flashbacks could have mostly been left out. However, relying on Lively's expert expression, he fills the screen with her closeups, not a bad choice to entertain us as we all pursue some bad mid-Easterners with her.The Rhythm Section is an enjoyable thriller that reminds us, like The Silence of the Lambs, this movie time of year does not have to be dull."}, {"id": 269, "text": "Where to start..........it honestly feels like two different movies in one. Almost as if the Indie Director started it but had to leave it to the Hollywood AD to finish. The first half was dark and gritty with a realism often only found in in the saddest of tales. Think Trainspotting with more than a hint of inspiration from The Place Beyond The Pines. They set the tone well and paint the characters perfectly, with a clear path to investment for the viewer. You couldn't help but care for the main protagonist, superbly played by Lively. Then there's her mentor, also played to a key by the always brilliant Law. After an all too familiar training montage which ticks all the boxes, the movie ticks over to Hollywood AD and off our heroine goes to fulfil her role as justifiable avenger. This is where the movie starts to swerve a bit and where I would say stick with it for the eventual evolution. The soundtrack is perfect, the story just this side of believable and the gritty realism perfectly enhanced with fantastic locations for each set piece.

Never knowing why she didn't get on the plane with her family, but Stephanie's life was one of love and happiness with them.But coping with survivor's grief sent Stephanie into a downwards spiral of self-loathing, eased by heroin addiction and paid for on her back in a brothel. And that's where Raza Jaffrey's freelance journalist Kevin Proctor finds her. Her family were not killed in the tragic air crash he tells her, but by a bomb. With the truth, and killer, hidden by our government. Let's pretend our government doesn't have any evidence that Tawfeek Barhom's Reza built the bomb, so he is at large, or maybe they just don't have enough police to follow him. Anyway they vehemently deny it was a bomb. Who are they protecting? If indeed it actually happened. And initially Stephanie doesn't believe it either. But when she sees detailed research in Kevin's flat, it fires her up, and armed with a seriously ill advised illegal gun, she stalks Reza in his university cafeteria. After making eye-contact, but unable to take the shot, Reza escapes.If Stephanie is going to track this gone to ground killer down, she needs serious training with Kevin's source at MI6, B, played by an off grid Jude Law in the Highlands. Producer Barbara Broccoli suggests Stephanie is possibly a female Bond for women, but if so she needs to toughen up. Our heroin addicted prostitute has some hard training ahead of her before she can pass herself off as an assassin. And meet with B's contact, ex-CIA operative Serra, played by Sterling K. Brown. It has shades of Bond when the marks take Stephanie around the world. Her kick-ass ineptitude is endearing, but she's no Baby Driver, instead the Rhythm Section is suggested by B to control her breathing during her hits. But in this new profession, indecision is likely to get you killed. Or someone else.I have enjoyed watching Blake Lively since The Age Of Adeline, and here she is equally watchable with Jude Law, and gives her all. But the story line went a bit AWOL midway, with who did what, when and why, and in between the great stunt work by Blake and the stunt team, the big reveal was a bit of a let down. Casting my eye over the book tends to imply that there is much more to the story than the film run time allowed. And if the books continue to be filmed then I'm all up for more Stephanie Patrick. And the ending did leave an opening for more."}, {"id": 271, "text": "I watched this tonight before it comes out on Friday. This movie is really 30-45 minutes too long. I blame flashbacks. The movie tried too hard to make us remember the grieving process the main character was experiencing. After the 20th flashback, I seriously questioned what the director was thinking. Did he think we were suffering from the same disease as Memento?The scenery was great. The action was ok. The camera work decisions were questionable. When the character was running or driving, we got what I would call running with an iPhone cam. It was very distracting and it took you out of the movie.So, should you see this movie? I would say not in theaters. I would save this for Netflix where you can watch several movies for a flat rate. I really hoped that it would be better. The marketing team destroyed a big plot point in the trailer for the movie. It would have been cool to see a female Jason Bourne. With a different director and better pacing, we could have had that."}, {"id": 272, "text": "I don't normally leave reviews for many movies but I felt I had to leave one for 'The Rhythm Section' as it turns out to be so much better than the reviews on here would suggest. It's true that if you enjoy popcorn rollercoaster movies like 'John Wick' or 'Atomic Blonde', you may find this movie too slow or lacking in action. Personally I find action movies like the ones I have just mentioned to be very boring and to me they are like watching somebody else playing a video game on an indestructible cheat mode. If on the other hand, you don't have attention deficit disorder, if you have ever read a book, if don't get bored when there's not a gunfight or car chase every ten minutes, then you may well enjoy this one. This is a slow burn atmospheric movie. It does have action including killings, car chases and explosions but they are not over the top and unbelievable. They take a while to arrive but when they come they are incredibly tense as they have an air of (relative) realism. The cinematography is great. The film is beautifully lit with lots of atmosphere and natural light. I've read reviews complaining about a 'shaky cam' style of filming (which is something that I personally don't like). But I was relieved to find that's just not true. I was only aware of handheld shaky style footage during less than one minute of a chase sequence. The acting is great from both Blake Lively who is brilliant and on screen for most of the movie, and also from Jude Law. Overall I'd call this the thinking person's revenge thriller. If you like films which have a bit of art to them such as Lynne Ramsay's 'You Were Never Really Here', then you will probably enjoy 'The Rhythm Section'. If you need dumb wall to wall action instead, well there are already so many films which cater to you."}, {"id": 273, "text": "In brief: This is nothing but a hormone soaked remake of American Assassin.*minor spoilers ahead* - nothing major - the movie itself is so spoiled, there is really no hope of recovering from the shambling mess that it isHere's a brief synopsis. The grief-stricken victim of a plane crash (Lively) which took her family, vows to become an assassin after being told by a journalist that the plane's downing was a terrorist attack. She somehow manages to link up with a rogue MI-6 agent (Jude Law), whose address, indeed exact coordinates are simply lying around in the journos flat. Jude takes her under his wing and develops her from a whiny drug-addicted prostitute to whiny killer in a few months. His sparse quarters in the Scottish hinterland somehow have all the appurtenances of a military training camp, including a full-on gun range with a human-like target course, along with an unlimited supply of normally illegal ammunition. Bear in mind, guns, by and large are illegal in the UK.Unfortunately for all involved, no matter the amount of training, this is an assassin who is more competent at hysterical screaming and emotional outbursts than any combat or killing. Meet the world's first squeamish and morally upright assassin, for whom killing even the most dastardly of evil-doers is just a step too far.The movie is just awful. A writhing mess of face-palm moments, the saving grace of which is that they are so inept and incredulous, you feel compelled to watch just to see how much more ridiculous the whole thing will get. The so called plot itself is written by someone who has never seen a spy movie nor has any inkling of the basics of how the espionage-ridden underworld of spies actually works. If they did, well, they have a funny way of showing it. You don't need to be a CIA expert to realize the plot is laughably inadequate, and that the character profile of the person swearing death and vengeance upon the terrorists, is in fact, no more capable of executing such a mission than the average housewife around the block, that too, without any training. She spends most of the time looking morose and in a grieving fugue state than providing any level of confidence that the months of training invested in her are worth any trainers time.Perhaps the biggest mystery is why the rogue MI6 agent sends her, despite her obvious inadequacies, to execute missions, rather than doing them himself, as he obviously has nothing better to do. And despite kicked-out of from MI6, he still somehow manages to stay abreast of every minute-to-minute development in the terrorist landscape, feeding her times, dates, names and locations of of people to meet to get to the root of the terrorist web. The internet connection in the desolate lochs of Scotland must be phenomenal.The cinematography though is surprisingly good - esp the first person POV camerawork in a car chase scene, one where Blake is hysterically screaming in terror that she's being shot at, while being chased after she accidentally does manage to kill someone with a great deal of difficulty (a wheelchair bound wheezing villain who needs oxygen at set intervals).Bottom line is that this movie is just an awful soapy attempt at a revenge thriller. The fashion and trend these days is to have female leads, and make them look and feel empowered to make up for the past stereotyping - make them more than a match for James Bond or Jason Bourne - as Noomi Rapace tried to do in the much better film Close. This movie does the opposite - reinforces the stereotypes of the 60s screaming, hysterical, estrogen-filled overly emotional female who faints at the sight of blood. It comes off more as Jason Bourne meets Eat Pray Love. It does improve near the end, but not enough. Not enough."}, {"id": 274, "text": "Blake Lively's latest is a problematic retread of La Femme Nikita as we follow the surviving member of a British family (they've been killed in a plane crash) as she seeks justice (a reporter informs her the initial report of the plane's accidental crash was actually the work of a terrorist) for their deaths. Thinking she can conduct her wave of revenge on her own backfires nearly immediately when she tracks down the bomb maker only to freeze up when she can't pull the trigger which causes her prey to track down the journalist (Lively gleaned information from his copious notes of the nasty deed) killing him.

Along the way she meets up w/an ex-CIA information peddler, played by Sterling K.

Wanting to have it both ways is never going to engender an audience's sympathies w/our heroine's plight since in this kind of story the moral ambiguities are usually front &amp; center &amp; never this mewling. Lively, who has carved out a nice niche for herself by picking projects which work to her strengths (like A Simple Favor or the Age of Adaline), seems to be at odds on what type of film this wants to be &amp; as is the cliche about shooting the target you aim at, this film's sights are definitely off."}, {"id": 275, "text": "After her family died in an airplane crash, Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) becomes inconsolable and her life goes quickly off the rails. However, when she's informed that the crash wasn't a crash but a bombing, she sets off on a path of revenge that leads her to be trained by an ex-MI6 agent (Jude Law) to kill those responsible... Although 'The Rhythm Section' has the credentials of a Bond movie - it's about spies, it's set in exotic locations, it's by EON Productions - it's far closer to an arthouse effort than a big-budget blockbuster. In fact, drafting in Reed Morano - who's made her career in stylish TV shows like 'The Handmaid's Tale', 'Halt and Catch Fire' and 'Billions' - speaks to an attempt to create something that's far more considered than just plain old explosions and gadgets.On the surface, 'The Rhythm Section' has everything going for it. Blake Lively in a serious, meaty role with an upcoming director, in a genre that's crying out for new perspectives - but the problem with it is that you've pretty much seen it all before. Compared to something like 'Atomic Blonde', there's something much different going on, but it's not helped by the lack of flow to it and the humdrum script and plot.It's a shame, as Blake Lively is trying her hardest to make it work and Reed Morano is absolutely a director worth watching. Sadly, Mark Burnell's script and plotting is far too clumsy and clunky to be helped, and doesn't always hit the mark where it should. Still, how Morano handles the action is fascinating and how Lively plays it is rich and authentic. There are no big, sweeping action setpieces and the fight sequences are messy, bloody affairs and done with little flourish - but that helps to make it all the more convincing.The supporting cast, made up of the likes of Jude Law, Sterling K. Brown, Raza Jaffrey, all do their work well, but it's Lively's show and she's more than capable of carrying the story. Sadly, that story's a little bit too hokey and flat for it to be anything other than just OK. The female-assassin trope is well-trodden, and in recent years, the likes of 'Killing Eve' have given it a fresh perspective. 'The Rhythm Section' has that behind and in front of the camera, but on the page and in the script, it's kind of a let down.

Unfortunately the script is poorly written and is really 2 slow acts of building up the Femme Nikita character or more aptly the Prozac Brunette and the 3rd act finally gets some rhythm yet that is the only section worth watching. Blake does her best to keep it alive but its impossible with so little depth to the film, esp with Reeds dreadful directing and so many close ups and shaky camera moves it just does not work in this story. I love Reeds other films but action is definitely not her gig. Broccoli family should stick to James Bond films. The Jane Bond film idea requires a much better well rounded character building / action script and this one is highly unrealistic, lacks any depth of character and there are so many holes it puts you to sleep. Plus Blake gets her ass kicked more times than she delivers and somehow the writer thought this was a solid idea for a female driven Bond/Bourne film. It is shocking this film was made esp for 50M budget. It feels like a 10M budget film esp the way it was directed. It is a shame as the casting was unique and after watching Blake in The Shallows was really excited to see her in another exciting action movie. I give it a 4 for Blake/Jude acting skills."}, {"id": 277, "text": "The Rhythm Section was a film a long time coming. First announced in 2017, and made by Eon, the filmmakers behind the James Bond films, it looked to be an intriguing sideways step into the genre by the company. Yet the film was here and gone in the blink of an eye, and it's only been with it coming to streaming that this reviewer had the chance to see it.So was it worth the wait?Unquestionably, it's a film that had plenty going for it. There's Blake Lively, for example, as its protagonist Stephanie Patrick, a young British woman whose life has gone on a tailspin dive following her family's death in a plane crash. A crash that, three years later, she learns from a journalist wasn't an accident but a terrorist bombing. The film is very much a revenge thriller thanks to that revelation, but it's also the journey of Lively's Patrick from a depressed drug-addict prostitute to a woman with just enough skill to keep her from getting herself killed. Indeed, Patrick is a refreshing protagonist for the very reason that she's an outsider who, once she gets a bit of training, gets thrown into the field without turning into a flawless killing machine. Indeed, it's only through sheer luck at times that she manages to make out in more or less one piece, battered, bruised, and never entirely sure if her path is the right one. It's Lively's performance that keeps the character from being, as the character of Jude Law's Boyd, puts it, a cliche, and into someone worth following, at least for 106 minutes.The film's got other things in its favor. Sean Bobbitt's cinematography offers plenty of visually appealing elements, particularly during a lengthy section of the film set in Scotland. You'll find no better capturing of the harsh but beautiful side of that country this side of Skyfall than you will here. There are also some nicely staged action sequences, including a car chase in Tangiers that we see entirely from inside the perspective of Patrick's getaway car, which puts a nice spin on a potentially cliched sequence. It's a wonderfully visceral experience on the small screen that would have been interesting to see in a cinema. Likewise, the film has a large but engaging supporting cast including the aforementioned Jude Law as the former MI6 operative who takes Patrick under his wing when she tracks him down, Raza Jaffrey as the journalist who sets events in motion, and Sterling K. Brown as her eventual contact the ex-CIA agent turned information broker. Combined with direction from the award-winning Reed Morano, one would have thought the film would be a sure-fire hit, surely?Unfortunately, not. The Rhythm Section has two significant issues, which rather weakens it. The first lies in its pacing, with the film's opening hour being rather slow, overloaded as it is with exposition that undermines both performances and that wonderful cinematography I mentioned. Once the film gets into its latter 45 minutes or so, it suffers from the exact opposite problem, rushing along from one action sequence and character beat to the next, with a pair of significant plot twists becoming essentially throwaway moments without any weight to them. It leaves the film feeling oddly disjointed, if not confusing.That's something that likely has to do with the second issue I alluded to earlier. When I read that the film had been adapted from the opening novel in a series, the film's odd-pacing clicked into place. The Rhythm Section suffers from a problem that many a would-be franchise opener suffers from: namely, trying to tell an origin story at the expense of telling a compelling narrative. Even though it's comparatively short at 106 minutes, it's a film that feels significantly longer thanks to an overloaded front half, which leaves the back half feeling rushed and short-changed.If this was intended to be the opener for a franchise, it's one that ultimately never quite delivers what's needed. Not that it isn't worth seeing, far from it. Lively's performance, the entire cast for that matter, along with the cinematography, and some nicely staged action pieces make it worth checking out. But, there's a lot of potential here that doesn't get put to its fullest use.Perhaps the best way to look at this film, then, is to say, Oh, what might have been..."}, {"id": 278, "text": "Failed to deliver, mostly 2 hours of a close up of her face, unrealistic and boring action scenes (well only 1 action scene I can remember), plot was slow and just boring.

This leads her directly into a global crusade of vengeance, with the help of a former M16 Agent (Jude Law).First off, the execution is great. Reed Morano directs gritty scenes with an indie flair and an intense realism to them. Her style uses a lot of darkness and silhouettes to set the scene, refraining from the urge to light up the place just to make it seem more slick. One car chase in particular stood out as a one-take like shot that was really impressive.Blake Lively commands the leading role. She portrays the broken Stephanie so perfectly and it's refreshing seeing an action lead fall flat on her face so much. It's never easy for the character during the fight scenes. Her chemistry with Law is also really great to watch.The story is by the numbers with twists and turns that don't really gain an emotional response or a surprising one.

There's not an ounce of emotional investment that is likely to be drawn out of viewers as the stories mysterious and totally unengaging plot rages on around Patrick, a plot that includes nefarious terrorists, Sterling K.

The movie feels jumbled and a bit confusing and never really finds it's way.

Law is a strength in this film and it's mainly his physical menacing presence that moves the film forward. The model of the film relies much too much on the Homeland series, having a flawed--though strong--female central to an action film. But the tone and cinematography is consistent and artful. It uses a formula that's not original: car chase, brutally and lengthy hand-to-hand combat, a surprise that is anticipated because nothing else much is going on, frequent scenic set pieces (Inverness is spectacular).What is touching is the impact of the loss Lively's character experiences (although, I kept thinking, Good thing not everyone reacts to tragedy by reaching for the crack pipe).

This film is very boring and feels basic for a large amount of time. When its lifeless, its hard to really stay invested in the story, especially when it feels like not much goes on for a bulk of the film. The film hits Action thriller led by a female lead cliches as we go along. I can see what the filmmaker was going for but unfortunately there isn't enough action or entertainment to really get viewers hearts racing. The studio was unsure what to do with this film and it turns out it will be just an after thought as soon as you leave the theater. Just a very unremarkable film.5.5/10"}, {"id": 290, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Produced by the same company that works on the James Bond films, The Rhythm Section went through tough production issues. Blake Lively injured herself on set, consequently delaying the movie until the end of 2019, and then again to the well-known trash month, so obviously, my expectations were quite low. It's the first time I watch a feature film directed by Reed Morano, as well as Mark Burnell, who makes his debut as a screenwriter. As usual, the only thing I knew about the movie was its synopsis and crew, but I also caught the overwhelmingly negative feedback from critics and audiences alike...While its flaws are undeniable (and I'll get there), I don't find Reed Morano's film to be worthy of belonging in January with so many worse movies. Sean Bobbitt's cinematography is a technical standout, by delivering two fantastic one-take action sequences (one of which is edited to feel like one take), and some wide shots look genuinely stunning. I always love when a film is set in actual cities or remote locations since these offer a realistic atmosphere, and given the right treatment in post-production, the tone can be better controlled by the environment surrounding the characters.The cast is also really good. Blake Lively delivers one of the best performances of her career, definitely the most somber one. Her character is constantly placed in challenging situations, physically and emotionally. Blake incorporates Stephanie's state of mind seamlessly, carrying the narrative forward even when the latter fails to captivate the viewer. Jude Law is Jude Law, and Sterling K. Brown offers a notable display as well. However, the positives end here.Story-wise, The Rhythm Section lacks creativity and uniqueness. Besides being way too straightforward and predictable for an action-drama with a central mystery, it's edited (Joan Sobel) in such an uncommon manner that makes the movie feel incredibly tiresome. Tons of moments are drawn out for extra seconds or even minutes. Almost every scene weirdly goes on for far too long. There's no new information to transmit to the viewer, nothing is happening... The whole film is edited like this, consequently ending with almost fifteen/twenty minutes of nothing. Also, some dialogue scenes are intercut with something that's going to happen after that particular conversation, which is confusing in the sense that the viewer doesn't know where the focus is supposed to be on.Then, the actual narrative raises tons of logical questions. I hate to be that guy who nitpicks character decisions or plot points like CinemaSins (even though this channel makes so for comedy purposes), but this movie really makes the viewer wonder how/why the hell is she able to do this?! Stephanie is trained to be an agent, and while a specific part of her training is straight-up impossible, I believe that the character possesses the required skills. My issue is that she barely uses anything that she learned: she continuously runs away from everyone and everything and she gets other innocent people dead in her partially failed missions.In addition to her, there are other characters with either unclear motivations or questionable lifestyles, having in mind that this film deals with secret intelligence, terrorism, and stuff that very few people have access to or knowledge of. The score also feels extremely awkward. Similar to the editing issue, the song selection doesn't fit the dark, depressing tone that the movie carries. Sometimes, Stephanie is about to go on a serious mission, and upbeat pop music is playing... Why?All in all, The Rhythm Section isn't as awful as most January films, it certainly doesn't deserve the record of the worst opening weekend of all-time, but it still carries tons of issues. The editing (Joan Sobel) is weirdly unconventional, drawing out scenes for extra seconds or even minutes where absolutely nothing happens and intercutting dialogue sequences with unnecessary flashbacks or flashforwards. Reed Morano isn't able to bring creativity or anything remotely original to her movie, and Mark Burnell writes a predictable screenplay packed with questionable plot points and logical issues, not helping the already dull pacing. Steve Mazzaro's score doesn't fit the tone of the film, but Sean Bobbitt's cinematography delivers a couple of surprising action sequences and some neat wide shots. The cast is really good, and if not for an outstanding Blake Lively, this movie would have been a lot worse.Rating: C-"}, {"id": 291, "text": "As a haunted rumination on trauma and grief, the opening throws of this movie are exquisitely done. It has the grinding, punishing eye of a documentary, and Lively is so crushed by events it is difficult to identify her as a member of the family we see her with in the first, sad frames - Lively, like many Hollywood stars of this moment, looks like any number of other famous people, depending on light or angle, so it is mostly by context that I connected the grief stricken young woman in one set of shots with the smiling one in the others.It is not a compassionate lens that the director offers, nor an intriguing one. By the time we introduce the second cold, stumbling character, I found myself thinking about other movies, other things, traumas that friends had suffered and survived, and if this film would upset them, interest them, or what. And then I turned it off, because I realized I'd watched thirty minutes and simply did not know why it was being shot.I have no idea if this vehicle comes to life at later points, but that short half hour was miserable, and I cant recommend it."}, {"id": 292, "text": "Stephanie Patrick (Blake Lively) is a drug addicted prostitute in London. It's three years after losing her loving family in a plane crash. Reporter Keith Proctor tells her that the crash is the result of a terrorist bombing which was covered up by the government. She tries to shoot the bomb maker Reza but lacks the nerve to do it. She tracks down Proctor's source former MI6 agent Iain Boyd (Jude Law) who trains her to be an assassin. A person known as U-17 had ordered the plane bombing to kill one particular passenger. Iain directs her to ex-CIA officer Marc Serra (Sterling K. Brown).The setup has a lot of unreasonable premises. Not only is there a large government coverup but Proctor is the only one who is pulling it together. He's a reporter. Report it. The secret should be the person who organized the bombing, not the bombing itself. As for Jude Law, I don't understand how Blake Lively would automatically believe everything he says. Apparently, she believes everyone until the one moment when she doesn't and that's the big lie. This is naively written espionage. Then there is the la femme Nikita where a hot prostitute is trained into a cool chick assassin. I do like the swimming bit and that she's not a strength fighter. I like that her punches rarely do much unless she's punching the nuts. I am willing to say that it's more realistic than the acrobatic woman super fighting that is so prevalent today. The actors are trying but the writing is a bit weak."}, {"id": 293, "text": "I really hate piling on with all those other negative reviews for a movie with such strong performances from Blake Lively and Jude Law, but, I must.First things first, the plot is straight out the Victim becomes avenger textbook we've seen eleventy billion times, except with a unique twist: It's exceedingly dull. We get lots of close-ups of Ms. Lively brooding and looking roughed up. Lots and lots of needless flashbacks, that do nothing to move the plot forward. And we get lots and lots of scenes that essentially do nothing. Instead of action for the the first half of the movie, we get sudden, loud music intended to imply there's action occurring when there is none.Then we have the editing, or lack thereof. Did anyone making this film realize it's an action movie? Instead, we get incredibly long scene after scene that could have been cut by 50-75% with no harm to the plot, greatly helped to keep the movie moving, and, most of all, kept us from going to sleep. The director and screenwriter were apparently so in love with their artistry they forget to entertain us,Lastly, I almost never give up on a movie, no matter how badly made or numbskull it is. I figure there's always something to be gained by watching it to the end. But, sadly, this one was so insufferably, needlessly slow moving, with so many plot gaps and absurdities I threw in the towel 2/3 the way through. Even the beauty and considerable acting skills of Ms. Lively couldn't keep me from enduring this exercise in watching paint dry. That's a shame, because in the hands of less self-indulgent filmmakers this might have made a nice little franchise for Ms. Lively, instead of the one-off bore bomb that it is."}, {"id": 294, "text": "Incredibly incoherent, tedious, and by all means boring- The Rhythm Section is by far one of the most strangely made and slow paced films I have ever seen, even despite Lively shining in the lead role. Before I get to all the flaws this film has, i'll begin with the positives. Blake Lively is very good in her role, and though she doesn't have much to work with, you truly feel her embracing the character as best as she can, and giving the role all she has. Jude Law doesn't have nearly as much time to shine throughout the film, but as always, he provides a solid performance and the two make for the only somewhat decent parts the film has to offer. Simply stated, this film is an absolute dumpster fire of a mess. It is very poorly edited, poor directed, and absolutely incoherent. It's a slow burn through and through, with almost no redemption to be had throughout besides Lively and some pretty shots. That isn't to say its cinematography is great either, as its action, once it finally gets to it, is absolutely loaded with shaky camera shots as far as the eye can see. It can be incredibly frustrating to watch, as you have no idea what is unfolding and why, as well as incredibly tedious as you watch the same bland crap happen over and over again until it finally comes to an end. The Rhythm Section is an editing disaster, and I hope Hollywood can find some more capable hands in the future to make such a complex narrative, instead of completely ignoring what it has throughout its entire runtime. My Rating: 2.5/10"}, {"id": 295, "text": "So this film came out earlier this year and I missed it but now I have had the chance to watch The Rhythm Section and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a woman seeking revenge against people who orchestrated a plane crash that killed her family.Main Character Blake Lively plays the lead character here and she is fine. She does a decent job in the action sequences and there were times were you felt for her character, but there just isn't enough there. You don't learn enough about her character to really care and there is nothing particularly interesting about her as our lead character here.Supporting Characters Jude Law plays her mentor in the film and I thought he did a good job here, the best part of this film is easily watching Law train Lively and he plays the role well. But like Lively I thought there was more that could have been done with his character but this film just doesn't have the time or effort to go through with it. Sterling K Brown is a good actor but I have no idea what his character was about here, he is a pretty charismatic guy but that is not on display here and it just feels like he is wasted and a bit bland. The rest of the cast doesn't have anything to offer really and just feel like people for Lively to go after.Story The story is good when it shows the training element. I like how Law and lively interact and seeing the training is interesting and the best part of the film. But my god this story is convoluted and it is hard to follow, again the fact that you don't care about Lively makes it difficult for you to get emotionally invested and care about the emotionally hitting parts of the film. Also the end of the film feels really rushed, it seems to breeze by and by the time you can take stock on what has happened the film is over.Script The script is really dull, there is nothing stand out about it at all. The dialogue is bland, there is no humour and the drama doesn't do enough to get you invested in the characters or the plot, which as mentioned is written poorly and makes it hard to follow.Style The style has some decent action scenes in it, one in particular is really good and it is just a shame the rest can't stand up to it. It is just a shame that with action films such as John Wick and Extraction with fantastic action this is just another by the numbers action film that has nothing that stands out. Also the pacing of the film isn't great, as I said before the ending feels really rushed and didn't work for me.Overall Overall, this is a below average action film that don't stand out. I honestly feel like this film would have been better as a TV series but unfortunately it is a by the numbers dull film that isn't worth watching."}, {"id": 296, "text": "In summary - An overall drab experience lacking anything to grab you and draw you in.The Rhythm section stars Blake Lively as a woman who lost her entire family to a terrorist act and is ultimately given an opportunity for revenge. It plays out somewhat blandly as she trains and goes through ups and downs before meting out her revenge with mixed results.There's a lot of interesting directions you could go with this well worn theme. You could focus on her struggle to absolve herself of guilt and loss, ultra violent action revenge fetishism, dramatic turns of the political complexities of terrorism, her rebirth as a vengeful spirit etc. Unfortunately it really doesn't do much of any one thing or anything well. It just sort of happens and then its over. Very...meh.Actually A Vigilante which came out recently comes to mind as a far more interesting revenge flick that buries its story deeply into how trauma can fundamentally change someone into a vengeful spirit. Skip this and just go watch that instead."}, {"id": 297, "text": "My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. As it turns out my wife had bought and read the e-book earlier this year, she said the movie parallels the book with a few changes. Rhythm Section is a reference to the rhythm of the heart and breathing as an assassin gets ready to pull the trigger.Blake Lively is Stephanie Patrick, as the first scene unfolds we see her behind a man, pointing a gun at his head. Then the story switches to 8 months earlier. She was a mess, doing drugs and doing tricks after losing her whole family in an airliner crash over the Atlantic. But now a man is approaching her, says it wasn't an accident, he knows who made the bomb that caused the crash.So the movie is about this ordinary woman with no particular skills becoming someone who can hunt down and eliminate international terrorists. It seems like more than a bit of a compressed time line and in fact she isn't very good at it. Plus she has a hard time actually performing the deed, killing another person, when she gets to that point. Plus she freaks out when she almost is killed in an interesting car chase scene through the narrow streets of a foreign city.I am really so-so about this movie. Lively does a good job but the movie isn't very good to look at, especially in all the dark scenes and unattractive characters. Plus the story and all the connections gets hard to follow at points. It is suitably interesting but isn't a John Wick or Jason Bourne movie. Not even as good as Jennifer Garner's Peppermint.My wife says the book's intention was to be the first of a series with several follow-ups. If there are follow-up movies we will probably watch them."}, {"id": 298, "text": "I have neither read the book nor read any comments prior to watching this movie.Stephanie Patrick loses her family to an air accident and decides to be a prostitute+drug addict as a way to cope with her loss. That in itself was a problem for me as I did not find the character redeemable as a person and could not connect with her as a human being.Without giving away the plot, Stephanie never shows the potential to be a killing machine that the movie wants us to believe and she escapes from one situation after the other with more luck that President trump and his escapades. Now that I have written this, Stephanie Patrick should run for the highest office in the sequel novel or movie or tv series.The training sequences were insipid, action sequences were bland and the protagonists ability for espionage with no tactical training was laughable at best. Changing your hairstyle and color or wearing a wig doesn't need a slow-mo video capture.Thoroughly underwhelming and at most time downright boring. This could have been a great opportunity for a series which was destroyed by sub par screenplay and story writing.Don't watch. Even for Blake Lively."}, {"id": 299, "text": "This film is inappropriately named. It has next to nothing to do with any sort of rhythm or music at all. It's the story of a woman seeking vengeance on those that did her wrong and her journey to becoming an agent of vengeance.To its credit, this is Blake Lively like I've not seen her before and she's good at it. Jude Law is also good in this and I seemingly always enjoy Sterling K Brown. So the acting is good, the story is basic but it works well enough. Some of the action is even decently shot.I really want to see Edgar Wright's version of this film, something that actually makes rhythm a part of it and injects some much needed style. Instead, there's this bland and kinda boring affair with an absolutely wretched chase in the middle.That's the biggest issue. This movie is just perfectly average and it felt like it could have been so much more. It's not worth the theater trip, this is definitely a wait to see it for free type of thing, unless your a huge fan of Blake Lively."}, {"id": 300, "text": "LIKES: A Different Character Development A Decent Mystery Component More Focused Spy Thriller Good Performances Given Limited Range A Decent Look At the Morals That Come With RevengeDISLiKES:The Lack Of Major Interaction With Family Time Warp Skip Convenient Forgetting Of Skills A Little Drawn Out Action Scenes A Little Too Plain Some Shaky Camera Scenes Jude Laws Mixed Involvement Some Rather Intense Torture MomentsThe VERDICT:The Rhythm Section is not going to be the film for everyone, because it's a slower, drier spy thriller that really focuses on the espionage and not the action. Lively leads the film with a good performance, diving into the madness of revenge while helping figure out the true evil that caused her such grief. If that's the kind of spy thriller you desire this movie is going to be for you. However, if you are like me, this appreciation of the spy class needs a little tweaking with a better pace, less convenient dropping of skills, a time lapse that is not to be believed, and better use of Law were all needed to take this film to its true potential. While not awful, the movie still did not meet the surprise I really wanted leading to this movie being mediocre for this reviewer. I believe, the movie is best left to a home view to maximize your potential, unless you really are a big Blake Lively fan, then you can knock yourself out.My scores are:Action/Drama/Mystery: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0"}], "reviews_amount": 301}
