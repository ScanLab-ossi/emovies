So why didn't they hear the plow the other times? Besides having already plowed that much snow, that car would be completely covered long before the measly amount that the plow did on his last pass.After hearing the plow go by. Wouldn't they know what direction it went past from the sound? Wouldn't it be wise to dig that way, get to the road and be seen?The snow is much brighter near the top of the window. Too light to be buried very deep. Why not break out the sun roof? Even holding a candle up to it may have melted enough to see sky.Sitting in a car with nothing to do. Cell phone battery really low. Wouldn't the couple have decided exactly what to say if they were able to get a call out?She got out of the drivers side. And started to walk the way they already came from. So how did she reach the Hotel they were headed to? Common guys. After you put a movie together, watch it a few times, make sure it makes sense! Like the car slid off the side of the mountain side.

First we have lived in the Arctic circle in Sweden so we know about thick snow! You can see so much light at the top of the windows that they could have easily broken through. If they really were in deep, unmovable snow, the 2 of them and lighting candles would have made them run out of enough oxygen for them to breathe properly in 24 days. In the depth of winter (esp as a tourist) you can only stick to main roads and they are plowed daily (even where we lived with 3 houses for 30mins) so they would have heard that plow everyday and been truly buried within a few days. They even see car lights really clearly through the snow when 1 drives past! Seriously they could have easily got out as the snow couldn't have been a few cm deep due to the light penetrating. The amount of candles they have could have helped melt it since they started to do that DAYS later anyway. Matt also uses the smallest pick to try and break the ice when he said at the start of the movie they had a tool kit for safety (its standard in these Countries) so he could have used something bigger or used the car headrest bars, he is also shown always picking at the ice at bottom of the window, Seriously!? You'd obviously do it at the top to dig yourself out. When she had the baby everyone knows (and clearly she did too as she does it in the end) the placenta is full of nutrients and people eat it anyway let alone when starving and trapped so basically Matt would rather die than eat the placenta? OK. She finally gets through to her dad and she doesn't even know where they are and panic cries. In situations like this adrenaline takes over and you would be clear and definitely have learnt your position! Honestly I could go on on and was so happy this wasn't a true story as dam i was starting to feel they deserved it haha. The acting wasn't bad but dam what awful writing how could they not see all these OBVIOUS mistakes!

So terrifying in fact that the makers decided to dial it down a bit and call it Centigrade in a hope that most US viewers would not pick up on the fact that Centigrade is the old name for Celsius. As for the story, honestly it was a bit dull, although I'm not sure how exciting you can make a movie based upon two people sat in a car refrigerating at -22\u00b0F.(that's 243\u00b0K).

The story was missing that extra spark to keep you hanging on for their rescue. The desperation was there but kept fizzing out when it could have been more embellished upon when those scenes appeared. One thing that kept nagging at me since they were in that car so many days...I couldn't understand why they didn't use the headrest to keep chipping away at the top of the snow from the car window after the wife broke it to at least try to stick a piece of clothing or something out as a sign someone was there.

If you hadn't eaten for a month you wouldn't produce enough milk to feed the newborn in the first place.. and then when she finally does dig her way out she has the energy to walk to the hotel she was meant to staying at!!!!! This Fillmore was not at all thought out properly and then to say it's a true story and at the end to say that she carried on writing books in memory of her husband, I have looked through so many pages to find anything about this said author, or to find anything about this story, I thought there is no way this can be a true story and I was right!! The characters in the film are a husband and wife, the wife is an author who was on her way to a book signing, didn't anyone realise that they were missing this whole time, especially as she made a hysterical phone call to her father to say they were buried surely a rescue team would have been sent out??

The trouble that is caused by people not talking truthfully to each other is why the planet is in such a terrible state. There is one piece in the film I am sure, like me, you will call her the dumbest, selfish idiot blah, blah, blah etc. etc. (if you watch it that is and, if you do you will - I am certain - highly regret ever doing so!).Like the films based on the same kind of tragic events it is not something you would ever wish to experience.
