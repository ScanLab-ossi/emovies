This movie deserves the best of applause. The director has done an out of the world job. At no point in the movie does he overshadow the kid. The best thing I love about the movie is the facial expressions of Kid. This kid is a genius and has filled life into the role of a music lover. Movie is so perfect, doting mom, lovable sister and a bad dad. The manifestation of problems has been toned beautifully and the way the kid is dreamed to get out the problems is artistic. Missing this movie would be a blunder."}, {"id": 73, "text": "The story was nice and the direction was much better took different locations and best expressions out from artist's hearts specially from Kids, songs by celebs and a competition of best music lover students shown in movie was also attractive.

Guddu sees a vision of himself in a bus: big smile, clean clothes, shiny guitar. His friends get by by begging on buses. One of them, Chuttan (Sachin Chaudhary), hangs currency notes as dreamcatchers. The band creates DIY instruments from junk: chimes, drums, xylophones. There's a buffet of everyday percussive sounds, which are rendered so well that the actual soundtrack - featuring Sonu Nigam, Hariharan and Amitabh Bachchan - fades in comparison.As a musical, Atkan Chatkan sticks strictly to template. A benign principal discovers the band and puts them in a competition. The role of Spruha Joshi, as an adjunct music teacher, is not hard to predict. It all leads up to a finale that can be seen from miles. Still, this is a fun film to sit through, owing largely to the energetic cast and Shivmani's zippy percussions. It's no surprise that two of the best passages play out silently, with just Guddu and his music. Words are an intrusion in his young composer's mind."}], "reviews_amount": 613}
