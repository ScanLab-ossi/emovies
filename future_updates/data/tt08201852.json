I know how hard it is to come up with a new idea, something that isnt over played. The beginning starts out strong, its watchable, interesting, good premise. Good acting, and it all just falls apart at the end. All of it, even the acting. The last scene, Amanda Seyfried looks at her husband and just nods 'ok' when he says he has to stay. No questions, no fight, no anything. Even his daughter just looks down. Im sorry, but if my husband told me he just killed someone and was staying in some hell house, id have a lot more reaction. That aside, it could have been a really great movie, but the ending just killed it. It fell apart so fast, I was shocked. As soon as they start walking outside, it becomes a illogical mess. Is it worth a watch? yes. It's better than most junk these days. Does it deserve an award? no way. Will I watch it again? No. I feel like had more effort been devoted to the last quarter, it could have been a great movie. It's an original idea, great actors and unfortunately had bad last half screen writing."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Don't believe the simple minded negative reviews. It was interesting, and kept you guessing. It definitely was NOT boring like others have mentioned. I found it to be creepy and kept me on the edge of my seat. Give it a chance it's definitely worth it."}, {"id": 2, "text": "A lot better than many of the horror / thrillers coming out these days, so not too sure why so many negative reviews. Good acting, good suspense. Does a pretty good job for small budget movie.It's more of an eerie suspense thriller rather than a jump scare, so if you're after constant scares, this might not be for you. Certainly got us hooked right till the end."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The idea of doors appearing and the geometry not quite being right is literally something that has happened in many of my nightmares. And as an elementary school teacher and third parent to a 9 year old, the want to protect Ella was an added layer that has not been in my nightmares yet, but I definitely felt that anxiety. Some of the plot was a little more of a plot device, like why Theo and Ella had to stay for one more night, I will give that. But overall, I liked it."}, {"id": 4, "text": "There is a little problem here. There is written that A screenwriter travels to a remote house in Wales with his family so that he can write the sequel to his big hit film, but he begins to regret his decision after suffering from a severe case of writer's block.  This is probably from another movie, because he is not a writer. He is an ex-banker and there is no writer's block, of course... But the film is medium and Kevin Bacon is great !"}, {"id": 5, "text": "I'm pretty sure the people giving this such a low rating were expecting this to be another dime store horror, which it isn't. This is a slow burn psychological thriller with some horror aspects. There are some mild jump scares but this is more like if M. Knight Shyamalan wrote Groundhog Day and set it in the Amityville House minus the devil. It wasn't prefect, but it wasn't bad either. Great performances and beautiful scenery. I'd watch it again to see what I missed the first time."}, {"id": 6, "text": "So the movie is about a man carrying the weight of a terrible thing he did in his past, he is trying to move on with his life, but he can't, and in the film the house is a metaphor for purgatory or some place he needs to stay to pay for his sins. They try to create a dark atmosphere in the house, but it doesn't work the way it should because the movie fails on keeping you invested, and the thing about how time pass in the house could be good if executed properly, only the scene when Kevin Bacon character is turning the lights off and ends up spending like 4 hours doing it and didn't even noticed, is the the only part that does that well.Also the real ending, the final scene with the narration is very bad."}, {"id": 7, "text": "First of all, I enjoyed watching Kevin Bacon playing his character. He is talented and he has a lot of experience. So, he was a very good choice for a complicated character like Theo. Also, I saw nice acting from Avery Tiiu Essex (Theo's daughter). She is talented. The story is very fascinating. It is the story of a family that goes to a special house for a vacation. Theo is suspected of killing his ex-wife. The movie is well-made. Most of the story is happening in the house. In my opinion, the director could benefit from more locations. The background noise and music were awesome. I liked the movements of the camera and the angles of the camera in different scenes. In summary, I recommend watching this movie to horror fans."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Watch this film, knowing what you get yourself into watching and this thought alone will make you enjoy it. Kevin Bacon is always fun to see acting and he does a good job here, carrying most of this film literally on his shoulders. The cinematography is eye-pleasing and the music and atmosphere immersive. Together with a sufficient run time which does not get long and tiring, these elements make it a good combo for a film to watch if you have no better alternative. The main problem in this film is the dialogue and generally the script. Its difficult to say this is a great psychological thriller while its dialogue... kinda sucks. Luckily there is not that much dialogue in the second half of the film, so you can enjoy a bit the experience of a thriller which is not meant to jump scare you, but to give you an eerie feeling overall. 6/10"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Warning - it's not a horror film, more of a drama n mystery but tediously prolix.David Koepp as a writer is phenomenal but as a director he is lazy and he proved it once again with this film. The film gets tedious after a while n apart from the star cast (Kevin Bacon) n the lovely locations, it has nothing good. There is unnecessary hide n seek inside the house. There is no tension but monotonous nightmares. The end was predictable for me. Generous with a 6 cos of Bacon n the nice locations.Some moron has put up the synopsis of Secret Window regarding a writer moving in a secluded cabin to overcome writer's block."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Thought I would add a quick review as there is a lot of negativity around this film. I'm suggesting it's a classic but it's fine as it is. Kevin Bacon is good as ever and it's a well put together story I'd probably a bit obvious. It's plenty creepy enough and at 90 minutes worth a watch in my opinion."}, {"id": 11, "text": "First of all this is not a horror movie, it's a psychological horror. The point was not to create a scary story or whatsoever, it was more the psychology of the person, the physical loop represents the mental loop, it kinda portrays living a lie and not being to live with yourself until you finally break free.. The dialogue is probably not the best out there but it was not stupid and empty either, more of a decent regular dialogue, but other than that I really enjoyed the movie it kept me interested and glued to the screen, the twist was there, the suspense was there, the cast is amazing and the aesthetics are beautiful (especially the choice of the house, if you actually dig and look for that house you will realize that the choice was smart).. I could go longer about this but just trust me when i say, if you're into superficial horror movies this movie is not for you, if you enjoy psychological horror and interpretations then go ahead and watch it !"}, {"id": 12, "text": "I don't understand why this movie has such negative reviews!

I'm not saying I loved it, but it was definitely different. The acting was good all the way around and it put a fresh spin on a haunted house story. This house was more like a magnet for souls that have blood on them. Like the movie says, the house either finds you or you find it. I've read ALL the bad reviews and frankly, you all suck. It's entertaining and keeps your interest. Love the twist at the end and I'd recommend it to anyone who's a sci-fi nerd like me who loves temporal abnormality...who did not love groundhog day?!

We're being reminded 50 times Kevin Bacon is Old, Amanda Seyfried is obviously looked more like his daughter and young girl his granddaughter so just because he was married once before he is her grandpa's age.The movie regardless of it's characters relies heavily on dream sequences, shadows, opening doors and jump scares. The production value is good and has face value for the actors but there is no story to keep you interesting in element of surprise or scare. All you see in first one hour, they are dreaming and getting scared and in last 30 mints the reason for the house and why he earned it. Which you know from the getgo, hint; he did something bad.Only thing works in this movie's favour is that it's an hour and half with good production value rest is all bleak."}, {"id": 21, "text": "I don't really know why people found this boring.

I only had one issue with movie, the age difference between the husband an wife was like 30 years. It totally explains one of the plot twist in movie. With that said the acting was well done. The little girl who played their daughter was really believable. The ending was really good."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Horror\\thriller fans are a strange bunch. They complain endlessly that the genre is stale and offers nothing but retreads of trope filled cliche ridden films; or remakes of prior successful films that usually ought to be left alone. Then when something new comes along... they hate it!As Shakespeare said centuries ago, There is nothing new under the sun, so it is with You Should Have left. What is new here is the approach. You do not really get the full gist of what is going on till nearly the end; yet throughout there is a cloud if ill ease that hovers over the characters and their dwelling. Something is up but what it is (a haunting, a possession) is a mystery.Excellent performances from Amanda, Kevin, and young Avery keep us caring about the characters (esp little Avery who often seems to be on the verge of tears) while director David paces the film with a firm grip and fills the screen with the aforementioned dread.Yet critics pro and armchair have taken a dislike to the film. Say it's boring. Say it's without scares or thrills. Well I say then stick to the stuff you usually complain about - cliche characters in a film filled with jump scares and buckets of Max Factor blood.You Should Have Left is a gem."}, {"id": 25, "text": "I don't get the bad reviews...this movie was certainly suspencful and definitely not the worst movie out there in terms of story line..it's the haunted/haunting house that traps people with evil past and it got me hooked and a lil spooked wondering what was going to happen in the next scene..you should check this one out."}, {"id": 26, "text": "We enjoyed this movie so much, interesting idea, out of the ordinary, well directed, well acted.

Nothing happens in this latest Blumhouse movie. It is not horror, it is not a thriller, there is no tension or any kind of negative characters, there is nothing here to be reviewed, literally. Shame on you David Koepp, it seems you are getting too old now!You should definitely skip this one."}, {"id": 29, "text": "I was excited to see Kevin Bacon starring in something new, but this is just something old and moldy. I don't understand how movies like this even get made. There is nothing new here, it's just a jumble of scenes that don't mean much in a movie that is suppose to be a horror mystery. Like so many not even up to mediocre films , I kept expecting this to get good and instead it's just a bore. They throw in all this melodrama that adds nothing instead of building suspense and interest. By the climax , if you could call it that, I was nodding off and I figured out the film's secrets early on. The best thing I can say is, Kevin Bacon is still an attractive man , but this was a huge disappointment. Unless you really need to see him, this isn't worth watching.

Nothing.Other than just being overall boring, this movie was lacking every other aspect of a movie that draws you in.The characters? They aren't developed, therefore you don't care about them. Not to mention they are flat and unrealistic. Why would a seemingly successful 35 year old, beautiful Hollywood actress want to be with a 65 year old ex-banker that was up for murder charges at some point? When did they meet? How? Why? Their daughter is probably 7-8? So she was in her mid 20's when she met this old man? Don't buy it. The age gap, by their looks alone is too forced. It's strikingly obvious. Kevin Bacon has never been a hunk in any way, in my opinion, and if she is successful in her own right, why would she be with, and stay with and just SO in love with this old geriatric man. But she's cheating? I never got a clear answer on that either? How long can you pull off 2 separate phones when you've been with someone for years and years? That's some stealth ninja stuff right there. Eye roll.The scenery. Boring. Wales? Mmmk, sure. There was maybe 2 scenes, the town, and driving to the house, that could have been filmed in Wales. Everything else looked like a set, and was drab and boring.The bad guy that you see in the first 5 min of the movie in the bad dream...were they trying to make it obvious it's Kevin Bacon just doing a weird voice? Thought it was very corny and far from scary.The twist? Meh. It was ok, had the movie been set up better. Why is he being punished now? Why now after at the very least a decade later is he being punished? Why is Stetler Kevin Bacon doing a weird voice? Why did he have a walker? Is he the devil? Pretty underwhelming comeuppance if you ask me.I give this movie 2 stars for the only interesting scene.

He has done so much awesome work and now that he is on the down side of sixty this is what he is going to be doing. Lot's of poor scripts but studios still feel he's bankable. So there is my 2 cents about Kevin.The film was not bad I gave it a seven it had some production value and I like stories about time displacement and different universes. Started slow but it built up well. Shot in England it gave a very dreary kind of ghost quality. Kevin has never ever stared with a so so leading lady. Get's the beautiful ones. But what I loved about this film was it addressed that he is getting old. Just a fact he can not play a 20 yo any longer he is 61 I think and at the conclusion of the film it showed how great of an actor he is. Script was better than average the little girl was great. Amanda was not very good bad casting there. Not a good paring with Kevin. Anyway after watching a zillion films in the last 3 months I give this one a go. Do it for Kevin Bacon If your a fan.

Well guess what? I'm tired, confused, and angry about not seeing your penis in this movie.The movie reaches an early climax when Bacon pumps Seyfried in the front seat of his hybrid overlooking the Hollywood skyline.

Where this movie looses points is it seems to be a reimagining of The House of Leaves (Released in 2000) by Mark Z. Danielewski. The premise is too similar to be a coincidence and even some of the audio (the self help narration) could be a direct replacement for Anne Danielewsi's album Haunted. Understandably this movie pulls from many movies and books that came before it, but the similarities are far too similar to be coincidental.

Given how poorly they entrailed his past, I didn't find his actions unforgivable (seeing through out the movie how fair, loving and caring he was towards his wife and their child). Yet his wife who lied and had an ongoing affair with at least one person (Max) was given no excuses as if it's okay to cheat and lie in a relationship.

Finally letting go of all the good to punish himself in his guilt and give up trying to live a happy life? Maybe. But that's why I like Movies like these because you can think the way it suits you. So you become a co-story teller yourself. Which is awesome.It reminded me of Triangle. Initially I thought it will turn into Shinning, but it didn't.

Why it's a house, a sort of weirdly constructed labyrinth that only the strangest of architects could come up with. In You Should Have Left (my latest review), said house is the star and its maze-like corridors are like taxing nooks and crannies.Anyway Left bills itself as a horror film (just watch the trailer) but it's probably more of a mind violence spectacle with a couple of jump scares and some analogous shadows. Is it keep you up at night scary? No not really. Does it get points for being somewhat original? Sure it does. Except for hinting a little bit towards 1980's The Shining, You Should Have Left is its own modern entity.So yeah, as something about a family who rents a Wales vacation home only to find out that the place is haunted and somewhat barren, Left builds slowly only to deflate and produce a lukewarm payoff. The performances are good though especially Kevin Bacon who layers up to play damaged banker and rattled husband, Theo Conroy. Amanda Seyfried plays Bacon's young wife Susanna (28 years younger actually) and Avery Essex plays Bacon's 9-year-old daughter Ella (Essex is more than adequate in the child acting department).The best moments in You Should Have Left actually don't involve the creepy. They involve the fiddly interplay between Bacon, Seyfried, and Essex. Left thinks it's a terror fest that sends your knees knocking but it's more a broken down drama about a household that probably didn't need to be formed in the first place. Director David Koepp who worked before with Bacon in the terrifying Stir of Echoes, adds a ghostly jolt or two to accompany the psychological swipe. The result is numbing, entailing, and refreshingly off-kilter. Basically You Should Have Left should provide you with a decent rental.

Not only it had a great opening, but it also had a strong fright element in the light sequences. Those scenes got me good not like a jump scare kind of moment, it was more about putting myself in his shoes and I wouldn't be as calm even though I love those kinds of things I would have been so creeped out. The movie did have the potential to have an extreme horror element but it was at the regular level in which it could come off as flat and yet it did give at least a good sinister presence. The mystery of the house needed to broaden further because it left me craving for more.The composer Geoff Zanelli did a good job with his music but it had room to give it a more frightening tone to lift up the suspense.Loved the cast, it's been so long since I have enjoyed watching the performance of Kevin Bacon, I love how relaxing he was portraying his character, and when the moment came to be the opposite. Amanda Seyfried always brings her talents at the right level her character needs to be and her emotions are so pure. Avery Tiiu Essex, such a talented child, and not only is she adorable but she also had excellent acting skills."}, {"id": 280, "text": "In 1999, Director/writer David Koepp and Kevin Bacon teamed up to create a fantastic emotionally charged paranormal chiller called Stir of echoes. They make a fair combination in their return here, and Koepp even employs some similar stylistic choices and emotional themes that take you back to days of stir of echoes.However the story is slightly scattered and doesn't always flow together in the slower middle section. Also the attempts at creepy scares are contrived aside from a couple intense moments. There's a certain creepy atmosphere thats conveyed with the modernized house thats executed well with a wide array of sleek visual trickery. By the end when things spiral into a bizarre and insane shocking conclusion, the revelations of the past are made, and it does come together more cohesively. It swung for the fences in the end and I do applaud its brutal honesty though many will critique it.As far as Kevin Bacon goes, he's still as intriguing as ever, and commands the viewers attention at all times. He's the glue that holds the film together for sure, even if it's not one of his memorable performances. He's ageless at this point and I hope he comes back for good after his 4 year hiatus. Amanda Seyfried was not very good imo and quite annoying. Maybe even more so than the daughter and that's saying something.Overall this is a decent yet scattered film that harkens back slightly to older style psych thrillers based on people's inner demons and past mistakes. It has its flaws and it's merits and with scarce releases these days, it's not a bad watch."}, {"id": 281, "text": "There are far more films being made in today's day than ever before and that goes for all genres, but for some reason, it always seems like the Horror genre as the most. I know that's not true, but seeing streaming services like Shudder dedicating themselves to only Horror films, it's hard to not believe that. For that reason alone, I know there are many more throwaway Horror movies out there than memorable ones. That's actually due to my own personal taste as well though, because a Horror movie really needs to stand out in order to impress me. Much like Superhero movies or Comedies, both of which I love, they need to find ways of feeling fresh and not like the last 10 or 20 to be released. Sadly, one of the latest Horror releases, You Should Have Left, falls directly in between, ending up as a film that's trying to be very original, but not doing enough with the setting to warrant a watch.Theo (Kevin Bacon), his wife Susanna (Amanda Seyfried), and their daughter Ella all take a trip to a house, secluded from society. Susanna being an actress and Theo just wanting to do something fun with his retirement, they choose this place. Dealing with some personal issues as the house decides to play tricks with their minds, this movie is meant to be a huge psychological thriller. Unfortunately, the psychology of it all never really comes into play until the third act and I never once found myself invested before that. Sure, Bacon and Seyfried are giving fine performances and the last 20-30 minutes are somewhat interesting, but the entire film felt like a missed opportunity.Before watching it, I had only recently seen any promotional material, of which showed some very cool ideas and imagery. With that said, this movie takes far too long to present those images, which makes you wonder if the entire first and second acts needed to be as long as they were. For a feature film and how the overall story ultimately plays out, I absolutely feel this film could've been told as a short story. The funny thing is that it's actually based on a novel of the same name, by Daniel Kehlmann, but the overall premise is different. The changes they made to this story clearly were a detriment because it just didn't feel like a meaty enough story as a feature film.Getting back to the fact that this is billed as a Horror flick, the Horror elements nearly feel non-existent throughout the first two acts. The movie begins with a scare and a few very minor things present themselves to let you know something is coming, but that's it. There are a few well-done set-pieces, but they don't do enough with them. For instance; There is a sequence toward the end of the film that revolves around a bunch of doors, which I would've loved to have been explored as a movie in its own right. It's cool moments like these that are brushed over in favour of a plot twist that I didn't feel worked all that well, to be honest.In the end, You Should Have Left presents a solid setting but it doesn't do anything with it. Director David Koepp, whom I have admittedly not seen a lot of his work, impressed me with his fun touch on the film Premium Rush. I found that movie to be far more exciting than it had any right being, which ultimately made me make my decision to visit his newest work. This is a film that suffers from too much drama throughout the first half that really has not much of a payoff by the time the credits rolled. Personally, I found the whole experience to be hollow, which is a shame, because the makings of a good film were all in here, but even at 90-minutes is seemed to be stretched out too long. You Should Half Left is now streaming on-demand, but I really don't think it's worth your time."}, {"id": 282, "text": "David Koepp has had quite an odd directing career. He only does a film every 3-4 years at the most and the genre can range from extremely dark horror like 'Stir of Echoes', through to immensely light comedy like 'Mortdecai'. When he does venture into the dark thriller/horror world though it appears to me that's when he's at his best. 'You Should Have Left' is a fine example of this. In less capable hands this film could have been an absolute mess. In his hands though he manages to contain the chaos and turn it into something really dark and haunting. I was a big fan of this film.Having Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried as the stars of your film helps things a lot. Neither are perhaps in the absolute top-tier of Hollywood actors, however both are very good at what they do. They are immensely watchable and even had the skills to have me forgetting I was watching a relationship with a 27 year age difference. Also Bacon is in incredibly good shape for a 60 year old it has to be said. The performance that blew me away perhaps the most though was child-actress Avery Tiiu Essex. So often I find children in movies extremely annoying and distracting. Not in this case though. She was charming, funny and never detracted from any scene.There's something so great about contained psychological thrillers. I love that this film isn't about trying to scare you with cheap jump-scares. There was one early in the film and I thought, oh no here we go, but after that the film settled down and was content to scare us with atmosphere more than anything else. I really appreciated that. Usually I despise dream sequences in horror films too, but in 'You Should Have Left' they kind of play into the story, so it is hard to get too angry at the film for having them.There were two or three ways this film could've ended, and it picked the ending type that I was most hoping to see. It was the icing on the cake for what was already a very fine horror movie. I highly recommend checking this one out."}, {"id": 283, "text": "You Should Have Left is a haunted-house thriller with two strong points: the house, set in remote Wales is ominous modernist with halls similar enough to scare you because you don't know where you are; and a lack of bloody business and jump scares enough to concentrate on the mental stability of Theo Conroy (Kevin Bacon), who has delighted tabloids with the circumstances surrounding a death.Unmistakable is the debt the house makes to The Shining by actively contributing to the unease of Theo (Matrix, Anyone?), his wife Susanna (Amanda Seyfried), and 6-year old daughter Ella (Avery Essex). The changing corridors and the utter imbalance of the house's parts are disturbing, notwithstanding the ghost-like presence of the owner, if that's who it is.With so much left unsaid about Theo's past and his sin, the thriller and its house rely on Theo's mind to do the scaring. He does it well enough as he throughout has been trying to write about his past to expunge his guilt and get away from his wife's seeming adultery.You Should Have Left is a small thriller most pleasing to intellects that delight in psychological untidiness. For the rest of us, this house in rural Wales has sharp corners hiding imbalance and supernatural presence more related to the reality of Theo's past rather than horror for itself. Not a bad thriller for the faint of heart."}, {"id": 284, "text": "About midway through this the movie Silent Hill came to mind. Not in relation to the story, but in the execution.

Sure enough in the credits its mentioned this is based on a novel of the same name by Daniel Kehlmann.Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried play a married couple who, along with their daughter, take a vacation to a remote mansion in wales only to find there's something wrong and spooky about the house.Off the bat Amanda and Kevin have zero chemistry. They just aren't believable as a couple and it doesn't help that shes clearly young enough to be his daughter, grand daughter even. They try to play to it, but theres just no warmth between them so it just comes off as fake and cringy.Everything else in the film is equally clunky. His interactions with the townfolk are silly and kill the immersion. A bizarre and pointless casting choice for the villain is so ridiculous some audiences will laugh unintentionally.The spooky bits are neat but not frightening. Its all just too goofy.Its a shame because now I just want to go read the book and forget I watched this.

Ditto the bit where the character looks into the mirror and his reflection does something else.The greatest thing about horror and sci-fi is that there are no bounds to what the filmmakers can create. Anything and everything is possible, permissible and encouraged.

Almost at once the perfect vacation turns into something not so perfect. Theo believes there is a unfriendly force in the house causing suspicion between him and Susanne to a point both believe they have not been truthful to each other.Why this scene started the movie made no sense to me at all. Ella is in bed and sees a shadow, then a man comes to her bedside. This scene did not start the movie. Was it a mistake to put it first? The movie actually starts when Theo and Susanne at their poolside home discuss going away for a vacation. That scene with Ella is at the vacation spot. See?Background. Susanne is Theo's second wife. Theo's first wife drowned in a bathtub and a jury found Theo not guilty of murder. For Self- Therapy Theo writes down his feeling about everything on a day to day basis. Susanne tells Ella about what happened because Ella wants to know why the tension between her and Poppa as she calls Theo. Sometime she calls him daddy, but mostly Poppa because he is much older than Susanne.I can deal with supernatural stuff and this is the case in here. The Shop owner, (Colin Blumenau) tells Theo that the house burned down and the Devil rebuilt it and he asks Theo, Have you met Statler? Apparently Statler was the original owner of the house. As Theo leaves the shop a woman (Lowri Ann Richards) stands next to his car and asks Theo, Have you met Statler? Apparently, the whole town knows about the house.The house has multiple hallways, and rooms and you would think it was alive because, at times, Theo and Ella get lost within.Things get dicey when Theo and Susanne agree to separate for one day. Theo and Ella are left to themselves, get lost in the house, decide to go to town and get away from the house only to find that they walked back to the house and Ella didn't understand that as she said they always walked down the hill to the town.Theo knows there is something or some kind of entity in the house that he must eventually confront. He doesn't know who wrote You Should Have Left in his notebook/diary. He believes Susanne did it. But we know the house is playing games with him, hallways are extended, lights to off and on, doors open and shut on their own, stairs that lead nowhere.The acting by all was very good, but a special shout out needs to go to Avery Essex as Ella. She is 6-yrs old going on 20. She is the best part of this story and she handles her job as an accomplished veteran. Kudos. We will see more of her, I am sure.This is not overly suspenseful, but it could have been. Kind of creepy but not horror creepy, but it could have been. I enjoyed it. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

Rating: B"}, {"id": 290, "text": "An ant doesn't know what a cathedral is...I can see why this one has so many unimpressed reviews, it's a pretty specialist piece. Basically, it plays like a love letter to Mark Z. Danielewski's immortal genre-bending modern philosophical classic of semiotic arcana (now try saying *that* ten times quickly) novel/dossier, House Of Leaves. That one's pretty esoteric, and so is this film, in the same vein. Few people know House Of Leaves - even among horror lit geeks, it's distinctly obscure - and even fewer liked it. But those who like it, *love* it. This film is for them.This is a mentally twisty, physically non-Euclidian nightmare about marriage, love, guilt and redemption. If it pings as anything, if you had to put a single label on it, you could probably call it a gothic horror - though very much a firmly *modern* interpretation.The characters' rich and morally complex internal lives are explored, the nuances and often struggles of romantic commitment are highlighted, and parental love is the absolute centrepiece around which the rest of the drama turns. Indeed, this horror is one which (much like the first 20 minutes of Stephanie) touches on the uniquely chilling nature of the specific fears exclusive to those viewers with children; the vulnerable babe innocently wandering into the woods, while those who would give their lives to protect them are shut out of any control, helpless to intervene in the terrible passion play to which they are forced to bear witness. If for nothing else than that, this film will move some viewers to horror more deeply than others.As for the acting, it's good - the players deliver rich, complicated performances that are deeply satisfying if undeniably uncomfortable to watch, but then one expects such from veteran Bacon, and to waste words on repeating the litany of his talents would be gilding the lily, so I wo't bother.More refreshingly, even the anime-eyed and lissome Amanda Seyfried gets a chance in this flick to prove to objectifying viewers that she's so much more than eye candy, as she throws down the mike with a portrayal of a loving mother and still-very-much-attracted young trophy wife at a personal crossroads between superego and id; between the fruit on the branch that's tantalisingly within reach and all there is to lose in eating it. The portrait she paints is vibrant with a certain emotional *fierceness*, in the veracity of the love she feels for both her husband and daughter, belied with an unexpected fragility beneath the passion and bravado - some sort of brittle-bright intensity undercutting the romance of that commitment, and imbuing the character with some unmistakably sharp edges which any one of the countless less talented actresses of her particular early-00s-high-school-movies origin would struggle to reconcile in a way that made the character seem anything more than simply bipolar. The moral convolution of this vivacious but damaged woman counterintuitively works to make her seem *more* sympathetic, rather than less so. She is challenging, and even reprehensible, but never entirely unlikable (though of course YMMV).And little Avery Tiiu Essex, playing their *very* small daughter, packs a lot of dramatic punch for her early age; she is by turns meltingly tender, heartbreakingly innocent, breathtakingly perceptive (playing very much against the common adult trope that children are oblivious), and, on occasion, shrilly exuberant to the point of annoyance - in other words, an actual child, in all its sweet, demanding, messy glory, as opposed to the one-note performances so often seen from actors so young (after all, acting is a skill, like any other, and skills *do* generally take time to acquire). This portrait, so naturalistic, puts your heart all the deeper and more firmly into your throat for the danger she finds herself besieged by. Your can't help but invest in her, and in the mutually-besotted (with her, at least) adults to whom she has become such a blessing.This is not simply a horror movie - or rather, it is not *only* a horror movie; it is also a domestic drama, a paternal love story, an examination of the lies we tell ourselves to maintain our self-image, and a thesis, ultimately, upon forgiveness and sacrifice. It's *also* one Hell of a horror movie, for those into a very neglected niche. For most others, it will fly over their heads (no judgement in that assessment, by the way; no one thing is for everyone).If you loved the Escher-room quest scene in Labyrinth, this will send your submarine positively skyward.Expect cult status to follow."}, {"id": 291, "text": "REVIEW - YOU SHOULKD HAVE LEFTStraight to streaming series this film was released on 18 June 2020.Starring Kevin Bacon who I personally love as an actor the film tells the story of a husband, wife and daughter who go to an isolated House in Wales to rekindle their marriage. Unfortunately through a series of events their relationship is pout to the test and eventually......... but........While staying at the house in Wales strange things start to happen, nightmares, shadows and strangely the house is bigger on the inside (not Doctor Who).Actually, a very surprising film as the scare factor is quite low for a horror but the suspense and expectation is classic Hitchcock, (yes personally I felt it was that good), leaving your own imagination to fill in the gaps and trying to guess what exactly is happening.Personally, I love films like this which do not give away the story until the end and even the keeps you guessing leaving questions unanswered not like many films today which throw everything in your face and resolve whatever it is all in the same film.This film takes its time to build up the interest and suspense, simply made but very effective and as for Kevin Bacon, even though he is directly Infront of you in a few other scenes (no spillers) you simply don't recognise him even in plain sight, Amazing acting!As for the house used in the film, this vacation home is located in Llanbister, a really small village in Powys in the historic county of Radnorshire and was designed by John Pawson, a famed British architect whose work is known for its minimalist aesthetic of the 'less is more' philosophy. The real house only has a ground floor, the second floor (upstairs) in the film was added by CGI. All downstairs shots were filmed inside the actual house whereas all second-floor shots were filmed in a studio.Worth a watch.Rating 9 out of 10"}, {"id": 292, "text": "I wanted to watch this movie because the trailer looked good, and I am a huge Kevin Bacon fan! Knowing that he pretty much gets to choose what he wants to play in, I thought that it would have a better plot or even a twist at the end, which it kind of did, but was it was a little subpar.I loved Stir of Echoes and thought this might be something along the lines of that one. But this one was a little tame, to be honest. When I first saw it advertised, it was as a psychological thriller but the next time, it was listed as a horror. I'd say it's more along the lines of a suspense thriller, in the fact that you are on the edge of your seat, not knowing where it's going to go. In no way would I describe it as a horror because it's too tame for that classification.All that being said, it's not a bad movie. It's just not the best.

Even the mystery part is far fetched.Without adding spoilers: Couple and their child go on a vacation to Wales, England and rent out a huge house. Insert 30 minutes of nothing going on. Kevin Bacon finds a hidden room in the middle of the night, doors open by themselves and time moves incredibly fast whilst he is in the room. As things progress during the last 30 minutes there are lots of doors that magically appear insert lame plot twist.

Spider-Man!) and some abysmal lows (Jurassic Park 2! Indiana Jones 4!). This one falls into the latter category, I'm afraid. It contains the seed of something great, but it's all setup and no delivery.First, let's get this out of the way: yes, there are some great moments, and yes, they're all in the trailer. Seen the trailer? Good, you don't need to go any farther. There's nowhere to go, really... those intriguing scenes aren't leading up to anything. There's a mystery of sorts, but you'll work it out pretty quickly. The final picture that emerges isn't so much a rich tapestry as it is taped together from photocopies of other, better pictures.I really wanted to love it, because the idea of the house is a fantastic visual premise. I suspect that's how the movie was born: Koepp envisioned this place with mysterious, unreliable geometry and wrote a story to go with it. Even the execution of that idea, though, is disappointing. The movie seems to be gearing up to bring us a mind-boggling, infinitely complex setting, but it never gets there. Most of what we are shown is well done, but it doesn't go nearly far enough, re-using too many of the same sets, and ultimately falling back on well-worn dingy cellar imagery and uninspired black walls that feel like a cop-out when they arrive. The movie the trailer prepared you for seems tantalizingly close but you never reach it.The story that's loosely written around the location doesn't take up the slack. Like the house, it promises more than it delivers. The actors are too good and the characters' setup too portentous for the damp fizzle that eventually plays out. There are some odd dramatic choices. Without spoiling anything, the subplot of the wife's secret is completely out of place. Instead of upping the emotional stakes or being an effective red herring, it just confuses the tone and the way the audience relates to the characters. It feels like padding in every sense: narrative, emotional, and durational, and its awkward inclusion just exposes the thinness of the overall plot.The usual Blumhouse treatment does the movie no favors. The punctuating of every shadow and jump scare with a loud noise or music cue, the ominous scoring regardless of context, the metaphorical billboards reading this is a scary movie, usually perfect for the production company's gloriously unashamed spookfests, all seem too blatant and unsubtle for this script. Then again, maybe that's me expecting more than it ever intended to deliver. When the mystery of the house is solved, the often-used premise seems like it would be more at home in an anthology series than a deadly serious, emotionally heavy film, and maybe that was the intent all along. Perhaps the production simply leaned too heavily on striking a somber tone when the material was more akin to an episode of The Twilight Zone than Sophie's Choice."}, {"id": 296, "text": "The end message this movies tries to give, is an okay one.

Performances are so-so.And it's very predictable. I stayed away from the trailers, and even that wasn't good enough to prevent me from working out the main giveaway from the very first scene of the movie.

Yeah, it's fairly predictable, not very scary, and the directing never really rises above being just fine, but I was at least slightly invested in where it was going for a while, it seeming like a more self-reflective version of The Shining, which I was all down for.But as the end draws nearer, it becomes quite apparent that it's going to be a that's it? kind of ending, and it most definitely was.But still, I did feel as if everyone involved did at least care about the project...although I'm not sure if that's cause for concern or not."}, {"id": 298, "text": "You Should Have Left (3 out of 5 stars).You Should Have Left is a fair psychological horror film about a couple who rents a house in a foreign country to get away from there daily lives.

The film is a little weak compared to that one.Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried did okay with there characters. The film does have a slow and boring first hour which lacks in thrills and suspense. Does get a little creepy and suspenseful when it reaches the climax. The direction is decent.

In fact it does many things very good and a couple of things perfectly. It just leads me to believe that the people who downvoted it either prefer bloodbath horrors (which this is not) or pretentious cinematographic drivel with no actual meaning (which this is also not). If you are looking for an actually good horror with psychological scares, look no further.As far as the acting goes, the cast does a stellar job. Perhaps the kid is a bit on the annoying side with some atypical lines but aside from that it gets high marks across the board. The pacing is done just right. It manages to set things up without putting people to sleep and then gradually escalates the tension.Where this movie truly shines is in the horror elements. There's no slimy, toothy monster that goes oogabooga!, nor a jumpscare-y ghost that constantly lurks off-camera waiting for a chance to scream in your ear. Instead the horror here is built on a breaking reality as it manages to blur the line of what is real and what is imagined. Doors loop back to places on different floors, the house measured from inside is much larger than when measured from the outside, minor changes in the background, just enough to make you wonder did the characters do that or is it...? While in most horror films the cast is expected to make a series of absolutely braindead choices to get the movie going, this one traps you and even the most rational can imagine that they will remain trapped. And that is the point of the movie - You cannot escape your own demons. The ending could have in fact been better, but even as is, I am not too disappointed.So granted, this is no Triangle, but it does a nicely polished job, while staying fairly simple. It's an absolute must-see."}, {"id": 300, "text": "You Should Have Left is a horror drama film based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Kehlmann. Directed and co-written by David Koepp (Secret Window, Ghost Town) and starring Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried, it is an odd movie that can't seem to settle on what audience it wants to appeal to.Theo Conroy (Kevin Bacon), is a wealthy retired banker who lives with his actress wife Susanna (Amanda Seyfried) and their young daughter Ella (Avery Essex). One day, the three of them decide to take a vacation in Wales, staying in a nice looking house on top of a hill overlooking a small village. Upon settling in at the house, the family's initial excitement turns to fear as each of them are plagued with terrifying nightmares and strange passages of time, causing them to believe that something is clearly not right with where they are staying.Despite being advertised as a horror film, You Should Have Left only offers sporadically jarring moments that could really be considered scary. The first two thirds of the film are very exposition heavy, almost as though they are leading us to believe that this is going to be some kind of family drama, only to toss in some fairly tame twists and turns during the final act in an attempt to categorise this whole experience as horror. This may have worked had all of the information unloaded onto us actually led somewhere interesting, but for the most part it felt unnecessary as it spoiled any potential for building up the important tension required. As a result of this, the film feels more like a voyeuristic soap opera focusing on a family living in a strange house rather than some cleverly veiled horror/thriller from the folks at Blumhouse.David Koepp does a decent job in the director's chair, even if he does become bogged down in the aforementioned scenes of overly long exposition. What I admired most was the way he made the interiors of the house look, with large, spacious rooms that lead to nowhere or lengthy hallways that seem to never end. Even if this was underused and wasted at the most crucial of times, it did leave something of an impression on me and at least made the film pleasant to look at. Unfortunately, Koepp fails in the most critical area: creating suspense. This film never really felt as though it was on the brink of any startling revelation or that something big was at stake, as most moments that could have been scary often ended up being false alarms. There are the occasional jump scares that, while I'm not usually a big fan of in horror films, could have been worked had they not been a result of a character having a nightmare and therefore not placing them in any real danger. For something that is allegedly supposed to a horror film, this is very lightweight on the scares.Surprisingly, the acting from the cast is of rather high quality. While I shouldn't be one to doubt Kevin Bacon's uncanny ability to chew the scenery in every film he is in or Amanda Seyfried's knack for demanding our attention with her alluring gaze, their chemistry felt so bizarrely believable that I really did feel as though the two of them were longtime husband and wife, in spite of their twenty-seven year age difference. This made scenes with the two of them interacting more watchable than they should have been and it definitely prevented things from becoming boring. However, I need to single out the young newcomer Avery Essex as their daughter Ella. I believe she did a superb job in the role, considering her age and the emotional heaviness of some of the lines she had to read. These three performances were the saving grace of the film, because if it weren't for these, I probably would not have cared at all otherwise.Overall, what I think brings this film down so much is how confused it is about its own identity. If it wanted to be a horror movie, then it is a failure, but if it simply wanted to be a family-focused drama then it has somewhat succeeded. The problem here is how the film has been marketed, with how Blumhouse Productions is so well known for producing primarily horror-based content that by mentioning this in the trailers and posters sets it up as something akin to the likes of The Purge or Get Out. That's not to say this film is entirely bad, but instead I'd say it's a curious oddity that got lost somewhere along the way.I rate it 6/10"}, {"id": 301, "text": "Please do not listen to these negative people on here who are so wrong!

It's okay as a drama expressing children's love"}, {"id": 305, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This movie has every ingredient to be a horror hit. David Koepp has written and/or directed phenomenal films: Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible, Spider-Man, War of the Worlds, Stir of Echoes... the list keeps going. Add Kevin Bacon and Amanda Seyfried, and you've got yourself two fantastic leads. A horror flick set in a haunted house, where the main characters go through some sort of a psychologically disturbing journey? The synopsis convinces me! So, with all of these features, there's no way this movie will fail, right? Yeah... It couldn't be more disappointing.You Should Have Left ultimately doesn't know what genre it belongs to. Koepp clearly takes inspiration from a bunch of other films (some from his own filmography), completely forgetting to develop the one at hand. Everything about this movie feels unfinished, or, being totally honest, everything feels like it's just an idea or a concept yet to be explored. Bacon and Seyfried interpret characters far from being persons with motivations, aspirations, or even personalities, especially Susanna, who is manipulated as a mere plot device to make things happen. She's an actress... that's her entire characterization.As the viewer, I finish the film without knowing a single thing about any character. Theo has some sort of past (like every other Blumhouse's main character of a horror flick), which is barely explained in detail. The only moment where some backstory is given to his character is an utterly unbelievable exposition dump between the mother and her daughter. This is the only personal development that Theo receives: an event that happened in his life described in a forced conversation between characters that definitely shouldn't be having it.Koepp's movie is marketed as a psychological horror film, but it doesn't even possess the necessary technical attributes to create suspense or a scary environment. The haunted house looks way too bright, modern, and not claustrophobic at all. The editing (Derek Ambrosi) is weirdly out of sync with the score (Geoff Zanelli), and despite Angus Hudson's cinematography boasting a few nice shots, it doesn't really help to create the necessary atmosphere. It just doesn't look nor feels like a horror film. Just like with the characters, Koepp doesn't know where he wants the story to go.There's an attempt at creating a drama within the family that doesn't work because, well, there are no *characters*, so I couldn't care less about their arguments. Then, an unnecessary sci-fi element is introduced, and it's bafflingly left unexplained. Finally, a mystery surrounding the house's size is approached, but just like the rest of the movie, it doesn't go beyond its concept. In fact, this is the most captivating aspect of the whole film, but it's only introduced after one hour of runtime. This movie tries to follow so many different paths genre-wise that it forgets to actually choose one...Overall, You Should Have Left had tremendous potential to be a genuinely intriguing psychological horror flick, but David Koepp gets lost in the many ideas present in the film. Kevin Bacon delivers an excellent performance, and Amanda Seyfried (underused) also lends her undeniable talent, but both interpret characters far from being so. Koepp's screenplay holds so many underdeveloped concepts and extremely superficial attempts at balancing distinct genres that it totally forgets to actually tell a convincing story with complete character arcs and interesting plot points. Even technically, its well-lit, modern house doesn't generate a suspenseful or spooky atmosphere. The editing and the score are also weirdly put together. Unfortunately, it's underwhelming and disappointing. I can't really recommend it.Rating: D+"}, {"id": 306, "text": "As one who likes Kevin Bacon's acting and films it's nice to see him on the big screen once again. You Should Have Left has him tackling Horror as a successful senior who takes a vacation with his much younger actress wife and their young daughter. The neat and spacious house with its pastoral and breathtaking view promises a great stay but from the start things are not quite right. From doors that take a life of their own events lead to a multidimensional nightmare that finds the lead face to face with his dark past and the sacrifice he has to pay as atonement. The subtle atmosphere and languid pace of the film serve as a good contrast and build-up to the creepy and horrifying scenes. The flawed directing and flawed acting at parts snag scenes in the flick where the actors don't act as they should lessening realism and the lead-up to the ending is abrupt and quite an anti-climax. The film works nonetheless in its chilling simplicity where the supernatural experiences shown do happen in real life making the film scarier and more effective with its effect. One of the finest recent releases in the Horror genre this should keep you blanketed and curled up."}, {"id": 307, "text": "David Koepp's career has been one of equal parts schlock and pop culture fun across the genres of crime and horror, scifi and superheroes. A little of the mysterious here, a little of the trodden there. You Should Have Left, ably written/directed by Koepp and produced by Blumhouse, lands dead center.You Should Have Left teases artful What If...? elements before it plods into a standard haunted house tale where unrequited grief lurks as the de facto spook.The ageless Kevin Bacon is the true heart of the story as he cements his leading man chops in a yet different role, following his fantastic spin as a corrupt sheriff in Cop Car. Playing Theo Conroy, retired banker now full-time dad, Bacon seeks to spend family time with his young wife (Amanda Seyfried) and their seven-year-old daughter by booking a family vacation at an isolated house in the Welsh countryside. The house is a killer design but at the film's end it simply is a killer. Theo, you see, has secrets. As does Susanna. And the house feeds on those secrets while keeping its own.You Should Have Left possesses a simple and tight concept. The Conroys are an easily enough family to watch. Koepp builds on that family love; always winking and nodding at the family secrets. What really happened to Theo's first wife? Who is Susanna constantly texting? Aside from the occasional jump scare, that family drama does not make a compelling thriller. Too much of the pater familias; not of enough of genuine creepiness. When that horror finally ramps up? That's when the yeah-yeah-I-get-it screams of the genre take over only to quickly let go.Koepp crazily establishes his movie around the nightmarishly-modern house. Ever-changing layouts. Hidden doorways. Poorly-lit staircases. Weird Polaroid photos in the laundry room. Other than Bacon, the house should get top billing. There always seems more to explore with unanswered questions aplenty. And mostly? These all go unfulfilled.You Should Have Left wants to build into a creepy-yet-cathartic climax, perhaps similar to Blumhouse's reimagining of The Invisible Man. The family drama and the haunted house plots do not weave into a frightening disaster. Rather, they are combatants. And the fight is more of a slow struggle than a WWE slamfest. The already-short run time could have been trimmed even more and would have instead resulted into a clever ep of the new Twilight Zone. Instead, the conclusion is rushed while Bacon's hair is mussed. At least this cool-looking house in Wales is now available for rent."}, {"id": 308, "text": "After enduring the hour and a half runtime of 'You Should Have Left', I had a lot of questions, the main one being - just why? The concept of this film sounded interesting, the plot didn't sound bad at all. However, the execution of it is one of the worst I've seen this year so far. Nothing really thrilling or exciting happens throughout the duration of the film as it turns more into a drama and mystery than a horror film.The three main characters have little common sense to the point it'll leave you frustrated at certain points throughout the film. There's a scene where Theo and his daughter Ella attempt to leave the house, only to return there a little while after, knowingly putting themselves back in danger.The overall message from 'You Should Have Left' is that you have to live up to the things you've done and you can't escape your own shadow. Or is it? Maybe I'm just searching too deep for an explanation after the cluttered conclusion to make myself feel better. This is what I believe the film-makers were trying to express anyway, however, it's sloppy and unclear. The ending of the film still leaves a lot of open questions.'You Should Have Left' is slow paced, confusing, lacks tension &amp; atmosphere and has no sense of direction. I found myself hoping for a surprise ending, a shocking twist or turn but was left just feeling more confused at the end. It seems to me that both Kevin Bacon &amp; Amanda Seyfried didn't read the script and wanted an easy payday on this one.I recommend skipping this film and reading the book if the plot interests you. I haven't read it, nor do I plan on doing so, but it can't be any worse than this production.It's rare that I have to share my thoughts and opinions on a movie's age rating and certification. However, the UK rating from the BBFC seems to have been skewed for 'You Should Have Left'.UK: Rated 18 for strong injury detail - this is legitimately all that is available on the official BBFC website. This rating makes absolutely no sense. There is no content in this film that constitutes an 18 rating. This should be rated 15 and a weak 15 at that. The only explanation that I can come up with for this is that BBFC have rated it so highly to stop younger teens from seeing this sleep-fest. If that's the case, then I tip my hat.US: Rated R for some violence, disturbing images, sexual content and language - this is a more accurate age rating which constitutes a 15 rating in the UK. The content they've outlined here is more accurate of that in the film and you should use this as a benchmark."}, {"id": 309, "text": "Kevin Bacon in this movie is completely wasted and was very underwhelming, same for Amanda Seyfried. Both have developed acting skills and they took part in successful projects in the past, but in this case they did not even tried. Movie lasts one hour an half, but there is material maybe for around one hour, or even less. There are a lot of stretched out scenes, boring and uninspired dialogue, predictable plot twists and cliche characters that usually take dumb decisions. The only idea that I have really appreciated is the one of the house that changes constantly the internal environment, and I liked visual effects, photography and some camera movements.There is nothing much to say about this movie, the most interesting scenes are contained in the trailer, that spoiled basically everything, pretty normal nowadays, especially for horror movies. If you don't want to waste one hour and half of your time, in just three minutes you can already understand what more or less this film is about."}, {"id": 310, "text": "I don't think this movie is getting the credit it deserves. Sure, it is a Blumhouse production, which tend to be formulaic and cheaply made. Sure, it contains elements from other horror movies we've all seen before, and sure, the ending is a bit predictable. But still, all that is combined into a movie that largely keeps you guessing, and is original in many ways.It's also nice to see a horror movie that is based on psychological elements, not monsters from another planet or, more commonly these days, supernatural beings.Plus, Keven Bacon gives a very good performance here. I think he is one of the least appreciated actors working today, even though he's been in many movies for decades. He's always good in whatever he does, and is capable of changing his on-screen personality to fit whatever role he is in.Overall, the acting is good all around, and the script is good. It is well worth an hour and half of your time."}, {"id": 311, "text": "Phil's Quick Capsule Review: I'm usually a huge fan of Blumhouse's stripped down style of horror films but You Should Have Left joins Fantasy Island at the bottom end of the films i've watched in 2020 so far (for balance The Invisible Man is near the top) And whilst the aforementioned TV reboot at least tried to do something different a day on from watching You Should Have Left I still really have no idea what the point of the film was. The 'twist' was visible a mile off, Bacon is okay but Seyfried seems miscast and the film lacks pace even across it's 90 minute run time.Best Bit: Bacon giving full on Bacon.Buy, Stream, Avoid: AvoidIf You Liked this Try: Fantasy Island, Happy Death Day, The Purge"}, {"id": 312, "text": "Review: 'You Should Have Left' is a psychological horror film directed by David Koepp. It follows a middle-aged man (Kevin Bacon), his successful actress wife (Amanda Seyfried), and their young daughter (Avery Tiiu Essex) who book a haunted vacation home in Wales that begins to wear down their sanity. This is a very confusing film and a hard one to review without digging into spoilers, but I will do my best. First thing is that this is not your run of the mill psychologic thriller. This is a movie that takes the idea of 'Groundhog Day' as if written by M. Night Shyamalan, while being in a modern-day version the Amityville Horror house. Now, that may sound good on paper, but it turned into a confusing story on screen. Talking abut the acting, it was okay at best. I am a fan of Kevin Bacon, especial in the 90's and early 2000's with his darker films like 'Death Sentence' and 'Stir of Echoes' which was from the writer and director of this film. But there were times in this movie where he seemed to be holding back. Amanda Seyfried was flat during the film and never expressed any emotions that were necessary for us to feel sympathetic nor angry at her character. Avery Tiiu Essex who plays the couples daughter was actually pretty good in the movie and was the most compelling character hands down. From the very first scene we are routing for her character and at times feel scared for her. Now, there is an age difference between Amanda Seyfried and Kevin Bacon's character. Even though the film did this on purpose, it was still very distracting and the two did not have any chemistry on screen. They feel like a new couple even though they have been together for years and have a young daughter together. But, pushing that to the side, it not the biggest problem in this movie. It's the fact that it's labeled as a horror film and the horror is pushed in the background to focus more on the characters relationship is a weird choice to say the least. Nothing happens horror wise or story structure wise until one hour into this film and it's only 90 minutes long. Overall, it is an interesting concept with poor execution. I'm interested to see what reviews this film gets by both critics and audiences. If you're a fan of Kevin Bacon give this one a try, but don't watch it if you're a fan of their earlier collaboration 'Stir of Echoes' because you will be disappointed, muh like myself. 2.5/5"}, {"id": 313, "text": "An inventive and uniquely interesting psychological thriller- You Should Have Left certainly has its weaker moments, as well as a bit of a weak conclusion, but it's sure fascination and imagination into its storytelling is surely a nightmare you won't soon forget. First off, Kevin Bacon is fantastic in this film. I have seen him obviously act various roles in the past, but this is surely one of his best. He truly commits to his role throughout, and shows a larger amount of emotion through a surprisingly grounded performance, both of which I have not had the likes of seeing before. I also enjoyed the performance held by young actress Avery Tilu Essex, who was quite good as Ella in the film. Amanda Seyfried was fine, although she truly brings nothing new to her performance, or really to the film in general. It's a bit of a slow burn, but it's an endlessly interesting and creepy tale. The atmosphere is thick and it truly makes the most out of its setting, unlike many horror films of this type often do. It can be a bit bland at times. Its beginning is a little bland, before they reach the house. Its ending is a little bland, abrupt, and a bit cliche. I was fine with how things wrapped up, but I couldn't help feeling a bit unsatisfied in the scheme of things. The script for the majority is fantastic, but it can't seem to really stick the landing at times, and unfortunately it's at times when it may have just been most important. IThe cinematography also needs a mention, because not only was it beautiful, but part of the reason the film was so chilling to begin with. n the end, You Should Have Left was a decent thriller from Blumhouse, and one I wouldn't mind diving into the meaning of sometime soon. My Rating: 7.5/10"}, {"id": 314, "text": "This was an alright watch but I have to say that it was very predictable for me. The plot takes us to a creepy house where it seems like our hero is going crazy at first.But something seems to have attracted our protagonist to the house, then it plays with him and his family because of his secret past.With a few plot holes here, such as why does this entity haunt the little girl who has no guilt to be preyed upon?The imagery is quite good, and the shots inside and outside the house are great. The nightmares are a little creepy but this isn't a horrer movie per se.The acting was alirght bit nothing too demanding seems to have been asked of the cast. The wife character was very weak and almost unnessessary since she dissapears from the plot for a large part of the movie.6/10 as an above average psychological movie with a few plot holes and some of the pacing dragging in places."}], "reviews_amount": 315}
