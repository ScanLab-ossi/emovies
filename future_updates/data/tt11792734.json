Turks are great with the drama stuff, we love the pain and we can really show it on the screen but when it comes to comedy we are not that good. Always the same comedy elements, curses, fart jokes,poor scripts... This movie should be a beginning for turkish comedy. We need more of this.

Then decided to watch 9 Kere Leyla because of the very talented actors and actresses. It was a disappointment. 2 hours with no social message, no personality, no script and no directing. Why? Why waste so many talents? Creativity was frozen and forgotten. Cinematography was horrible. Actors had no clue what was going on. Looked like they had fun between themselves.

It is emphasized that masculinity is not a matter of gender but a matter of mentality, referring to patriarchy. Otherwise, there is no distinction between the human sex as masculinity and femininity, they were created equal.

There are films we watch as we grow old or grow up and think it's nonsense,but then we experience stuff in life and we start to understand those films in a different way. ....spoiler.... . . .I loved the plot twist where they show us who Lilith actually was.

I watched for Haluk Bilginer and Demet Avgar but It was disappointment. You shouldn't never watch it."}, {"id": 77, "text": "After the release of the film 9 Times Leyla, which attracted great attention with its cast of master actors, the negative comments and the meaninglessness of the subject matter were insistently mentioned. I can say that there are many reasons for this and that the comments are generally criticized as empty or even 'childish' content by not making a connection with the subject, people who are far from mythology and literature (hence the community without interest) cannot establish a connection with the film. As usual, most of the criticisms made in our country were insulting and insulting rather than being constructive, and perhaps even caused the people who might be interested to block their way. I want to make it clear now that I will speak by generalizing, because the small portion that remains does not even need to take over what I am going to say. As a society, we are lazy of thinking, commenting, wondering, and often researching, creating an atmosphere that people can say unnecessary. The movie 9 Times Leyla is a rich aesthetic-visual and auditory film that we can call black-humor based on the mythological character Lilith. While the whole world knows Adam Eve as a whole and the first love, Lilithi, who has always been forgotten among us, has always been denigrated and never made her feelings, no one can empathize with her, and in essence, the first wife of Adam, Lilithi shows us his experiences and how strong character he has shows. Lilith, who developed with her life experiences, has been with us since the existence of the land. He is constantly in search of his inner world and wants to find the faithful, ethics. We can say Lilith's guilty charm, which is why she has the air of causing a lot of trouble and curse on the opposite sex. While the way he advocates love, his way of owning it, has historically called Lilith the evil and evil one, we know Eve in most places as the one who desperately desires for her love and has been with Adam from the beginning. While no one makes Lilith's voice heard anywhere in the world and calls her evil, 9 Times Leyla movie shows us exactly the psychology of Lilith and how she wanted to be crushed, her feelings and the sense of ownership and dedication she needed. At the same time, the soundtrack of the movie, which is far from details and absurd to many of you, and the fact that Adam turns to his inner world with every attempt to kill Leyla, and his musical accompaniment to court with the Adam in his head, shows us how incoherent Adam is and how foolish he is. It almost does not have its own self-determination, it is dragged from right to left like a blind chicken in constant search. In addition to these, the decor details we see in the movie should not be overlooked. In most scenes, the forbidden apples, which are not separated from us, are highly suppressed, especially in the sex scenes. When Adam, who is called the original sin, eats the forbidden apple as a result of his disobedience to God causes him to be removed from the Garden of Eden. In the movie, Adam's infidelity to Leyla ultimately leaves him to die and moves away from his wonderful home, which is the Garden of Eden, and his new home is now hell. Unlike the apple object, the paintings in Adam's house also attract attention. For example; The Lilith painting made by John Collier in 1887 is one of the most known. Maybe we can come across detailed comparisons and personality traits about other characters that can be interpreted more if watched carefully. For now, I wanted to make a brief evaluation about what I first felt and know about the movie. Considering all these evaluations, I want to say health to everyone who has contributed and devoted to this work. In my opinion, it was a magnificently prepared movie and even the small details were told without missing. Turkey also increased to such films, and we wish more likely to become art."}, {"id": 78, "text": "The message is not directly given in the movie.

Most of his movies have been mentioned within golden works of Turkey Cinema. But unfortunately this last movie is too far away from responding to any audience expectation based on Ezel Akay cinematography.Although the movie evokes the cinematic grammar of Neredesin Firuze (one of Akay's previous successfull works) it fails to catch enough dynamic mood which Neredesin Firuze significantly presented and 9 Kere Leyla tries to perform.-. Inadequate links between mythological significations and political discourse and-. failing repetitive jokes which dominate and vanish sub-contentscould be encounted as main major problems."}, {"id": 106, "text": "It is probably not the best movie you've ever seen but it is a story you've already read. Apart from its social message poorly imposed, the movie contains lots of elements one can find very interesting unless the audience gets bored with old-school storytelling. If you enjoy finding elements of different fine arts in one form, you should definitely see the movie.Take a look at other reviews, they will tell you that it was disappointing. This is not a silly comment but missing the fact that works created in the Middle East, unfortunately, have huge responsibilities besides their artistic value. In my humble opinion, Ezop would be more free and watchable in his art if he doesn't have to imply deep social messages in 2020.So please watch and enjoy the movie, and try to catch the humor without getting annoyed with the sketchiness of its social message. But remember, you can always appreciate an idea even hated the expression of it."}], "reviews_amount": 107}
