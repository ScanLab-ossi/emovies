All the people who gave terrible reviews are crazy. People were claiming they couldn't follow the plot, but I didn't have any problem at all. In fact, I rather enjoyed myself. Now this movie will not win any Oscars, but neither will it be listed among the worst of all time either. Watch the movie with the notion that you will not see a cinematic masterpiece, but instead will be able to spend two hours where magical islands exist. The TV show Lost had a similar plot, and it was one of the most successful shows of all time. Watch this movie with the same mindset."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Oscar worthy? No. But, if you're in the mood for a nice, fun comedy, action, thriller... it is A-OK. Has a couple of twists. Keeps you wondering where its going. If the plot gets a little sketchy here and there, have some more popcorn and give it a bit!I enjoyed it more than many higher rated, more pumped movies I've seen lately! Grab ya a bucket, a nice beverage and have a little fun with this one!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "What the hell do people expect? Watch it with popcorn, booze, and a few buddies."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Its fun and actually better than I though it would be! Get some popcorn, sit back and enjoy!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "People seem to rate these types of movies badly and I am not sure why. I think this was very unique, not many movies are made about islands that manifest your fantasies in a dark, twisted way. Despite anything it should get points for creativity. Secondly, it was thrilling, and kept you thinking about who was behind jt all, and managed to surprise me completely. Obviously with a group of 5-6 main characters it is hard to flesh out all of their development but even that did a good job and managed to get a few emotional moments. In conclusion, campy, gimmicky horror is a style of its own and doesn't deserve to be rated badly."}, {"id": 5, "text": "No it's not an Oscar contender but it's a fun movie and well worth the two hours. If you enjoyed fantasy island in the 70s you should enjoy this as well! It even has some good twists!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "I grew up in the age of Fantasy Island, Gilligan's Island, Love Boat era. While I'll admit I was partial to the latter two, I remembered, the plane boss the plane, and the immaculate gentleman in white welcoming guests to fantasy island. That out if the way, this was a fun movie, we enjoyed it from beginning to end. The negative reviews sound like want to be film critics. There is no deeper meaning or philosophy to take away from this movie, it's just fun. It's meant to be entertainment and it is. What would you say about Top Gun, Footloose, Legend, Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, Heavy Metal and Gremlins if they came out today? Those movies were not to convey a message but to entertain which they did. Not everything has to be an Oscar or teach you a life lesson. Rant over, I recommend this movie for no cussing, nudity, crudity, or senseless stupidity. So get your ice man to break the rules help a unicorn break the glass ceiling restore the balance beat the oppressors and don't eat after midnight."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I loved the tv show but knew this was a horror so knew it wouldn't bethe same. There was always the possibility of the fantasy not playing out as planned and being killed in the tv show, but obviously that was never the case for a family show back then. So, to show the dark side interested me. I thought the fantasies worked well and actually enjoyed how they come together. Rourke was very like the original. Yes, there are sime holes in the story and the last line is so corny but I now have it in my collection to watch again."}, {"id": 8, "text": "I was hoping not to be bored with this movie, looking at the score of 4.6/10 but I was amazed. Mystery must be the genre, not horror. There is almost no horror inside but so many unexpected things. I believe that the idea is great and the hidden idea even better. This move deserve at least 7/10. Go watch it by yourself."}, {"id": 9, "text": "If you go to this expecting to see the original you will be disappointed. If you go expecting a Blum House Film you will love it. The plot twist is perfectly done. The villain is kept secret. Yes, it is formulaic but they aren't chasing oscars here. They are creating a BLUM HOUSE film, and they did a good job. The film is fun to watch and entertaining."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Forget the critics and reviews. I love this movie. Fun, scary, twisted... all in one movie. I am a big fan of Lucy Hale. She was great in this movie. And Maggie Q was too."}, {"id": 11, "text": "It's more fun than I thought. Even it's a little not logically. It's still full of imaginations. Just enjoy it and don't think too much!"}, {"id": 12, "text": "It was a great movie with suspense and exciting adventure. I recommend this to anybody who wants to kick back and enjoy their time. I don't think anybody will regret watching it. 8/10"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Great movie, twists &amp; turns to the end.Great direction, acting and score, try and watch the unrated version rather than the cinema cut.Lesson learnt for me is, not to listen to people, many said this movie is bad, but to me, it's fair from it.Great suspense, great movie."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Despite plot holes all over the place, the storyline is quite enjoyable at the first and second act. BUT then the writer suddenly decided to rush it at the third act by creating the worst plot twist."}, {"id": 15, "text": "This movie was surprisingly really good. Everything in this movie has a reason and I love it when things come full circle. Everything made sense at the end and it gave me goosebumps. It didn't have some super deep meaning but I still thought it was interesting and really fun to watch. Overall a really fun thriller to watch and my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Despite the low rating, I saw this movie. Although it is not a masterpiece, it greatly respects the theme of the tv series. I liked it a lot!!"}, {"id": 17, "text": "I think it is what it was intended to be...a fun, scary, re-imagining of Fantasy Island."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Everyone knows and expects perfect fantasies to go awry, but how the stories unfold makes this movie worth a watch. I'm surprised more people haven't enjoyed the movie. Is it life changing? No. It's fun, has an interesting plot, good music and good actors."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It's not worthy of an Oscar; but I was entertained. Technically I guess you could call this a horror movie; but it wasn't scary. I don't like being scared."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I must confess I hadn't high expectations about Fantasy Island because seemed to be another horror movie with the same vibe of Truth or Dare. The story is interesting and makes us think about what we would wish if were in that island, but unfortunately turns to be a little annoying in due of the lack of tension and violence. I just can say this film is more a drama with comedy and fantasy elements than a horror movie.The other problems are the acting of some characters (I don't think Lucy Hale is a bad actress, she's just unlucky about the roles that she accepts) and the main plot twist that doesn't make ANY SENSE.SPOILERS: During the final act, everything reveals to be a revenge plan made by Lucy Hale's character. She tried to bring all the people involved in the accident of the man who she loved. That doesn't make sense because during the movie she helps some people and is surprised about everything that happens in the island. During the first act she goes to that torture room alone and she's in shock when finds everything is real and the kidnapped woman in front of her is also real, but in the ending she says that knew everything about the powers of the island.ENDING OF THE SPOILERS!For me, Fantasy Island is a campy film, it's really weak however can be so funny and entertaining to watch with a nice group of friends."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Why was that bad? I think it is a very fair movie, it was not predictable, there were surprises in store, its atmosphere is really cool. i loved it"}, {"id": 22, "text": "There were actually two movies before the tv series, but the first one was basically very similar to this one. A famed hunter wanted to be hunted, a woman wanted to attend her own funeral and a WWII vet wanted to relive his lost romance. In some way, the fantasy worked, in another way, things didn't, or, as happened in the movie, the fantasy ended. I really didn't enjoy the tv show giving way to Love Boat on land as it did, with each person finding romance in the end as well. I think only one time on the show did the fantasies crossover. Granted, there seemed to be some bits that were a tad clunky, but in the end they all came together, . . . . somewhat connecting. Hardly the worst movie, as all the other posts seem to think, and they did seem to be along the lines of what the people on the show always wanted. Won't give away what happened to anybody, but it was together as a movie. Do I think a sequel would be possible? Possibly."}, {"id": 23, "text": "The tv show always had an undercurrent of tension with Roark and this beautifully brings it to the surface. Michael Pi\u00f1a stepped into Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n's shoes and I didn't think that was possible."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I didn't watch this because I'd heard so much hate. I don't get it. Good production, cinematography, acting, and a solid plot line. Also, loved the very end.I don't understand what people are expecting, but reviews for a lot of films seem to be taking a hit. The 1, 2, and 3 stars are from trolls who have nothing better to do."}, {"id": 25, "text": "An entertaining plot, a nice acting cast, and I liked the fresh take on a classic franchise.Too many people on here are just crybabies behind computer screens. Get a life."}, {"id": 26, "text": "Bad movie! Bad, bad...bad movie! Go to your room! Forever!I don't know where to start. The convoluted attempt at anything close to a plot? The juvenile writing? The bad acting all around? The movie should not have been called Fantasy Island. It should have been called Clue. Cause no one involved had one.However, I do credit it for a first in the life. As in the first time we in the audience had a conversation, with show of hands, just how bad an experience this was. It was like Lifetime and the CW had a baby. A horribly, disfigured baby.Please spare yourself. Don't watch it. It's too late for me. But if I spared just one of you, maybe my sacrifice is worth it."}, {"id": 27, "text": "I thought the story was interesting. Not as scary as I thought it would be but still enjoyable!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "This movie has bad reviews because of fans of the original show not getting an identical remake (that's what I assume at least). If you're a fan of imagination, and well-thought storytelling mixed with a little horror element; this movie will tickle your fancy. It has a well-needed theme/moral that people these days could take note of. Redemption, forgiveness, letting go of the past in order to have a future."}, {"id": 29, "text": "Its a 6 or a 7 out of 10 ... Watchable popcorn flick ... Only gave it a 10/10 in hopes of raising the score a little to reflect a more accurate ratingRight now there aren't a lot of choices in the way of new movies .. If you skipped over this one due to its low rating give it a shot ... I promise you you've seen worse"}, {"id": 30, "text": "The reviews I have been reading and seeing on YouTube are so bad that I had to go see for myself. I would rank this movie up there with Once Upon A Time in Hollywood. I got what I expected. I was pleasantly surprised."}, {"id": 31, "text": "Fantasy Island is nothing like the TV series. It is a fantasy horror thriller with lots of twists and turns. I like how the story went. Judging from the trailers, it looked like Saw on an island, but it is definitely not that. I liked Michael Pena as Mr Roarke. He was quite a character. Though he does not possess the gentlemanly charm as Ricardo Montalban from the TV series, he is an interesting character. The other cast did a good job too. I also like the nods to the original series and hope to see the sequel."}, {"id": 32, "text": "I loved it. It was surprising and you didn't see the twist coming. It was not predictable. A good thriller but soms details good be better. Like the special effects with the guns. With a little more budget. It would have been great. Also maybe with an other Mister Roarke. Someone darker. Less comedy."}, {"id": 33, "text": "I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had surprises and twists I never expected and I didn't get bored at all. Story was good too, even that synopsis itself explained this movie to be this basic: People goes to island and things starts to go wrong, which is itself very common idea."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Not sure why others are rating it low, but felt it was unique with a twist...definitely worth watching"}, {"id": 35, "text": "This is a well made, well casted and entertaining film. In a world where a decent horror movie is as rare as the Shrouded Ghost in Sea of Thieves this film does a good job. Maybe hardcore fans of the past content are upset but as far as remakes go this was far better than I expected. Give it a chance. Don't trust just the reviews alone. Go into this film with no expectations and I'm sure you'll be surprised."}, {"id": 36, "text": "Taking place before the events of the 1970s tv show and adding a little horror flavor to the fantasy island setting of the movie, this latest creation from blumhouse and the last one to hit theaters before the world turned upside down is pretty clever, funny, sexy, and very well done. I saw this in 4k HDR for 99 cents on google play and loved it. If you're a fan of the show, there are traces of it in this film, which in the unrated version is not for kids. Shot on location in Fiji on a $7 million budget and making 6 times its budget, this cult hit is a really good steal."}, {"id": 37, "text": "I've been putting off watching this movie for awhile due to the awful rating, but my husband insisted. The movie towards the end was plot twist after plot twist. This movie was actually pretty good. Would recommend."}, {"id": 38, "text": "I had very low expectations due to the 4.6 rating of this movie but since I love tropical island movies and I'm stuck at home social distancing anyway, I gave it a watch. The acting is pretty decent and there are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. This movie is really about a 7/10 but I rated it 10/10 to balance all the moronic boomers' hatred.It's definitely not predictable, Hollywood usually makes sure a certain stereotypical trope plays out in every horror movie, not this one though. I won't ruin it for you. That was fkucing refreshing as hell. Great job Blum! Looking forward to more movies like this one!"}, {"id": 39, "text": "This movie had everything you need in a thriller. I am normally one to listen what critics are saying. This movie was so much better than I expected it to be. It keeps you pulled in entire time, pretty fast paced and it wraps everything up perfectly. Lucy hale was phenomenal in this, spot on for the part. As well as the the brothers. They did Ana amazing job on this movie would definitely recommend!"}, {"id": 40, "text": "Most people have already written this film off because they're upset it's a loose adaptation of the old classic tv show and they feel that it should've never been made into a horror film. While it may appear like a desperate attempt at a cash grab from Blumhouse concept wise, It's actually a pretty fun horror film with some bleak subject matter. There are some very sinister sequences that I did not expect in the film and the way they adapted the fantasy aspect is rather intriguing and works fairly well. there are some moments of tropes and clich\u00e9s that we've all come to be very familiar with from Blumhouse but it still has a great level of vicious intensity. The acting is pretty average overall but the visuals carry the film. Overall it's a solid outing and better than I thought it would be and if people are already hating it just because it's an adaptation of the old TV show I say give it a chance because the way they adapted the fantasy concept is kind of cool."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Fun suspenseful surprisingly entertaining. Good special effects for a low budget film. Good storyline a surprise around every corner."}, {"id": 42, "text": "Loved this! It was very good. Suspenseful, not gory. The characters were great. I loved the story. The location was beautiful. I thought this was going to be more of a slasher fim, but it is not. I was surprised I liked it so much! If you like thrillers, Fantasy Island is for you. Highly recommend!"}, {"id": 43, "text": "A very confusing movie. Starts off well and as the movie rolls on all the fantasies start to intertwine and confuse the daylights out of he audience. My fantasy was for the movie to end sooner."}, {"id": 44, "text": "Beautiful island,beautiful girls &amp; beautiful fantasy's,this movie manages to keep your attention throughout,it has an original format &amp; some beautiful scenery but don't get to excited,somehow it falls into the B movie category when the acting &amp; horror scenes let it down somewhat,its almost a comedy horror with the one liners much like the EVIL DEAD movies,however you are left intrigued as it doesn't give much away to early &amp; there are some plot twists that surprise,but overall while very watchable you come away feeling cheated or unsatisfied with the finale...for an evening kill time its recommended but probably would not watch again say for a sequel....WATCHABLE"}, {"id": 45, "text": "As usual all the sad people with no imagination who have put bad reviews and who have to have everything put on a plate and cut up for them so they can digest things have missed the point.This is glorious stuff.

Interesting from the start to the finish! Rarely a film where I can't guess what's going to happen. Lots of twists and turns with a lesson."}, {"id": 48, "text": "I really liked this! It took the premise of the original show and gave it a sneaky, dark little nudge. Blumhouse is always good for a turn down the lights and get lost in the fantasy kind of movie and this one is no exception. It's not an award winning, groundbreaking storyline but it does entertain, and isn't that the point of a horror movie? The characters are interesting, the little hints are subtle but there if you look. It's a fun movie, so enjoy it and don't be dissuaded by the reviewers who took it too seriously...or themselves."}, {"id": 49, "text": "I thought this was a fantastic movie. The plot never stopped all the way down a twisted road to the end with a great bang. Acting was great. Several of us watched 2gthr and we all felt the same that it was a great story. Highly recommend this movie."}, {"id": 50, "text": "I just finished watched this movie and I am surprised to see that it has a 4.8 rating, hence the reason I gave it a 10 to push it up. While this is not your typical haunting or gore horror, and not scary, I can appreciate the horror thematically. A beautiful island where people come to live out their most desired fantasy turns out to be a disappointment as lives are lost and expectations ruined. I find the cast quite entertaining as I recognize some of them from other movies, so I know they are competent actors. They carried the story well and I was able to watch the entire movie without feeling bored. Therefore, this movie deserves a better rating because I have seen horrible movies getting a 6+ rating."}, {"id": 51, "text": "Watched at a turbulent time in my life, this was kinda healing"}, {"id": 52, "text": "Ignore the trolls that are pounding this film with 1 star ratings.My theory is that many of these trolls are homophobic and did not approve of one of the characters being implied to be gay early on (this character proceeds to get excited about some of the clandestine dress, physically men on Fantasy Island). No big deal.Look at my profile- I'm a real, longtime IMDB'er. I PROMISE YOU that this film is creative, thrilling, adventurous, exciting, and it keeps you engaged the entire way.

I did miss Tatoo though! Eightys kid and never missed a episode of the show!"}, {"id": 54, "text": "I did read the negative reviews and understood what the movie was before I went. They should have called it the Horror of Fantasy Isle and not used the names from the TV show and the ratings would be in the 6's. So don't stop from seeing the movie if you read the negative reviews because you know this is a horror comedy going in. A high percentage of the people that rated it negative are rating it because it is not what they expect of the happy Fantasy Island TV Show.

Heard Jason Blum wanted Nic Cage n that wud have saved this film a lil bit. Michael Pena's character is too soft spoken n without any mystery. The film has no good kills, no nudity, no suspense n tension. This movie is set on a supernatural island n i dont get to see any deadly snakes, insects, monsters or ferocious animals. The end is a big meh. This is a prequel to the tv show of the same name and they provide the hint when they introduce the character of Tattoo which was played by the iconic Herv\u00e9 Villechaize in the tv show.

I simply wanted an entertaining watch, something fun and a little suspenseful to see with some friends. And that's exactly what it was. It by no means was the best movie I've ever seen, nor did I expect it to be.

When I fist watched Fantasy Island, they called Blumhouse's Fantasy Island, now its just Fantasy Island. Anybody know if Birds of Prey decided on an official title yet? Any way, lets take a trip back to Fantasy Island.This film is a horror thriller. Like the television show there are multiple plots occurring at the same time. The primary one, the thriller one, and the comic relief one. With this adaptation, each of these storylines- sadly- cannot pick a theme and follow through with it. They are always changing. The overall tone of the film is dark and uncomfortable, and mysterious, everybody has secrets, maybe that is the theme. Oh well, that is too much information, lets get back to the critiquing of the film. The film was first announced as a dark and gritty reboot of the classic Saturday night show, it lacks the grittiness for most of the film- but it is dark. It is more of a modern adaptation of the show that also serves as a prequel, as spoiler, how can you remake Fantasy Island without Tattoo, or another assistant to Mr. Roarke from the start of the film? My other complaint is there were no cameos of the original actors, but that is mainly because they were deceased before filming began, though more evident nods to the original series would be appreciated- saying that some of the co-hosts that filled in for Tattoo are still around. This cinematic adaptation of Fantasy Island is closer to the television show than a horror film, although the horror elements are present and the film has some great ideas to make it their own, the film lacks quality in the end.This is a fun film, even though the political correctness involving the clich\u00e9s stereotypes that seem to make it into everything in the entertainment world these days. Lucy Hale gives one of her best performances to date and Michael Pena did a good job with the role of Mr. Roarke. There is great chemistry between the actors who are the guests on the island as well, but this film serves more of an origin story for the Island Resort while still keeping the concepts of the television show alive. While this film is a hot mess, it is still enjoyable for fans of the original show as well as people who want a thriller based action film."}, {"id": 108, "text": "Yup pretty good!

The last couple years I've tried to make sure I hit all of the 'major' releases in the theater to support the genre. I didn't have the highest hopes for this one, but I wasn't coming in to hate it either. I tried to come in expecting something similar to Happy Death Day, which I know was pretty polarizing, but I still thought that one was fun. The synopsis here is a horror adaptation of the popular '70s TV show about a magical island resort.Something I have to give credit for is that this movie doesn't waste any time getting into it. We start with seeing Sloane Maddison (Portia Doubleday) trying to escape from people that are pursuing her through woods. She emerges from them and we see she's on an island. She goes into the main house and the phone rings. She answers it to hear a man's voice before she's taken.We then have a seaplane arrive at this island. Disembarking from it are Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q), Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale), Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell), Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang) and his brother J.D. (Ryan Hansen). They're met by Julia (Parisa Fitz-Henley) among other staff as they're led to the main building. Each is taken to their own room, except Brax and J.D. We then meet their host, Mr. Roarke (Michael Pe\u00f1a). He informs them that they'll all get their fantasy. The rules are that they only get one and that they need to allow it to play to its natural completion. Brax and J.D. are the only ones not taken to a room as their fantasy is starting now which is a wild party.The following morning Gwen meets with Mr. Roarke who inquires more about what her fantasy is. It ends up being to fix the biggest regret of her life as she doesn't feel she deserves happiness. This means going to the date where Allen Chambers (Robbie Jones) proposed and she turned him down. Melanie's is to punish a childhood bully who made her life a living hell. It turns out that her bully was Sloane and it goes darker than Melanie is ready to go. Patrick's fantasy is to be a soldier, as he wasn't allowed growing up. What he gets isn't necessarily what he's expecting when he comes face to face with Lieutenant Sullivan (Mike Vogel).All the while, we're seeing a specter that is disfigured as well as a wild looking man named Damon (Michael Rooker). The reason they're all there might not be what they were expecting and they all share something in common as it becomes a fight for survival from cartel members, soldiers and a monstrous man named Dr. Torture (Ian Roberts). There's also a secret within the island of how these fantasies are possible.Unlike many of my cohorts in the horror community, I don't despise PG-13 horror films. Not all of them need to ramp up the blood and gore to be effective. An example for me is Happy Death Day which does feel more like a comedy with slasher elements. I didn't think other movie was great, but it was fun. This one here is really taking slasher elements again, but mixing in adventure, fantasy and mystery. If you're not going to go hard R with the blood and kills, you really do need these secondary elements to work.To start with what I liked, there's a mystery and story underneath everything that is happening on the island. This connects all of the characters and I liked it. I will admit, I was starting to get bored until that plot really surfaced. That's where it caught my interest. Shifting slightly to a negative, there's really only one of these initial fantasies that are horror, being that Melanie is torturing her bully and a dark manifestation of a doctor that she dealt with as a child who she called Dr. Torture. The other fantasies do take this turn though as it progresses.The major issue I had though would be the pacing. This movie runs 109 minutes and I think that's too long. What makes it wild though is that as it doesn't take long to get into it. We get to see the fantasies of all of the characters before they start to play out in ways they weren't expecting. The problem becomes it takes too long to get into what's brought them together and the truth. I lost interest and didn't really find things all that interesting in the second act until it all collides. It does pull me back though and I thought the ending was fine. It has a nice little nod to the original show, but I've never seen that so I had to look it up to understand. This is slightly problematic as this is directed toward a younger audience. I don't know if you're get to get a lot of people in the cinema or to see this that enjoyed the original show or its remake so it could be lost on them. You're also not going to get my age group or younger to use this as a reason to watch the shows either.What I will give credit here to is the actors and their performances. I'm a fan of Pe\u00f1a and thought he was fine for this role. He does play it cryptic which makes sense for the island he works at and what he's doing to progress the story. Maggie Q feels like the most accomplished aside from him and that would make her the other star. The problem with having four main characters though is that they do disappear for stretches. She's brooding with her past and it works. I was actually really impressed with Hale here. She's quite forward to start out with, which is different from her role in Truth or Dare. There's more to her as we learn more about her past. I thought Stowell was fine along with Doubleday, Yang and Hansen. I did like the cameos by Rooker, Vogel, Kim Coates, Roberts, Jones and Goran D. Kleut as well.That will take me to the effects here. To be honest, they're a bit light. We do get some CGI, but they actually don't go all that heavy. It's usually used to make someone's eyes go dark, some smoke as well as having people disappear before they're seen. This of course being hallucinations so I'm willing to allow that. So overall this is not a big deal and doesn't really affect anything where I was bothered. Being this is a PG-13 film, it's lighter on blood as well. They do have some guns here, so they can avoid things there. I would say that the cinematography is fine overall.Now with that said, I never try to come into a movie to hate it before I've seen it. This does do some good things for sure. I like the underlying mystery of the movie. I think the reveal of the truth is good and incorporating a bit of supernatural elements as well. The acting is solid across the board and I don't really think any issues with the effects. This does run a bit long which caused me to lose interest a bit. The soundtrack really didn't stand out, but it also didn't hurt my opinion either. If you like these Blumhouse type films, give it a viewing. It's not bad and would say that my rating here is just slightly over average."}, {"id": 122, "text": "This is bad filmmaking. Jeff Wadlow is the writer and director of this film.

Ms. Coal goes out of her way to torture, maim and murder dozens of strangers, just because she's laboring under the delusion that they conspired to ruin her first Real date with the latest in what is surely a long string of Dream Guys. (Ms.. Coal's lifetime romantic highlights are necessarily limited to first dates, because once anyone starts rubbing elbows with this monkey wrench of a wench they are bound to immediately discover what a sordid failure of a human being she actually is.) Evil torture comes as naturally to Melanie as water off a dolphin's back. Lying, back-stabbing and navel gazing all are second nature to her. To add in salt to injury, even her perceived slights are second- or third rate. For instance, she accuses Sloane of dumping a bucket of toilet water on her during an eighth grade school dance. Most likely Ms. Coal is conflating the actual scene featuring a vat of PIG'S BLOOD from the CARRIE movies with something that may (or may not) have happened to her in her own tiny life. (Perhaps some girl flicked a few droplets of water toward her from the next sink over in the Girl's Room.) At any rate, If Melanie had had any friends, doubtless she would have organized her own chapter of the Trench Coat Mafia. Because her abrasive personality ruled out any possibility of such close associates (and given her total lack of gumption and stick-to-it-ness), Mr. Coal instead waits until long after her perceived wrongs' expiration dates to take disproportionate revenge."}, {"id": 133, "text": "Seeing the rate made me hesitant to watch it.

The plot followed all the different characters and their development throughout the movie and them dealing with the past and learning how to move on with their lives. I also love the idea of fantasy being one thing in one's head, but playing out completely differently if it were real. It pushes a message of don't loose yourself in your fantasies.However, the writer rushed the third act with a dumb plot twist. Towards the end I thought each of them were going to face their inner demons in their physical forms as that was where the movie seemed to be doing.

Well, it really wasn't. Ironically, this movie remake/reboot of the iconic late 70s-mid 80s TV series had a lot of similarities to that show. I say ironic because, frankly, many reboots of popular TV series fail to do that very thing. They tend to go their own way in trying to be completely different and in many cases, they end up awful. And despite the below-5 rating, Fantasy Island is actually not awful.Now, don't get me wrong, there are definitely some weaknesses with this film, most notably some of the characters are very annoying. In particular, I found the jabberjawed millennial Melanie and the two partying 13-going-on-30 stepbrothers to be extremely overbearing. The 2 brothers were supposed to be this comedy duo, but most of their jokes fell flat. The best charactrers were Roark, Julia, and Sloane. Also, Gwen and Patrick were cool characters and I thought their fantasies were well done.The film did a reasonably good job of intermingling horror with human subplots, something that the original series did as well. In fact, the series started out as a very dark, twisted, horror piece before it turned into a rather campy popcorn entertainment as it wore on in it's later seasons. What really surprised me about this movie is that most of the emotional beats actually worked and in fact were the best aspects of it.

More different races and sexual orientation reflecting a difference from the 70's show is the Fantasy Island movie.

There is both straight and gay sexual fantasy on a sex Island, and revenge slasher horror movie Fantasy to woke and spice up the Fantasy Island.

That's the famous quote from the 70's television series Fantasy Island. Now over forty years later, we have Fantasy Island the movie. Fantasy Island the movie is like the PG-13 rated horror version of the TV show. I also got a sort of tingling, Twilight Zone/Flatliners vibe as I watched it.2020's Fantasy Island contains actors you thought were kinda out of the business at this point (Maggie Q., Michael Rooker, Kim Coates). Fantasy Island also makes these actors seem goofy while they play down to their forgone potential. The film is about five linked people who visit a fictitious island only to have their fantasies turn into wretched nightmares.Campy, creepy, stupidly humored, tone confused, and lushly story boarded (at least until the final act), Fantasy Island entered theaters this month with little hype, little marketing, and a kind of dated approach. It's eerie fun for most of the way though and it's a long shot but the midnight movie circuit might be calling Fantasy Island in years to come.Directed by a guy known for action and/or horror flicks (Jeff Wadlow) and garnering a running time of 109 minutes, Fantasy Island is kinda wishy-washy about what it really wants to be. For my money, it's outmoded tripe for anyone nostalgic about the late Ricardo Montalban (or the late Herve Villechaize). It's also B-movie tripe for anyone who dug the revised movie versions of Charlie's Angels, CHiPs, and/or Baywatch.Helmer Wadlow fashions Fantasy Island as a fast-paced mutt of a film with twists and turns thrown in just for the heck of it.

Must see movie this month."}, {"id": 191, "text": "When I first heard that they were going to be making a movie of the long running TV series that was so popular when it aired on TV I had reservations. How could they recreate the series in a single film? Then I heard they were going to change it up and make it more of a horror offering. For me that cinched it, this film could not be any good. Fortunately I was wrong. It's a blast.The film opens with a woman on the run in the jungle, hiding in a house where she is soon captured. It quickly changes gears and much as the series did we see a sea plane landing on a mysterious island in the Pacific as a watchful eye sees them land. This is Julia (Parisa Fitz-Henley) who runs and alerts the man in charge, Mr. Roarke (Michael Pena). The occupants of the plane are Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q), Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell), step-brothers J. D. (Ryan Hansen) and Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang), and Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale).The group are all winners of a special vacation, a trip to Fantasy Island where all of their dreams will come true. Greeted by Julia she tells them she is his assistant and he will meet them later. She escorts them to the main house and has the staff show them to their rooms along with their luggage.That is except for J.D. and Brax. Instead of a room Roarke meets with them and escorts them to a different part of the island, informing them that their fantasy has already begun. As they come out of the jungle they find a hidden oasis, a fancy house and a huge pool filled with glamorous women and men. It turns out J.D. is there for the models and Brax is gay. Both have their dreams come true as the party gets started with them in control.Roarke meets with the other guests and tells them that their fantasies will begin after they get a good night's rest. The next day we learn what each of them had in mind. Gwen wanted another chance to change her lift and redo her greatest regret, turning down a marriage proposal and living a life with the man she loved, having children. Patrick wants to be a soldier like his deceased hero father. Melanie wants revenge on the girl that tormented her throughout high school.Each one of these individuals has their fantasy come true. But not quite as they expected. Gwen still questions her choice. Patrick is reunited with his deceased father on the mission that he died on. Melanie has the chance to literally torture her tormentor but has second thoughts when a murderer enters the picture. And J.D. and Brax discover that their dream home was actually owned by a drug runner who has returned to reclaim his home.This pattern follows the map left by the original series but it soon becomes different when the characters find themselves crossing over into each other's fantasies. By doing so it enhances the film and makes it much more fun. Just why are their fantasies combining? How far will their fantasies go? Does the island have the ability to bring them back to life if they die during their fantasies? And why is it that Roarke does what he does? What is the secret of the island?All of these questions are answered by the end of the film. The story is far deeper and involved than one would expect from a film like this. It holds your interest from start to finish and runs the gamut of emotions from thrilling action to deep emotional turmoil. Even though the film is pure exploitation it carries enough weight to make it better than the concept used behind it.All of the actors do a fantastic job here. Perhaps standing out are Maggie Q. as Gwen showing a depth of character many of her action roles have not allowed her to do. After this film I look forward to seeing her in more movies. Michael Pena also does a fantastic job here. It seems with each role he takes on his abilities become stronger and he too is someone whose name in the credits will most likely be a draw for me in the future.Potential spoiler: The film does leave an opening for a sequel. Second films are often difficult to carry off with enough surprises to match the first film. I for one would like to see another film, to see this turn into a franchise. But the box office results were not that huge, in part because it came out just as the coronavirus pandemic began. In spite of that the film did make $47 million on a $7 million budget so who knows. Perhaps we will see the mysterious Mr. Roarke once more.

So is it a cross between both genres or a hybrid? Well it did not feel like a big funny comedy nor did it feel like a full on horror, i guess mystery would be the best way to describe the genre.

This movie is a waste of time &amp; money!If there is anything redeeming I can say about this movie is that it has an interesting concept but it's poorly written and executed. The idea that your deepest fantasies and desires can have dark consequences is something the original TV show explored but with less of a focus on the horror aspect.The problem this movie has it that the overall story doesn't make sense. The way this was put together makes me wonder if the filmmakers were drunk &amp; high and when they wrote and directed this mess. The story starts out well enough but quickly devolves into literal nonsense. The movie tells both the guests of the island and we the audience that only one fantasy can be had and it needs to be played out to its end no matter good or bad. However, because the filmmakers felt the need to be clever, this is quickly discarded for a nonsensically cheap twist that even a five year old would scratch their head at.What's even worse is that they don't even begin to start trying to setup the ending twist(s) until a little over halfway through. Add to this, when the twist occurs, several characters have to mansplain it to everyone because it literally makes no sense whatsoever.Whether or not you saw the original TV series or its remake with Malcom McDowell, DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!

I didn't think it would be that, but then a little of this, and that, and a twist into something totally different. It was confusing, and I have so many questions as to how everything that was a twist and turn came out to be. For instance, what was the deal with the black zombies? What really happened the day of the fire that killed the one guy? How did the one chick who was supposed to go on a date with him that day even know the others played a role in his death somehow?

But this doesn't turn out to be the case and their biggest fantasies turn into their biggest nightmares. Wow what an embarrassment of a film Fantasy island, it was beyond poor and I honestly struggled to find any positives.First of all, there was no character background and the characters were incredibly irritating. The characters were just thrown onto the island with no information about them whatsoever, so you instantly didn't care about them due to the lack of time they took to flesh out the characters before they got onto the island. And a large majority of the characters were terrible and irritating. Lucy Hales character was incredibly annoying, stupid and self-centred with no likeable qualities at all. The brothers were the most annoying characters in my memory. Annoying personalities, nothing likeable at all, with awful one liners and they were trying to be funny, but it was just incredibly awkward to watch them.Next the script was beyond poor and most of the performances were actually pretty bad as well. Wow where to start with the script, it made no sense. The lines that some of the characters came out with were so bad and cringey it made me laugh for all the wrong reasons. It felt like a poor first draft that should have been re written multiple times to get a half decent movie it just felt sloppy and unprofessional. And I have to say I thought most of the performances were actually poor. The performances were either clunky and not believable with none of the relationships feeling realistic. Or it just seemed like the actors didn't care and weren't trying to be good it was strange and shockingly poor.Now time for my very positives, firstly the only two performances that were half decent were Michael Pena and Maggie Q. Michael was actually fairly creepy in places and manipulated the other characters well. And Maggie Q actually tried in my opinion. I cared about her character and her emotion was the most believable out of all the characters. Next the cinematography was decent basically the island looked nice. And finally some of the characters fantasies were fairly interesting and were briefly explored well, the fantasies about having a family and revenge on a childhood bully as key examples that briefly worked for me.Now back to the negatives, there was poorly executed plot twists and to many lapses in the logic. Wow I appreciate the attempt at plot twists but it would have been nice if they were believable and actually made sense. The twists of why Michael Pena's character was stuck on the island and the real villain of the film made no sense whatsoever and made the film fall apart. There was just to many unexplainable moments that were not answered once again linking back to the poor script.My next two negatives would be the lack of character depth and development and my emotional disconnect to the film. Wow the film added no new elements to the characters throughout apart from the basic personality and one things from their past it was like they weren't trying therefore I cared about practically none of the characters, this also led me to have a complete emotional disconnect from the film. They tried to add emotional moments to Michael Pena's character that fell flat, they tried to add emotional moments about bullying for Lucy Hale's character it fell flat. And both of the deaths in the movie I didn't care about and they were poorly executed and rushed.My final two negatives would the films lack of tension or Jumpscares and its massive tonal inconsistencies. This film was supposed to be a tense horror film, but I was not tense at one point and I was not made jump even once. This was largely due to the poorly timed and predictable Jumpscares and lack of tension building just brief outbursts of what was supposed to be a tense scene. And the films tonal inconsistencies were crazy. I genuinely don't know what genre this film was supposed to be. It had elements from horror, thriller, comedy, action, sci fi and none of them blended well whatsoever therefore making it seem like multiple different versions of the same film put poorly together.Overall Fantasy island is an embarrassment of a movie.

We have Fantasy Island, and holy crap, I loved the movie. It was so amazing to experience everybody's fantasies. One was Revenge, One was Seeing dead ones, One was life of party, and One was do-over. I found it unique to experience the fantasies each Visitor had. And it was even more interesting when the twists happen.1. Melanie: Revenge - Wanted a kid friendly revenge such as embarrassment on a bully that traumatized her. She then realized that the revenge was going too far when a guy came in and cut her bully's wrist2. Peter - Seeing his Father - Peter wanted to see his Father who died a hero. He gotten the chance to see him, but ended up changing what would happen. His father still died a hero but instead of saving his team, he saved his son3. JD and Brax- Party life - They gotten a great party with males (Brax is Gay) and Females. But the house they party in...I think it belonged to the Mafia so they were involved with the mafia 4. Gwen - Do Over - She wanted to change things in her life which was say Yes to getting Married and Save her neighbor (Nick) from the fire. The second was the twist.Now there were some questions I was having about the movie. For starters, the twist where the twists to each Fantasy was Melanie's doing as revenge for losing her love Nick. What was more confusing was how did she know the visitors she was with was part of it. Her Lover Nick died in the fire. The visitors of Fantasy Island was there around the fire, but Melanie wasn't there when it happened. She said she read about it so how did she know who was there?

What could possibly go wrong? Well, the opening sequence where a terrified woman is chased and caught is a clue, as is the fact that the UK Censor's card reveals that the film's full title is Blumhouse's Fantasy Island, Blumhouse being a horror production house.So,the old TV series reimagined as a horror. It's not a bad idea, and the 4 tales here (and the wider story they become part of) are nicely contrived and ravelled together.The cast is decent, with Michael Pena doing well as Mr Roarke.

So, I guess that hearing it over and over again one evening I thought that it might be a good idea to check it out. Mind you, I was a little bit dubious about it though because I could see that it was going to be one of those horror/thriller type films, something that the original series (not that I ever watched it) wasn't.So, we have this island where basically all of your fantasies come true. However, there are two rules - you can't change your fantasy, and you have to play it through to the end. Mind you, there is a reason as to why this is the case, but it sort of goes to suggest that there is more going on behind the scenes than what really meets the eye. Of course, we learn that one of the characters wants revenge against a high school bully, but the reality is more evident than otherwise.Personally, I really don't want to give too much away with this film because there is a lot that is actually going on behind the scenes that is building up to the climax. Further, there is quite a number of twists and turns that sort of leaves you wandering what is actually going on. Mind you, the characters sort of can't quite believe that all of this is true, and there is certainly something about the island that makes this to be the case. However, another aspect of the film is about how one's fantasies never actually turn out exactly the way that they want them to, and that there is always a much darker side to it than meets the eyes.Mind you, as I mentioned, there is more going on than meets the eyes, but the problem is that there does seem to be some inconsistency in the movie, that is between the start and the final reveal at the end, and as to what is actually going on. I guess that one thing sort of was designed not to make it too obvious as to the whole mystery behind the island, but in another sense, it does upend the continuity, and consistency, somewhat.Still, in the end, this film did turn out to be somewhat better than I expected, and while I wouldn't necessarily consider it to be one of the best films that I have seen, it was still quite enjoyable."}, {"id": 237, "text": "Michael Pe\u00f1a runs Fantasy Island where everything is possible.

If you see BLUMHOUSE PRODUCTIONS before your movies, RUN.Where to start with Fantasy Island? Remember Khan on the mysterious island with the little guy shouting Ze plane! Ze plane!? Well, not here. You get Michael Pe\u00f1a, a great comedic actor, being all broody while five largely unlikable characters live out their fantasies on aforementioned mysterious island.I'm unsure how to review this movie without dropping spoilers so here we go. Our guests are Melanie (Lucy Hale), a young woman who fantasizes about evenge on her high school bully; Patrick (Austin Stowell), a cop who wanted to be in the military; Gwen (Maggie Q), who regrets rejecting her boyfriend's marriage proposal; and brothers J. D. (Ryan Hansen) and Brax (Jimmy O. Yang), who want it all.Once in their respective fantasies, the group find that all is not what they expected. Melanie realizes that her tormentor, Sloane (Portia Doubleday), is really there to be tortured. Patrick comes across his father (Gordon D. Kleut), who died in the war when he was young. Gwen accepts the proposal, and gets her happily ever after. J. D. and Brax indeed have it all: parties, girls and, in Brax's case, guys. And then there's Damon (Michael Rooker), a private investigator out to expose the island's secrets.What follows is a web of mystery and ideas that likely came up late in production, and the director, previously responsible for such misfires as Kick-Ass 2 and Truth or Dare, said throw it in! How everything unfolds, that's not for me to go into excruciating detail about, but in the end, it becomes evident that this movie was merely a prequel for the TV series."}, {"id": 281, "text": "I really enjoyed this movie as it leaves the viewer wondering how what and why for most of the film. A good blend of suspense, fantasy, horror and drama all blended into an interesting yet curious storyline which goes a bit beyond believability, but still draws you in.Regardless enjoy it for what it is, adventure action aplenty with a dose of fantasy thrown in for good measure. Some fine moments as well as some cheesy ones balance out and all in all a movie worthwhile watching. Definitely a strong 7/10. I enjoyed the brief yet short tribute to the original at the end, definitely leaving itself open to a sequel or two."}, {"id": 282, "text": "The low ratings are just silly. It's a good story.

I would hope for a sequel and who knows maybe they can make it alot better."}, {"id": 284, "text": "British author W.W. Jacobs coined the phrase, Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it. Chiefly, Jacobs is known for his grisly short story The Monkey's Paw. Penned in 1902, the tale features a severed primate's paw. A devilish holy man in India casts an evil spell on it and gave it to a British soldier. The Briton could make three wishes and the simian's extremity would grant them to its owner. According to the soldier, the holy man wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives and that those who interfered with it did so to their own sorrow. When I was in middle school in 1968, I read this creepy yarn, and I've never forgotten it. Most of what happens in Kick Ass 2 director Jeff Wadlow lackluster horror movie Fantasy Island deals with wish fulfillment and its consequences. A twentysomethings' quintet has the chance of a lifetime to conjure up their dreams at a lush paradise resort island hotel. Not only do these delusional dupes suffer for what they sought, but the audience does, too! Horror comes in the form of jump-scares scattered throughout this second-rate saga that inspired by the vintage ABC-TV series Fantasy Island (1977-1984), co-starring Ricardo Montalban and pint-sized sidekick Herv\u00e9 Villechaize. For the record, Malcolm McDowell replaced Montalban in the short-lived Fantasy Island sequel in 1998.The Fantasy Island premise had promise, but Wadlow and co-scribes Jillian Jacobs and Christopher Roach provide little of either dread or excitement. Blumhouse Productions, headed by Jason Blum, has been producing quality horror features for the last fifteen years. The Paranormal Activity, Sinister, and Purge movies constitute some of its successful franchises. Let's not forget director Jordan Peele's Get Out (2017) and Us (2019). Alas, not everything Blum and Blumhouse Productions has produced has panned out. The Gallows, M. Night Shyamalan's The Visit, the Ouija movies, and The Boy Next Door rank as Blum's blights. The catch, however, is most Blumhouse movies boast such ultra-low budgets that they recoup not only their costs, but they also earn enough often to justify sequels. Not surprisingly, despite its rich potential and abortive promise, Fantasy Island has tripled its $ 7-million production costs, earning over $24-million globally, and with a good chance for a sequel.As Fantasy Island opens, five people are flown into the resort. Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale of Scream 4), Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q of Mission: Impossible III), Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell of Whiplash), and stepbrothers JD Weaver (Ryan Hansen of G. I. Joe: Retaliation) and Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang of Crazy Rich Asians) were all winners in a television contest for a weekend retreat at an idyllic hideaway. Of course, this is what Wadlow and his co-writers want us to believe. Before its interminable 110 minutes ends, you'll know something far sinister was planned collectively for all five of them. Meantime, each must experience a fantasy, and we are treated to a variety. A former city policeman, Patrick wants to rumble in the jungle like a soldier, so he can sample the shenanigans that his heroic military father, Lieutenant Sullivan, lived and died for in combat. As it turns out, Patrick never knew his pop, so imagine his surprise when he encounters him during his rugged escapade! JD and Brax want to quench their loins, reflecting their different sexual preferences, with gals and guys galore. Melanie wants to exact vengeance on a Mean Girls bully, Sloane (Portia Doubleday of Carrie), who made her high school years an ordeal. Finally, Gwen hasn't recovered from rejecting a marriage proposal from Rocklin (Robbie Jones of American Dreamer) several years ago. She has lamented the loss of either the love of a husband or a daughter. The enigmatic Mr. Roarke (Michael Pe\u00f1a of The Mule) welcomes them to the island. Regret is a disease, he comments before he specifies the two rules of Fantasy Island. First, they cannot change fantasy because they don't like it. Second, they must see their fantasies through to either good or bad ending. Meanwhile, a harried private investigator skulking about the island, Damon (Michael Rooker of Guardians of the Galaxy), has discovered the source of Roarke's incredible power and he wants one of the guests to alert the outside world. Gradually, the fantasies of our quintet, including Mr. Roarke, intertwine for one complicated exercise in screwball horror that involves more than just them. Along the way, we see a lot of eerie zombies bite the dust, and their eyes squirt dark oil. Gwen has the most challenging and complex fantasy when she learns that five years have passed, and Rocklin and she have had a daughter! Alternately, Melanie wants to torture Sloane, but she has second thoughts and relents.You won't find any slices of provocative horror in Fantasy Island. This contrived potboiler doesn't baptize audiences in buckets of blood and gore. Indeed, blood is incidental to the convoluted plot with its 22 characters going in circles. The best jump scare occurs near the beginning. A staff member surprises one of the guests in her room. Afterward, nothing tops this single moment. Of course, since it received a PG-13 rating, nobody gallivants about in the buff, while some supporting characters cavort in risqu\u00e9 swimwear, exposing off bronzed, often bodacious physiques. Despite its rating, Fantasy Island is LGBTQIA friendly, with an openly gay male character. Otherwise, everybody else is straight. Nobody gives a bad performance, but these characters are both so superficial that they generate little charisma, and we never feel sympathetic to their plight. Meanwhile, the rest realizes too late their fantasies have been sabotaged by the island. Wadlow shoulders most of the blame for the failure of Fantasy Island to live up to its premise. This sophisticated hokum amounts to more of a soap opera with moments of violence and horror which wouldn't give anybody goosebumps. Little about Fantasy Island qualifies as imaginative enough to recommend it as entertainment."}, {"id": 285, "text": "Good pace and a fun film with some neat surprises.

There are characters in this movie that should be in spoof movies, not in this horror thriller. And by the way, this movie is not a horror movie.

I did enjoy Fantasy Island, it's mindless entertainment, nothing to be taken too seriously. So I don't agree with the negative reviews, but I do agree it was sometimes a bit difficult to follow but overall it's worth a watch.

Richardo Montalban who played O'Roark was a very debonair type of person and he shone through every episode. What most do not know about the story was that O'Roark was an earth bound immortal who granted fantasies for guests in order to figure out the answers to their own moral questions. Whether its regret, envy, jealousy and on and on for each person who has a unique view on life.There are many hints as to O'Roark's existence, which dates back to the bronze age or when Christ was crucified on the cross, and Cartaphilus was cursed to walk the planet before the crucifixion and after he struck Jesus as repentance for his sin. It's very possible that O'Roark was Cartaphilus.I remember one episode near the season ending, which clinched it all together where Roddy McDowell played his opposite opponent... The devil. I don't recall the exact details on that episode but it all ended pretty much the same way. That the guests experienced their faith through tribulations or trials of fate and became more enlightened from it and nobody died.The movie was played out well. Not a lot of sudden impact scenes or jump scares to give the viewer that creepy feeling but some of the action was good. Cavern scene was - - or felt like it was too sterile, and the characters explaining to one another about who was doing what and why seemed too college slap stick.Other than the few flaws and the cliche zombies it was not a bad spring filler. The producers should have kept the theme the same just like the series. That O'Roark was Immortal on earth to help those in need, not some explorer who came across an island and made it his own with a sick wife.

This movie is based on the 1970's tv series Fantasy Island. This is also a movie produced by Blumhouse so you can guess it will be a little different, since Blumhouse usually does horror movies. Michael plays Mr. Roarke, the host of a magical resort type island that has guests fly in on an airplane to have their wishes fulfilled. Lucy &amp; Maggie are a couple of the lucky participants and Parisa is Michael's assistant that goes running to Michael, telling him of the plane's arrival-and no, she is not called 'Tattoo'. Michael tells the people that there are only 2 rules; Only one fantasy per person &amp; they must finish the fantasy, no matter how it turns out. There are some bumps in the fantasies-they don't go according to the guest's wishes-and there are secrets.

The plot had so many holes that I couldn't begin to keep count.

One lady came to get revenge on her school bully, one lady came to deal with her biggest regret, one guy who is a cop came to enlist in the military, and 2 brothers came to have it all.

The guy who wanted to be in the military meets a family member and it was very interesting. I enjoyed the 2 brothers...they were the comic relief, until one was killed and one made a huge sacrifice.This leads to the negatives. The HORRIBLE plot twist near the end of the movie involving the girl who wants revenge on her bully. It was so ridiculous it actually made me angry. The one in charge, Mr. Roarke, had a weak story arc. The movie was TOO LONG. A movie like this should be 90 minutes. 2 hours was so long, it started dragging.

It's a horror film, and not a good one !"}, {"id": 469, "text": "Horror movies almost never get good reviews. Horror as a genre is almost universally frowned upon by critics, so it's no surprise that Fantasy Island, the horror movie version of the classic 1970s/1980s television series, has opened with some of the worst reviews I've ever read for any film of the past decade. What is surprising is that general audiences, for the most part, seem to be agreeing with the critics. People just seem to not be responding to the movie much at all. Maybe it's because I don't have particularly high standards for horror movies these days, or maybe it's because I enjoy the fun stupidity of the Fantasy Island franchise in general, but I find this to be a whole lot better than most are giving it credit for.No, Fantasy Island isn't going to win any awards or be remembered as a horror classic for years to come. It's not going to launch the film franchise that I'm sure the filmmakers are hoping that it will. But, despite the flaws the film may have, Fantasy Island is, at the very least, a ton of fun to watch. Despite an arguably too-long two hour running time, I was engaged in Fantasy Island from start to finish. Almost everything from its dopey jokes, silly island horror cliches (no phones!), and ridiculous plot twists may make most general audiences groan, though I had blast with all of it. The movie is, for both better and worse, exactly what I imagined a horror version of Fantasy Island to be from the moment it was announced. I don't know what critics were expecting from this. In me eyes, it delivered what I expected.Admittedly, a lot of my enjoyment out of Fantasy Island comes from the fact I like everyone in the cast. This is the closest to an ensemble horror film that we've had in a while. The time devoted to each of the guests' four fantasies is given about equal screen time, so even when one fantasy isn't quite as interesting as some of the others, that particular storyline is only dealt with for a few minutes at a time. The Ryan Hansen/Jimmy O. Yang storyline was my personal favorite and although I would have loved to see that play out more, I commend the filmmakers for giving each of the storylines equal weight in terms of importance to the overall piece. All four storylines to eventually merge together in a way that, while convoluted, at least doesn't seem like a cheat. There are several different ways the ending to this film could have ruined everything, but that didn't happen here.I can't argue with critics that argue that parts of Fantasy Island look cheap and that not everything in the plot holds up against close scrutiny, though I would argue those same complaints are true of almost every episode of the old televisions series. My only major complaint is the the film absolutely suffers from not having Tattoo as a character. Tattoo is a huge part of the formula of Fantasy Island and to not have the character front and center made the movie feel like it was missing something necessary to truly be Fantasy Island.Overall, Fantasy Island is not the disaster people are making it out to be. While not a genre masterpiece, it's certainly more entertaining and more fun than 80% of the horror movies I've watched in the past year (maybe I'm just not watching the good stuff). For those who like the cast members and silly, dumb horror with a sense of humor, Fantasy Island is worth the trip. 7/10"}, {"id": 470, "text": "It's all in what you give; I gave, which is all that is.The circle of met her, better than meta.

This movie recreates the feel of the show perfectly for me.Which, to be honest, was somewhat of a disappointment. Re-envisioning this as a horror seemed like genius to me, but this was so watered down, it played like a made for TV movie. If you're familiar with the original Fantasy Island, you can guess the oh, so predictable pattern of the movie within the first 20 minutes. Maybe less. There are no surprises, no stand out performances, nothing new brought to the table. Just a stale rehash of standard TV fare.

Nothing really important happens in this movie. And the re-reading of Greek mythology meets Scream, explaining the \u00ab why \u00bb of the situation, is pretty silly. Another thing I didn't like was the kill count. Close to nonexistent. Maggie Q has the most interesting and compelling character in the movie, and Lucy Hale really improved her acting since her Pretty Little Liars days. Only male characters storylines were those that bored me the most. On one hand you have the comic reliefs, and on the other, the tortured souls. Hardly something to keep you invested.

Fantasy Island pull no punches, and knows exactly what it is - an entertaining bit of escapism with just enough mystery and intrigue to keep the viewer engaged.Yes, Blumhouse is fast becoming one of the most interesting and progressive studios in the buisiness. From Get Out, Happy Death Day, the Invisible Man, Upgrade and Sinister, they've been making a name for themselves as creators and producers of a new kind of 'smart' horror film that pleases critics and audiences alike. As well, they've produced some fantastic non-horror films like BlackKklansman, Whiplash and the Normal Heart. Maybe it's because Blumhouse has such excellent films in their repertoire that Fantasy Island got lumped in with them. Fantasy Island is lighter fare, and there's nothing wrong with that.Using the premise of the original show as a jumping board into madness, the film tells the story of an ensemble of millennials, dumped onto a mysterious island to live out their fantasies. But as most stories like this go - sometimes your greatest fantasy can become your worst nightmare. This simple premise allows for entertaining wish fulfillment, a bit of goofy satire, as well as some good ol' shock and awe. When things go south, however, is when the film gets interesting.Like a weird, semi-serious episode of 'Lost', Fantasy Island tells a compelling mystery story that coasts on the talents of its leads, especially Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Portia Doubleday and most of all, the duo of Ryan Hansen and Jimmy Yang. Twice now, I've seen them onscreen together, and no matter the quality of the film, they always steal the show. Even though the ensemble is great here, the film would have been served much better with fewer characters and a more streamlined plot. At almost two hours long, there's a lot that could have been cut out without sacrificing the story or drama. Couple that with a weird, almost unearned ending, and the film just misses the mark. The end sometimes feels as if it was reshot to make focus groups happier. I was expecting a little more from a film that builds its mystery and suspense surprisingly well.All in all, this isn't a perfect film, but it's sure as Hell entertaining, and there's a lot worse ways to spend a quiet night or afternoon. An enjoyable, entertaining and light bit of escapism worth watching due to the cast and cinematography raising the bar above mediocre.

Sure, her storyline is kind of cliche but you feel for her through the film. Besides this, the interaction between Lucy Hale and Portia Doubleday is an interesting aspect of the movie to a certain extent.CONS: ~The mystery element of the island isn't properly explained. Only one fantasy is supposed to be satisfied but some characters conveniently break the rules. Furthermore, why do the different fantasies intersect each other and what are the overall qualities of the island? ~The ending twist makes no sense and you question everything you have watched. It's proven that Lucy Hale's character is the actual villain but she looks surprised when she arrives on the island. There is one torture scene specifically where at first she thinks that the kidnapped woman (Portia Doubleday) in front of her is fake but then shockingly realizes that everything is real. The revelation that all the other guests are responsible for the death of her tinder boyfriend is weird, not to mention that it is impossible to find that all these people were present the night of the tragic event. ~The subplot of Austin Stowell's character is laughable. At some point he has the opportunity to be together with his dead father (Mike Vogel) but for some reason when the latter takes a different path -to be with his son- he is criticized by his son for not being a hero. ~The jokes don't land for the most part. Jimmy O. Yang and Ryan Hansen play two brothers who are very stereotypical and deliver some cringeworthy lines. In other words, they are a strong example of the overall dialogue of the movie which is terrible (why do they keep repeating that they are beloved brothers?). Moreover, the decision of the first one to stay on the island instead of his brother (who has died during the movie) is nonsensical and the fun service that is given to the viewers of the old Tv series related with him is forced. ~Michael Pena is totally miscast here. He is more softer than he's supposed to be and the behavior of the others towards him in the end is laughable after all those things he has done to them. Michael Rooker's presence is almost nonexistent and it's a pity that the film doesn't use him more. ~The film lacks the horror element. There are a few jump scares that aren't effective and the zombie-like creatures are uninteresting.

It is also revealed that everyone had a part in Nick's death.Here's where the problems begin.1) Right off the bat, I thought How does Melanie know who all had a part to play in Nick's accidental death? Brax was his roommate. Why would he be an active participant in Nick's killing? Patrick is shown to be a police officer at the scene of the fire. Again, from the very many police personnel, how would Melanie even know if Patrick was there at all?2) When the grenade is about to go off, wouldn't it be a wise decision to just escape with the others instead of bodyslamming onto it?3) If it was indeed Melanie's fantasy, why was Dr. Torture after her and attempted to injure/kill her?4) When the party scene is shown, who are all those people? Where did they come from? Are they some kind of projections (Inception reference) or are they actual people? If they're not actual people, Alessandro would simply respawn wouldn't he?5) How was Damon surviving and feeding himself?6) How did Sloane &amp; Gwen magically figure out that whoever drinks the water gets their wish?7) Initially, when the panic room posse shuts the door, why did they not reopen it there and then?

Attaching the Blumhouse name to the project proved to a be a fatal mistake, which no one could have seen coming except everyone. I'm not sure there was really much juice to squeeze from this rotten fruit, but whatever there was, the filmmakers certainly made the least of it.The lack of star power in the cast provides the first hint of the movie's pitiful quality. A startlingly overqualified Michael Pena stands out as the only exception. He plays the mysterious Mr. Roarke, the man running the island's resort. He's meant to be mysterious, at least. The big mystery to me is why Michael Pena agreed to be in the movie.The guests on the Fantasy Island arrive as winners of contest, gifted a chance to live out their single most desired fantasy. Among the collection of annoying and moronic characters are two unfunny brothers whose veins run rich with alcohol and dimwittedness. They fantasize of having it all. Other guests include a late-blooming former social outcast who fantasizes about getting revenge on a junior high school bully, a career woman who regrets declining a past marriage proposal, and a cop who dreams of being in the army.The story carries out much as expected, with Mr. Roarke giving warnings about their fantasies not panning out as they might expect, warnings the guests promptly ignore. The scenes in which the guests finally live their fantasies are not scary nor funny nor interesting in any way. Each story attempts to strike a jarringly different tone, which makes the movie feel a handful of separate stories that are haphazardly slapped together.None of the story seems fully realized or even partially realized. Saying this script feels like a first draft would be generous - it's more like a few scribbled notes that were never once proofread.After each fantasy takes a dark turn, there isn't much more that happens. The story doesn't advance in any meaningful way, never gaining momentum. Every few minutes a new scene will come to a grinding halt as a different character pukes exposition to let viewers know why things are happening. It's an offensive violation of the show don't tell rule of writing.Of course, the writers save the worst for last. A third act plot twist comes out of left field and makes absolutely no sense when held to the slightest bit of scrutiny. The rest of the plot, which was already dangling by a single thread of coherence, is completely invalidated by the big reveal.

At times it felt like it wanted to be an action movie and it carried different tones throughout the movie (which I think dragged and soul have been way shorter) and even during the second act it felt it wanted to be like 'Indiana Jones' and go on a mission to :destroy'the Island' The LACK of exposition really infuriates the audience watching because it makes it hard to follow.Terrible movie. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of its amazing location shots and georgeous setting. They wasted Micheal Pena and Rookers character.

No, I'm not talking about the fantasies turned nightmares at the centre of the film, but rather the need for films like Fantasy Island to remind audiences what constitutes a good film to begin with.At the top of that list should be a coherent storyline, something which Fantasy Island didn't seem able to budget into its meagre $7 million price-tag. What begins as a fun B-grade horror/thriller quickly descends into abject nonsense, with a last act that will either have you howling in laughter or utter disbelief... or both. It's like the studio decided to take the supernatural elements from Lost, but forgot to bring the nuance, depth or philosophical pretence that made that show (mostly) work. Or they just hired the guys who wrote Truth or Dare.Full disclosure, I have never seen an episode of the same-titled 70's show upon which the film is based on. Maybe those who find the show a guilty pleasure will be more forgiving of the film's utter nonsense.

We are captives of our own imagination when we dream about different outcomes of past events. We are slaves to our minds when it starts asking What if.....?every choice we make in life , is a crossroad and every-time you make a different choice a storyline is revealed and another alternative remains unexplored. The alternative becomes an untold story that disappears into thin air. When we think of regret ... when we look back and say I wish I made a different choice , we are transfixed on that one immediate effect that we want to change; But we rarely think of what comes after, the butterfly effect of that choice. How this one diverge in the road will change the whole story because It will change all of the next chapters of your life. you wont be the same person you are today, you wont be in the same place you are right now.

It truly is an imaginative approach, and certainly relevant given all the remakes/reboots of the movie's decade. That being said, it is not without flaws and oversights.The characters are fairly interesting, and the plot does exist. There is a mystery and everyone's situations payoff and come together in the end. So kudos for that. But there are traces of lazy writing and some annoying plot holes, if you think about it too much. The performances depend on the person. Michael Pena, who portrays Mr. Roarke, is excellent in his role, while Michael Rooker is quite hammy as a rogue jungle-detective.But one must give the filmmakers credit for refraining from an R-rating, especially given the previous success of titles like 'Joker' and 'Us.' The horror here is pretty creepy without being stomach turning.While it is not faultless, 'Fantasy Island' is a step in the right direction as far as creative re-makes, and horror that isn't just for gore fans. I hope Blumhouse can take lessons from this and learn to improve upon this model, instead of just giving up due to a fair amount of negative responses."}, {"id": 709, "text": "Fantasy Island is a movie based upon a popular television show of the same title of the seventies about a magical island resort. The movie tells the story of five young adults who have won a contest to come to a magical island resort to make their wildest dreams come true. Two quirky half brothers dream of throwing a big party and having sexual intercourse with hot girls and guys, respectively. A lonesome woman regrets not accepting when her former boyfriend proposed to her five years ago and wants to change the past. A young man dreams of becoming a soldier and wishes he could save his father who was killed in action in Venezuela. A young woman wants to take revenge on a school bully who had terrorized her for years. All their dreams become true but soon take a sinister twist they didn't anticipate. The five protagonists soon realize that they have something in common. They must find out what that is in order to leave the island alive.This movie convinces in numerous departments. The story has multiple twists and turns that will make your head spin. The individual fantasies of the four groups of protagonists are diversified and entertaining. The locations are absolutely stunning and deserve the title Fantasy Island for sure. The movie mixes intense action sequences, gloomy fantasy elements and mild horror moments in a balanced way. The film has steady pace and entertains from start to finish. The film includes some interesting side characters such as the mysterious host of the island and a man who lives and hides on the island and seems to have his own agenda.On the other side, some of the characters are rather shallow, especially the two half brothers who seem to be rather dim-witted and only think about booze and sex. The film's horror elements aren't really spooky and the movie overall rather qualifies as quirky adventure flick. The story ends up having so many forced twists and turns that the viewers will end up being all confused in the final twenty minutes.Still, Fantasy Island is thoroughly diversified, entertaining and fast-paced. It's not the most creative, memorable and profound film but it never attempts to be that way and delivers the goods in the action, adventure and fantasy departments. Many people who rated this movie down obviously had wrong expectations right from the start. This movie isn't among Blumhouse greatest productions such as Happy Death Day, Insidious and The Gift but it's certainly better than Paranormal Activity, Truth or Dare and Unfriended.

This is true, but as time passes, their dreams become nightmares and it would appear that the guests are in fact part of someone else's fantasy - someone seeking revenge for past indiscretions.Featuring a mad doctor with a stapled shut mouth, dead soldiers reliving a dangerous mission, a crazed private eye lurking in the undergrowth (Michael Rooker giving a career worst performance), masked armed drug dealers, a spot of Saw-like torture, and a wild pool party complete with big-breasted models and muscle-bound hunks, it might sound as though boredom wouldn't be an option. Unfortunately, this isn't the case, the convoluted post-twist final act dragging on for far too long with little in the way of logic but plenty of contrivances.After much inane nonsense, and a particularly dumb denouement, the film closes with a dreadful 'tattoo' joke to make fans of the original TV series hate this cinematic turkey even more."}, {"id": 712, "text": "This definitely was the exciting, action, fantasy, thriller I needed on a night in with a glass of wine and take out!

Just sayin."}, {"id": 713, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, no, I have no knowledge of the TV series this film is based upon, and after watching Jeff Wadlow's adaptation, I'm definitely not watching anything related to this story. I always follow this principle: the two pillars of any movie are its story and characters. It doesn't matter if everything else is absolutely perfect. If the two central pieces fail to convince the audience, then the whole movie falls to the ground. Sometimes, there are some crumbles that remain intact. Very rarely, there's a big segment that has no scratches whatsoever, which can help the film to survive and, even more rarely, actually make it okay.Fantasy Island has two little crumbles named Portia Doubleday (Sloane) and Maggie Q (Gwen), who deliver good performances, especially the former who everyone knows from one of the best TV shows of all-time, Mr. Robot. Everything else is completely destroyed. The Grudge still has a couple of redeeming moments, but Fantasy Island is undoubtedly the worst movie of the year, so far. The before-mentioned two pillars are built with the most annoying, cliche characters, as well as a ridiculous narrative that ultimately brings the whole thing down.The third act possesses some of the most nonsensical, irrational, and illogical plot twists I've ever witnessed. This is 2020's version of Serenity, also a movie with an absurd twist that only turns the film even worse than what it was. The big difference between the two plot twists is that Serenity's was predictable from the get-go. Fantasy Island's last twenty minutes are profoundly unexpected because no sane soul would have thought of such a baffling narrative decision.The best way to describe the twist without spoiling a thing (and I won't) is through the editing. During the exposition-heavy revelation, the editing is so awkwardly choppy that it made me think it was all fake. I genuinely thought the plot twist was a false sequence. When I realized it wasn't, I simply laughed like a maniac because I couldn't believe someone thought this made logical sense. Usually, a plot twist carries some sort of build-up, even if it's literally a couple of minutes before the explicit revelation.This one just happens. Without any preparation, a character just shows up on the screen and begins explaining everything. It simply doesn't make any logical sense. It generates so many incongruencies with the whole story that I lost count of the plot holes I was able to point out. The film starts with establishing a few rules, only for an hour later to ignore or change them completely. A particular character acts a certain way without any plausible reason as to why. If the screenplay wasn't messy and confusing enough, the characters are also horribly-written.I never enjoy writing that an actor failed to do its job, but Ryan Hansen (JD Weaver) is the weak link of the cast, even if every single script is dreadful. Even the casting doesn't make sense: Michael Pe\u00f1a as a dramatic Mr. Roarke? A character supposed to be serious and mysterious? It's Michael Pe\u00f1a! I don't want to insinuate that he can only do comedy, but making him the villain (if I can call him that) is another addition to the list of questionable production decisions. Lucy Hale (Melanie) is fine as the protagonist, but it all comes down to the lazy, unimaginative scripts. Everything is so unbelievably messy that I don't even have any sort of technical remarks... Maybe that the beginning of the film and the actual concept look interesting. That's the only compliment I can think of: it wasn't a bad idea (different fantasies, different genres, it could have been a fun mix of styles).Fantasy Island is undoubtedly the worst film of the year until now. Consider it 2020's version of last year's Serenity, but with a third act's plot twist that is so unexpected, everyone will have their jaws on the floor due to how nonsensical it is. The story wasn't close to being decent until the revelation, and it only turned into something a lot worse after it. Dozens of incongruencies and massive plot holes are generated due to the ridiculous attempt at a Shyamalan-like twist. If the absurd narrative decisions aren't enough, the horrible character scripts don't help the not-that-great acting, with the exception of Portia Doubleday and Maggie Q, the only good aspects of the whole movie. In the end, the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are a total failure, making everything else fall apart with no possible salvation.Rating: F"}, {"id": 714, "text": "It is an amazing premise. There is wonderful character development. The acting is great. The casting is well done. The plot is very good and there is a lot of twists and turns. A lot of scary moments and unexpected jumps. The scary element and sci fi resurrection element was really well done. At one point it turned into a journey 2 the mysterious island quest time thing which I really liked. There's only one thing... the writing choices and lines are a bit weird. There was some confusion which had me scratching my head at times to understand why the plot went certain directions. The whole Lucy Hale sex plot was out of place. Some of the bad guys seems strange and cheesy, and the final ending (which I am not gonna spoil) had me quite confused. Good ending don't worry... but It was weird. Regardless, the laugh out loud comedy and the horror moments had me on the edge of my seat. I was emotionally invested and crying at the sad bits. It's a very good movie, but some of the writing choices were a little weird so I can see how it got bad reviews. Personally I enjoyed it and if you can stomach some gore and gross parts, it's a great comedy/thriller/action adventure/i don't know what genre (lol)."}, {"id": 715, "text": "If you never see the series like me, because i'm from other country and never heard it. don't listen to critics they are blink with this one, and i'm sure for the majority of their critics can't be fully trusted,you can watch the movie for couple of minutes and watch the movie your self if it's good or not, you can feel it.and if you like mystery movie, you will absolutely like this one, not your A movie but still has a good one. you know people won't bother makes a review here, if the rating is definitely wrong, people will try to help it. and i'm one of them. it's not because i like anyone, actor and the team. it's because i appreciate the movie, and rating ruins it for people who hesitate to watch this movie.Trust me you won't regret it. this is another 2 hour mystery movie and a good one. start watch this and help fix the rating."}, {"id": 716, "text": "Fantasy Island is a feature film re-imagining of the TV show of the same name that aired from 1977 to 1984.

It tries to be an action-adventure, a comedy &amp; a horror movie, all at once. This doesn't work, for the most part. The writers should have stuck to one main genre &amp; built the other genres around that. There are several twists &amp; turns that will keep you guessing, right till the end.

Michael Pena is outstanding as Mr. Roarke. Parisa Fitz-Henley is amazing as Julia. Ryan Hansen is great as Bradley. Austin Stowell is superb as Randall. Jimmy O. Yang is fantastic as Brax.

Only that all fantasies have to reach their natural conclusion, whatever that may mean. Now important thing to those familiar with the original series from the 70s, this has nothing to do with that. At all. This is a thriller/horror. Some of the fantasies differ from easy (to have it all - which is fulfilled as constant party time,) fixing a mistake in past, becoming a soldier to revenge on a high school bully. The characters do not know how and in what way their fantasies will be fulfilled. It seems all fine and dandy at first, but then different fantasies start to overlap and then it all gets twisted up. The whole cast gives great performances (Lucy Hale and Maggie Q being the stand out), and as the film progresses the film keeps on piling on twist upon a twist and it still makes sense but the main story may be a bit buried upon that heap of twists. It's just too twisty for its own sake. But it's a lot of fun. If you are not looking for anything highbrow, this is great pick.

I didn 't expect anything special from this movie initially. Went just to spend time and enjoy exotic locations of the film - shot on the Fiji Islands (by the way, it was on this island that shot Return to the Blue Lagoon with 15-year-old and already seductive Mila Jovovich) and my favorite actress Maggie Q. And all. And here, suddenly, a very non-cool plot with interesting turns of the plot. Directly pleased. It 's got modern fiction with adventures and a bit of comedy. Although the plot, in my opinion, is very obnoxious, but, apparently, the authors of the film decided that in this case it is better to cross more than not to finish. The film 's actual plot comes from three popular postulates: 1. Be afraid of the dreams! They may be fulfilled, but somewhat not as you expect it to be. 2. We are all responsible for our actions, and this responsibility is irreparable even after a certain amount of time. 3. A person is always given the opportunity to change/correct his Destiny. The main thing is to realize this and make the right decision at the right time.Therefore, in my opinion, the plot of the film turned out to be smart, the plot is quite dynamic, there are several twists, an unexpected ending. Therefore I received sincere pleasure from the film despite quite decent timing - 1h50-min. And yes, I would love to go to this island. To fulfill your most cherished wish.

This film is inspired and intended as a restart of the TV series of the same name from the 70s.In the film, the mysterious Mr. Roarke (Michael Pe\u00f1a) people to come to his remote tropical resort. Here he promises his guests that he will help them achieve their dreams and fantasies. As the new guests from Mr. Roarke living their fantasies and dreams, they begin to realize that in addition to these good things they are also confronted with their nightmares on the island. The guests learn in this way that they have to solve the mystery of the island if they want to leave it alive again.This film was made by the same film team that made the film Truth of Dare in 2018. In this film she tried to turn a simple game into a scary horror film without success. With this new film they are now trying to turn something larger, such as an old TV series, into a horror film. This film is about the different storylines of the different guests who all live up to their imagination and then have to fight their nightmares. The story seems to be difficult to follow, because all of these separate story lines are a bit messy. That is why the script writers have probably chosen to explain almost every scene in the film over and over again, but instead of making it clearer this only makes the film more elaborate. The only thing that gets no real explanation in the film is the size of the film. In this way, the film ends up being long-winded and also an incredible film.This film is also not as strong as a horror film, because a little horror fan can predict when something scary is going to happen in the film. The sound often disappears to come back hard in the film and to serve as a simple jump scare.The acting is also done a bit exaggerated by most of the cast. Maggie Q is the only one of the cast who still has a reasonable storyline to follow that she is trying to make something of. Michael Pe\u00f1a has also been cast a bit wrong, because the Mr. Roarke character from the TV series was portrayed by Ricardo Montalban and in the continuation of the TV series by Malcolm McDowell a bit more in a dark and sinister way. Michael Pe\u00f1a's version of this character is more like the character of Rowan Atkinson from the first Scooby Doo movie."}, {"id": 720, "text": "399. Fantasy Island. It's pretty amazing, no not the movie. It's pretty amazing when you go into something with low expectations they are usually met. And this was no different. With that mindset, I enjoyed it. I remember watching the show as a kid, but it somehow gets meshed with The Love Boat, so I remember Tattoo saying 'de plane, de plane' and Mr Roarke saying 'Welcome to Fantasy Island' that's about it. Minus Tattoo, Mr Roarke welcomes this group of 5 people to the island and explains the rules. Live out your fantasy until it's natural conclusion. Natural conclusion heh? We get two brothers on the Island simply wanting to have it all. Another guy's big dream is to enlist in the military like his daddy. Another guest's fantasy is to get revenge on her high school bully, and the final guest wants to say yes, instead of no at her wedding proposal. And everything is pretty freakin sweet for awhile until they realize that the fantasies are a little too real. Whats wrong with that? Small example: The guys that simply wanted it all. When you have it all, other people usually want to take it from you, including armed masked men! Fantasies with consequences, whats up with that??? I'd want a refund! A movie so bad, it's good. Maybe, maybe not. Guilty pleasure, sure!

What I do know, however, is that Blumhouse's vision of it is a conventional and tedious lackluster. Jeff Wadlow's previous - Truth or Dare - I consider one of the worst horror movies Blumhouse has had to offer. Sadly, Fantasy Island lands right beside it.Months ago, the trailer already put it in the not excited for pile of movies, but I was ready to give it a chance as soon as it gets VOD'd - the cast is quite alright, concept has some intrigue &amp; it's just a big-budgeted horror flick. And so it came around, and so it will be forgotten. Fantasy Island is about a variety of card-board characters landing on Fantasy Island, hosted by the mysterious Mr. Roarke, who, having the reigns over the mystical powers of the island, makes a single fantasy come true for each of the guests. The first half, the most entertaining one (which is not saying much), soon breaks down in episodic nature as we follow each of the guests, their fantasy and confrontations with the island &amp; Mr. Roarke. The other half leads to even more clich\u00e9 and stupider decisions and twists. Pacing starts its suffering downfall right at the start, and your personal fantasy might just be to see the credits roll. With its 109 minute runtime, Fantasy Island overstays its welcome by a margin. Wadlow, together with the Truth or Dare writing team, has beaten all odds and succeeded at making another uninspired and dangerously dull horror movie almost entirely devoid of atmosphere or scares. The horror variables all fell flat, so did the comedy, intentional or otherwise. The cast did not manage to redeem much of anything, the characters were every bit as bad as any other department of the script. For the majority of the movie we go through each character's either trauma, insecurity or whatever else they want to get through. Eventually most of them do, sending a dry, flat and painfully familiar morale towards the viewer, one after another. It seems to be the entire point of the movie. Michael Pena felt a little confused as Mr. Roarke (Jason Blum wanted to cast Nicolas Cage as Mr. Roarke, perhaps a smarter choice, at least there would be some entertainment), Michael Rooker had just about nothing to do &amp; the rest... were pushing their way through this borefest, alright. The visual design, all that 7 million garnish, did little to nothing to impress, the overall aesthetic might just be as uninspired as the plot. Even Bear McCreary's score seemed uninvested in this whole affair.Honestly, I'm almost frustrated at the fact how good this movie did at the box office, for it might cue Blumhouse to make more of these forgettable, basic and flat to an impressive level horror movies. It was a tough time to look for any value or silver linings, the verdict is such that I can't recommend this movie to anyone. And I watched what they called the more hopeful unrated version... My rating: 3/10."}, {"id": 722, "text": "I really wish I could say that fantasy island was a good movie because how much potential this movie had to be good, but sadly this movie was really really bad and disappointing. Yes there is some fun to be had in this movie because of how bad it is there is many scenes in this movie that had me bursting into laughter because of how bad and ridiculous it is. The only good thing in this movie easily has to be the concept of this movie because it's a really intreasting concept, but the execution of the concept was just so bad. The characters in this movie are not likable at all they are all jerks and I didn't care about any of them at all. The movie is also extremely boring and it had me looking at my phones clock just counting down the minutes till the movie was over. The pacing in this movie is so slow and the runtime of 1 hour and 49 minutes felt like 2 hours and 30 minutes. There is so much scenes in this movie that could of been cut out to make the movie shorter but no. The dialog in this movie is awful and had me laughing out loud many times. This movie is not scary at all and a lot of the scares had me either laughing out loud or just rolling my eyes. Overall I really wish I could of gave fantasy island a more positive review but I really didn't like this movie, and that is really disappointing because this movie had a lot potential to be good."}, {"id": 723, "text": "There should never be as much negative energy around a film before it is even released as there was for 'Fantasy Island'. People seemed to think that because 'Truth or Dare' (a film I actually really enjoyed) wasn't to their liking then Jeff Wadlow's next film had to be the same. This film is far from perfect, but it certainly has a lot more going for it and a lot more effort put into it than 90% of the garbage being thrown out in the horror genre today.The first thing I noticed about 'Fantasy Island' before seeing it was that it had a runtime of 110 minutes. This is very odd by today's standards. Very rarely does a horror movie go over 90 minutes long, and if one does it is usually in the vein of 'Midsommar' which pushed right out to around 150 minutes. The reason for the extra 20 minutes in 'Fantasy Island', I quickly realised after beginning to watch it, is because it bites off a lot. There is a tremendous amount going on in this film. There are basically four stories all interweaving and connecting together. The film does its best to juggle them all, but it is an ambitious task it took on.The great thing about there being so much going on is that the movie never lags. The pacing is excellent (until a rough last 20 minutes or so that drag on a little) and before you know it the film is reaching its conclusion. There is quite a mysterious element to the film as well, and before it is revealed what is really going on with the island it is a lot of fun to run through the scenarios and try and work out which direction they are going to take the film in.Where the film lets itself down is in the balance between comedy and horror. Sometimes it just goes way too far down the comedic route, and then two minutes later is asking you to fall right back into the horror path. That isn't an easy transition to make for the audience. Once you get us into a light-hearted, jovial mood it is hard to get out of it. Also the ending of the film leaves a lot to be desired. As I mentioned earlier the film takes on a lot of story, and while it does a decent job of managing it through most of the runtime, wrapping it all up is a different matter. There is a twist that doesn't hit anywhere near as hard as it should. It gets very sloppy, convoluted and basically silly. It's a shame to end the film on that note.There is enough here to make this a watchable film however. The film looks great. It's beautifully shot and the tropical island scenery takes care of itself. The story is ambitious, but ensures you are unlikely to be bored. 'Fantasy Island' is worth a look, but maybe don't get your hopes up too high. You might just find yourself a guilty pleasure."}, {"id": 724, "text": "DE PLANE, DE PLANE! I mean Stream to Big Screen strikes again. This weekend we were able to view Fantasy Island, as well. Fantasy Island is a horror adaptation/perversion of the old TV show from the 70's. The movie stars a cast of characters headlined by Lucy Hale, Michael Pena and Maggie Q. But should people go to the theater to view this movie?Let's start with the easiest way to describe this movie, which is if Shutter Island had a baby with Inception and one of the grandparents was Fantasy Island the TV show. If you've seen those two movies before, WHICH I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DOING IF YOU HAVEN'T, then you know just how deceptive, convoluted, and involved this movie is trying to be. Now, that description could be a compliment but in this situation, it is not. Fantasy Island does not measure up to either movie yet it essentially steals elements of both. Even though it is billed as a horror film, the viewer is deceived because Fantasy Island falls more into the Shutter Island psychological thriller realm than pure horror. The other elements of the movie fall more into the Inception Sci-Fi/Thriller realm. Either way, Fantasy Island fails to have a distinct intent and it's supposed genre was never fully embraced.Furthermore, the movie is so twisted that it straightens itself out before the two final twist reveals. Just listen to how confusing that statement was. Fantasy Island tried so hard to keep viewers on their toes that they ruin their own anti-climatic twists. I will give credit to the producers that the twists were still executed well but they lacked umph. The viewer is left unafraid due to the overly complicated storytelling and plot developments. It would have served the movie well to just be classified more like the previous movies mentioned, rather than not delivering on the horror genre.Even with those issues, the cast was sub-par. Individually, the actors were average, but collectively, the actors were still just average. Lucy Hale was by far the best performance at times but still was annoying. I feel Michael Pena was underutilized and or the writing and directing just squandered the possibility of the character. In fact, all of the ensemble cast had issues of being extremely annoying. Now, that I think about it, the writing in this movie was just poor overall. AH HA, found the issue.With that said, de plane de plane... *clears throat* excuse me. Fantasy Island is a letdown for a horror movie but in a way could have succeeded as a Sci-Fi, psychological thriller. The storyline is not original, which is why they tried to make it so confusing. Or should I say a fantasy within a fantasy within a fantasy. Did they just successfully create an inception?! Either way, you can see this at a matinee time but you're best served waiting for this to come on HBO Go or a streaming service."}, {"id": 725, "text": "I have never seen the TV show that this was based on but I did scratch my head that they were making an update to it and also hearing that it would be more horror. Okay. Then I was having more doubts knowing that it was from Blumhouse, the director of Truth or Dare, and the lead actress from Truth or Dare, Lucy Hale. I was hoping for something semi decent because honestly the premise sounds interesting and with good writing it could be a nice little niche horror. I'm sad to report that this film is terrible. The film is about a group of contestants who win a trip to a place called Fantasy Island. On this island the groups get to explore their greatest fantasy and act on it, almost as if it is happening in real life. The keeper of the island Mr Roarke, explains the island and soon each of the contestants start to live out their fantasies. Soon they realize that the outcomes of their fantasies are horrifying and there are dark secrets abound on this island where escape seems unlikely. When the film started I was hoping for the best. Its an interesting plot for sure. However, as minutes passed by and a pair of contestants kept high fiving each other and dropping bro jokes and references I wasn't so sure anymore. The film drops so bad in quality as it progresses. The film fails as a horror film immediately because all the scares are done exactly when you expect them to turn up. The acting is pretty bad. Pena disappoints and I think Lucy Hale has always been terrible in everything. The twists that they keep pulling in this film are so bad especially the final fifteen minutes where the plot keeps changing. The tone is absolutely all over the place. You get a war scene and people dying and then switch Maggie Q relaxing on the beach relaxing with her fake daughter. Also, the amount of times they try changing the fantasies and try guessing whose fantasy they are in, good grief its over plotted and extremely messy. It makes up rules as it goes along and makes less sense as it goes along. Had to roll my eyes at the end.

Turns out that this movie was a mess of a storyline. The character gallery was for the most part a very flaccid and pointless one, to be bluntly honest. And that gave the actors and actresses very little to work with. And it didn't help that the storyline written by Jillian Jacobs, Christopher Roach and Jeff Wadlow seemed like they were individually told to write something on a concept without talking and sparring together. It was just a mess and a pain to sit through, literally.Not even the performances of Michael Pe\u00f1a, Maggie Q or Michael Rooker could do much to lift up this train wreck of a movie.I managed to sit through the movie in its entire length, but I must admit that my attention was failing the things that happened on the screen. The storyline was just way too clumsy and incoherent to catch my attention.It should be said that some of the visuals in the movie were actually good, but that could only do so much to salvage the rest of the movie.While I suffered through the entire movie, I can now check it off of my watched movie list and I know for a fact that I will never be returning to watch this 2020 movie again - ever.My rating of Fantasy Island lands on a very generous three out of ten stars.

They of course become nightmares and the group of goofy characters must try and escape before they die. Director/Writer Jeff Wadlow of the awful Truth or Dare should be given props for trying to be ambitious and spotlighting a gay asian character. But the film feels so confused. It doesn't know what it wants to be, never brings anything to a satisfying fruition and doesn't commit to anything. I feel most of this us because of studio tampering, test screenings and most likely an unfinished script and a looming release date. The end result is a goofy, confusing film that at times feels more like a drama than a horror film or thriller. It all culminates with a ridiculous twist that makes even less sense than anything that has come before it. I appreciated that the makers tried to do something new they just don't have the talent or creativity to pull it off.

Actually, when I saw the movie poster/banner at first glance I thought it was family friendly adventure movie in same vain as the recent Jumanji and Journey to the Centre of the Earth movies, I would not have guessed horror or thriller. Anyhow, judging the movie by it's cover I already kinda knew what I was getting in to beforehand so the movie letting me know in a overly direct and unsubtle way that it is based on its title name sake didn't phase me all that much. My expectations were set to low and I did actually enjoy the movie and it's darker twist on the 'live your fantasy' premise. Unfortunately that premise never really gets fully explored because about half way through the movie the plot takes a sudden turn, followed by a twist, followed up by another twist and by the end you can only laugh at the ridiculous mess it has become. This movie is basically LOST in a nutshell if LOST was as good as is last few seasons overall. I honestly think that if the plot would've kept on track with the whole 'you get what you wish for' Twilight Zone story and explored it further it could've turned out quite okay. It wouldn't have been nearly as good as a Cabin In The Woods but a least it would have tried to be as interesting. But no, instead we get a unpleasing mash-up of Fantasy Island with late 90's slasher films and a out of place Michael Pena played by Michael Pena. Don't get me wrong, I like Michael Pena, but he basically played the guy he always plays, and then a bored version of that guy. That character needed more, he needed to be more mysterious and charming while being sinister and unpredictable at the same time. This mr. Roarke possesses none of those characteristics and frankly neither does the movie itself. For what this reincarnation sets out to do it fails. It starts of in the right direction but veers of course quickly never really living up to it's potential feeling very timid on the horror and scares along the way.

It was nice seeing her outside of Mr. Robot. Michael Pe\u00f1a was also really good, but his accent threw me off with how fake it sounded.One of the main problems lies within some of the dialogue, especially surrounding the Weaver brother characters. It's something that I looked past, but that didn't stop it from being very cringy at times.The other problem was the entire third act. It goes a little too silly, even for its own standards, and the twists didn't entirely work for me. It's a shame, because the weak third act took a great film down to being just a good film.However, I was genuinely compelled by the first two acts and I loved seeing the fantasies play out.

At no point in the 109 minute runtime did I feel an ounce of tension or suspense. Plot movements feel forced and contrived without making any real sense. They film makes the mistake of trying to explain the magic and all that does is cause more problems.It also struggles from spreading itself too thin. There's half a dozen characters here that are split up right away and we jump back and forth between then, so much so that we never get the chance to really connect to any of them. If the film would've had more focus there could've been some level of investment in the characters. There's also a significant number of moments that just look bad. The cinematography in this is awful. Too many times things just looked bad, whether it be from weirdly shaky shots or awful looking computer editing.The setting is pretty.

Bless them you can all see that they are trying their best...........I commend every single one of them for not breaking down and laughing themselves. You cant blame them at all that is what they were told to do. So I give all of them a pass !!Although it is always nice to see Michael Rooker play a really creepy guy........I really like Michael Rooker I think he is great in everything he does !!Overall there is nothing positive about this film.........well apart form it being under 2 hours.......can you imagine if it was more !!!! 20% out 100 its just a terrible film and concept to being with.........how did this get through the script development stage ???

A horror re-imagination and prequel to ABC's 1977 television series of the same name, it stars Michael Pe\u00f1a, Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Portia Doubleday, Jimmy O. Yang, Ryan Hansen, and Michael Rooker. Produced by Wadlow and Marc Toberoff, as well as Jason Blum through his Blumhouse Productions banner, the plot follows five people who visit the eponymous island, discovering that their dream fantasies brought to life begin to turn into horrific living nightmares they must try to survive.It really bugs me that nobody is giving this movie credit where credit is due, this is an inventive and fun horror thriller which is refreshing in comparison to the likes of most other horror movies out there. The movie even has some pretty emotional moments and makes you think about how you would feel in the same position of the characters.

I could have seen this premise expanded to a series of psychological and twisty horror anthologies like the twilight zone were each fantasy would have been a separate psychological short horror story. Mr. Rourke character could have been a central crypt-keeper like character much like a ring master/fantasy master. Not like the actual skeleton crypt-keeper from the HBO's original series; But a sophisticated Latin man like Ricardo Montalban was. If they had only taken the time to really write each fantasy well with characters that had depth to them. But the makers botched up a great concept, unfortunately. This could have been a really great horror franchise if they had not gone for the quick buck and if had taken the time and love to build this film for the long haul with additional sequels.

The narrative gets convoluted, the motive(s) lack conviction, and that late twist (gosh!) was disastrous, to say the least. I haven't seen the original show that the film is based on, but it's safe to say that it must have been a lot more entertaining than this drivel.Michael Pena and the entire ensemble seem miscast in the flick. Talented actors like Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, and Michael Rooker are wasted in badly written roles. The few positives include the beautiful Fiji locales and the somewhat intriguing first act. I think Jeff Wadlow's intention was to turn this into a less creepy, more sandboxy version of The Cabin in The Woods and Lost (a weird blend indeed!). The stories of the individual characters become less hard-hitting with each line they utter and every passing scene.By the time we get to the finale, the screenplay has run out of solutions to keep you entertained.

Like they were held at gun point to play a role in it. Others, well, they just are bad actors or this was a film made purely for the sake of bringing in income for a quick buck.It felt like a movie made to make fun of horror. Nothing, I mean absolutely nothing, was scary or believable. Nothing was interesting and nothing felt genuine. I honestly felt embarrassed for the cast the whole time. This felt like a film made for TV on Adult Swim or something. I swear the actors were blackmailed into this movie. You could just feel the lack of interest or passion in them.I've heard nothing but bad things about this movie. Reviews from websites to YouTube. I just wanted to try it for myself because maybe I could squeeze some enjoyment out of it. No. I was so wrong. You can get the same feeling out of this film if you go watch a cringe compilation on YouTube.All in all, I feel most of the cast want to brush this under the rug like it never happened. The story, the acting, the writing, and the directing were all just so embarrassingly bad or stale. They must have thought the audience would be slow because most of the movie is characters explaining everything to make sure you, as the audience, understands.

This film has its own Mr Rourke but there's none of Montalb\u00e1n's magic on offer, literally and metaphorically.In its place is a very basic, by the numbers horror, that's not bad as such, its shake and bake entertainment, that's here today and then quickly forgotten.The cast includes a few actors I know from a few different tv series and to be fair, the quality of performances is acceptable if unremarkable.In short, a horror film that borrows elements of the TV series but has little, to nothing, in common with it.5/10."}, {"id": 739, "text": "This movie had it's moments, but still a terrible movie.

Michael Pena performance comes across like he's trying to do a Ricardo Montalban like impression. Lucy Hale acts like she's reading off a cue card.

Fantasy Island is a film that acts as a perfect crash course on how not to construct an enticing narrative. Wadlow's work behind the camera is fine if not uninspired, but every aspect of Fantasy Island is uninspired and lazily done in a manner that would lead you to believe the entire cast and crew came up with several first ideas and ran with them without taking a second pass to flesh them out or make them intriguing. From terrible characters to an uninteresting plot that continues to stack insipid elements one on top of the other, Fantasy Island is a wreck of a film that above all else, will make you groan with every vapid moment that passes. Fantasy Island opens with our main cast of contest winners departing their plane and stepping foot onto the lush and beautiful local known as Fantasy Island. Our winners are Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q), Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale), Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell), Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang), and J.D. Weaver (Ryan Hansen) who all have their own individual fantasies they wish to make a reality. While on the docks, they are all greeted by Julia (Parisa Fitz-Henley) a caretaker on the island, and Mr. Roarke (Michael Pe\u00f1a) the main man running the show who specifies that every guest must live out their fantasies to their natural conclusions. They lead the winning contestants into the hotel and explain to them the rules of the island while showing all of them to their rooms. For the first day, all of the winners get acquainted with one another while the sun is still up by striking conversation to figure out what everyone's fantasy is. Later on that night, everyone splits up and prepares for their fantasies to become realized; all except Brax and J.D. who while exploring the island under nightfall stumble upon a flashy mansion party. The two brothers instantly light up and join the raving festivities. The following day, Mr. Roarke shows the remaining island goers to their respective fantasies. Gwen has a desire to go back in time and accept the marriage proposal she refused so many years ago, Melanie wishes to get revenge on an old bully that tormented her during her high school years, Patrick dreams of enlisting in the army to honor his father who perished on the battlefield long ago. With every guest in their individual fantasy, not all things are as they seem. Strange occurrences and unsavory characters begin popping up everywhere leading to every fantasy linking in unthinkable ways as they all uncover the mystery hidden beneath Fantasy Island. After the title card of Fantasy Island passes, we are introduced to one of the most painfully bland casts of characters ever put to screen. Let us first begin with the insufferable duo of Brax and J.D. These two brothers are the absolute worst this film has to offer. Brax and J.D. are two different characters that ultimately share the same exact fantasy (with a few minor preferences) based on the fact that they are brothers, I guess? When looking at the character that is Brax, there is really nothing present of any substance. It is clear that the writers put up a board of random traits, threw some darts, and wherever those darts landed they said Hey! We'll give that to Brax!. Brax is a mess of a character that is designed to fill a number of trite roles but completely fails at selling any of those positions. Ryan Hansen as J.D. is assigned the role of playing the dumb jock dude-bro archetype that has been done a thousand times over. Ryan is given nothing more than some outdated dumb jokes that always fail to land. Next, we have Lucy Hale (no stranger to Blumhouse) as Melanie Cole who is the most juvenile character on the entire roster. Every time Hale parts her lips, she does so to spew one horrible line after the other fed to her by the THREE writers attached to the project. Everything Hale is given is either obnoxious or utterly humorless, and sometimes it is a combination of both. The final two major vacationers are Maggie Q as Gwen and Austin Stowell as Patrick. There really is nothing to say about these two characters other than they are just two simple slices of white bread, plain. Q is given the most emotionally resonant story but it sadly goes nowhere and winds up feeling empty. Stowell's story is easily the most intriguing of the two with a couple of twists and misdirects sprinkled all throughout that make his fantasy stand out amongst the rest. Their characters do not exactly commit anything egregious, but both actors fail to deliver any breakout performance. In general, every character in Fantasy Island is absolutely unbearable; everyone across the board is nothing more than dull. However, despite the cast not churning out any stellar performances, the cast is not solely to blame. The majority of my displeasure stems primarily from director (also co-writer) Jeff Wadlow, along with fellow writers Jillian Jacobs and Christopher Roach as these three had the opportunity to create complex and dynamic characters with interesting plots given the source. But, they failed in every respect imaginable that did not leave me laughing or feeling disappointed; I merely fantasized of what I could have done with the time I had just wasted. Fantasy Island had a marketing campaign that made it appear as though it would be a trippy vacation gone wrong thriller. Fantasy Island delivers only on the vacation gone wrong part. Tonally the film is a mess as it is forced to jump from fantasy to fantasy which are all extremely varied. You have a mansion rave, a marriage story, a jungle war, and a retribution tale; none of these fantasies have anything in common which can be viewed as a strength, but when there is no through-line that can competently connect these loose stories, the entire plot falls apart. Instead of taking a deep dive into interesting themes to explore within these diverse fantasies, the film cops out to utilize jump scares and lousy jokes with a healthy side of nonsense as it slowly devolves into an awfully generic action film that fails to accomplish even the bare minimum. Fantasy Island is a property that laid dormant for nearly three and a half decades (two decades if you count the 1998 television reboot) and it really is a shame because the concept behind the project is extremely unique. Yet, if we receive another dreadfully half-baked reboot in the likes of this film, maybe the Fantasy Island series should rest for another thirty years.Final Verdict: D-"}, {"id": 741, "text": "Blumhouse begins to be more an obstacle for the genre, than that wonder that was sold to us at the beginning (and I bought).But I will focus on Fantasy Island.

But I try to forget the plot and focus on other aspects. If you want to focus on the protagonists, you lose time, since you cannot feel anything, be it empathy or dislike for them, because there are so many stories that connect in such a coarse way that it almost seems like a joke in bad taste. Ok, I focus on the island ... Where is the juice that the damn island could give?

I actually felt sorry for the actors having to recite such woeful lines.It honestly reminds me of those short stories we had to write in primary school where we try to fit in as many plot twists as possible to make it interesting. All that was missing was the classic, then, I woke up at the very end of the film.So why five stars then? Despite there being one cast member that I've actually seen before, the terrible script and the messy plot, it kept me interested even if my facial expressions said otherwise. Would I recommend seeing it?

The moral of most of these stories is that the wishes never come out like the wisher had in mind. Perhaps they wanted a million dollars, but when they got the pile of money, it turned out to come right from a bank who reported it missing. Or maybe they wished to be a very powerful person, and they ended up becoming a drug lord. Wishes gone wrong have been subject to a lot of movies and television. One example was from the popular 70s/80s show Fantasy Island.Fantasy Island took new guests that would arrive to fulfill whatever fantasy they desired. The wishes were engineered by the island's keeper, Mr. Roarke, who told guests they had to see their fantasies through their natural conclusion. Though I haven't seen a lot of it, the show made for an eerie, Twilight Zone type feeling in which lessons would be learned, but all within this tropical paradise. There's even an underlying darkness that has potential to be further explored. It's too bad they got the wrong people to handle the movie adaptation of Fantasy Island.Several people have won a contest where the prize is a free trip to Fantasy Island. The winners include a businesswoman Gwen Olsen (played by Maggie Q), officer Patrick (played by Austin Stowell), stepbrothers J.D. (played by Ryan Hansen) and Brax (played by Jimmy O.

In Patrick's fantasy, he gets his chance to enlist in a combat war and serving with the troops. In J.D.'s and Brax's fantasy, they now have the mansion of their dreams and they party. In Gwen's fantasy, she gets a second chance to say yes in a marriage proposal she initially rejected. As they do, they all go wrong as each guest tries to make heads and tails of what's going on. This leads them to dive deeper into the island, figure out Mr. Roarke's intentions and see how everything works.It seems like that director Jeff Wadlow (Truth or Dare) wanted to take the show Fantasy Island and mix it with themes from Lost and Westworld, which isn't a bad idea, especially if done with the right kind of horror. In fact, for the first part, I'm even drawn into some of the ideas...with the keyword being some. The fantasies with the brothers and Melanie aren't that interesting and predictable. But the fantasies involving Patrick and Gwen do carry a lot of weight within their personas and how their connected to the island. It's too bad most of the movie really falls apart after forty-five minutes.I'm not sure why the script had prepared it in this manner, but in an attempt to connect all the guests, the plot get way too complicated and pretentious. They'll refer to a fire that had everyone involved, but when the movie reveals whose significant other died, you almost forgot that they were referenced to at all. Plus, many of the characters, including Mr. Roarke, are too unlikable to sympathize with. They all seem to have troubled pasts, but the movie is more focused on scaring you then trying to draw an emotional connection.Speaking of which, this movie barley qualifies as a horror. I'd count this as more of a fantasy-thriller, but even that feels very tame compared to other R rated materiel we've had recently.Casting wise, the movie is spotty with that. Players like Maggie Q, Austin Stonwell and Michael Rooker do fine, but everyone else is either over-the-top or giving the minimum for a performance. Unfortunately, as much as I like Michael Pe\u00f1a, he was miscast for Mr. Roarke, who doesn't come off charming or enchanting enough. They really needed a George Clooney or Antonio Banderas.I'll give this four Fantasy Island TV show dvds out of ten.

There was a 1 Season only revival of the series that aired 14 years later in 1998 and, that should have been the last of it. It was fun back then but not one of those programs that would transcend well with time.Poor direction, a very drab/boring script with a complete change of the storyline about half way through (probably when the director realised it was reaching total turkey trash status) and the cast playing their roles as though they were completely uncertain as to how to go forward with a very lacklustre piece of boring droll! With only a budget of $7M, in this day and age of 2020, you just know its going to be a worse than B-movie flop...and it was! Its the only time that I can remember ever agreeing with the critics about a film being a total bad washout of served up junk. It took just over $47M at the box office worldwide but, I am pretty certain that that was probably from people who remember watching the original series as kids. Its the only reason I watched it and crikey...I was desperate for it to finish as I was so freakin' BORED! I can't believe that Maggie Q (who I love as an actress) got involved with this flop.

It was a bit of a roller coaster ride for me , meaning that there were many scenes that in my view didn't deliver that point of being an amazing movie &amp; parts where I would lose a bit of interest. Being a low budget film may be part of the reason. For instance some of the acting was bad, while others were better. Maggie Q delivered good acting, Lucy Hale &amp; Michael Pena were ok, and for the small part that Parisa Fitz Henley had she delivered good realistic acting. In my honest opinion though the rest didn't. The story line and idea of the movie was pretty interesting and entertaining, but through out the movie some scenes just didn't make complete sense. And I don't really enjoy having to put way too much thought or bits of confusion of why things happened the way they did in movies I watch. It's good to keep the audience guessing but it needs to be done right. Some parts to me were very cliche. Especially towards the end. This movie also is marked to be a horror/Thriller, the thriller part I can somewhat get, however the horror not so much.

When you had an original (successful) series in the span of 7 seasons with the same title and the same premise some 40 years ago, writers and producers shouldn't bother and get themselves involved in producing a 2020 mock-up movie version with ridiculous screenplay, non-existent suspense, artificially dramatic music and forced acting.Would have been a much more successful, unpretentious movie with total strangers and a new cast. The existent (famous) cast did nothing, but having concerned looks and shedding tears.Messages of courage, hope and forgiveness could have been delivered by complete new actors who sought a name for themselves in the industry.

Either watch when you're able to not pull away and miss one detail or accept someone got paid too good to out out what potentially COULD HAVE BEEN a great movie.

That's exactly what leads into my issues with the Fantasy Island because the excitement felt forced. I was actually enjoying the first 35 minutes but everything went downhill. My biggest issue with Fantasy Island is that it relies way too much on exposition as if I didn't know what was happening. Sometimes the dialogue makes me feel like I'm watching a teen show from ABC Family with cringeworthy pop culture references. The characters in this are stereotypical including with every horror movie trope that it tries to accomplish. Every character has a fantasy which in my opinion was messy and should have stuck with one that related to one of the plot twists. Thats another issue, there are plot twists that make the story aggravating and one that related to the whole characters fantasy that I found interesting and would have made the movie better if it only had that one plot twist.

Wang as brothers J.D and Brax would be a disservice to a film that is destined to live a long life on the cult circuit, a venture for cinephiles to pick apart for the years to come as a fine example of movie making gone very very wrong.Final Say -Billed as a horror, Fantasy Island is anything but as the only horror to be found is in its terrible script and bizarre set-ups but this film like no other is highly enjoyable when watched through the eyes of an observer witnessing one of the strangest mainstream films to appear in the last few years.2 panic rooms out of 5"}, {"id": 751, "text": "I just got out of a surprisingly busy showing of Fantasy IslandThis is certainly not the Fantasy Island of my childhood.

I'm not sure what's more laughable, the attempt at developing the characters or the acting itself. The sense of this film having no direction at all is overwhelming, you never feel anything progress.

Please save your time and money and watch something else."}, {"id": 753, "text": "With a talented, thoroughly game cast and the backing of a production company with a history of success in the genre, Blumhouse's Fantasy Island fails to capitalise on these assets, telling its story with a loose grip instead of a firm fist.Even for all it embraces its own goofiness - ancient mystical McGuffins included - Fantasy Island offers little more than its own initial allure. The first act begins with a rich atmosphere of mystery amidst the beautiful Fiji scenery, but what begins as a promising character-driven exploration of wish fulfilment culminates in nothing more than a rote cautionary tale of being careful what you wish for. This is one instance of genre-bending failing to form a coherent whole, as the writers' overwrought ambition leaves them unable to commit to one tone, resulting in an uneven blend of teen comedy and PG-13 scares that eventually buckle under the weight of a ludicrously forced plot twist. Blumhouse are known for their mainstream but effective brand of horror, but that is uncharacteristically lacking here. The shame is that the premise offers such a refreshing alternative to the usual haunted house plot machinations that have driven some of their better fare.A curious misstep for Blumhouse, Fantasy Island plays similar to a lazy Netflix original, no better or no worse. As a time-wasting option for content on a streaming service, its mediocracy is perfectly adequate, but as a cinematic experience it doesn't come close to reaching the bar."}, {"id": 754, "text": "The stage curtains open ...Although I was never a big fan of the television show by the same name when I was a kid, I remember watching it from time to time and enjoying it. So, based on that and the trailer to this new film, I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. Despite all of the negative reviews for this movie, I felt that Fantasy Island, in short, delivers a fun, entertaining hour and 49 minutes.We are whisked away to a beautiful, tropical island setting where 5 individuals arrive by plane with the promise that they will be able to live out their own personal fantasy. They are greeted by their host, Mr. Roarke (Michael Pe\u00f1a), who informs them that the only rule is that they must follow their fantasy through to its natural conclusion. It all starts out innocent enough, but when things start to get a little too real, the guests of the mysterious island find themselves running for their lives. They don't know who or what they can trust, not even Mr. Roarke, since he obviously has a hidden agenda.Serving as a prequel to the television series, this has been toted as a supernatural horror - far from it! It plays out more as a supernatural thriller with aspects of escapism thrown in. Based on that, I think many of the reviewers were critical of Fantasy Island for its lack of scares, which is true. However, it had a fun story, and overall, the development of the characters were good and the end result satisfying. The acting was pretty bland here, in fact, Michael Pe\u00f1a, didn't even seem to care. But, we did get a nice turn from Maggie Q, who's character was really the only one with true depth in the film. The strength of the movie is it's plot and cinematography.I would recommend this film to anyone who isn't looking for perfection, and who isn't too critical. Each person's fantasy was interwoven and it was fun watching how it all came together at the end. The television series did last for 7 seasons, so there was draw and appeal, but even those weren't all that great. Perhaps it is the idea behind the movie that is the most appealing here. Even so. I enjoyed Fantasy Island and give it 7 stars out of 10."}, {"id": 755, "text": "Fantasy Island (3 out of 5 stars).Fantasy Island is a fair supernatural horror film that does lack scares and thrills but does have a decent concept. A concept where people can go to an island and they can have there fantasies fulfilled. Fantasies like redoing a choice during marriage proposal. Or being a hero in the military. Or torturing your bully. Or having a party with a bunch of models. The plot is about several strangers going to an island. After winning a selection of being picked. They meet Mr. Roark (Michael Pena) who is there host. He shows them the rules. And guides them to their fantasies. Except, there is more to these strangers and fantasies which they will soon discover.The plot was decent. I never saw the original series. I am not sure if it is close to the source material. Besides Mr. Roark is a host to a mysterious island where things come true. The concept was pretty neat that the film has several characters with a connection of some kind in the past. Which does have a twist. The film is fast paced moving with some nice decent thrills. But it does lack scares if it was trying for that.The cast ensemble is okay. Lucy Hale was okay playing a character that wants to get back at her bully. Maggie Q playing a character that wants a redo of her choices. Austin Stowell playing an ex officer wants to experience being a soldier. Jimmie O. Yang and Ryan Hansen playing step brothers who want to have a time of there life. Michael Rooker has a nice small role playing a character that's been on the island long enough. And Michael Pena does seem out of place with the character. But he was decent with the role.The movie did have a stupid direction in making characters making dumb choices or logic. One character running out of a burning building. Passes by a person stuck in a room which she yells she would get help. But once she was already out and no one helped. She runs back in. Would have been a lot faster if she tried helping opening the door to that person. There were plenty of other dumb logic and choices.

The connection is an interesting twist. Surprisingly, I'm going along with the movie at this point. Once the twist happens, the movie should get to the climatic action and wrap it up quickly.

The mystical and magical Black Water. In revealing this tidbit, give the audience more questions.Unfortunately, they also give the viewers a mess of a storyline. Within that story, they also injure the character of Mr Roarke. In the TV series, Mr Roarke was a cool and classy embodiment of the Island. They try to bring this to the film, then they try to make him human by introducing his wife. However, if he truly loved his missus as much as he claimed, would he compel her to his fantasy... forever? This makes him selfish and self-centred, and it doesn't work. This character needed mystery. Not everybody needs an origin story.Though, I am happy with Tattoo's introduction.The worst part of the story is the reveal over the first true fantasy. This would mean the character gets two fantasies. The second fantasy then becomes a sham; it's to confuse the viewers and the characters victims. The writers needed to flag this up for a rewrite. All it needed was a few structural changes in the story. It's an unforgivable error, especially with three writers.It's also one reason the film seems too long. It would play better with ten minutes removed. Wardlow could've shortened the overlong scenes. Both the cave and Tattoo &amp; JD segments had such scenes. The tension and excitement would've improved at these points. Sadly, there were a few moments I found myself yawning.However, the chief drawback for me was the opening sequence. This has such an amateurish quality to it, with bad angles and nasty shaky camera work. I immediately doubted my enjoyment for the rest of the movie. To start a film in this manner is poor.Luckily, though, this is the worst-case in the film. However, more innovativeness throughout would have strengthened the movie.The best thing Wardlow gives the viewers is the vivid technicolour Island. It adds an overly beautiful chocolate box elegance to the film. This is truly paradise. It's the perfect way to frame the Island.As for the acting, Michael Pena as Mr Roarke is a failure. Pena is a good actor. I believe the reason behind his failure is that of the writing and direction of the character. Ricardo Montalban created the perfect host in the TV Series. So you either keep that image or go completely in the opposite direction. Pena might have been able to handle the mysterious Montalban image. For this persona, though, I think I would go with Danny Trejo, Luis Guzman, Jimmy Smits, or David Zayas.The rest of the cast work well in their personalities. Though Michael Rooker as Damon is under-used. Damon needed a few more scenes to root him into the story fuller. Make him a tad more solid for the audience. He's just a throwaway character to drive the plot.This movie could've been everything everybody was expecting. All it needed was a little more attention and love from the writers and director. Even though there are two horror elements, the doctor and the torture chamber, this is not a horror film. At best, I'd call it a dark fantasy adventure. So if that genre floats your boat then sail across to Fantasy Island... you may enjoy your stay.It is an enjoyable film and I will watch it again, though not soon.

I don't really think so. Fantasy Island falls into the trend of making a superficial movie that has all the gleam to attract you with little sustenance to keep you nourished. It's a great opening horror movie for the younger generation to wet their feet, as it attempts to get some relatable issues on the table, add a small amount of character depth, and still give the thrill of the chase. Yet where the movie falters is in its ability to really tie this adventure together, managing to put a twist into the film, but not in the artful form to pull everything together.

I used to randomly watch some episodes from that show when it was on rerun (probably end 90s or early 2K's), that show which featured that Montalaban dude from Star Trek The Wrath of Khaaaaan!!!! &amp; also that midget french guy from James Bond The man with the Golden Gun. I never was looking for that show, it always was just on, so when i hadn't anything to do i watched some episodes.

How weird is it that Hollywood reboots some show most people remember, let alone know at all... An then as a Film???.Having watched the Film i can say i was surprised in positive and negative, who was this for?. I remembered reading it was supposed to be Rated R and then hastily recut to PG13, the question is why?. For PG13 it was too dark, most parents wont go in that with their children, and for Rated R its too soft (it only hints at more)... I guess adults will think its some sort of mindless kids/teen flick.Whatever they thought, i still liked it, it was fun and had some interesting ideas and shots...

The actors aren't memorable, Michael Pe\u00f1a was miscast, the score is okay which is surprising because Bear McCreary is amazing (Child's Play especially), and the writing was horrible.As mentioned, the characters are horribly written, they're not relatable, they're not real, it's old men writing dialogue for teenage or young adult characters. Several decisions actually made me facepalm and it's because they make horrible decisions that would never happen. The actors as I mentioned, weren't memorable and realistic, and I hated two characters in particular. Also we have some characters that are meant for comedic relief, that didn't work, and then we have characters that are the emotional core for the movie, and we go from drama and then the comedy walks into the room, presenting major tonal issues. The editing was also really bad, it always made weird decisions to either make it scary or to present comedy in horrible places. Also they have no idea what subtlety is, it's so obvious what was going to happen and then they present it as a huge reveal and you are underwhelmed.

While staying as guests on Fantasy Island, their deepest desire will play out in reality and they will get what they truly want. Initially everything seems to be blissful until one by one, the guests fantasies turn into nightmares until they are fighting to survive for their lives.This film is directed by Jeff Wardlow, who, along with Chris Roach and Jillian Jacobs, also does the writing on it. For anyone too young to know, this film is loosely inspired by a TV series by the same name which ran between 1977 and 1984 which starred Ricardo Montalban and Herv\u00e9 Villechaize. The TV series wasn't as dark as this film, but the plot is similar; guests turn up to have their fantasies fulfilled, but it's not always as it seems to be and often tests the strength of their character. To make things darker, inspiration was taken from Cabin in the Woods (2011) and the Westworld TV series (2016 - present). In this modern take on it, the Mr Sloan character played by Montalban is still present and played by Michael Pe\u00f1a. Villechaize's character of Tattoo in the original is also present here, but it's not made obvious till later in the film so I won't spoil it.There is a decent enough cast in the film, I've already mentioned Michael Pe\u00f1a who does well in the leading role. There is also Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Jimmy O. Yang, Ryan Hanse, and Michael Rooker (to name a few) also thrown into the mix. They all perform ok, even if some of their characters aren't necessarily written as deep and engaging - some in fact are written as stereotypical avatars of what could be seen as cool, or what could be seen as an ideal family unit. As far as the character writing is concerned, I had a bit of an issue with the Melanie character (Lucy Hale) - without spoiling anything too much, the audience follow her and see her panicking and fearing for her life. She can be seen talking to herself while she tries to escape. Heck, she even comes up with the escape plan. By the end of the film, without spoiling it, I was wondering if that wasn't a massive plot hole. There were some other instances of lazy writing which kind of annoyed me too (the source of the fantasies mainly), particularly with some of the other plot twists - but again, I'm not going to start listing them all. What I will say is, that while this isn't an Oscar worthy film, it is fun still.All in all I think I would recommend this as a decent enough film to pass the time. I think it's under rated and from what I've read on film websites, I think it's been panned unfairly by a demographic of audience that need things explained, or have to have super glitzy blockbusters. There are enough nod's to the original material, but this has been adapted well enough for a modern audience with good aesthetics and pacing. There a few instances of lazy writing which make certain things lack depth and appear a little predictable, but overall there is enough fun to keep you entertained. I can see a sequel to this being spawned, just maybe not with the same good casting due to the ratings this film is unfairly getting by keyboard warriors online.

Here we get a sense of how confused were the makers of the movie: goofy comedy, akin to Scooby Doo, with dark and ominous hints, like a horror story, a distinct video game feel like the Jumanji reboots, but also the promise of emotional catharsis and a deeper lesson at the end. This could go in a variety of directions, some of them really good. Unfortunately the film continues to remain confused until the very beginning, where a completely artificial and nonsensical twist pretty much destroys every premise of the story.Bottom line: the film was entertaining, the acting good, but the plot was a confused mess."}, {"id": 768, "text": "Though their low budget approach means that virtually every movie they make is guaranteed to be a commercial success, that doesn't protect Blumhouse from critical savaging and the 2020 reimagining of the 1970's series Fantasy Island as a horror-lite IP feels like the company taking a step away from their comfort zone and misfiring badly.Five contest winners, Gwen (Maggie Q), Melanie (Lucy Hale), Patrick (Austin Stowell) and brothers Brax (Jimmy O Yang) and JD (Ryan Hansen) arrive on a luxury island resort and are told by the operator Mr Roarke (Michael Pena) that their deepest desires will come true here. Though they are soon indulging in their fantasies each takes a dark turn and make them question whether what they thought the wanted, was their true wish.The trouble with Fantasy Island is all in the writing. The cast are fine, nobody is doing anything amazing, but at the same time, nobody lets the side down. The island looks welcoming and isolated in equal measure. The visual effects are OK, again nothing spectacular but nothing so strikingly awful it ruins the film. On a technical level, the film is solid if uninspired.However, the story sets up rules that the film doesn't then follow through on. It establishes that certain characters within the fantasies aren't real but created by the island. Why then does one notable participant in one of the fantasies need to be really drugged and kidnapped in order to appear on the island, why couldn't they be created too?It's later revealed in the film (I'll try and keep this as spoiler free as I can) that one of the characters has another agenda based on something that happened that each character was involved in. You'll likely piece all this together before the films reveal but it unravels the whole premise of the film. We (the audience) see this character, on their own, interact with things in a way that doesn't make sense, if they are behind it all. It means that this character has two wishes too, which we're told is forbidden. Also it means that this character found their way to the island before somehow, to start their true fantasy, then left and returned with the rest of the characters. It also would all unravel if, at any point on their flight across, the people had started to talk about where they lived.It's not the worst idea for a film, and I'd be OK with the premise used for another film - but this one unravels the more you think about it."}, {"id": 769, "text": "Fantasy Island has intrigued me from its trailer when it was screened few months ago in the cinemas.

Besides the often awful performances from Lucy Hale and Ryan Hansen, not to mention the nearly pointless inclusion of Michael Rooker, everyone else fails to memorable- although Maggie Q, Michael Pena, and Austin Stowell do try their best. The script is incredible messy, tedious, and very illogical in every sense of the word. It is full of twists that are not only unbelievable, but require almost no convincing at all, which doesn't only seem lazy, but shows that they required no effort or interest in making any sort of quality film. I had fun watching this film, for the most part. There are, for sure, plenty of annoying moments throughout. J.D. and Brax's characters as brothers in the film seem like a bad SNL parody every time they are on screen, and the clash of tones between that, an army story, a revenge Saw-like story, and some creepy family scenario just don't seem to mix in any sense of the word. Its sheer audacity for believing that somehow all these mixed concepts will work together though does make for a entertaining and very interesting movie experience, even if it is in a rather ironic fashion. In the end, Fantasy Island is an odd remake of a classic tv show that doesn't seem to work on any accounts besides being rather fun in a bad sort of way. It's not scary, funny, or any of the other genres it tries to mix throughout, but it's so uniquely bad in telling its own tale- that it does make for something you haven't seen before, which is something I suppose.

I don't know what is with writers and mysterious islands (I'm looking at you, Lost), but it makes them crazy: just because ANYTHING could happen, doesn't mean it needs to. The problem with Lost is that they were actively reacting to viewer reactions, trying extremely hard to produce episodes that didn't match predictions (allegedly keeping the audience guessing), but that just makes disjointed story lines that wildly diverge for no reason. This movie is basically that happening all in one go.The reason that the audience can draw lines is because a pattern is established by the written story, diverging breaks that pattern; it does not enhance it.This movie keeps some movie mystery clues in there, but there is a LOT of wild diverges and acting within acting here that I can't elaborate on without spoiling it (it's the one great thing about this movie, so I won't). There is a high quality way of writing that involves red herrings and proper misdirection, but this is not it. The end result looks the same, until you review what happened and realize that the first was based off the information given and the second is based off of arbitrary writing decisions.The mystery of the island itself interferes with the traditional mystery aspect as well. Even in ghost mysteries there are rules to follow. When there aren't any rules left, you can't predict and the story actually gets boring if not frustrating.I am not saying this movie is without worth, but I am going to say that I feel bad for Lucy Hale as she's definitely the best of this movie."}, {"id": 772, "text": "Another blumhouse AKA Bumhouse worst film since Truth or Dare, Dear lord how in earth Blumhouse is making tons of worst films ever I liked The Hunt that was Blumhouse I don't hate every single Blumhouse films. I thought this was worst film I have seen in 2020, I wish it could been released a lot later then you have Hunt released on sametime as this film at theater I have got this film for free on DVD sent by friend of mine so I decide to check out film because I had it for free so I saw it I ended up hating I like idea of film, cinematography looked nice didn't look so cheap I like the look of Island as well cast I like Lucy Hale she is hot since Pretty Dirty Little Liars series, I can't believe they chosen her rubbish trash films like this and Truth or Dare I am come on I know they can choose her better films not this crap I can't believe it why is she in dumpster films nowadays sadly, I liked Maggie Q one of my favorite Asian girls Naked Weapon, Die Hard 4, Nikita. Michael Rooker Iliked him as well, Michael Pena play's a worst character in film worst villain I hated his accent way how he speaks was soo Annoyed and he looked bored out his mind. Kim Coates play's killer in film witch I thought eh wasted. I hated rest of characters were pointless didn't care for them, cast I liked Kim Coates, Michael Rooker don't have too much hopes up because they get wasted and used but I liked Lucy Hale, Maggie Q in film as leads that what was watchable. the all film is massive time waster, boring, it's not scary the story can't keep things simple it changes to other and it tells you other story to other witch it annoyed me but I bet people who saw in this theater got pretty pissed off when they payed 2 something dollars for ticket to see this piece of crap. trailer when I first time seeing it it didn't do anything for me and I knew it was a bad film I can tell by using Ariana Grande - 7 rings witch is false advisement in trailer that's why it made go like this like a stupid film I wished this was an Netflix film or slaright to DVD VOD Digital not the Hunt because I understand why because COVID-19 with Hunt but who in earth thought releasing this film in theater would be a great film. the film Has potential it's watchable to know what heck is Fanasty Island but it has silly lines, stupid characters, it gets boring after would, time and time it gets weird and strange but in a very Lazy writing and it ruined plot so badly at twist ending the twisting of film doesn't know what it wants to be sadly this film had a sloppy plot writing film doesn'tfeel like Fantasy film felt like time travel film when you watch it you will get what I mean. director who made tons of rubbish films of all time I didn't mind Never Back Down then he started to do horror films witch he sucks doing like Truth or Dare if this advisement director from Truth or Dare witch movie that everyone craps on will crap on this that's why it has producer of Halloween and Get out if they ever mention anything about this director then no one will go see film so they are tricking people to go see this film. I swear just don't ever think about seeing this because all over for Lucy Hale because you will not like twist at end of film witch it makes you hate film a lot more I don't recommded this film at all avoid this if you hate Truth or Dare this is an same director who that made this junk he got jobs for making more films this is what he made? I wish this guy would never make a film ever again in thousands of years later. horrible missed cast as well I like cast them playing in film eh they can't even save film story follows Mr. Roarke not Mickey Rourke, Mr. Roarke (Michael Pena) with the stupid accent plus he can't play a series role in film he looks like a guy he can be in comedy films a lot more he has a stupid accent dumbass white suit he is completely bored out of his mind of this movie you have Melanie Cole (Lucy Hale), Gwen Olsen (Maggie Q), Patrick Sullivan (Austin Stowell), Brax Weaver (Jimmy O. Yang), J. D. Weaver (Ryan Hansen) came to Island for something they wish for anything like say I want a bunch 20 virgin girls then it happens if you made up character then it comes to life that's what it is and also it can bring you back time as well I started to like Melanie character she is being bullied at school also she was an bully she goes to torture room she tortures this girl she bullied Sloane Maddison (Portia Doubleday) is tied up on chair Melanie gets to torture her but then theirs doctor Torture who tortures people so Melanie somehow saves this chick when it gets to twist what was so point of saving her when you watch it you get what i mean, Maggie Q Gwen who wishes she needs an family but it comes true but end of day their not real at all. she wishes to ask something else like go back to time to save that guy at burning apartment building but she didn't and no one could saved him she feels bad for it I am like no one could saved him at all sadly so I don't understand why she feels like bad forthrew out rest of film was pointless dumb, it keep changes to other story to other witch it was SO annoying as hell I hated 2 brothers were annoying wasted cast like Michael Rooker &amp; Kim Coates were not much in film to honest this hell of time waster film boring as hell film people went see this witch I don't understand why? It got 7% on Rotten Tomatos witch I think it should get that rating of that film hated ending for some reason villain Michael Pena doesn't die or he is not that of bad person he is bad he gets people killed he will do it all over again and again. this director beware of him Jeff Wadlow who can't write, can't direct that's why his films are flopping and getting trashed in dumpster pile of crap that's why he doesn't have his name on Advisement of poster or on trailer so if people see From Director Jeff Wadlow Truth or Dare now made this film people will not go and see it but it has Producers from Halloween &amp; Get Out so that he can cover his name and film he is known for so that he can fool people to go see it and then they got fooled can't get their money back so that's why movie flopped so HARD that's why I don't trust this director I luv Lucy Hale but Jeff leave her alone let Lucy work with other directors please leave her alone stop getting her involved in this crap where films get's flopped like Truth or Dare and this among with other crap upcoming projects Jeff Wadlow should be given anymore jobs to do not anymore 1.10 don't waste your time or think about watching this crap if you hated Truth or Dare"}, {"id": 773, "text": "With the Endgame's success filmmakers are becoming victims of a fallacy. I suggest everyone to watch and analyze Infinity War and the whole saga to see that the risks Endgame took were earned while this movie joins the crowd of poor remake movies.Many interesting fears and fantasies are being explored. Directing is subpar, sets were great. Actors did a great job. However, jumping to the story, there are many things that causes a below average experience. The explanation of how and why comes in so late, out of nowhere by the way, that the story loses its engagement value. Having many characters is not wrong. Taking the risk of making them all strangers who live completely different realities only to have an only to find out moment is a calculated risk, but it just doesn't work. The main conflict gets crumpled in these distinct stories, making it more of an anthological short stories rather than a movie. Again, there's nothing wrong with that. But if I wanted to watch that when I tune into a movie, I would watch a series. Besides, that climax... Come on...If you like being interrupted by another story while listening to another story, or if you can handle that well, or tolerate it without being losing focus, go ahead. Otherwise, I don't want to be the one who recommended this. Not suitable for under 18."}, {"id": 774, "text": "For a book, movie, tv-series to work, they need a couple of elements: good plotrules (that are followed, from the start to the finish)a satisfying endingThis movie starts well and, then, it breaks the 3 rules from above. Why you ask? Because it is a B, if not C movie, they don't care.For me, it seemed like a combination of an island horror wanna-be, taking an idea from the first Harry Potter movie.This movie didn't even deserve its runtime, it could have been easily a 1h30min movie.If you watch it till the end, your qestions will be what?, huh?, how?, but...?."}, {"id": 775, "text": "I'm a little too young to have seen an episode of fantasy island but old enough to have been aware it was a thing. The idea actually seems pretty sound, guests come to the island to live out a personal fantasy, except it turns into a scary Monkey's Paw situation. If the movie just did that it might have worked. But no, they had to turn the concept on it's ear and subvert a premise that the audience isn't familiar enough with in the first place, turning a promising start into an incoherent mishmash of plot twists that don't make any sense. What happened to keep it simple stupid? Fantasy Island is a movie destined to go down as wasted potential and an example of how not to do a third act.Let's start with the positives. If this was a short TV series that featured a single story per episode, and didn't try to hammer the audience with ridiculous plot twists, it could be fun. The island is a beautiful location and a lot of the movie, before it decides to spend the last half hour in terrible underlit tunnels, looks pretty good. Ryan Hansen and Jimmy Yang are fun and their storyline gets off to a great start. Hansen and Charlotte McKinney as Chastity might be the movie's MVPs. The first half hour is engaging in an this doesn't seem so bad kind of way.But then the bad. First, this movie has too many plots. One of the stories should have been cut. They abandon their premises far too early, opting out of the fantasy element of Fantasy island less than half way in. The normally good actors are given very little to work with and any elements of supernatural thriller are abandoned in favor of fighting the Island itself. Lucy Pinder's story makes NO SENSE. Maggie Q's story is abandoned before it even begins. There's just the worst TV quality writing throughout, and then the film decides to spend half an hour in a crappy looking cave.I could go on but this is mostly just an incoherent mess and a waste of potential. These actors deserve better, hell, this LOCATION deserves better. This is a prime example of thinking a story needs to be stuffed to the gills with twists and back stories when none of that was needed. Watchable but misguided and fails at even basic storytelling. So thankful I didn't see this one in the theater as that would have been my own hell fantasy, new Blumhouse movie, only it's an insult to the audience's intelligence. What a twist!"}, {"id": 776, "text": "Pros - This was very true to the original Fantasy Island series from the 70s. So if the directors planned on doing that then yay they did. But I remember that show being terrible.Con - Then mix in some Baywatch for scantily clad females and guys in speedos and some made for TV acting and characters and you have the basics of it.Then tell the writers to go watch Scream and try and come up with a movie with more plot twists than one of those twisty roads in Switzerland and you basically have it.To be fair this movie started out pretty good despite ripping on the intelligence level of most Instagram Influencers and when it was all about the fantasies it was ok - but then in the second half everything started falling apart and it was twist after twist after twist.Then we get to the special effects - I've seen better on You Tube done by 23year olds in their moms basement.So yeah there you have it - if you want to take that special someone to the movies whereupon you will sit in the back row and ignore pretty much everything on screan then hell yeah go for it. But otherwise one to avoid for sure. Or is that what the island wants you to think?"}], "reviews_amount": 777}
