This movie isn't just for band kids, it encompasses a broad spectrum of life that is actually interesting to watch.

Not everyone will agree with me, but I think the story is well crafted, the characters are very likable, and the film maintains the audience's interest throughout. The main character is Devon Miles (Nick Cannon), a hotheaded young drummer who has received a full scholarship at Atlanta A &amp; T University to play snare drum in the very prestigious marching band. Devon proves to be the best drummer on the line (even though he secretly cannot read music), but his overly inflated ego becomes a liability for him, particularly in his numerous confrontations with drumline section leader Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts). Over the course of the season, Devon learns to curb his cocky attitude, and he and Sean become the best of friends as Sean helps him learn to read music.Highlights: At Devon's high school graduation, the percussion section in the concert band suddenly bursts with a funky rock beat (instigated by Devon) during the band's performance of I Believe I Can Fly. On the opening day of marching band training at Atlanta A &amp; T, we hear a couple of great renditions of When the Saints Go Marching In; a little later, the camera dollies backward across different sections of the band (whose leaders feel that THEIRS is the most important section in the band) before stopping on the drumline. Devon plays his audition piece flawlessly without looking down at the sheet music once; he then decides to add a little something of his own at the end. Bass drummer Jayson Flore (GQ) becomes furious when his roommate challenges him for his spot on the field and beats him; near the end of the season, the smartened-up Devon helps Jayson retrieve his spot. There is quite a bit of excitement in the air when the Atlanta A &amp; T Marching Band takes the field for the first time (I certainly remember how thrilling it was for ME in college marching out onto a football field for the first time in front of thousands of spectators); tension mounts as Devon unexpectedly duets Sean's drum solo and then takes over completely! The hip-hop stylings of the Morris Brown College Marching Band contrast Atlanta A &amp; T's Flight of the Bumblebee. And the final drumline battle between Morris Brown and A &amp; T at the B.E.T. Big Southern Classic is sheer cutthroat competition! Drumline is a wonderfully entertaining movie with flashy camera work for the numerous marching band performances. Watching the Atlanta A &amp; T band drilling, rehearsing, and shaping up over the course of the season is quite a joy, and for a musician like myself, this film is one that will never lose its appeal. Aside from the pivotal character of Devon Miles, one other character I particularly admire is Dr. James Lee (Orlando Jones), director of the A &amp; T Marching Band. Dr. Lee is a fine, straight-laced, hard-working director who deeply cares about the progress of his students and who continually strives for excellence. A majority of his instruction to the band has been part of my own instruction as a marching band student, particularly the concept that just ONE person's actions in the band can affect EVERYBODY."}, {"id": 31, "text": "Drumline tells of an Afro-Am high school grad and hotshot drummer who goes to college and learns it takes more than fast sticks to make the grade. Just okay as a light drama, this flick deserves high marks for making some positive points about the importance of rudiments and teamwork to success and for its tribute to, what is on most campuses considered un-cool, marching bands. What the film lacks in story it makes up for in marching band pageantry, music, and, most of all, percussion. A must see for anyone into marching bands and a should see for young people who dine on a steady diet of MTV and other entertainment junk food.

He was missing some teeth but had incredibly feathered hair. When I got home I smoked a bowl of my own dandruff and sat down to enjoy what was possibly best movie I had ever seen in my life. It tells the trail of how Nick Canon just wants to play drums no matter what the cost. My favorite scene was when Nick said to his teacher Just let me Eat ya!, to which his teacher naturally gives in and cums in 4 strokes. This film bends the rules, doesn't follow proto, and isn't afraid to melt your brain on fire. I give this movie 10/10 benadryl (which i also took before watching). Do yourself a favor, don't be stingy and try it out."}, {"id": 34, "text": "I noticed a common thread in many of the reviews for Drumline on IMDb. Many said the same thing that Drumline surprised them and it was a good thing. I'm not sure many people ever think about a marching band being a true test of music like bands, or dancing, or rock singing and certainly you don't really think of it as competitive and yet out comes Drumline and changes all of that with style and flare. I know nothing about marching bands or American Universities for that matter (yes I am Canadian) so I don't know how much truth there is to the film but it just happens to be very entertaining, fun, touching, and well delivered all around. It's not perfection or award winning or a feat of film making and yet it seems to be something that everyone just sits down and really enjoys. One of the keys to music films is of course the music. The more I like the music personally...the greater the film...consider Dirty Dancing, or Mama Mia, or Hairspray but the odd thing about Drumline is that the music is not typical or any type or brand. They do play modern music with their marching band but the story is what keeps the film afloat and truly entertains.Nick Cannon is cocky but brutally talented Devon Miles. Cannon holds the role very well. He comes across as smart, and well spoken and talented but his character is very entertaining and has quite an arc to his story throughout the film. Zoe Saldana is Devon's love interest in the film. Saldana is a talented actress, I've seen her perform very well but other than being a love interest she doesn't really get a whole lot to deal with in her character. The character is under developed unfortunately but Saldana and Cannon make a good couple with great chemistry between them. Orlando Jones is terrific and gives truly a stand out performance as Dr. Lee, the leader of the marching band. Jones gives a moving performance and really gives the film nearly all of it's heart and power.Director Charles Stone III is seemingly new to the directors chair for Hollywood films but he seems to hold his own making a spectacle of marching bands. The sheer concept seems ludicrous and yet marching bands and the entire competition never seemed so exciting and entertaining. I am actually surprised that the film makers didn't decide to milk this film for straight to DVD sequels although there is still time. So if you're looking for something light hearted with some intense competition and yet something completely different from other films in the same genre this one is almost certain to entertain you. A solid film. 8/10"}, {"id": 35, "text": "This film is an awesome combination of a great hard-work story and amazing music.

Aficianados can appreciate the tight flams, rolls, high sticking...but beware, the constant tug of war between the line versus showboating is nothing' but Hollywood drama because every experienced snare drummer knows nothing is sweeter than when ten snares sound like one because it only takes one weak link to muddy the sound.Did I pay attention to the rest of this movie?

Yes, like Dirty Dancing, the plot is a tired clich\u00e9, the dialogue pathetic, the directing embarrassing, the scene development/cuts jarring. But the moves, the moves. Omigod, when the bands take the field, it's gripping. As for those gorgeous girls and their gyrations, it's enough to send me to my chiropractor! I was half hoping that there was a real competition like the Southern Classic, living as I do just two hours from Atlanta, but alas, no such thing. As for watching drum and bugle corps in order to see real drumlines, sorry. They are military, wooden, and you'll forgive me, very whitebread--like this lady. Yes, DCI bands do more intricate footwork but those marimbas or glockenspiels whatever they are--icky plinkaplink. I'll buy this film, just like Dirty Dancing, but only for the music/moves sections."}, {"id": 41, "text": "If you are a person that actually can go to a movie and simply enjoy it for the fun and a new experience, then you will love Drumline.  It's a great movie that will enlighten many Americans as to the type of marching bands that have been the highlight of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) football games for decades.  Do not go to this movie and expect to see the standard kind of band that graces the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade every year.

Overcoming difficulties in relationships and life shows that we can mature beyond our shortcomings, and better our circumstances.Drumline had a plot with everything that a typical BLACK movie generally lacks.  What little violence that was in the movie actually served as a learning point that helped the characters mature and win at the end.

It's more than this, though.  It also captures some of the essence of the black university experience, although it's focus is understandably limited to those involved in marching bands.If you are ready for something other than the chocolate and vanilla too often encountered in today's American movies, don't miss Drumline."}, {"id": 46, "text": "This movie depicts the band of a Black University very well.

It would have been better about a true marching band that really works to put together a good show, not goes out and learns in a day or two how to get in the shape of a car or play as loud as possible with a bad sound.  The performance by Nick Cannon is abominable. A jar of jelly could have delivered a more riveting performance. Not only was Cannon a horrible actor, but he had the audacity to go on to Jay Leno and make fun of real marching bands. Real class act.

I'd probably have enjoyed some filmed performances of actual bands a whole lot more.

This young kid gets a full ride scholarship in music to a college. Nobody could tell he can't read music?!?!!!?!??! I'm sorry, but that sort of thing just trips my ohfergodsakegimmeabreak switch, and it ruins entire movies for me even if they were otherwise pretty good.Even getting accepted for training at a music school will require you to read a piece of music you will never have seen. The filmmakers, though, apparently want me to believe that he got a full scholarship to a music school without anybody checking that out? It might even be possible that such a scholarship could be given even with such a lack if the player is good enough, but it would certainly have been discovered prior to acceptance unless the school is being run by morons.There's even a sight reading audition where he apparently was given the music beforehand. WRONG!!!!! Sight reading means it is plopped in front of you, and you get maybe 30 seconds to look it over before you have to play it. There's even a good chance that it was written shortly before auditions. Sight reading is a test to find out how quickly one can absorb an unfamiliar piece of music. Any chance to prepare it defeats the purpose of the test. The only reason to do it the way this film does it is that the story writer wanted to have this undiscovered deficiency in the character. That's just plain awful writing.***So the plot if formulaic, predictable, and badly written. Maybe it's just me, but formulaic, predictable, badly written plots ruin my ability to enjoy the music.

Devon went to his father's job to disrespect him after his graduation. I know many students who disrespect their fathers for being crummy and don't invite them to their graduation. But after this scene,  there is a hole in the plot of the movie. Where were the boys coming from when they were on the bus in Atlanta? This was the scene where all the boys first met each other and said what instruments they played. This was the scene where the bus driver talks about how good Morris Brown's band was and disrespects Dr. Lee. Shouldn't they have known each other before the bus ride if they were coming from the same location?It was so funny seeing Orlando Jones play a serious role. Marching band directors are really perfectionists just like Dr. Lee portrays in the movie. Band practices are really torture and students are really really competitive! I played in the band for a while and I was in the orchestra for five years.But Devon getting a full band scholarship and not knowing how to read music is a made up lie! In my city,  you can't even make the 7th grade band squad without knowing how to read music. A college band student on a full band scholarship not knowing how to read music is like a college student on an academic scholarship not knowing how to read books! How can someone fool anyone like that for four years in high school?While I am on that subject,   when in was found out that Devin couldn't read music,  he should have been sent to the next plane home to NYC! When Devin was actually cut from the band,  he was still allowed to stay at the college. In real life,  he would have lost every dime of his scholarship, and he would have to clean out his room and sent on the next plane back home. No argument!The anger,  disrespect,  stuck up attitudes,   and competition were the only realistic things in this entire movie!This movie had such a predictable ending!

There were some nice visuals, especially the quick motion shots of, I believe, Morris Brown's band invading the field like ants, and the twirling of the cymbals overhead. Some of the music and dance sequences were nice, some better than others. But the plot was somewhat trite and predictable, and the dialogue was mundane. Plus, I think that Spike Lee's School Daze and the television show A Different World gave large audiences a glimpse of black college life, so its not a completely novel subject matter.

So the plot may have been predictable but the characters involved allowed you to get to know them and experience their trials and tribulations and get a first hand view of the steps involved to gaining one band one sound.

Its main gripe seems to be that the main character remains the same conceited grandstander that he was when the film started. That's absolutely not true. (spoilers) If it were, he wouldn't have had anything to do with the band after he was kicked out of it, but he did some soul-searching and HUMBLY offered his services to them in another capacity, without expecting to be reinstated in the drumline. He was respectful to his girlfriend (if a little boastful and, later, sulky); he was eventually respectful to everyone.

The plot required the people, but band is band, everyone's different. This has to be the best movie I've seen in the past year. People who don't know what goes on in bands wouldn't really appreciate this, so they shouldn't put down this movie. Overall, it was great and I plan on going to see it again and buying the video when it comes out and watching it religiously. Band is a sport no matter what anyone says.

This is a simple story for a simple film. Nothing really deep to understand. Boy gets band/girl, boy loses band/girl, boy gets band/girl(somewhat)again. Along the way the 'idea' of community; 1 band, 1 sound; working with others, sacrificing individualism to a point, is necessary for the overall success of the band/group.  The music/band/drumline and marching bands were really the main story here. It doesn't go in depth with the characters as say Rocky did, another simple story, but scratches enough of the surface for you to understand. The story also honed in on staying true to yourself and your ideals.  The Orlando Jones character exemplifies this in his dealing with Devon and his handling of the school president and band.This is a film well worth seeing. A simple story worth the watch."}, {"id": 76, "text": "Possible spoilers below Overall, Drumline is watchable.  It's decent...I saw this at 11 am the day it opened...just me and 3 other people in the big theatre.  That was nice. I was excited to see this movie, being a percussionist and a big marching drumline fan myself.  The drum parts of the movie were good, tho they weren't done as well as the trailer made you think.  A few things about the marching band stuff was silly.  They were too militaristic in their teaching, which is something I have never even seen in drum corps, let alone college marching band.  They don't scream at you and make you run up stairs with drums- well, I highly doubt they do!  It seems to me that these kids are in college, yet I see no one in class or no studying, or anything else that could be construed as college work.  They seem to have band practice 24/7!  There IS one 30 second scene with Devon in a class (even tho it IS a music class.)  Another thing that was totally fake was the fact that Devon had no idea how to read music, yet after a few lessons, he knows how to read music and very well, at that.  Simple music is tough to read for a beginner, so the complicated rudimentary stuff in marching drumline music would be impossible to read without atleast a few months of study!  There is some music I still can't read, and I have been a percussionist for over 10 years! I also didn't like how they made this a black movie.  What was the point of that?  I mean...I guess I have nothing against movies that have only black cast members (seems like all gang movies are all black casts, and movies like brown sugar and soul food, etc...)  I just don't like this whole concept in general.  It appeals to a very limited audience.  They HAD to make the character someone who had had famil problems (no father.)  Why can't they make these movies and get the message across without the silliness?  Why do the characters always have to have a tough childhood, grow up in the hood, or have a family member who abandoned them?  It's an old formula that has been way overdone.   As for characters- Devon is awful.  He is in NO way redeeming in his traits.  He is a jerk throughout the entire movie, and like others have said, there's really no realization by him, and a change.  He just seems to become a different person magically overnight.  I think Nick Cannon did an okay job here, but his character is just so bad and unlikeable, who knows...The other characters are okay, but you don't get a very good feel for who they are.  They seem to not be drawn out very well.  Orlando Jones is really great as the band director tho. Another con- why is trailers trick audiences into thinking a movie is totally different than it really is?  When Devon auditions in front of the three guys in the trailer, his added part is much more powerful, accompanied by background music...and right after he plays it, you hear i thought i'd add a little something- something on the end...  Then, you hear a voice that says ah, yea...that'll work. They make it look as tho the band director and drum majors welcome his style, yet in truth- they cut out the line where the director gets upset and asks if he didn't like the selected piece...then the 3 guys talk about how he's a good player but his attitude is terrible.  My point is- the trailer was made to trick the audience into thinking this was much more of a comedy than it really was.  Don't change the whole meaning of a scene to trick the audience!  That's wrong if you ask me...and the actual scene in the movie wasn't as good as the trailer, which can't be good!  There are a few other scenes in the trailer that are twisted to make the movie seem different... In the end, Drumline is mildy entertaining, especially to fans of marching band music, and in particular, the drumline...but, at the same time, it's ruined by a bad script and a very annoying jerk of a lead character. 5/10"}, {"id": 77, "text": "The drumming and musicianship in DRUMLINE was awesome, but the story was everything that ROCKY and every movie since has been.

More is expected from you in college, such as responsibility, maturity, and all of those other characteristics associated with growing up. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) wasn't displaying any of that.

The scene at the end where the two bands are trying to break the tie seemed to last forever. And I started to get a headache after hearing all that drumming. But I'm not criticizing this movie. It was watchable. The scene where the band gets to perform at the football game for the first time was excellent and it was pretty cool to see them form those designs as they played their instruments. This was a good poignant family movie. Thanks for reading my review."}, {"id": 110, "text": "Ernest was my favorite character in Drumline even though he had a smaller part. Jason Weaver is a great actor and he made the movie funny.   I can't wait to see him in the upcoming  movie, 'Ladykillers' with Tom Hanks.

Somewhat within the category of Bring It On. Nick Cannon is great and can play the drums like a pro, and Orlando Jones is awkwardly good, regarding the role.

I'd want to rewatch this film any day anytime anywhere, just Fantastic!!!!!!"}, {"id": 112, "text": "A guest of mine rented this movie recently. I hadnt really had a compelling desire to see it.  I have to say i enjoyed it more than i thought i would. There were some nice visuals, especially the quick motion shots of, I believe, Morris Brown's band invading the field like ants, and the twirling of the cymbals overhead. Some of the music and dance sequences were nice, some better than others. But the plot was somewhat trite and predictable, and the dialogue was mundane. Plus, I think that Spike Lee's School Daze and the television show A Different World gave previously unexposed large audiences a glimpse of black college life, so its not a completely novel subject matter, which would make up for the lack of originality in the plot. In other words, this movie was not an unpleasant experience but i wouldnt necessarily rush to see it again"}, {"id": 113, "text": "For years, in the movies, people in band were seen as immensely geeky (a little Lucas or American Pie anyone)  Then comes a movie like Drumline to set people straight.

From getting up at ungodly hours in the morning so you can go practice, to dealing with the jitters that come when halftime starts.

The lack of critical and popular appeal surprises me. It was playing at only one theater in my area and it never made it to many screens across the country, what a shame.

The reviews that I read on this site that criticize the movie seem to center around the lack of realism in the portrayal of marching bands, but never having been in a marching band, I enjoyed the artistic license of the drumline.

The point is, it is nice to see a well-done movie about something I'm so passionate about. I was in the Auburn U. Marching Band (Trumpet) from '89-'92. We patterned ourselves after DCI (Drum Corp International for those that don't know) as much as a college marching band could. Sure, there are points where I thought AU's Drumline was better, but that's not the point. It was a good representation of the passion and intensity that goes into good marching bands.

It leaves you wishing for something better. If you aren't a band member, some of this humor may be lost. After the movie, there was one memorable moment (Beat the drum! 'I am!'

Alas, I could not get over the unoriginal plot and paper-thin characters.There are some scenes of exceptionally good drumming and choreography that keep this from being an utter failure of a movie.

I'm glad that I did.(possible spoilers)The plot is a rather simplistic and formulaic but in this case it works straight across the board.  Devon is the talented high-school drummer who is recruited to play on the drumline of a one-time top college marching band in the south.  The director of the band, Dr. Lee (played in a very straight-forward manner by Orlando Jones) is under fire from the chancellor of the school to get the band back up to the number one spot.  Unfortunately Dr. Lee is more interested in teaching the students about music than about entertaining the judges in contests.All of this sets up the story for the hot-shot kid with the chip on his shoulder to face up to the challenges from the head of the drum-line as well as the conflict between Dr. Lee and Devon in their battle of old-school teaching versus new-school performing.Simplistic right?  Most definitely, but it was certainly entertaining. People might find the training sequences a little off-putting but I didn't. Having gone to a school in which the band was frequently ranked higher nationally than the football team and knowing many of the people in the band, I found much of what went on to be relatively true.  The band members live a life totally different from many at the school and are marched through an almost military style training camp.  Strange but true.The music is incredibly enticing.  The rhythmic beats rumble throughout and move all around the body making it hard for even the most jaded viewer to stay completely still during some of the scenes.  Especially the final battle.  The artistry and percussion was simple awesome to view and hear.I highly recommend this one."}, {"id": 131, "text": "This movie wuz tight from the trailer to the beginning of the film to the ending credits rolled around.

The competition to e the best band around is as fierce as portrayed, and the egos of some of the people who want to  be the best at their instrument, is also well portrayed. At Purdue, we had a perfectionist of a band leader (Al G. Wright) and one can see the ways in the movie that band directors try to get the band to be the best. And it is often true that the best of the best are not really nice human beings; witness insensitive Beethoven, egotistical Wagner, perfectionist Mozart. No one criticizes Mozart in Amadeus for being somewhat of a jerk, so it puzzles me that in this movie, the almost genius drum player is castigated for being somewhat or totally a jerk.

Anthony Brown: Here is a drama that drums a beat that we've all heard countless times. It regards perseverance and maintaining your goals. It stars Nick Cannon who wins a scholarship to attend a Southern university where he hopes to extend his ability to play the drums on a marching band drumline. His attitude comes into conflict with others, particularly the conductor. The plot is full of clich\u00e9s but director Charles Stone handles the material with skill with the marching and performing that are wondrous in itself. Unfortunately the fine cast is subdued in stereotypes. Cannon bringing out the rebellious nature of a gifted drummer but the problem is that everything has been laid out before. Orlando Jones is also playing predictable material as a conductor. He will yell at Cannon who will in turn rebel before they come to respect each other in that conclusion we've long arrived at before they have. Zoe Saldana is a disappointment as Cannon's love interest because that is about the height of her role. Other supporting roles are cardboard as well, and are about as festive as hearing those drums beat in your ears for hours. Theme regards expressing self through talents but unfortunately the screenwriter was expressing clich\u00e9s and stereotypes right down to the final drumline.

It also show cased the soulful sounds of African American college bands and the talented and beautiful dancers and majorettes.

Afterall, it was part of the official rules to be in the band. The way Devon ignored rules, his attitude toward Lee and his drumline leader, and the fact that he caused a fight with a rival school, any other person would have been kicked off the band without given a second thought. Also, the P.A. announcer at the stadium was very annoying. Could have done without those pointless arrogant lines. Lastly, the movie ended badly.

Throwing the two styles against each other would definitely liven things up a bit, and we'd get some sweet, heart-melting DCI brass power chords to go along with it.Otherwise, the movie is formulaic but with its heart in the right place. I was happy to miss the usual black clich\u00e9s in this film, in favor of seeing decent kids with sense, for once. I'm happy to see that Zoe Saldana has gone on to bigger and better things, since she was the stunningly beautiful standout of the film. Orlando Jones was also excellent... what happened to that guy?

But it became clear by the middle of the film that every character was going to remain strictly one-dimensional, and every interpersonal relationship was, too. Every major pair of characters has a single conflict or issue to work out, and they don't interact except on that level. Characters make telegraphed choices and react in a vacuum; there is little character development or nuance to the story. The circumstances that develop and consequences that result are quite implausible.

Every character was believable, had emotions that matched the scenes, and who could forget the outstanding performance of the bands.My favorite part was at the end when Atlanta A&amp;T got to show their stuff on the field and at the end when they were tied with those purple people how they totally wiped their faces in it.

A guy is a really good snare player but he can't read music? How does he know about rolls and flams and rudiments and stuff? I think it's too far-fetched that he can play the stuff by just hearing it. And then he somehow learns to read music at a college marching band level in just a few days? Unless he is God or something that's not likely. And they make band camp look like boot camp. I haven't heard of a college band that runs up and down the stairs carrying the drums on their heads. There's no point. What you really do is marching fundamentals and learn music and stuff. Oh, and by the way, most marching bands march to classical music that's spiced up with drumline beats and stuff, not modern music. Flight of the bumble bee may not sound cool, but I'm pretty sure it's damn hard to play on a trumpet! But I guess you would have to be a band nerd to appreciate that talent. And what's with the two bands tieing in a band competition? Yeah, right. Give me a break. And then they have the drumlines battle it out to see who wins? Please! It sounds like Hollywood crap to me!If you're going to make a movie about a drumline, make it about a REAL drumline. Not some drumline that dances in the middle of the field and can't play clean beats all the time. And don't make it some Hollywood story. It would be cool if it was like a true story.

It's time we see a black film that diverts from the usual material we've been viewing. I was pleased that the love interest girl wasn't unidentifiable in terms of race and features. So what she had fake hair, its easier to manage. And when the dancers had the afros, they were going back to their roots. Get a grip. Whats the big deal?  Its a shame we still on issues of color and ethnicity.  But how black people are represented in the film industry is important. I feel sistas who want to see more of a Nia Long or an Angie Bassett, Sanaa Lathan and the cutie from Lifetime's The Division. I felt the two leading ladies were realistic. Light-skinned, dark-skinned, they were black.  And damn was it nice to see a black film without a sex scene. Really any film for that matter. Doesn't the music industry exploit sex enough?I liked the fact we got to see the discipline , skill, and dedication it takes to achieve a good band. Orlando Jones' character couldn't have said it any better, love of music and being a unit.

People who debased Devon's character as a spoiled youth with a chip on his shoulder who didnt show a character change either never been around black young men like that or just don't have the patience to understand a troubled young man like that. Or just flat out prejudiced.Reason being I read a comment similar to this one on other black films that involved troubled young men like a Devon. Don't diss what you don't understand.There are so many Devon's like him everywhere its not even funny. That's how a spoiled jerk acts. And whats this that he never changedthrough out the film? He showed change by making amends with the band leader. And instead of beating each other down any further they worked together as a unit. That ain't change?  He showed true courage and loyalty  by rejecting the rival band leader's invitation to join when he was being pressured to divulge information.There are true sell outs who would have given in but he didn't.

For instance; Why did the girlfriend have to tell us why her parents didn't want to meet Devon?  Why wasn't that scene actually acted out?  That would have been a very tense and compelling part of developing their relationship.  A marginal scriptwriter knows that conflict and tension build drama .  I guess I answered my own question.

You couldn't have a movie that was 2 hours of nothing but band performances so you HAD to wrap a formulaic story around it. Boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy gets girl back and learns the value of teamwork in time for the big showdown is a formula that has worked for years -- and it works here!Another poster remarked that the band camp scenes were unrealistic because they were too militaristic ... he didn't believe that (among other things) that the students would be made to run around holding their drums and so forth. Well, believe it!I marched in one of these bands (Southern University in Louisiana) 20 years ago and back then, band camp was FAR MORE INTENSE than anything you see on the screen in this movie. YES, it is that competitive. YES, it is that grueling. YES, it is that disciplined. Black College marching band is serious business and this film gives you only a small sample of what it takes to make the band.The actual band performances are AWESOME and will definitely be an eye-opener to anyone who has never seen this type of thing before. More importantly, there is no sex, violence, drug use, and very little bad language (just the requisite d*mns and h@lls - nothing any more intense than prime-time television.) Equally important, the movie features strong male figures who resolve differences without resorting to pathological violence.One last point -- the movie grossed 13+ million dollars in its opening weekend. And this was against Star Trek (18.7 M) and the Jennifer Lopez (19 M) movie. Although it finished in third place, it was shown in about 1,000 fewer theaters than those two. It had (by far) the highest revenue per theater for the weekend!Do yourself a favor -- open your mind and see this movie -- you and your family will enjoy it!"}, {"id": 173, "text": "Former drumline member here.  Well damn, I guess I'll be the first drummer to say I liked the movie a lot.  I swear, half of these reviews I'm reading are annoying - people bashing it because it's an all black movie, people bashing it because the band has dancers instead of a color guard, people calling the drumming rudimentary because they played in a drumline that did better blah blah blah.What do you guys want, a documentary on marching band?  If I was to make a Hollywood movie about the drumline I would have done the same exact things with the drum sequences - put in a gang of stick tricks and showmanship that would translate well to the screen.  Nobody wants to watch flam taps for 90 minutes.That being said, the last drum battle is one of my favorite things to watch. I love when the bass drum cadence comes in, the basses march in a circle, the quads toss each other their sticks between bars, and the snares have an orgy of backsticking and other stick tricks on a level you rarely see performed in real life.  And the movie is only cliche as far as its kid w/ bad attitude needs to put his pride away plot goes.  I don't watch Nickelodeon so I haven't seen one of those types of movies since I was... hmmm since I was 5.  Far as what isn't cliche about it, there's a lot to like.  One of the best things is that it immerses itself in Afro-American culture w/out any cliches at all - just life as it is down south at an all-black university.  No guns, drugs, none of that stuff that you'd expect from a character who walks and talks like Nick Cannon's character does. I also liked the way they handled the white character in the band.  The dialogue where they ask him why he went to the all-black college.  His first reply is a wink at the audience, which would expect Hollywood to trivialize race relations like that.

For all those who do (and even those who don't), here's an energetic film that manages to entertain while eschewing content that could conceivably offend anyone (unless they find even the tiniest amount of innocuous, lightweight hip-hop too much to take).The thematic ground here - young hotshot learns to sacrifice for the good of the team; underdogs strive for triumph - has been covered countless times before, so DRUMLINE wisely boils the plot down to its barest elements, for the most part sidestepping the obligatory contrived obstacles and setbacks, and plays to its strength: the music.This is a story about college marching bands, focusing in particular on the members of the percussion section, and a good 50% - if not more - of the film concentrates on the lively and elaborate performances of the bands, which are complimented by equally lively cinematography and editing.No, it's not deep and, yes, it's old fashioned.  In, fact, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see Mickey and Judy in the roles of Devon and Laila (though probably with different names!).  I mean, these are the cleanest livin' kids you'll see in any recent picture!  But it's solid and it all works.  Oh, and don't be scared off by the idea of so much college marching band music.  Not being a football fan, my exposure to such things is limited to the Rose Parade, and I don't have a clue as to what state-of-the-art is for halftime entertainment these days, but, for what it's worth, this is the best college marching band stuff I've ever seen, and I wasn't bored for a minute."}, {"id": 175, "text": "The talented young smart-ass goes to college and learns there's more to life than being skillful or clever theme is an old one and it's been done better many times in the past. Robert Young learned about teamwork in Navy Blue and Gold. More recently Rob Lowe learned the lesson in Oxford Blues. The difference between Drumline and these and other older films on the same theme is that the lead characters evoked more sympathy. Nick Cannon's Devon Miles character is a self-centered, posturing, swaggering jackass who evokes immediate dislike and though you see him grow up a little in the course of the film, you never really learn to like or respect him.Drumline also suffers from an identity crisis of its own. You're never really sure what sort of story it wants to tell. Is is a coming of age story, a drama, a comedy, a romance? It tries to be all of these at once and never seals the deal on any of them.Drumline could have told a good story about a New York kid learning that there's more than one way to be black in this world. There are a couple of hints of that in Devon's relationship with Laila. Her comment to Devon: Southern sisters don't date...we have boyfriends, could have been an opening to a good subplot about differences in black culture between different parts of the US, but, as with so many other possible plots, the story touches it lightly, and then flits off to something else. An arrogant young freshman such as Devon would have had many lessons to learn while finding his way in this environment, but the film misses nearly every opportunity to show us the relationships between the characters in any depth, so the performances come off as predictable and mechanical.All the same, I've seen Drumline several times and enjoyed it for what it does very well. The presentation of the music and and the work that goes into running a big university marching band are very good. I could have done with more of both. The all-too-brief glimpses of life at a black southern university are well done. Again, I could have done with more of that as well.

The message of the movie, as I see it, is about that dedication and sacrifice in order to achieve greatness. Being a movie, of course there are unrealistic aspects woven into the story. For example, Devon should have not have been permitted to rejoin the band until he could read music. Because he did, it shot a big hole in one of the main underlying moral principles of the band. Still, we're talking about a movie. I experienced great emotional appeal watching the hard work of the team. Sure, if it was a complete story about a marching band, the movie would fall far short, but who would watch a 20-hour movie about a marching band? It certainly would have been more realistic to include the pranks and general fun that we all had to have in between all the hard work just to stay sane. The movie as presented may not be entertaining to anyone who has never worked hard toward a goal with a team, but for those who have, I'm sure they will see a piece of themselves and their experience in Drumline. It's easy to find criticism in virtually anything. If we accept the basic good message of Drumline and allow ourselves to be entertained by the music as presented, it will be a movie that will be watched and enjoyed repeatedly. For those who actually think there are race issues in the movie, pay more attention to the people in it and what they are trying to do with their work, and you won't see any color.

Every high school graduate, particularly one who has excelled at some endeavor be it extracurricular or academic, has a certain ego about themselves, and that ego has taken over their personna. Drumline captures the feeling of on youth as he must deal with the fact that his ego has now gotten in the way of being able to be part of something larger than himself. Even though he individually excels, he must understand humility, and learn how to be part of an organization. This is a life lesson that he learns while being part of this band and finally understands that his goals and the goals of the band are the same. This movie could be set in any environment, but the fact that it depicts an African-American youth coming from urban life I think heightens this theme, plus the fact that he is surrounded by other African-American students and professors lets him see that success in life is color blind, if one has the guts to go for it.I think this is one of the better character studies I've seen in a while, and the marching band and drumline setting make the movie that much more entertaining.

Nope.  There's nothing enjoyable about this movie.  The story was cliche, the characters were stock, the direction was amateur, the situation was ludicrous, and the music and marching were a joke.  I kind of thought they'd use, or at least model themselves after, real SWAC or MEAC bands and players, but the music sequences, which should have been equivalent to the game sequences in sports movies or the performance sequences in arts movies (e.g. Fame, Center Stage, Bring It On - kinda), were so low quality they were laughable.  20 High Schools in my state could have easily won that competition, and every drum corp except maybe the Troopers.  There was some special attention given to, can you believe it, the drum line, but ultimately, the sequences were boring and monotonous, and the cadences rudimentary and annoying.  Since the story was utterly predictable, let me rate the performances in this movie, using BOA scoring:Music Performance Individual:  12/20 - The closeups were the best part, and Devon was good enough to be in my college percussion section - on cymbals. Music Performance Ensemble: 5/20 - One band, one awful sound.  They couldn't even play a Bb scale in tune.  Seriously. Visual Performance Individual:  5/20 - Hey, Devon?  Tick, Tick, Tick... Visual Performance Ensemble:    3/20 - Straight lines are not that hard to maintain when you stand still for 5 minutes..  Maybe you guys should be introduced to a thing called Marching.  In a few years we'll move on to another thing called Drill Design. Music GE: 15/40 - Dr. Lee, let me introduce you to a thing called a Theme. There's nothing wrong with quick cheers and fanfares in the stands being based on hip-hop, but you may have noticed that the melodic lines of most contemporary hip-hop tunes are not exactly ever-changing.  In The Stone was cutting edge about 20 years ago, but now every high school band plays it. Visual GE:  4/20.  Atrocious dancing, flat footed marching, no concept to the shows at all.  While we're doing Band 101, there's a new concept called Color Guard you may want to look into.Total score:  44/100.

This is an enormous waste of two hours in my opinion. One part of the movie that especially comes to mind when  say a waste of two hours is a scene where the drumline section leader walks up to the drummers one at a time and plays on their drum with them walking forward. The drummers are supposed to follow. No one is is able to do it except, of course the star of the movie. But once he's is done playing the part with the section leader also playing on the star's drum, the band teacher walks up and says somethin to the effect of you do what i tell you to do, and you're an asshole.

It's, at heart, a marching band movie, something my friends and I have been looking forward to for years. It's often an overlooked part of high school and college, and I'm so glad the genre was kickstarted with this fantastic movie.I loved the training sequences. My band camp wasn't that intensive (our band was a little more laid-back), but we loved it just as much. And Dr. Lee? He reminded me so much of my old instructor, it was really sad. Orlando Jones turned in an incredible performance.I went to see this movie with a friend who was also a graduating member of the band last year. We both expected to like it, because of the band connection. We came away loving it. This movie is incredible--it made me nostalgic for my band.

Star Trek? Let me guess, the Fate of the Universe is at stake.  I expected  Drumline to be another African American comedy, a Mr. Holland's Ghetto. Instead, I was shown a whole new world, one I had no clue existed. I needed to check the Internet to discover that Atlanta A&amp;T, the school where the action takes place, is fiction, but the other schools whose bands march in the competition scenes are real.Ok, so the plot has been done so often we know it by heart.  Talented kid with a chip on his shoulder, unwilling to pay his dues, ticks off his drill sergeant, who then embarrasses him in front of the captain. Kid grows up a little, gets to lead the charge and wins the girl. There is even the package from home scene. Drumline doesn't completely follow the formula, however. The kid never cries and the sergeant doesn't fall on a live hand grenade to save his squad. Apparently they don't use hand grenades in band, though given the intensity of the competition, that's surprising.But the characters are engaging, the story works and the band performances are spectacular.  Marching band as a major American art form? I would have assumed that was the punch line of some joke before I saw Drumline.  Now it's undeniable.  A cleverer plot could have detracted from the real story, the talent, team work, energy and grit of these amazing marching bands.

Drumline just became one of them.I agree with a Commentor about Drumline being a good movie as far as feel good and entertaining.The movie does not touch on several aspects that were presented. Issue's that are brought up are skipped over, and there are too many montage's. One or two is usually exceptable. But this movie has four.  Can't be lazy!Also, the two main female character's are both high yellow. One, with not so many lines has a stomach (pregnant) that all of a sudden goes down, and the audience is left to make up a story line again.  And the other, Devon's girlfriend is a depictment of a black white girl. There are too many films that depict these roles as exceptable only if they are yellow and have European features and certain hair. There are millions and millions of beautiful, multi-talented brown and dark African American Actress's, inlcuding myself, who are very fit, attractive and tall. The only other time females are featured in the film is when dancing, in brief, during band playing segments.Overall, the movie did spark my interest throughout.  It is up there, at least this weekend, in the top three with 13.0m.  Congratulations!"}, {"id": 188, "text": "Drumline rocked.I was expecting something kind of exploitive, you know. Caricature characters (ala Varsity Blues) or just dumb with heart (the replacements), but instead I get something completely different. The characters were not stuff I've seen before. The lead has something special that will hopefully make something of him. Orlando Jones can act, he does more than the broad comedy you see. He created a very plausible and interesting band director, he doesn't go for the cliche Mr. Chips. he creates a singular teacher.The easy way out would be to have the Harlem kid strut around classes proclaiming how Black he is and how the serious musicians in the band just don't get it.  That doesn't happen here. Devon makes it clear from the start that 1. he hasn't been arrested. 2. has no kid 3. and he's ecstatic to be going to college to play drums. This movie doesn't get lost in blackness, it respects its characters enough to let them lead their lives and not live up to the caricature. Devon is classic big fish in little pond and he gets the rude awakening. And his mistakes and attitude are punished, I believe. He's forced to watch something he can't compete in fully. not that the film doesn't end predictably. Predictable matters not when the outcome is presented as inevitable. This film didn't choose to end this way, it had to end this way, every moment building on the last. But the real star of the movie is the band.  For band geeks like me, its great to hear the one band one sound adage being presented so earnestly. I expected this film to have issues combining the group aspects of band with the individual needs of a film. How do you root for a band as a whole, especially a group as large as a marching band. Well, you create subgroups, the band into the drumline, into the competition between the first and second snare drummers.When I saw Bring it On, a film that made this film possible and marketable my major critique was that the routines were visually interesting enough to support the investment that an hour of movie is asking for. I didn't see what all the fuss was about. In Drumline, the performances are shot (using high speed film, moving cameras and a dedicated editing style) in ways that not only thrill but are incredibly impressive. You understand why its such a big deal to these characters because you yourself are still breathing hard from the performance 10 minutes ago.I'd put this film inline with the previous films these past few years (soul food, barbershop, the wood, etc) as a new New Black Cinema. Different from the previous NBC (boyz in the hood, menace II society, etc etc) in that they are not about being black in america as much as they are about just being people, with their own histories dealing with the stuff that white folks have been dealing in movies for decades now.

But, I do have to say, this is the best (almost) all black musical since STORMY WEATHER ....and has a very funny sense of humour (pimply faced tubby burger fed white boy playing a huge tuba) and quite a good script. The lead character, Devon Miles is the usual ghetto jerk with the boring ego- attitude and the script has fun sorting him out. Like TO SIR WITH DRUMS this is an uplifting college musical without being a musical and shows that really we are still at Monogram Pictures college in 1943 with Mantan Moreland and Cab Calloway. Released here in Australia on ONE print, and invisible advertising, it grossed only $900 in its first week. A long way from the $56m gross in the USA, so I guess it will drum itself off screen this week. Pity, it's a lot of fun and the music is sensational. I will buy the CD soundtrack if it is available here and encourage us whiteys to go see it and get some jive or something.

While there was little to no back story, or that much of a plot that hadn't been done one hundred times before, I still found this film to be entertaining in a flashy way.Drumline is the story of a recent high school graduate who has received a scholarship to a southern university to play with their school marching band.  We see the military-esque drills and follow the band to their `championship moment'.  The pacing is good, the acting is decent (with a surprisingly understated performance by Orlando Jones) and the obvious star is the music and music talent, which saves the film from being a complete disaster.Unfortunately there was no back story to the characters, there are many plot holes, and conflicts seem to easily resolve themselves.  However, criticizing a film like Drumline for missing these elements is like criticizing Charlie's Angels for being superficial and flashy.  Drumline is clearly not supposed to be anything but about the music and the music program, just as Charlie's Angels fully intended to be exactly what it turned out to be.  If I were to criticize Drumline harshly for not being more `deep' I would have to do the same for many other films as well, something that is completely unnecessary.Watch Drumline if you are not looking to think, but instead to be entertained.  The showmanship and theatrics are incredible.  And while I'm not certain the regiment the band members went through is typical, it was certainly interesting to see that their recruitment and training programs were not unlike those of many sports teams.  A definite popcorn flick, Drumline is worth a shot.--Shelly"}, {"id": 192, "text": "Comedy Film and what more do you expect?It's FUN throughout the movie, and it follows the four steps of composition or development. Nick Cannon was a bit immature and selfish causing problems with a fellow bandmate. The movie clearly shows how the protagonist grows into a mature young adult and how he develops friendship, making the whole band united. Because the movie evolves based on specific steps of plot line, it is easy for audience to follow.Excellent Drumline Performance. Some of the movies with musical piece or performance turn out very boring and crude. However, the drum scene is incorporated with rivalry between two schools, strengthening intensity and tension.I personally think the movie is underrated because it is an old comedy movie AND showed a lot in the MTV, BET, or other entertainment TV channels. Film itself is good quality and worth watching a few many more times."}, {"id": 193, "text": "African American males often use Music as part of a wonderful learning style and this film is a hilarious and inspiring exposition of this fact. Nick Cannon is on the beat as Devon Miles, a musical prodigy with a gift for rhythm and percussion. Orlando Jones is a revelation as Dr. Lee, a different kind of black hero who uses his mind and his teaching skill to win adventures in learning rather than relying on guns and fists. He easily and naturally reflects the kind of personality that populates many urban environments working tirelessly to raise the tone of the entire community.I also enjoyed the conflict and tension between Cannon's Devon Miles and Leonard Roberts' (of 'Heroes' fame) Sean Taylor, head of the Drum Section at the Southern University Miles has won a scholarship to attend. Once again, as in the movie 'Accepted' the creative nonconformist butts heads with the system and its representatives and learns the value of humility in cultivating natural talent. Something like 'The Natural' with drums, but minus the lightning and the thunder if you discount the emotional fireworks between the lead characters themselves.That's it in a nutshell. The final 'Drum Off' between the two competing Universities at the end of the film captured more about the Black Aesthetic than anything I have seen in a long time. I thought it was a beautiful set piece and kudos to Director Charles Stone III and his Cinematographer Shane Hurlbut. The beautiful thing about this scene was that despite it sensationalistic aspects nobody was maimed or killed to accomplish the ultimate dramatic effect. You can feel the intense passion of the African American to rise above that factor of their legacy that involves oppression and exploitation, but here that angst is discharged creatively rather than destructively.Zoe Saldana (of 'Star Trek' fame) as Laila, the romantic interest of Devon, demonstrates through their relationship the steps our main character must take to socialize his tremendous talent for the greatest benefit to all. J. Anthony Brown makes a worthy adversary as Mr. Wade to Band Leader Dr. Lee before and during the BET Competitions for best University Band in America. But what I really liked was how the story revealed the African American Community seizing Learning and Music as an appropriate choice of weapons for attaining greater freedom with an in-your-face style and panache."}, {"id": 194, "text": "The urban culture depicted in Drumline is without a doubt the softened, fictionalized version built for a PG-13 film. Yet it doesn't need to be vulgar. It's a sweet, innocuous parable about a school's marching band, erecting a pleasantly unfamiliar atmosphere known to few American audiences, and too, showcasing actors of charm and set-pieces that almost touch the status of sublime.I've had a countless number of debates that centered around school and extra-curricular activities and my general disinterest in many of them. I could always admire the time, effort, and devotion many put into their favorite activities, whatever they may be, but my place is more behind a computer rather than out on a field or a track. I've continuously mentioned, however, how school bands, both at high school and college level, go mostly unrecognized due to the bigger entertainment that awaits after they finish. There's an enormous amount of practice, perfection, and devotion that go into making a band a success, and Drumline makes no attempt at shortchanging that.The film centers on the likable, yet troubled Devon Miles (Nick Cannon), who has just graduated from high school and looks to pursue an invaluable four years at Atlanta A&amp;T University. He wants to continue formulating his musicianship and excellence in the field of percussion, and has aspirations to make the awe-inspiring drumline the school has to offer. Yet because of his smarmy, often surly attitude, his position on the band is rather in limbo with Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones), who is annoyed by his ability to change not only moods but notes at random. Then there's the romance we love to watch unfold. This time, it's with Zoe Saldana, who plays Laila, who is often off-put by Devon's attitude, yet knows there is a good person wrestling with the worse one.This sort of inner-character-conflict can grow tedious at times, with Devon adopting a rather up-and-down personality to almost everything and often challenging those who do not look to challenge him. But Drumline doesn't capitalize off of this so much as it does several things that boost its story above the level of simple Saturday morning fare. For one, it is occupied with riveting, highly-detailed set-pieces that exfoliate the theatricalities beautifully, also allowing the set design and painstaking choreography to assume the forefront.Secondly, it pleasantly subtracts needless elements of the story that could've further stretched out the already lengthy film to a level channeling tedium. For example, the film is in a grand-ole position to have Devon kicked off the school band because of the potential possibility that he is not doing well in his classes (we only see him on the field practicing or performing and rarely with his head in a book or body in a desk). Thankfully, there's no contrivance that Devon is very skilled when behind a drum, but in a desk he's inept and anemic, and there's the reason he can not be on the band. When he is punished, he is for his own belligerence and disobedience to policy and disrespect of intimidating authority. He's a flawed character. Not a stupid one.And finally, writers Tina Gordon Chism and Shawn Schepps prevent the entire project from veering off into mawkish sentimentality, despite, yet again, being in a great position to do so. Throughout the film, there are hints that Devon's absent father only affected him in a small way, seeing as he was still kept fulfilled, nourished, and motivated by his peers and, most importantly, his mother. What Drumline doesn't need is a sob-story about a youth who is troubled because of the lack of a father figure he somehow managed to get by with for several years up until college begins. Again, Devon is a victim of his own actions. Not the fact that he lacks a father figure.Then there's the obligations I have as an aspiring film critic, or an amateur one, whatever may have you. That is to recognize that the film does rely on formula and familiarity to get by for a good portion of its runtime. But the reason we watch a story like this unfold and stick around for the two hour runtime is because we enjoy the setup, reside with the characters, sympathize, or even possibly empathize, with what they're going through. The film is an achievement worth cherishing, and if it may be labeled as contrived filmmaking, it should at least be worthy enough to take notes from.

The music is relatively easy to play, and the audience has a good time watching the dances and horn flashes.There are some flaws, however. But, you will never find a movie that is absolutely perfect. One of the obvious flaws is how long the band pauses between sets. In an actual marching band there is way more movement. On average you will stay in one spot for about eight counts.

Few have delivered academy performances, but nevertheless remain in the memories of those that love their art. They serve to expose the mainstream to a particular craft. Drumline's predictable story line is simply the standard framework that supports an underlying passion for the marching band's drumline. Sharing a love for music, rhythm, performing arts and athletics, I found this film quite entertaining. I chose to focus my appreciation to the film's passion for the beat. Marching band purists will undoubtably pull the details apart. Perhaps sitting down with the 5.1 sound cranked up enhanced the experience, but there is magic in seeing the final tie-breaker sequence unfold.

The script has some problems -- there are too many sub-plots, some character conflicts are predictable but not convincing -- but films of this genre are not typically blessed with great plots. So what?It's the characters that count and Devon has an approppriate and largely believable arc in the film, Laila (his girl) is sweet, believable, appealing and with a perfectly acceptable arc, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones) is only OK and the film would have been better had his character been a little better realized (in the script).

To my mind, this is neither the worst movie ever made, nor is it Casablanca. Instead, it is a highly predictable formula film in a setting-with-a-twist, that of the halftime bands in the HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) environment. The drumming is quite good, and will likely be an eye-opener to the majority of people who are not familiar with drum corps, HBCUs or band in general. It is not, however, the best-of-the-best that one could have hoped for (see Blast!, or the annual real-life competitions for those). The acting is solid, with Orlando Jones being a real standout. Newcomer Nick Canon exudes a fair bit of charm, and is appropriately cast.All in all, this film will be revered by past and present band-members, HBCU grads, percussion fans, and middle class urban audiences. Its point will be completely missed by blue-collar conservatives, inner-city gangstas, and people who have no idea of (nor interest in) HBCUs, drum corps and modern Black cinema. If you fall into the former category, by all means go and see it before it leaves the theaters (those drumlines are great on the big screen). If the latter, you should probably save your money.

A debut feature by almost all involved, this feels natural from the opening scene of a high school graduation in Harlem on to leading us through the fascinating and arcane boot-camp world of Southern Black college marching band competition. This is a movie about African-American young adults who go to college, who study in the library, have majors, work (OK, and play) hard, have and develop their skills, whose even absent parents are gainfully employed, and are proud to be selected for a national honor society.  And it's a heck of a lot of fun! Sports (and hackneyed sports movies) aren't the only way black kids can shine; as one character explains about these bands: Half-time IS the game. The band performances are as entertaining as the cheerleader demonstrations in Bring It On.  This does feel like a sports move; there is more than a hint of Slap Shot in the battle between the Old School approach to classic band routines vs. the new one that incorporates hip hop culture (as a fundraiser I was interested in the issue of alumni pressure and the dangling of donations.)  We got a hint in Time Machine that Orlando Jones has a lot more chops than his goofy clown persona but his band leader with principles pressured by his boss and his students is a nice take on Denzel Washington. The engaging lead, Nick Cannon, evidently used to have a comedy show on Nick and one of the band members has a last name of Poitier, but they were all new to me. Yeah it borders on predictable melodrama a la Mr. Holland's Opus, but it's so grounded in these unfamiliar specific situations that I was not a step ahead. My only qualm was the women's roles.  Even the Old School approach includes scantily clad dancers doing MTV-style salacious choreography as the cheerleaders.  While there's one prominent woman band member with corn rows who gives as good as she gets, the rest of the African-American women follow the Halle Berry model of black beauty with straight hair (who have to wear Afro wigs for the '70's tribute). Are even black producers now particularly looking to cast mixed race women like Berry who have what are perceived as more white features?

The big finale is a drumline competition at the center of the Georgia Dome.  But the judges are on the sideline, and how can they see what was going on?  It seemed to be more about how I could stick my drumstick in your face, then good drumming.  In fact, no foundation was ever laid for how good Cannon's character is supposed to be.  He sounded like all the others to me.  On the plus side, Orlando Jones is fantastic! He really carries the film in many spots and has presence the others lack.

As it is, my only experience watching a band like this came last year when I saw the Delaware State Marching Band perform.Anyway, onto the movie, which I mostly liked. As many reviewers have pointed out, it features an old fashioned story. Basically, you have a high school hotshot (Nick Cannon) who, while a talented drummer, is a poor team player. When he's recruited to the prestigious Atlanta A &amp; T Band, he believes it's his chance to show his stuff with a superior school. But his cocky nature conflicts with both the values of his section leader and his band teacher, and he will have to learn that it takes more than just talent to be a part of his school's drumline.It's an old-hat Hollywood story, but I will give it credit for getting one thing right about being in a college marching band. You HAVE to be a team player. You need to follow instructions and play your correct part. So I will give the movie credit for showing that.Another thing the movie doesn't skimp on is that college marching band is very tough. While our band did not have to run up and down stairs with our instruments held high or do tons of push-ups, we did have to practice for almost 12 hours a day every day in the August heat, and then practice every day for at least 90 minutes from the September heat to the November snows. You have to treat marching band like it's a living, and this film does a good job showing that too.The acting is fine on almost all counts. I especially enjoyed Orlando Jones as the band teacher; he reminded me of a couple of band teachers I've had in the past. And the marching band performances are zippy, filled with energy, and fun to watch. I guess my only reservation is that I can't think of many people I knew in marching band who had experiences that mirrored Nick's story, so it was hard for me to completely relate to this movie. Then again, marching band is something I take very personally, so it would have been hard for a marching band story to satisfy me anyway.Basically, this is good entertainment, with a couple of good examples of what it's like to be in a college marching band thrown in. Don't be fooled by the 5.2 rating; I have no idea why the rating is so low for this movie. It should be a 6-6.5 at minimum. Considering how few movies there are that even reference marching bands, it's a good thing this movie can at least do some justice for them."}, {"id": 205, "text": "This movie isn't terrible, it just isn't anything except what you would expect.The obvious, well-intentioned, idea that got this movie made was to presenting young black males as something other than gangbangers. I can't complain about the motivation, afterall, black males are ridiculously stereotyped by Hollywood and an attempt to correct this can't be faulted for the effort. So why then do I even make mention of this? My feeling is that the script and screenplay suffer because demographics and theme were paramount getting this movie made.The story is your typical, rebel versus society story. The hero, Devon, has amazing talent but suffers from an enormous ego. His hubris might have been turned into an excellent drama, but sadly the character is nothing much more than a cut-and-paste protagonist. He has flaws, namely his problems with authority, that are only briefly addressed (his father abandoned him), but this is not a serious drama so we only learn about Devon's problems from the outside.In order to make the band seem cool we find most of the training is like football-camp or basic training. Young musicians are belittled, degraded, physically over-worked.There is a completely unnecessary, token white guy.The most redeeming aspect, as many others have noted, is the excellent marching band sequences; from choreography to cinematography.In the end, only a fair movie."}, {"id": 206, "text": "I love Nick Cannon's plug for the R. After all he is R. Kelly's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and must thank him for I'm a gigolo and that essentially is his character. Cannon is decent and talented when he doesn't get overly gung-ho on his ghetto smarts. His main enemy screaming I'm tired of your fake ass ghetto whatever sums it up. It still worked. This movie is not forgettable because Cannon can draw a crowd.The beginning gives Cannon depth and the movie doesn't lose it. He's cocky, he's brilliant, he is real, and he's confident. The last trait drew me in for the first battle. I was audibly rooting for Cannon and embarrassingly caught myself. That is good acting. Not necessarily great, but a good character.Orlando Jones deserves his props for he is good. He's stern, with a dry, wry, and fitting sense of humor. He cares for music . . . and his job. There is a part you should see coming, but due to the fact you're not blunted with the situation it can surprise you. It becomes at an at peace moment and offers an honest, refreshing, and tidy wrap up to a very complex and difficult situation. Jones also fits in as a disciplinary character for Cannon helping ease this tension. And Cannon fittingly and naturally honors him (although certainly implied) later. Cannon's girl interest is attractive and learns from him and he learns from her. They balance each other out and look comfortable. Nick Cannon's character is actually a gentleman, whilst Zoe is surprisingly uptight (in character). The movie has predictability and sentimentality, but that's not the focus. The focus is determination, pride, and self-truth. Charles Stone III entertainingly gives you these ideals without dragging down a movie. Those that compare this to Remember the Titans aren't wrong, and that movie is great, but by far more over the head with its message. I say perk your eyes and chill out."}, {"id": 207, "text": "After seeing this movie, I am speechless. I have goosebumps all over my body -- especially after the final competition. Since I was a member of a very large high school band, I can appreciate this flick. If you have never been to a weekend high school football game and saw the band play, yes -- you may not like this movie. Well, I was part of everything regarding bands and sports -- high school and college. So if you have any appreciation for high school or college bands, you should watch this movie. There is also very good cinematography here too. Some of the scenes -- and especially the final Drumline scene were great. There is even a decent plot to this movie. I see the low rating of 5.3 and I'm a bit miffed about that; however, that might be because of the people who have no appreciation of real band and music material. I'm not knocking those people, but maybe they would rather watch Johnny Knoxsville in Jackass; than see this movie.This is a great movie. Please give this movie a chance. It's really worth the time. Every time I see that it is on, I drop everything, and tune in to see it all over again.This commentary is in tribute to Bernhardt Rydjeski, Director of the East Islip High School Marching Band. I don't think he's alive anymore, but I did keep in touch with him until about 5 years ago. Thanks Mr. Rydjeski for the greatest years of our lives -- I really mean that.=============================================================It is now February 28TH, 2005 and I just found out that my friend, Mr. Rydjeski died just last week. He had cancer and was buried in the St. James Cemetery on Long Island. I am so upset about this. I love this man. He was an inspiration to many of us in the East Islip High School band. There were several of us who went on to stardom, in particular, Ron Wikso, who played with Cher for many years. There was also Cathy Tricoli who had a hit single for her efforts. Mr. Rydjeski, we loved you as our band leader and we will miss you intensely. Thank you for all that you have given to us. You gave up many hours of your life so we could have a life of our own. You are a great person and we will never forget you. I truly hope that my prior band members see this message and respond back. We had the greatest times of our lives with you! Rydjeski, Canis, and Gifford. Go EI HIGH! Mr. Rydjeski, we will miss you."}, {"id": 208, "text": "I'm a member of an HBCU marching band in the South and this movie was not a good example of how a real Black college marching band program is run. For instance, no crab (freshman) would ever be caught talking to any old-head (upperclassman) members the way Devin was, let alone a section leader. Nor would a dance troop captain even think about giving a crab the time of day. A crab would be too scared to talk to anyone in the band besides their CB's and CS's (crab brothers &amp; sisters) at least for the first 2 months or so. Any fast-talking crabs would probably get some type of hazing (be it push-ups, running, or getting their @$$....never mind).The half time performances were not realistic and the acting was mediocre. This movie was horrible for anyone who knows anything about Black college bands in the South....Or maybe I'm just mad because the whole idea of the movie, along with some of the copied drum cadences came from MY BAND'S DRUM SQUAD and we weren't even in the movie. I was told that certain Southern Black bands weren't put in the movie because they would actually out-perform Atlatna A&amp;T (a fake college band made of high school band members from numerous bands)."}, {"id": 209, "text": "My younger sister is a drummer and was in marching band all through high school and college.  I always envied the fun she had, although marching in 100 degree heat in Arizona got old...especially when carrying a HEAVY drum around!  Anyway, I just HAD to see this movie, considering my background. There really isn't much of a storyline; nothing we haven't seen before.  The competition sequences were interesting.  What I found annoying was the Orlando Jones character insisting that Earth Wind &amp;Fire  (or Jackson 5) tunes were somehow inherently superior to today's hip hop music...oh, PUH-lease!  IT's POP music!!  If he wanted to be artistic, marching band isn't the place!! And to suggest that somehow 70s pop is superior to today's pop is just ridiculous. That had to be the absolute silliest aspect of the storyline.  Most marching bands play music that can be memorized, stuff that is energetic and will get the crowd in a good mood! I don't think marching band conductors worry too much about selling out by not playing artistic stuff out there on the football field!  But I guess that's not enough to sink the movie.  I give it about 5 1/2 out of 10 stars."}, {"id": 210, "text": "'Drumline' is 'Rocky' for band geeks. While it's admirable that Hollywood seems determined to give every single target group its own little fill-in-the-blank that could story, I wondered during the opening moments of this movie if it had the courage to be more than another knock-off. Nope, knock-off. Sadly, too much of the screenplay was photocopied from underdog flicks of the past and not enough effort went into digging for an original idea beyond being an over-long movie about band geeks.And it sold, to audiences and critics! I've read the reviews for this late-2002 low-budget success and they're glowing. Critics acknowledged that director Charles Stone was high-stepping his way down the path of least resistance, and they let him off the hook for it. Sure, the young cast (mostly black, all capable actors) do as much as they can with characters we've seen over and over and over. Nick Cannon is the Balboa of the group, a super-talented drummer with a 2x4 on his shoulder and a self-destructive ego. Maybe that makes him the Cruise of the movie actually... Kid can drum, no doubt about it. He's got a real knack for smackin' the skins.I know very little about southern U.S. colleges, so maybe the marching band really IS more popular than the football team at certain schools. That's pretty messed up. That's like buying a magazine for the advertisements. Anyway, our heroic Atlanta A&amp;T (the movie's concoction) battles their arch rivals (the real Morris Brown U) and gets to go 1 on 1 in the final reel. Stunning how that works out, huh? Along the way, Cannon makes a friend out of an enemy, falls in pseudo-love (with the lovely Zoe Saldana), and ruffles the feathers of his stern and old-fashioned bandmaster (Orlando Jones, playing against type). Nothing any of them do or say will surprise you. They have some nice moments, but I almost expected the crowd to start shouting ROCKY! ROCKY! during the band-off at the end of the movie.If you don't mind a re-tread experience (and you're p***ing on my advice to skip 'Drumline'), be sure to rent the widescreen DVD. The one genuine pleasure I had was admiring how skillfully the actual musical scenes were choreographed and shot. The fullscreen version I saw chops off the sides of many compositions that I assume are quite beautiful in the proper ratio. Seeing the movie in this crappy format was my own tough luck, but I don't want to invest another 2 hours in this ho-hum material just to discover what I was missing. I'll pop the Italian Stallion (or even 'Hoosiers') in the DVD player again if I want to see this story play out the right way.

We have a freshman who plays the drums and  is going to college on a band scholarship.  Of course, he has a bad attitude and thinks he's hot stuff and doesn't get along with a  leader in the band and the band's director. He gets in trouble a lot and finally gets kicked off the band. He meets with the band director of the rival school, only to find out he just wants the inside scoop of what the other band will play at the  big band contest. So, bad attitude drum player changes his tune and decides to write a great piece for his original band Atlanta A &amp; T to play.  The new piece is more of a hip hop style, which is what the school's president wanted by threatening the band director with pulling band funds.  So, it is the day of the big contest. And guess who wins?  Well, I won't tell you because it is easy to figure out. Just think about the title of the movie, Drumline.I can't say this movie was bad, it just isn't anything original. At least, there is a lot of music, but it is not my favorite kind. And every character is so stereo typical it's naushish.FINAL VERDICT:  If you play in a band, then I'm sure you will like this. However, I have never been in one, which is why I can't take this whole band contest too seriously. I would rather watch the game then a band and I really don't care what a band plays at half time."}, {"id": 212, "text": "I just finished watching this film and I did like it. I'm a drum major for a high school marching band, so maybe I set my hopes a little too high. It's not the greatest thing I've ever seen, but it is watchable. The drumming was fantastic! However, there are some things that irked me throughout the entire film. 1.) Devon's character is a brat through the entire film, and his character's lack of respect for his director and section leader really made me mad. My band director would never have stood for any such thing, and we are just a high school band. 2.) The slang started to get old. You trippin' yo? WHAT IS THAT?? If a group of adults, even band directors and moms and dads sat around watching this movie, they wouldn't have understood it.Even so, I am very happy that a film was made about band, and not another sports film. Don't get me wrong, I like films like Remember the Titans, or Rudy, but for once people need to realize that band isn't for whimps. It takes a lot of energy to make a marching band truly great, and we marchers know that sometimes we don't get the appreciation we deserve.Anyway, I have been using this coloumn for my own personal views on bands when I should be talking about Drumline. I guess in the end, this film is not just for us band dorks, it's for everyone. And even with the somewhat predictable plot, it has a good story and portrays good lessons about respecting others."}, {"id": 213, "text": "Wow, this has to be one of the worst movies I have seen!How hard is it to get some percussionists to do this movie? If there's a sequel, I'll be glad to do it! Just please try not to give a bunch of actors sticks and expect real percussionists to be pleased with the movie. There's parts where I can point out that they don't play on the drums, or fast forward the scenes to make it look like they are sticking fast. one band, many bad sounds should be there motto too. I don't think I heard too many parts that were clean and, being in a drumline, it's awful to hear. (It'd be like a baseball player watching a movie about a baseball team that drops balls, strikes out, and trips all the time). That one scene where the band was playing a scale I was literally cringing it sounded so awful (I believe it was some trumpet that was WAY out of tune). There's other things I could point out too but they've probably already been pointed out in previous reviews so I won't bother.And don't be fooled thinking that the fancy sticking they did during the cadences was amazing bc we do visuals like that or harder......and we're MARCHING. (see what the band was doing in the movie, that ain't marching) If anyone is interested in some REAL good drumlines check out the Cavialiers, Blue Knights, Cadets, Glassmen, or any other DCI drumline.

Only after a hearty recommendation from a close friend did I decide to see it, an issue I will surely address with her later...  I hate very few movies, but this one came pretty darn close.First of all, I found the acting atrocious, particularly in, well, the LEAD, Nick Cannon as Devon Mills, which made the whole film almost unbearable from the START.  I hated him and never cared if he learned anything (which it seemed he didn't).  I found myself often rooting for the opposing band, Morris Brown, and I thought the most admirable student throughout was the oh-so-nasty-but-eventually-nice-guy section leader Sean.  Frankly, I found the obvious and bland character of the token white guy offensive and he hardly stood out as anything but another brother.  The character of Laila, however, was intriguing and offered one of the only memorable acting jobs throughout.  Orlando Jones as Mr. Holland, I mean Dr. Lee was passable, but hardly memorable.Directorially, it was obvious they were spicing up otherwise OKAY arrangements with an interesting shot, but if I had to sit through one more musical/change of heart/Why Can't We Be Friends montage, I was seriously going to end it all right then and there.  As for the ending, gee, I really wondered what was going to happen at the end.  Sure, they threw me for a loop, having a TIE, but that only prolonged the misery.  I whole-heartedly wished the lead would drop his stick or get arrested or beat or SOMETHING to stir things up a little.  And another thing:  Every time the Color Guard (of sorts) came on, I swore someone had spliced clips from Bring It On into my copy.I love my memories of the good old days in the band, but I did NOT love this movie.  I'm really sorry I stayed up so late watching this.  I just kept hoping something interesting would happen.  All in all, I'm glad I work at an establishment that allows me to rent DVDs for free so that I don't have to live with the fact that I paid four dollars or more to see this movie, which I consider to be one of the worst I've seen all year.1.9/10 for some interesting musical arrangements and amusing, albeit sparse field formations."}, {"id": 215, "text": "I just watched the DVD of 'Drumline' and was pretty disappointed.  Iwas on the drumline in high school, and so I thought this flick wasright up my alley.  I didn't march show-style like the bands in themovie, but we always went to see the competitions when theycame into town and as a result I have seen some pretty amazingstuff go down on the field. I think the biggest problem with 'Drumline' lies squarely with thedirector.  The routines that he filmed, I felt, weren't worthy of thecompetitions they were supposedly a part of.  The best routine atthe end of the movie isn't really up to snuff compared to the realthing.  All of the routines are shot with that high shutter-angle trick(think 'Saving Private Ryan') to accent the sticks and the steps, buteven with that the performances just fall flat because of, if you canbelieve this, a lack of camera movement.  Usually movies like thisthat are geared for younger audiences are chop-chop-chop full ofrock 'n roll cinematography and edits, but oddly 'Drumline' is verystatic, to its own detriment.  The script and the acting aren't any better or worse than any othermovie like this.  I did have a bit of a problem with the relationshipbetween the band director and the dean, which seemed ratherphony.  If the dean wants funkier music, then he should just orderit be so.  Suddenly we're faced with a band director who spendsthe whole movie going on about order and sacrifice for the greatergood, and firmly establishing his belief in the chain of command,but has a problem with his own superior?  I didn't buy this for asecond.I really wanted this movie to be good, but it just wasn't.  This is byno means the worst movie you'll ever see, not even close.  It's justpassable when it could have been great given the subject matter. Very disappointing.

Considering the possibilities this subject matter offered it was a combination of bad direction, bad cinematography, and especially bad sound editing.  The scenes of marching and playing used a lot of close-ups and fast cutting so it was impossible to see what the band-members were doing. The biggest crime is that there are several montages where we see musicians playing but instead of hearing the drumline we hear songs from the cheezeball soundtrack--unforgivable!Of course the story was lame, but I was expecting that.For those seeking a realistic portrayal of college marching band experience, well I don't know about the school in this movie, but based on my experience, for one thing with ten or a dozen snares anyone with the attitude of this main character would have spent all of band camp doing cymbal laps--not to mention learning how to stand at attention.  Also in a marching band with hundreds of members I can't imagine the band director knowing any freshman personally--there are no stars or solos...who's going to hear you in a colliseum!!  And the freshmen in this film had it easy. No indication of spending an entire semester being hazed by every upperclassman in the band.

I've heard (and seen) MUCH tighter drum line performances (pick any top 10 DCI performance of any year).  Surely, with a production budget as big as they would have had for this film, they would have shot the intricate music scenes enough times where the snare lines would have actually sounded like one instrument, rather than a flurry of fuzz anytime the tempo increased.   Given that this is supposedly a degree-granting band, I'd be flunking those drum lines.

I was most impressedwith newcomer CANDACE CAREY (one-arm pushups) who tended to steal every scene she was in.  And big huzzahs toOrlando Jones and Nick Cannon.  But really, there is LOTS OFGOOD ACTING all through this movie, both good guys and badguys. The only thing drum corps have (or used to have years ago) overthese college bands is that the routines were 15 minutes long, not7, and the season is in the heat of summertime, not the fall.  Theyalways ended up with the whole corps abreast on the right goalline, where they played a closing fanfare.
