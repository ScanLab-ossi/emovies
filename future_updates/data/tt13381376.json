Somewhat reminded me of Tobe Hooper's 1978 horror classic THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE but little less gritty or raw and without any chainsaw or machete wielding maniacs.

Life in a staunch patriarchal household must have hardened them and turned these two young girls into docile individuals. We say this as that aspect of their personas surface when they bob without protest, sob under their breaths and take verbal thrashings from the male members of their respective families for wanting to hold on to their jobs or returning late from work. One day, the duo is sent to a long list of hamlets as census enumerators. On their way home, at a crucial junction, Neha reconfirms with Anuja if she still wants to go to that only house in a far-off village. The latter responds in positive. On reaching the somewhat deplorable building, the two exchange quick whispers about this family of four being 'very, very odd' and scoot. But a person's initial demons are hard to get over, and the bruises on childlike Prerna (Tina Bhatia) reopen old wounds. After much cajoling, Neha gives in to Anuja's demand: they are going back for a thorough inspection and rescue a heavily pregnant Prerna, who is also clearly combatting mental health issues. That family is sociopathy personified and the house, a house of terrors. Director Pushkar Mahabal's 'Welcome Home' has an air of eerie silence looming over his story (written by Ankita Narang), which is juxtaposed against the heinous and senseless crimes that are mercilessly carried out by the paanch saal ka maun vrat-ee patriarch Ghanshyam (Shashi Bhushan) with his kook of a cook, Bhola (Boloram Das). Ironically, Ghanshyam is a loyal devotee of the Almighty and is often seen engrossed in chanting deep prayers in the hallway while in a room adjacent to the temple are two innocent, helpless humans begging for their lives - such is the intensity of his narcissistic God complex.Mahabal has portrayed Bhola as the creepiest amongst all and embodies the spirit of a nymphomaniac - asking from time to time, yeh ladkiyan jhoot bolti hain, main jaun unke paas, bhaiya? Main jaun? Main jaun?... He is a sex-deprived and extremely deranged character; writer Narang has shown no leniency and gone to extreme lengths to develop this role and unleash the megalomaniac tendencies in him. Bholoram Das internalises the characteristic traits of a man you wouldn't want to be in the same room with for a split second. Shashi Bhushan works in tandem with Das and together, they give the viewers an insight into the twisted world of pseudo machismo and toxic masculinity."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Acting, writing, music was brilliant, but must stop making such kind of out of box violent movies"}, {"id": 36, "text": "Amazing and fabulous screenplay and direction with mind-blowing performances by everyone"}, {"id": 37, "text": "After a long time have seen a great thriller coming out of india..!!

The camerawork, screenplay and editing is top notch that eventually makes this a fine piece of cinema. There are no supernatural elements, monsters or jump scares in this one- just the story and its narration are enough to unsettle most. Though some viewers may find the gore and violence a bit disturbing. Overall, the performances are excellent (especially the antagonists- Old Mother, Ghanshyam and Bhola) but there are a few scenes where the two protagonists end up hamming while portraying pain and fear. The only other negative one found was the liberal and exaggerated use of the background score to incite fear- that could have been toned down and the film would have still been as scary as it was intended to.

When the movie starts, we are introduced to a simple, small town woman, Anuja who is about to be married to a toxic man. She is brought up by a misogynist father and she can't see men in any different way. For her, it is how it is, she doesn't control her life, it is left to the men in her life. When she meets another woman at her place of work who seems different from her at the surface, she immediately seeks solace in her friendship. But only later does she find out, even this friend has a misogynist brother who controls her life! There's one scene where the two discuss their mothers. That's solid screen writing. This movie is about Anuja's character arc more than anything else. It's also about how she rids her life of misogyny.We are never told the back story of the psycho family, but as the mystery unveils, the chilling details evolve. This is not the regular run of the mill blood fest, but is an intricately constructed film where deep social issues are explored. Even the family is not shown like cinematic nut jobs. They have their own moral codes and ethics in their own twisted way.This is by far one of the best Indian movies made in this genre, where everything comes together. Solid acting, great script ll, wonderful camera work and editing. Special mention to the music director, Meghdeep Bose for using a mix of silence and nerve wrecking music to communicate the mood.I will not recommend this film to anyone who can't stand gore, violence and adult content.

Once in a while a movie comes along which either makes u laugh or cry or forces you to open your mind and realise certain facts of life. This movie definitely makes you do the latter. The scariest kind of horror is not a malicious spirit or angry soul or demon lurking to kill or possess you... It is the sheer depravity and cruelty that are possible by some human beings. Welcome home brings that kind of worst horror from the dark depths to the fore. The casting is so apt that you refuse to feel that these are actors and not real life characters themselves. The IG pages of the actors will leave you speechless at how well they have portrayed the role. Also checked up online about the director, Pushkar Mahabal. This is apparently the first movie directed by him and to my surprise he was once praised by RGV himself as a talent to watch out for ... Its easy to understand why. He has a deft &amp; uncommercial touch ( it's a compliment ) and the movie benefits from having a stark and grim atmosphere all around. The writer Ankita Narang has given birth to this genius of a script, which while highlighting the social travesties that still exist across the length and breadth of India, also has you rooting for the underdog and has you cheering ( with some expletives thrown in) whenever the underdogs strike back. She is a talent to watch out for. Someone who can write scripts like that in India and has the courage to not water it down for a more universal audience should be applauded.If there were awards for OTT movies, then Boloram Das has already won the villain of the year, Ankita Narang has won best script and Welcome Home is the movie of the year. It won't make you laugh... It's not a breezy popcorn movie.... But, it will get under your skin and show you the brutal travesties that still occur in our country.Must watch !!!"}, {"id": 82, "text": "Slasher films are a rarity in India. And it's only in India that you'll see a giant warning on a slasher film's poster saying the film isn't for the faint-hearted. That warning holds true to those audiences who don't know the existence of the genre in international cinema. Welcome Home is the closest it can get to the Indianized version of Tobe Hooper's cult classic - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) - minus the latter's all-out brutality. Two government school teachers doing census duty end up at an isolated house where a family with sinister secrets resides.Now, if I were to analyze Welcome Home as a first-time viewer exposed to slashers, I'd now be praising it to the skies for its grittiness, gore, and strong performances. The Pushkar Mahabal directorial (written by Ankita Narang) also adds patriarchal layers to the lives of the lead characters Anuja (Kashmira Irani), Neha (Swarda Thigle), and Prerna (Tina Bhatia), making a strong statement against it. While two of the women are forcibly held against their will, the third has lost her sense of free will. There are at least a couple of bad decisions made by the leads that they obviously regret later.However, the violence isn't held back one bit. It's showcased in all its menacing glory, and blood is shed more times than you can count. While the leads are effective, I found Akshita Arora's (who plays the matriarch of the house, Leela) presence (and stares) the most disconcerting. Boloram Das (who plays the lecherous house-help Bhola) is also solid. What can also be regarded as a positive is how the women (especially Anuja) choose to fight back against this oppressive family of murderers, instead of waiting to be rescued. It's a pretty satisfying finale that Welcome Home has to offer, be it in terms of creating a gory mess as well as (some level of) closure for its leads.The first 30-40 minutes of the film (especially, the 'initial visit' scene) is when the unnerving terror feels palpable. The house looks creepy even during the day, with the musical score making it a little too apparent. In that stretch, there's very little dialogue, but that the family has some twisted secrets is evident. It's when the duo visits the house the second time around that things get a little predictable. It's all thrilling and enjoyable for slasher fanatics regardless, and I'm glad such a film has come out of the Hindi film industry. However, I won't rate it more than 3 stars since I'm not new to slashers, and there's still a long way to go till we get a true cult classic in the genre."}, {"id": 83, "text": "Due to the pandemic situation, we are witnessing very different and unusual content this year on OTT. Welcome Home is one of the hard-hitting cinema and probably the most disturbing psychological thriller ever to come out in Bollywood. As the makers have clearly called it - This movie is not for the faint-hearted, it will actually haunt even once the film gets over.Welcome Home tells the story of two government home teachers, Anuja (Kashmira Irani) and her colleague Neha (Swarda Thigale), who have been given a task to do the census survey of specific areas in the city of Nagpur. While ticking off the houses from their list, Anuja and Neha comes across a lonely house which is situated at a deserted place away from the city.Anuja and Neha reaches the house and knocks on the door, a pregnant lady, Prerna (Tina Bhatia), welcomes them. While taking the survey, they find the suspicious activity in the house which has a weird looking old lady (Akshita Arora) her son (Shashi Bhushan) who is on silence fasting and their ever-smiling and wicked cook (Boloram Das). Curious and yet diligent, on their second visit to the strange house to know more about Prerna, Anuja and Neha gets stuck in the heavy rain and are forced to spend a night in the house. During their stay, unusual events begins to occur which reveals mystery behind the house.Directed by Pushkar Mahabal who has also done a fabulous job in editing as well, Welcome Home is certainly the most disturbing slow-burn pyschological film to come out in Bollywood which is based on true events (Bihar Shelter Home case I guess). The film builds on you as it progresses with excellent writing, haunting background score and brilliant camera work where each and every scene has been executed appropriately and accurately. Screenplay is fantastic, though it becomes little sluggish towards the end.Hats off to the director for making it bold and blunt. Welcome Home is highlighted with brilliant performances starting with Kashmira Irani and Swarda Thigale stealing the limelight with their honest work. Shashi Bhushan and Bolaram Das will haunt you with their brilliant acting even after the movie while Akshita Arora and Tina Bhatia were outstanding with their expression even though they had less dialogue.On the whole, Welcome Home is not easy watch but it will expose the harsh reality of child sexual abuse and it will definitely make you angry.

While exposing regressive thoughts a section of our society shamefully bears for Women; it blatantly exhibits real life heinous acts through a horrific tale. Which makes you feel distressed &amp; shaken to the core!Without any applicable bounds, it showcases Exploitation, Abuse of Women; which is still to this day; largely prominent in discrete parts of our country as well as in this patriarchal society. An engaging storyline intuitively becomes too realistic at times. Highly unpredictable nature at play; the plot bit by bit sucks you right in.Coupled with a tenacious soundscore that helped creating a requisite ambience. Albeit the same composition, in few instances became monotonous and boisterous to listen to. Cinematography is fine if you could ignore the indisputably cramped resources!All of the actors being dauntless &amp; credible; Performances were simply astonishing. Everyone deserves hefty praises of their own. Characterization, especially on those with short tenured appearances; sticks out like a sore thumb.It's a slow burner, as you guys might have already guessed. That being said, if you love unconventional horrors; you will admire its grounded yet impactful narrative. Just beware of those few sequences where it breaks all its shackles, and starts to dwell in a discomforting manner."}, {"id": 85, "text": "Though I am not a big fan of slasher flicks, Welcome Home really impressed me in many ways. There may be hundreds of such movies in Hollywood like this but only a handful movies are like this back home, and Welcome Home definitely is among the top 5 in that genre. The disclaimer at the teaser made me giggle, thinking that it is a marketing ploy, but this movie definitely needs one as it is definitely not for the light/Kind hearted. Lots of things add up since it's based on true events.Screenplay and pacing was great to get us into the groove of the storyline. The director's ace storytelling leaves us on the edge of the seat for a good part of the first hour. Production design, makeup and costumes was excellent. Music and editing though generally good were a little patchy in a few places. Cinematography was very decent. Acting levels were surprisingly good by the two female leads throughout the movie. One has to really appreciate the producers to put money on such a subject, in a country like India.Overall, a gritty and eerie movie throughout, which springs up surprises time and again. Yes, it is riddled with some logical loopholes, but which slasher movie isn't? Need thrills and frills watch this movie with volume turned up in a dimly lit room late night, the sound alone will do a lot of things in our heads. Not suitable for family viewing or for young viewers. For maximum effect better watch it late night with full sound. 6.8/10 stars."}, {"id": 86, "text": "Seldom do you come across a Bollywood splatter film that delivers an astonishingly gruesome and thrilling plot with such grace. Mind you, the this film is not your average run off the mill bollywood thriller flick.The plot centres around Anuja (Kashmira Irani) and Neha (Swarda Thigle) who are teachers at a government school in Nagpur. The two are appointed by government authorities to conduct a census survey of nearby villages. As they are about to wrap up their assignment, they land up on the final house on their list - an outlandish mansion situated in the middle of nowhere. With no neigbours for miles, the house is completely cut off from human civilisation. In spite of their misgivings, Anuja and Sharda decide to enter the outlandish mansion, only to realize that things are not as they seem as.Debutant director Pushkar Mahal has done an outstanding job and never for once do you get the impression that this is his first feature film. Every character has a complex backstory which we learn as the film progresses. The entire cast delivers an exceptional performance but the lead actresses Kashmira Irani and Swarda Thigle merit a special mention due to their riveting performance. The background score is spot on and magnifies the bloodcurling intesity of the film. Overall, this is a thrilling entertainer and definitely deserves more recognition. Watch this if you are looking for a fresh breath of air."}, {"id": 87, "text": "First Thing First After So Many Days I Watched A Good Horror Mystery Thriller The Tag Line Defines It All This Is Not For Faint Hearted This Film Doesn't Have Any Spirits Or Ghosts But This Has Something Which Is More Than That The Story Is Well Written And Directed The Characters Are Enough To Give You Chills And Cherry On The Cake Is Its BGM Which Keeps You Hook Even In The Normal Secnes I Can't Reveal Anything About Story And The Characters As It Will Be A Spoiler And Also Request You To Not Enquire About Them Just Vist This Home And Hope You Return Safe \ud83d\ude42 This Is Not A Flawless Thriller The Lightings Could Have Been More Accurate As In Some Places Its Too Dark and In Some Places Its Uneven Well This Should Not Stop You To Watch This Coz If Content Is Art Then Sony Liv Is Picasso Of It And In The End I Would Say If You Want To Make Some Films On Feminism And Films About Patriarchy Then Make Something Like ThisWell That's ItThanks"}, {"id": 88, "text": "Welcome Home (Hindi, 2020) Horror, Thriller The new SonyLiv flick is filled with emotions of fear and blood. This creepy movie tells the story of 2 ladies named Anuja and Neha who had frightening experiences when they went to take census count in a secluded house in the middle of nowhere. They went to take the census and felt something was out of place when they had met Prerna, a pregnant lady who told 'Children were born and they die thereafter' when asked about her other kids. There they met 3 more adults who were suspicious of the way they behaved.They stepped out of the house. Later, Anuja had a feeling to go back to that house and Neha at first wasn't interested. But their instincts made them go there. This time, everything is changed. A downpour made them stay for the night and, that was the beginning of their ultimate fears. What happened to them thereafter is the rest of the movie's story.Apart from dealing with a horror subject, the movie directed by Pushkar Mahabal and penned by Ankita pictures the Indian community dominated by men. For example, Anuja's fiance and Neha's brother were the same apart from living in different Indian cities. Their attitude towards women can be seen at the beginning of the film. The sex-starved villainous characters also depict another section called psychos who are not common, yet they consider women as tools for just sex. The male characters in the movie are mostly awful. Maybe they too exist!!At end of the movie, when we realize that the whole incident is based on a true incident, we could feel chilling vibes through our flesh and bone. Welcome Home is well crafted and cut to the chase during the nearly 2 hours of its run time. Welcome Home shouldn't be missed if you are a movie fanatic, especially if you like the movies that chill down the spine that pervaded with an eerie atmosphere.Well, it was too hard to live the life of Prerna!!!"}, {"id": 89, "text": "2 girls escaping but they want to discuss at the doorstep whether there is a dear body or notNo point in hiding where they are from their own knowing people , infact census taking is an official dutyIt's not a so dense forest but even tigers growl \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 it's a habited place with even electricity so this scene made me to laughContradicting phone of one girl fells in water and of other girl is left behind in house , typical Indian mode of executing movies ... people forget easily when they are well aware that something is not wrong at that place \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04THE ONLY SENSIBLE PSYCHOTHRILLER WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE FROM BOLLYWOOD in recent IS  TUMBAD"}], "reviews_amount": 90}
