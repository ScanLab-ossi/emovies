Is it about a return to our old Heritage? The poisonous and devastating consequences of the diverse anti-protagonists? Let's find out... First the negative... The casting of Nat Wolff... He did a good job.. his acting skills are not the reason I dislike him as the main character , he represents a lineage that is hardly visible , despite his wandering of to america and returning to the old soil and whatever might have happened there. Most people will not be bothered by this but I have spent many hours reading about my heritage.and feel a closer physical match would have been appropriate. The casting of his nemesis which initially bothered me (before realizing her role) ticks all the boxes in the end. Most annoying of all this is the american of Norwegian descent -protagonist forces 99pct of this movie to be in English... Norwegian would have been so much more immersive and appropriate. What did I like .. the underdog turning out to be a hero. The wandering off and returning to his roots to reclaim glories of a past long forgotten , Remembering brings back a power long left slumbering. I love the research put in this... .J\u00e1rngreipr , Mjollnir and megingj\u00f6r\u00f0 are seldom seen depicted so realistic ( despite being never noticed by casual or wandered viewers . .)The movie is not perfect but the landscapes are eye-candy..The cgi is kept to a subtle and realistic level , the supporting characters are kept relevant enough to advance the story and keep a flimsy subplot contributing enough. Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal loves his Norwegian landscapes too I am sure , as was visible in the only other film of his I saw..

I don't normally go for foreign films, but I really did like this one. Please remember it's a FANTASY, and watch it with that in mind.

I have scrolled through some pretty horrendous reviews (Even from a Norwegian), really I have no idea what exactly they were expecting (As for Azrafiq, I'd love to know exactly which movie he was watching, as it wasn't the one were talking about) and as for people saying it was a naff ending (Get a life), it was a cliff hanger, for a sequel.

It's kind of a dark origin story of a superhero, although the protagonist doesn't actually save very many people. Marvel this is not. If you think that's a good thing, you just might enjoy this movie.It was written and directed by Andre Ovredal. I've never seen his other movies, so I didn't know quite what to expect. If you like this movie, I've heard his other films are even better. They include TrollHunter , The Autopsy of Jane Doe , and The Tunnel (Tunnellen). Honestly, I thought it was cool that a Norwegian would create a modern-day version of a Norse god.TIPS FOR PARENTS: You see a person with a lot of burned skin. A person has a hard time controlling his emotions. Talk to your kids about that and offer some helpful tips. Some people die.THEMES: Maybe we're not meant to understand everything. - Sheriff It's healing to have someone believe in you. Religion is an interesting aspect of the story. People wonder if Eric is a gift from God like Jesus. One of the characters notes that if he is, he wants to help and be on the right side. Greek/Norse mythology is also a part of the story, as some people believe Eric is a descendant of Thor. Fear PowerTHINGS I LIKED: I liked the very beginning of the film because it was intriguing and I had no idea what was going on. You get to see some beautiful Norwegian landscapes. It felt like I got to take a little trip to Norway. That's cool how they made Christine's hair stand up in the jail scene. Some special effects look really good. Others, not so much. Some of the makeup design is very effective. Others, not so much. Cool movie poster. The color palette was very dark and grey, perfect for a brooding story of mystery and danger. I love the aspect of searching for one's family roots. My twin sister and I wrote a book about how to do just that! It has lots of how-to information, as well as inspiring stories from real people who had amazing experiences while researching their family tree! You can check it out the eBook on Amazon.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: The acting isn't exceptional and has even been criticized by many reviewers. I've seen worse. I thought Nat Wolff and Iben Akerlie did fine and were believable. Sometimes it's hard to understand what people are saying because they speak so quietly. Some scenes are dark, which will make viewing on small devices difficult. There's no humor. It's a very dark drama. The music was often too noticeable, rather than supportive of the scenes on the screen. There was a character whose motivations were very strange played by Priyanka Bose. After being saved, she tries to hunt down the protagonist to kill him. Why? I thought there would be a surprise reveal in the end that she was a superhero villain, but absolutely nothing happened with her character arc. Such a missed opportunity and disappointment.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel and website!"}, {"id": 50, "text": "Interesting movie good some slow some goosebumps etc but def makes up for a no2.

A very captivating movie with a brilliantly written script, directed to the highest level and executed to perfection by a mostly unknown cast. Nat Wolff has a very bright future ahead based on the talent showcased here. Whilst Torden (Mortal) is somewhat reminiscent of Brightburn it manages to carve out a sense of realism and has an air of being entirely believable. This is helped along by both the very periodic subtitles for the Norwegian as well as the incorporation of ancient runes and understated special effects. Nothing over the top here Marvel. My only gripe is how short the movie was.

This movie was very well directed by Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal and by no means I've just found his talent comparable with of the best in the industry, brilliantly done, an excellent director. He did everything right, not too much, just enough to let your curiosity and emotions rise with Eric's, played by (Mat Wolff excellent choice btw) so we could feel what he was going through as the scenes unfold and Christine played by Iben Akerlie, omg folks, the moment the camera got a close shot at her face, the scene when she looked up at the sun while standing under the rain, her beauty came out like a beam of light, I suddenly recognized the most beautiful actress like Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence and australian beauty Anna Torv facial features, jump right out with grace and that's when I thought, this beautiful Iben Akerlie from Oslo Norway, should never be forgotten and be cast again in more movies like this one, where there are extreme emotional scenes and this type of movie genre. Iben Akerlie and her fellow actor Mat Wolff were both mesmerizing in their roles and whoever found these two actors, kudos to you and the casting director. The special effects were out of this world and were just simply blended in perfectly with the beautiful Norwegian untouched landscapes and that suspended bridge standing there with tunnels at both end entering straight into the mountain was impressive as hell and an incredible feat of engineering and an excellent choice to put in the movie for its premise but also a great idea for a great tourist attraction. I don't know about you Norway reminded me, some of the scenes in The Lords of the Ring that were filmed in New Zealand, two place on earth that I wish I had a chance to visit one day and travel across its landscapes and sleep in a tent just to feel its soul.I'm telling you, I'm not just pulling your chain, this is probably one of the best super hero movie, where the protagonist discovers his powers and his reason to exist, since the super hero remake of the 2013 Man of Steel played by Henry Cavill, because of the story, the music, the actors, the suspense, the emotions and the sfx. To this day, Man of Steel remains in my top 20 greatest movies of all time and this movie folks, Mortal has found its well deserved spot in my top 20 best movies of all time. Definitely needs a sequel or this would be a travesty if they preferred not to. All we can do is cross our fingers. This movies deserves to be promoted by every means possible because anyone who understands the work behind the making of this movie, can only be in awe, but unfortunately it's a bittersweet industry, where everyone wants their movie to be shown, meanwhile you have a gem like Mortal, because of its foreign origin, doesn't get the light of day in exposure as the big budget american block busters that become successful by default, because of the pounding publicity that forces it down your throat, even though it wasn't that great to watch in the first place. Not fair at all if you ask me, but hopefully with word of mouth, it will become iconic in the super hero movies and a classic whereby everyone who loves fantasy and sci-fi movies would've seen it once by principle at some point in time their lives just like you'd watch the Star War trilogy right? It's that good folks i'm not kidding and this movie should be a trilogy. Now with all that in mind, if I told you, I recommend this movie to all you movie buffs, who loves to fall in love and also be blown away by fantasy and sci-fi storytelling, would you believe me ?? Well don't take my word for it, go see it without the critics in mind, because thats the worst way to watch a movie, you'll ruin it.

And this including the unearthing of a burial chamber full of ancient runes and the apparel of the God Thor - glove, belt and of course the hammer. Well, I can tell you that I got pretty Thor at that point myself.The movie might have been so much better if the lightning strikes and the Norse God thing had just been dialed down a bit.Thankfully, I didn't pay much for the Blu-Ray that my wife and I have just watched.

The character starts off as good and tries doing the best he could yet there will always be someone/thing to screw it up in the end that will drive the character mad or even make him angry. As shown in the movie Eric is seen as a scared guy who doesnt know what is happening to him, and then a girl come in to help to which they fall for one another after she sees the real him and he sees that she is trying to help. In the end it is ruined by some woman who just doesnt want the world to see it as a good thing because she is scared of him and of what he could do. She kills the girl accidentally but it could've been avoided, but instead she goes through with taking him down at all costs and because of that it causes total chaos after Erics' now girlfriend is shot in the head because the girl said to shoot Eric point-blank. Eric then is fueled by rage because what could've been a happy ending was turned around to show the real side of humanity. Not everyone is open to new thing or beings i mean who knows what could be out there. The most of the planet will be filled with hope but there will always be that one bit that just disagrees and hates to see the people hopeful.

It's a pair of gloves!) and the Belt of Strength that they'd include it all, and that at the end, Eric would've revived Christine, since, that's one of Mjolnirs abilities in the actual mythology (Thor would often kill and eat his Goats Toothgrinder and Toothgnasher, then gather up the skins and bones and in the morning, use Mjolnir to revive them), but no, it ends with a supervillian shout almost because they had recently seen Brightburn or if this were bigger budget, to introduce an evil mythology movie series.The entire movie instead feels like a very long first act to what could've been a much better story. They're just getting to what should've been the meat of the story, a cult of Thor and the instant glorification of Eric, how other religions react to the reveal of the Truth of the Norse Gods, how do governments react, etc.If you've read this far and haven't watched the Netflix/Norwegian series Ragnarok, do so and enjoy an actual story with real characters playing in this same sandbox."}, {"id": 156, "text": "We get the back story late in the film.

I registered just to review this, and thats saying something.If historical mythology is up your street, particularly aimed at Vikings, and Old Norse, then you will enjoy this. Its a movie about discovery, without spoiling it too much.Its a slow burn, but anticipation grows and your left with arguably the best film I've watched in recent years. Id even argue its better than most mainstream films. It has a hint of a Bmovie about it, but the special effects used, look believable and outstanding. It never felt over done or overly Cgi.The acting was decent. The dialogue and script for Priyanka Bose's part as Hathaway felt hollywoody. I REALLY hope theres a sequal coming, and wasnt a one off. The entire film was staged perfectly for a sequal, and there's so much more that could be told."}, {"id": 164, "text": "I highly recommend it (yes Americans can appreciate this movie too haha).My compliments to all involved in this project top to bottom. Great writing, directing all the actors did a great job, granted at first I didn't think I was going to like Nat Wolff but he grew on me. And really nice effects nothing over the top or excessive but quality work. It was a great story, that I thought it unfolded nicely.In my case the ending really surprised me, I didn't read the full summary, I just thought the first half sounded interesting. So I completely missed the Norwegian mythology part. Now granted given a little more thought I guess I could have put 2 and 2 together early in the movie but honestly I'm happy I didn't. It was much more fun being completely surprised toward the end. I just wish a certain thing hadn't happened in the last scene.I really can't decide if this is one of those movies best left alone as just a great piece of work or if I'd like a second. Probably the former but it really did leave me wanting more, it definitely felt like there was another chapter there just waiting to be told."}, {"id": 165, "text": "You know.. what the hell happened here? \u00d8vredals last three movies are Trolljegeren, The autopsy of Jane Doe and Scary stories to tell in the dark. Three prette awesome movies. And then this? What!It starts off depressing, and it keeps on being depressing, dark, slow and just a big downer all the way to the end.The leads, Iben Akerlie and Nat Wolff have no chemistry, or very little at least. We don't get to know them at all. Nat Wolff is sulking and acting afraid. We get about a billion close ups of his face. He is also totally charmless, I'm sorry to say.Overall the acting is ok tho. And it is kinda cool to see this kind of movie in norwegian. A lot of the dialogue is in norwegian.The action is tolerable, if you can call it action? The movie looks pretty good. Nice nature. Probably the best thing about it. It's beautiful here in Norway. It's not exactly a bad movie, it is just slow, very uninteresting, and well, pointless. And again, Nat Wolff.. boy. He is so boring, and plays a character I don't care about at all.And please get actual americans to play americans."}, {"id": 166, "text": "Slow is the way to go, sometimes. Imagine if it was you, and you don't understand what is going on with you. Like a disease, or trauma. In this world of instant gratification movies, its refreshing for a movie to let one live it, in seemingly real-time, with the hero. Slowly, cautiously, discovering what he can, and cannot do. Its like people are in such a hurry to know everything. They almost need to re-learn to discover it, as the hero in the film discovers it. There is doubt, and concern, even fear, that needs to be overcome. You have to look before you leap, especially into he unknown. Its called Patience. People who rush into what they don't understand, will regret it. So, go at your own pace. Like this movie does. Especially when you are in doubt about who you are, slowly leading to self discovery. Why rush it? I love how the movie criticizes and slams others feeling they have to control everything and others. Not unlike some of these instant gratification addict negative IMDB commenters, who wouldn't know a good movie if it was in front of them, educating them. They want to control it, insulting that scum, is what this movie is also about. You control nothing. You do not seem to understand that your comments become what you expose: boring and depressing. Worthless comments take up space and often reveal your ignorance, and that you seem to have have missed the point. You are the take the shot crowd, and try to ruin it for the rest, but... as the film shows, sometimes there are consequences. You seem to have learnt nothing from watching this film. Now go watch Police Academy that's your level. Leave the more sophisticated, slow, involved, deep movies to the more mature people, who appreciate them. Thank you."}, {"id": 167, "text": "I have been watching a lot of Norwegian movies recently and to be honest I have not seen a single bad one yet and this is no exception.It shows what can be done on a low budget; the photography and landscapes are awesome, the story is intriguing from the very start and keeps you hooked and on the edge of your seat until the very end and puts a magic spin on the old real Norse mythology of Thor and the tree of life.The people giving this a 1 or 2 stars have no right to be reviewing movies as this means it is the worst movie you have ever seen and if you don't have any idea of what ratings like 1 or 2 mean, you should not be doing reviews. It is almost as bad as the paid shills giving movies a 9 or 10 stars and this is definitely nothing less than a 7 star movie!It would have gotten an extra star if it had not been for the rather abrupt ending which made me feel like they had run out of money or perhaps angling for a sequel and the main character could have had a better choice of actor but i liked the idea of replacing the usual musclebound, brainless Marvel nonsense with a more ordinary bloke; kudos to the director and may he make many more movies in future and hopefully a sequel as this beats the Marvel crash, bang , wallop ordure into a cocked hat!If you enjoyed this movie then do try other Norwegian classics such as the magnificent disaster movies B\u00f8lgen (2015) and the sequel Skjelvet (2018), for horror try some Fritt vilt (2006) and one of the best thrillers I have seen in ten years Hodejegerne (2011) but do rent this Thor alternative or preferably see it at the cinema as this film is truly a joy to behold!"}, {"id": 168, "text": "First of all, I watched this having only seen the trailer a while back and not having read ANYTHING about it. I think that helps.So, the bad. CGI is poor at times. There are a few unexplained occurrences which characters should really question. Dialogue is occasionally stilted and the actors can't make it work in those few, brief moments.Now the good: Pacing of story is spot on - it's not relentless but never drags. Acting is on the whole quite good. Cinematography is very pleasing throughout, backed up by some excellent lighting. If you are a fan of super-human/fantasy films, the story is engaging and better than average.I'm not going to say much more than that. It is easily 8/10 (for the genre) and provided a thoroughly enjoyable Friday night's movie-watching. I am quite picky with film and TV and enjoy a wide range of genres and eras.

The female lead is a complicated character with personal issues. She speaks hers native Norwegian language but also communicates with the male lead in English, which she explains that she is not proficient in.The male lead is NOT Thor. He is from the USA and has been through a very traumatic experience. He is going through changes that he does not understand and cannot explain. And he is totally alone in a foreign land and does not know the language or the people.The special effects are minimal but good. Supporting cast is good in their roles.The cinematography, scenes, and locations are a major part of what makes this film so good. It is a story about Norway, past and present. Its people, culture, history, and mythology.The male lead is a US citizen so the US government MUST get involved for \u00ects own selfish interests.

Unfortunately that drives movies such as Mortal, that are beautifully done, to be dismissed or misplaced under the radar.Mortal was true storytelling and broke free of the typical boring format and approach of super hero origin stories.The creators of Mortal allowed the time and built the space for the viewers to truly empathize with the characters. The movie speaks a lot of subtle truths about this world and our societies and how we jump to conclusions and don't consider multiple perspectives or take time to understand truth. They attack, subdue, or try to control anything that they fear, that is different, or threatens their belief systems.I will say I am not into the comic book or super hero types of movies typically nor do I typically write reviews.... But when I saw the ratings Mortal was getting... I thought the people that made the movie deserved a shout out from someone that is pretty picky about movies... though there are a couple special effect / cuts that could have been done a bit better... Mortal was so beautifully done. The story telling and cinematography was superb. Overall a great movie and origin story. So bravo to everyone involved.

There is where the strength of this movie lie. It's a slow burn movie which lets you process your own emotional connection to the different characters first, before proceeding to the next scene. You'll sometimes find yourself saying to your head--oh no, you should've done this instead or this shouldn't have happened if... and that's okay--because you are not the character, the world is filled with people who thinks and reacts differently anyway.Enjoy the movie in its entirety--the cinematography, the sullenness of characters, the weird weather in Norway (why do they always have hooded jacket? -- you'll ask), the take on Norse myths. The movie will not explain everything so you need to drum up your imaginative and creative brain--by which a movie should make you do.What will make this movie a better film is a better development of the characters and how they are relevant to the overall story--like the father of the dead kid.What will ruin this movie is a big budget heavily spent for effects, costumes, and advertising."}, {"id": 172, "text": "I love movies based on characters with superpowers. I especially like plots that aren't so black and white, good vs evil... one-dimensional. Toward that end, this movie reminds me of films such as: Push, Unbreakable, Chronicle, Code 8, Jumper and especially... Firestarter and The Lathe of Heaven.I thought the film's plot was good enough to keep most users engaged. The acting is very good, especially from co-lead Iben Akerlie. It's a Norway product so there are a few subtitles early on but the film is mostly english - so you can concentrate on the visuals (actors, backgrounds, facial expressions, etc).There was something throughout the film that kept nagging at me, however. It turned out to be the lead actor, Nat Wolff. He simply cannot act (or at least, was terrible in this film). While the rest of the actors did a marvelous job (in helping me suspend disbelief), Wolff was decidedly the opposite.The movie kept switching from a high-quality, low-budget 6+ to a B-movie that sucked the energy of out you - every time there was a focus on Wolff. It was like listening to a song with a good chorus and the lead would speak (not sing) his part. His voice was monotone, his facial expressions (a big part of acting) were monotone, his movements were monotone. Bad, bad casting here which nearly ruined the film, if not for Iben Akerlie carrying Nat Wolff.Despite this, the film is very watchable (especially if you enjoyed some of the example films I listed above).The ending is a little disappointing but leaves room for a possible sequel.

I was, though, hoping for a movie somewhat in the spirit of the Norwegian series Ragnarok, but what I got instead was a story that feels like it was written for my 10 year old son, completely lacking in depth.The acting was solid, but unfortunately it could not compensate for a poor script.
