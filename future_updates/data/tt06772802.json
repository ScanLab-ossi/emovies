What I wanted to say was this is a hard movie to watch. It's hard bc it's honest. We all have our struggles and this is another depiction of an honest struggle families have. In America we like to place labels. In this case the labels are hillbilly, red neck, or white trash. It's all true, but it doesn't mean that's bad. It means it's honest. It makes me think of other honest movies about American families like Crooklyn, Ordinary People or Kramer vs Kramer. In this year of 2020 the word struggle comes up time and again, but let's not forget another truly American symbolic word .... perseverance. Watch this movie and know that if you're down and feel like the world is against you just keep fighting and persevere. I hope this movie can inspire that feeling. It did for me."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I don't understand the low ratings. I cried through this movie and couldn't help but think of my own, imperfect family and the life I've made for myself dispute it. Beautiful. I have not read the book but will and can't wait."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This movie was very touching, I usually do not watch movies revolving around family issues, but this really hit me. The acting is super and the storyline plain, but the storyline with the acting is super. I would recommend this movie."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Don't know why there are such low scores and reviews, it was a very engaging movie, and the acting all round was top notch."}, {"id": 4, "text": "50 year old Asian male here. I've had a charmed life, so I can't relate to the crazy hardships. Not sure why, but I was tearing up a lot though. Kind of embarrassing cause I'm watching it here at work."}, {"id": 5, "text": "As a born and raised Kentucky girl, I could relate to this story. I was disgusted by the negative reviews from the media and Hollywood folks. It's obvious they know very little about poverty, family and all the trials of being poor white people. We hear so much about race and how every white person is privileged, well this story proves that poor folks suffer and have suffered just as much as anyone."}, {"id": 6, "text": "While I hoped this movie would be more well made then it was, it was still great to watch. It was nice to see a movie that felt very familiar, especially coming out on a big streaming platform like Netflix. They did a good job with this one. Glenn Close was amazing every second she was on camera, and definitely carried the film. The music was nice too, and the film feels very authentic. It might not be perfect, but Hillbilly Elegy should definitely pique anyone's curiosity and be able to hold on to them for the entirety of the film. Go watch it and decide."}, {"id": 7, "text": "This movie makes me want to be a better man, period. Thank you for all the actor and actresses that made this happen and gave it their all. I quess i will be seeing glenn close at the oscars again. It just made me feel. Thank you!"}, {"id": 8, "text": "I honestly do not understand the harsh reviews, I watched this movie with low expectations because of what I'd read before going into it but I thought it was fantastic! I don't doubt this will get Amy Adams or Glenn Close a nomination for film awards, at the very least. This movie is definitely emotional and the performances will linger with you after you finish because it is vulnerability and it is weakness, and redemption, and perseverance, and helplessness all at once. Amy Adams is this whirlwind of drama that proves hostile to her family while she struggles with her drug addictions, her son having to cope with the lack of both parental figures with only his grandmother to be his guide and savior throughout his childhood. This movie really kind of gave a window into what addiction does to a person who neither can afford help, or is looking for it, and how complicated life can become. There were so many moments throughout the movie that could have forced Amy Adams' character to confront herself by letting her reap the consequences of her recklessness. But her family behaved like this cushion or a doormat, or a crutch for her misdeeds and drug addictions and the badness would become a cycle, a trend almost, an expected high with a certain inevitable low.There is one particular moment that really got to me, and it was the scene where Glenn Close (Mamaw) is begging a meals on wheels worker to give her more food because she is now taking care of her grandson; a meal for one is split for two and she doesn't think twice about giving her grandson the larger portion of the meal. This just really got to me because although this young man's life was nowhere near perfect, he had someone in his life who pushed him to go further and to try harder and this scene and what happens afterward is probably my favorite thing about this movie."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I thought this film was a great drama that uses flashbacks of the past to explain what's running through J.D.'s mind as he tries to navigate university and his moms constant drug addiction. The acting was powerful all the way through. It has gripping emotions from start to finish that shows how bad you have to work, and to want something, to succeed when all the cards are stacked against you. Some may find this to be a woe is me kind of story, but I think it showed the never quitting spirit that Southerners have. Honestly, it's better than the professional critic reviews that I've read.Overall, I really enjoyed the film and the story behind it. That to say, I can't figure out why this film is getting low ratings, but I think it's worth the watch. Currently it's in select theatres until 24 November when it releases onto Netflix in Canada."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Don't really understand about all the hates or jealousy here. I am a very picky individual when it comes to watching a movie too. However, I find this one very entertaining and outstanding among all those stupid CGI films that were released during the year. Couldn't be happier because this one just quench my thirst."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I enjoyed the movie very much. As a Black American, I know the struggles of my culture, so to see the trials and tribulations of another culture is eye opening.Ron Howard is an A-list Director and doesn't produce anything that is subpar. The critic reviews and low ratings for this movie are puzzling. Yet I'm seen high ratings for movies to me that weren't so great.The movie is good, don't believe the critics."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Have we become so cynical that we can't appreciate a truly exceptional movie. Every performance is top-rate. If you can't find something to relate to in this story, you're not paying attention. Gabriel Basso is terrific. I'm sorry that this movie will be ignored because critics can't relate. Ron Howard is one of our finest storytellers. Two hours well spent."}, {"id": 13, "text": "It's a really beautiful movie, for people who want to feel something and dive in it. If you see that, as a critic it doesn't work. I really can't see the reason for the bad critics. It remined me movies like Fried green tomatoes, Terms of endearment and that was really rare to find in a movie these days. Glenn Close is astonishing. She gives one of her best performances. Couldn't stop crying. Amy Adams is great too. And the music of Hans Zimmer... My God! What a beautiful work. What a moving and touching peace. Thank you for this movie!"}, {"id": 14, "text": "With My Daddy's roots in the same hills this was such an authentic movie. Loved it. Glenn close is simply amazing!"}, {"id": 15, "text": "Excellent portrayals of the characters. Why the horrible reviews? Maybe the critics have been stuck in their cities too long."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Trying to figure out why the critics' score is so different from the user score and all I can think is because the former is detached from the reality of rural white poverty. Living and teaching in an area similar to where J.D. comes from, I see his struggle of trying to escape poverty through education and the impact of drug abuse on communities on a regular basis. It's easy to dismiss this as Oscar bait and it definitely is...but it's also a movie, though really difficult to watch at points, that tells the uncomfortable reality for far too many."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Anyone that gives this movie a bad rating needs a reality check"}, {"id": 18, "text": "Excellent, magnificent, the performances of Glenn Close (10) and Amy Adams (9)."}, {"id": 19, "text": "It's not often that filmmakers touch on subject matter which reveal greater truths about a neglected part of our society. Ron Howard digs into the forgotten dregs of Appalachian society and holds a mirror to the socioeconomic realities of an unnurturing environment and the fortitude, faith, and blind luck which is required to pull oneself out of a seemingly hopeless situation. Glenn Close--in a monumental role as a fierce, yet vulnerable matriarch--is no less than exceptional as a woman trying to raise her grandson to a better life. Amy Adams shows yet again what a dependable star she in the Hollywood constellation. Complete with carefully manicured visuals and a moving score, this is the event movie of the year."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Maybe it's because I'm from Ohio &amp; I now live on the other side of the world, but I cried from start to finish. Homesick, missing my roots. I love Glen Close. I thought this movie was very well done. I wish there would've been more of an ending, but I guess that would've made it more of a cliche. I feel like it encapsulates the Midwestern family makeup very well. At the end of the day, family is most important, but you're entitled to live your own life as well. I needed that reminder. This movie resonates with me more than any others. Ron Howard did an excellent job!"}, {"id": 21, "text": "For some reason, the critics have really piled in on this film. So is it the Cats of 2020?Not at all. Admittedly it's not as good a film as you'd expect from Ron Howard but it's perfectly watchable. The cast is great - Glenn Close will surely be up for another Oscar nomination.Worth a couple of hours of your time."}, {"id": 22, "text": "In many ways things have not changed. The child abuse, drugs, poor education, etc. Massive struggles. These are still issues throughout the Appalachian Mountains, but they're also scattered everywhere else too. The only thing that differs is most kids in these situations don't end up at Yale."}, {"id": 23, "text": "These critics are ridiculous! This is a nice story, very well acted. Amy Adams and Glenn Close did a fantastic job. I found the first third to be a bit much, erratic and lots of yelling, but if you can get though that it's a rewarding film. It kind of grows on you over 2 hours and by the end you feel more connected to the characters. Overall 6/10."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Prior to watching Hillbilly Elegy, I had read reviews calling it things like poverty porn, Oscar bait, and a missed opportunity to truly examine the characters. Ignore those descriptions. This is a look at how growing up in a dysfunctional poor family affects you for your entire life. Glenn Close's and Amy Adams's performances are like a brick in the face (and yes, I'd say that they both deserve Oscars for these intense roles). Definitely see it."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Hillbilly Elegy is just a nice story about salvation, redemption, and self-preservation. Some people might be ambivalent about it because it doesn't offer much in the way of social commentary or political analysis. Not every movie needs to do so and I don't believe that this movie is particularly weak because it doesn't veer into such matters. All in all, I can recommend Hillbilly Elegy to potential moviegoers even if it isn't one of the better films I've watched over the years."}, {"id": 26, "text": "Hillbilly Elegy based on a J.D. Vance memoir and well directed from Ron Howard is one brash, blunt and harrowing look thru flashback at a rural upbringing that helped influence and make one Yale law student. If one grew up in the rural South or Appalachian many can relate to many of the scenes of hollows, mountains, and just good loving country folk. Anyway the movie is a tale of upbringing and forming strong family bonds as this would shape one J.D. Vance from his Kentucky start thru Ohio living to his arrival at Yale law school till his meeting of his girlfriend Usha(Freida Pinto). Love is felt in the strongest and toughest form from Mamaw(in a transformative turn from Glenn Close) and the wild card of the family is J.D.'s mom the far out and eccentric Bev(Amy Adams) who battles her own personal demons of addiction. This picture does feel real and emotional as it's touching to show how family and a rough raising helped shape success and start a new journey in life."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Great acting. Great story. What's not to like?...I'll tell you what's not to like - the rubbishing of a film for political reasons... Need I say more?Go woke, go broke."}, {"id": 28, "text": "What a cast and lead by Ron Howard. Knocked it out if the park. Glenn Close must be nominated for an academy award. Didn't realize who she was in the show till half way through. WOW"}, {"id": 29, "text": "Anybody, who ever loved his Mamaw will love this simple story. Glenn Close is great! Thank you all, for this movie!"}, {"id": 30, "text": "The reviews are unfair. It all was JD Vance life. How can a screwed up family be rescued by a sickly grandmother. The main diffwrence with the book was that JD's father was a kind and decent person, but he had his own family and JD chose his grandma rather than his father and stepmother and step siblings. It is a portrait of the decay of blue collar America. Once jobs go away, people give up trying to be decent. In the movie (and life) nobody goes to church, nobody cooks a meal (only junk food), nobody exercises or keep their lawns mowed. And it is just a reflect pf their low self esteem.His sister also shows how the easiest escape from oppressife houses is by getting married early, when you move from a broken household to another one. His grandpa was also important, because he was a nasty husband when younger, but as he got older, he learned how to appreciate his family."}, {"id": 31, "text": "Be prepared to cry profusely. I can't for the life of me figure out why such a touching movie has so many poor reviews."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Like all films by Ron Howard, it is very well made. At times it is hard to watch as it so truthful to what troubled families go through. It has a good message and needs to be seen. Amy Adams and Glenn Close are superb . Emotions run high in this movie and it is well worth watching. Keep watching through the hard times and it has a good, but somewhat expected message at the end."}, {"id": 33, "text": "I did not read the book but I think that it must be better with more time to develop the major characters. The Flashbacks to the main character's teen years clearly are the scenes that stand out in the Movie. Some of the Plot seems forced on the viewer and I did not feel for the characters much or care what happed to them. I blame Ron Howard direction for this fault. That said. the performances by two great actresses make this a must watch on any list. Amy Adams was not afraid to look less than enchanting in another fine performances. Give it a shot. Rich"}, {"id": 34, "text": "Honest story based on real lives. Despicable that critics have disrespected Vance's intentions and failed to give the cast the accolades they deserve. Loved the book and loved the movie!"}, {"id": 35, "text": "Top level acting. Amy Adams as you've never seen her before. Glenn Close is terrific. Great story."}, {"id": 36, "text": "I have two boys. I know a son's love for his Mom. This was that, and so much more. This was a beautiful story of love choosing to prevail over heartache, destructive choices, difficult relationships and loss.

Boy Moms will be so proud of this kid. Way to go, J.D.!"}, {"id": 37, "text": "Sometimes I totally don t understand people, why give this great movie a very low rating. The acting is excellent. Ok it' s not an action movie or thriller but just a troubled family which deals with addiction, coming of age and never forget your roots."}, {"id": 38, "text": "I read the book last summer, loved it. Watched the movie the first day it was on Netflix, loved it too. I also read those critics reviews, can't believe they are so harsh on this movie, particularly The Atlantic, saying it the worst movie in last year, come on, Atlantic, I read your articles regularly, this is so mean. Id have given it 8, but those unfair reviews triggered me, I gave it 10 instead."}, {"id": 39, "text": "I don't know why the movie's ratings is so low the film isn't so bad The film have a great acting by emy Addams , Glenn close and Owen Asztalos as young J.D and of course a great music by Hans zinmer I think the movie deserves Oscar nominations for leading actress (emy addams) , supporting actress (glenn close) and music original score But I fear that critics's low rating oppress the movie in awards season My rating 7/10"}, {"id": 40, "text": "This is a good story. It's not perfect by any means, but it is a nice story about a family and the realities of circumstance. It's simple but complex at the same time. The first half has some tedious parts, but the last third makes it worth watching. I really enjoyed it."}, {"id": 41, "text": "This story was hard to watch for someone coming from a dysfunctional family. I didn't read the book so can't comment on that, but this is a movie review, so I don't know why the book would matter.The casting was spot-on. I cannot imagine anyone better suited for these roles, and every actor was spectacular, especially Owen Asztalos as the young J.D.These are a lot of emotions and the actors did an incredible job of helping the viewer feel them."}, {"id": 42, "text": "I've seen article after article saying not to see this movie so of course I had to watch it. I am glad I gave it a chance. The movie was eye opening yet relatable to life in the Midwest. I highly recommend seeing it."}, {"id": 43, "text": "For me it was a nice surprise. I initially watched it reluctantly but soon fell in love with the young boy and his dysfunctional family. Loved this movie."}, {"id": 44, "text": "It's honest, to the point and shows the daily struggles families came come up against."}, {"id": 45, "text": "The critics who call this the worst fil of the year must have never ventured outside of their elitist circle. I will preface by saying that I haven't read the memoir so maybe some people's disappointment is how the movie compares, but it's impossible to perfectly sum up a person's life in just shy of 2hrs. This movie shows the honest struggle of millions in our country and one man's journey to better himself. Amy Adams &amp; Glenn Close are superb as usual. My main critique is that I wish they would have shown more of J.D.'s life growing up rather than continuing to flash, but I see why it was set up that way."}, {"id": 46, "text": "I really enjoyed the movie but so much of the book was not covered. I realize that this is a common problem in movie-making. The acting was outstanding and the movie was well put together although I may have emphasized other aspects of JD's life, if I were doing it.As an aside, I grew up in Middletown during this period and my father worked at the mill (Armco). I was not aware that so many hillbillies moved to town and the problems that were created in their lives being transplanted. I went to parochial school so this is probably why I was unaware. I look back on my life during this time in Middletown with pleasure. I am very sorry that others did not have this experience, as demonstrated in the movie."}, {"id": 47, "text": "I really didn't know what to expect, when I started watching this movie. I don't think it can get any more real. Amy Adams playing a drug addict mother is almost to real. The funeral for her dad made me cry. The small town respect for the dead was heartwarming. Glen Close as a grandmother was unbelievable real. Great movie Howard. Thank you, To all the haters out there. You have serious issues!"}, {"id": 48, "text": "Art should be judged by assessing how well it achieves what it tries to achieve. This movie is what it tries to be. If you don't like what it depicts, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It just means it isn't your cup of tea. The bad reviews are by coastal leftists who don't care about the people who live in fly over states.This is an excellent movie. If you want to learn something about a culture that's little understood by leftist elites, this movie will give you a lot of insight."}, {"id": 49, "text": "Amy Adams is so great! Just a feel good movie of real life issues that every family struggles with!"}, {"id": 50, "text": "Hillbilly Elegy is a film that starts with a soothing vibe and goes on introducing all the characters. Pacing of the first arc goes smoothly but starts to feel kinda boring after some time. Right at the end of the first arc things start to feels repetitive where the story is just circling around the family drama. The film tries to strike us with all the emotional moments where sometimes it works fine but sometimes it doesn't. Amy Adams delivered a fine performance throughout the whole movie but in the end it wasn't enough to lift up a whole movie. overall it's a film that you can definitely watch for once."}, {"id": 51, "text": "Did we all see the same film?? I'm baffled by the criticism. I thought the film was an excellent, multilayered narrative that captured the essence of one man's experience. The acting is excellent and the time jumps work well (in illustrating the ways our past informs our future). It isn't meant to be a political commentary or dissection. If you're expecting as much, you may be disappointed. If you watch the film, however, and judge it independent of the political expectations that have been dumped on it - I think you'll enjoy it. It's more autobiographical than political. But it works well."}, {"id": 52, "text": "I'm not sure about all the negative reviews.This is one of the best movie adaptation of a book that I have ever seen."}, {"id": 53, "text": "What a great &amp; heart touching story you never seen before, it's amazing it's fantastic. Great."}, {"id": 54, "text": "It's not my type of movie, but I truly don't understand the terrible reviews that came out. The child actor for JD was amazing, and obviously the rest of the cast was great. I didn't see the prejudice and hate all of the critics were writing about a few weeks back. It's like this movie was purposely hated on for some odd reason.Again, wasn't my favorite, but was worth the watch."}, {"id": 55, "text": "This movie is so good. Reality in this world. It's a feel good movie with sadness about family struggles . I think Glen Close ,Amy Adams and Ron Howard should all get awards! Acting was so good. I understand it's based on a true story.

Wow, just wow."}, {"id": 57, "text": "I'm starting to watch this as we speak on Netflix. And although i feel a bit drowsy and sleepy for some previous sleeplees nights. This movie is very engaging. Good acting. Watch it grab a bag of kettle chips. Sea salt and vinegar and stream it on your tv. Also Ron Howard directs good films. He directed Cinderella Man."}, {"id": 58, "text": "Maybe this movie was hard to watch, but I like a story about someone who makes something of their lives despite their rough circumstances. It's a real look at family dysfunction, addiction, mental illness and it doesn't sugarcoat."}, {"id": 59, "text": "We don't deserve the selfless, strong, and fear-inducing women of this earth that would do anything for their children. I don't believe in god, but if I did this is where I'd say I hope god pays them back every penny and ounce of energy they gave up for us if we aren't able to do it first. Outstanding performances throughout this fabulous movie. An early Oscar contender is my prediction."}, {"id": 60, "text": "So I liked just about everything about this film. BUT....the BF/GF sub story...it didn't feel well written. seemed as if toward the end they ran out of time to finish the story in a great way. it sucks because it could have been a 3hr movie. I mean its Netflix and a great story. why not give it time time it needs go to its full potential? im being way to picky...i knowbut,I loved the movie. happy sad happy story. makes you think. we all dont get to be happy, it takes pain and hurt for some of us."}, {"id": 61, "text": "Is Glenn Close. Or is Meryl Streep the other Glenn Close? And Amy Adams is well into the running. Yet another completely transformative performance from Ms. Close, and a heartbreakingly authentic one from Ms. Adams. And at 25, Gabriel Basso is his own man, playing with a remarkable authority that holds it all together. Special mention also goes to an extraordinary Owen Asztalos, who plays a kid who gets knocked every which way in life and still survives and thrives, Ron Howard's film is bittersweetly beautiful. It's based on a true story with a happy ending. I'm afraid the more common reality for people in this type of situation and environment can be seen in the harrowing Winter's Bone. Nothing sweet there, only bitter."}, {"id": 62, "text": "Glenn Close and Amy Adams shine in this predictable shallow Ron Howard melodrama about the struggle of an ambitious law student getting out of his social class he's leaving behind. No deeper social or political analysis in sight. Exploiting the misery of the lower social class for dramatic show effects, people constantly yelling and beating at each other. What made these people behave like that? What made them fall under the conditions they're suffering from? What does it take to escape from his own social background and family roots? If you expect serious answers you'll be disappointed."}, {"id": 63, "text": "This movie is well written. So much better than the films currently being produced -wherever. Amy Adams turns in a compelling performance as does Glenn Close and the rest of the cast. The actor playing the young JD does a particularly nice job.The story, of course, is truly American and is no doubt the reason for the less than glowing reviews. The dullards who panned it I suspect looked beyond the production and were influenced by the real life conservatism of JD Vance. Maybe not- but few in the media today are honest about anything connected to American or conservative ideals.Better than the wretchedness being produced and sold for $3.99 on cable - watch it! It's a window into seldom seen but often denigrated section of American life."}, {"id": 64, "text": "This film is good, it's a social drama that touches the heart and tells an inspiring story about success despite living in a troubled family setting full of everyday conflicts.

This is a really important blueprint and story of how families and extended families really need to step up and stop parents bullying their children. I think the uniqueness of this is that in real life you have to be incredibly brave to stand up to bullying parent who bullies their own child. As family scapegoating of children as many people know nowIs intractable and also I'm treatable in family therapy as usually the culprits resist taking responsibility that's why it's good that the grammar is brave strong empowered and very loving and supportive of her grandson I love this movie I really do and I hope lots of people lots of children lots of family sit down and watch this together because being bullied isn't fun especially when it's by your own parent."}, {"id": 68, "text": "Addresses social issues like inequality, poverty, addition all taking place in the Appalachian region.

Thank you, middle age! The story and performances were so engaging that it kept my interest for the whole hour and fifty-six minutes. Glenn Close's portrayal of Mamaw is so nuanced and powerful, that when she is on the screen she overshadows everyone else. Every emotion is seen on her face, from the guilt she hides inside for not supporting her daughter Bev when she needed her, to the strength and determination she summons to help her grandson J.D. and not repeat the cycle of broken dreams and despair. It was astonishing to see in the credits how closely Glenn Close and Amy Adams resembled the real-life characters they played."}, {"id": 82, "text": "This is a good movie, despise of what progressist leftist critics may say... A story of personal growth founded in the values of a dysfunctional family trying to overcome all sorts of difficulties...

Some of the latter want to make it so - almost like bad reviews are a hoax or are fake news by woke liberals. Or that this somehow proves that white privilege doesn't exist. Please stop this. Push your issues to the side and watch a really good story about how families struggle. Dreams are dashed in so many ways - anger and resentment are so often the result. The story is real and the acting is excellent. It may not be for everyone, but it doesn't have to be because of their politics. STOP trying to make every difference between people based on politics!! Stop being so angry because people don't always agree."}, {"id": 85, "text": "I'm so shocked this film hasn't got higher reviews!

The film was beautifully acted, written and directed. Ron Howard and his cast should be very proud of their adaptation of JD Vance's memoir. I've seen the critics pan this movie because of some perceived political reasons. The real reason that the progressives hate this film is because it shows how important family is. Ron Howard came from a well balanced family and produced a beautiful family of his own so of course he didn't see the problem with making a film about family that also focuses a bit in the opioid epidemic.

My oldest daughter is now a lifestyles enrichment coordinator at an assisted living facility, my middle daughter is my Yale grad (2011) - with an online financial education business supplying college and high school kids with curriculums to help them also go beyond their raisin'. My boy is working hard in a field he enjoys and is a good man. But for that family, things could have turned out very differently. I winced and teared up watching the boy struggle and learn his way with the help of those around him, and then have to face reality again as his future was looking bright.

I did not know that Glenn Close was Mawmaw until after finishing the movie, which blew my mind. Her realism in the role was amazing. The only reason I can think of for such a low metascore, and even worse Rotten Tomatoes score is that the critics took their opinions on the subject matter out on their reviews. Film snobiness. Yes, it was hard to find sympathy for the characters, but this true story wasn't really about Mawmaw and the addict Bev. Yes, these family dynamics really do exist. I did not feel like it was an exploitation film. It was about J.D., and the obstacles on his journey to success. Maybe J.D. didn't meet an outsiders criteria of a true hillbilly.

Of course, consolidation and simplification are to be expected when adapting book to film.In any case, the superb acting (especially from Glenn Close and Amy Adams) more than made up for the shortcomings in the storyline.

Both actors deliver the goods. Worth seeing for that as well as all the others. 2nd, uniformly amazing setting(s), atmosphere and re-created reality.

An absolute masterclass in character portrayal. Believable to the extent Glenn made me cry and Amy made me angry.

I love that the story is true and by the scroll at the end , everyone is doing as well as can be expected. Forget everything you've ever thought about Glenn Close.

Glenn Close, as Mamaw who helped raise J.D. was almost unrecognizable, she two put on an Academy award performance. Gabriel Basso as J.D. Vance, Academy award performance. The chemistry in this film is so fluent that it tugs at your heart, it's a clean film with no nudity. Ron Howard is still the man anything he touches turns to gold. The story of J.D.

I enjoyed the movie, but I think that this movie would do more for those than have not read the book - which is 99%+ of the population - so it would make sense that they make this for the an audience that hasn't read the book.Trying to make a movie about the human condition can be difficult, but I think the movie did a good job of illustrating it at many different points. I liked the beginning scene where adult JD is at a fancy cocktail party/dinner/whatever with colleagues, as it shows the stark contrast. However, I think the movie goes back to the adult version of him too much. The flipping back and forth between his youth and current day works fine, but I'm left thinking that a straight chronological trip through his youth would have been better. Papaw was a very central character in JD's childhood, yet hardly gets mention in the movie except for when he dies. I think that JD deciding to leave for the Marines would have also been an interesting storyline that very much contributed to the story (I could have seen that as a good ending if the story was told 100% chronologically).Hillbilly Elegy is one of my favorite books, so I think it's only natural to be nitpicky about the movie given that is the case.

This is a story about a family who's had its struggles and having to fight to survive. I think it's rare for Hollywood to tackle a subject like this, but this story is not uncommon, in fact I bet everyone I know around Denham Springs, La knows of families similar to this. Growing up with a father who owned a construction company, I saw his employees get their paychecks on Friday and be broke by Monday because of drugs/alcohol while their kids would go without, and at a very young age I knew that 90% of their kids would likely end up just like them.

That contrasting gap between having easy access to school's supplies and having to steal a calculator in order to do homework. Glenn Close nails it, Amy Adams too, but we learn much more about her character's weaknesses than her talents. Adams' character feels truly painful, and that's thanks to her amazing acting method and vulnerability.

It's a story about Americans lacking both job opportunities and education, resulting ignorance and poverty plus untreated mental illnesses. Drug use is often a result of these things. It's also a story about family and family helping family.One reason why the movie is probably rated less than stellar is due to it's dark nature. It's gritty and frustrating to see human lives needlessly wasted. The brightest part of the entire movie is, literally, the last two minutes before the credits roll.Another reason is that turning any great book, which often takes 5-8 hours to read, into a two hour movie is going to tick off anyone who read the book. I first experienced this after reading Paul Gallico's excellent adventure novel The Poseidon Adventure then seeing the movie a couple years later. Although the movie is rated 7.1 on IMDB, I was disappointed for the simple reason movies can never live up to a book. Yes, including the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Critics whining about the movie have similar complaints, that the movie doesn't live up to the book or harping that extra time should have been spent on one thing over another. An example is Bev (J.D. Vance's mother) obvious mental illness (my guess is bipolarism), her inability to receive adequate treatment and her continual relapses into ever worsening drug addictions as a probable cause from untreated mental illness.As others mentioned, it would take a mini-series to fully tell this story.

Contrary to our initial assumptions, JD's mother wasn't a poor woman who had nothing going for herself. She was smart and educated (was a nurse). She had a decent house from what I could see. Therefore, it's really hard for me to believe that her actions were anything but selfish. Drug addiction is hard to overcome, but JD's mom barely admits she has a problem in the film. This makes her character very unlikeable. In other words, this character has little remorse for her actions. She's a complete narcissist in the film. This woman puts her kids through the most horrible conditions and then blames her upbringing for it.Secondly, I don't understand the point of this film. Family comes first. Okay? Even when one person is abusive and puts their wants before their own children? Frankly, the film kind of sends this message that it's heroic to save your messed up parents. We are made to believe that's a child's responsibility. I call BS. We shouldn't glamorize JD's situation. That woman was awful and he had no obligation to help her at all. Family values don't apply in cases of abuse. I'm just going to leave it at that.Lastly, this film is completely one dimensional. It almost appears like a big budget Christian film with great acting. I was expecting a little more depth after reading about JD's true story. He is a Yale Law graduate yet the film lacks sophistication. There's no critical thinking required to understand the film's message. It's shallow and sensationalized. Even when it tries to address poverty, everything falls flat. The biggest problem? The writing! The dialogue is very simple and I've heard that before. The bottom line? This film is okay because of the acting. Everything else is completely unoriginal and relies too much on tropes.

The Hillbilly elegy had all of the elements of an awards contender but didn't execute any of them at all in an absolute mess of a movie, lets get started.First of all, the movie had good cinematography, some interesting themes, some good chemistry between characters and great performances. The movie did look visually amazing, the set locations were excellent and well explored adding to the visual appeal of the movie. I thought some of the themes of the American dream and the prejudice of Hillbillys was well explored and expressed well the struggles of people having judgments on them before even knowing them, linking that to the main character trying to get into top end universities but being proud of his heritage was good. I thought the chemistry and the connection between the main character and Glenn Closes character, her being the motivation for JD (Gabriel Basso) for being a better person and motivating to achieve things in his life was heartwarming and powerfully thought out. I also have to have hats off to all the performances in this film because they were excellent. Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos were absolutely excellent as JD, they were powerful, emotional and authentic, Glenn Close and Amy Adams also did an excellent job with the poor material they were given, their performances were powerful, nuanced and hard to watch in places so they were excellent.However, my first few negatives would be the unnecessary character conflict, rushed beginning, odd narrative choices and a clunky narrative and pacing. I thought that the movie created way too much character conflict between everyone, the movie positioned each of its characters against each other, they were all bitter and horrible towards one another and it all just felt unnecessary and made the film very hard to watch due to the lack of connection to the characters. I also found the beginning very rushed, when they were establishing the character background for JD and his family I would of wanted the movie to spend more time fleshing out the characters before cutting out to modern day, I just felt like the movie didn't spend long enough developing the characters or having some form of relationship to connect with. I also found the narrative choice to switch between past and present very strange and it often didn't work for me, I got most of my connection with the characters despite it being limited when JD was younger and having it when he was older didn't work for me, this constant switch between tenses also made the narrative and pacing very clunky, it got very irritating spending a limited amount of time in the present and then cutting to the past, to the point where they were over relying on it to create character development and from a screenwriting perspective for me it was just messy and made the pacing extremely off.My next couple of negatives would be the bad character decisions and over the top melodramatic tone. I personally thought that a lot of the characters made horrible decisions throughout the movie, if the movie was supposed to make you connect with the family and reunite and be happy it managed to achieve the complete opposite, they were so horrible to each other I was genuinely questioning why they were still a family in the present, I also thought the movie had way too much of a melodramatic over the top tone, the movie had nothing positive or hardly anything uplifting whatsoever, it was all a bunch of people dieing and crying and it was just too much.My final few negatives for me would be the lack of connection to the characters or emotional connection, and the movie poorly handling its deeper themes. I had absolutely no connection to the characters whatsoever, I disliked pretty much all of them, and whenever the movie tried for a powerful and moving moment I just felt nothing and completely emotionally disconnected, my biggest issue with the movie had to the how poorly it handled the movies deeper themes, the way the movie portrayed abuse and drug addiction was almost insulting and horrible to watch, the whole movie felt completely against Amy Adams character, there wasn't one single sign of her wanting to get better, and they just portrayed her as a horrible human being, this will offend and upset a lot of people and the movie really poorly handled these themes that require a lot of thought and sensitivity to be included.Overall, the hillbilly elegy is made partly watchable to due to it's fantastic performances, but I was completely disconnected from the movie, it's script was poor and often offensive, it's pacing was all over the place and it really poorly mishandled its deeper themes which made me stop watching before the movie even ended."}, {"id": 260, "text": "Howard's film is neither a success nor a failure.

I enjoyed the realism of the book to screen. The critics saying that it's not an accurate depiction of life have never lived apparently in an abusive relationship. Life is not easy coming from that background. Wake up or read a little more ."}, {"id": 265, "text": "The problems the family in this film face, are no different than some families face in Los Angeles or any other town. The problems are not unique to so called 'hillbillies' or Appalachia or Middletown, Ohio. Nor are they unique to the poor or homeless.Despite the amazing talent on screen, the film sometimes felt indifferent to its own characters- even though it fairly shows the boy making changes to his life that lead him to a better future. I think this is because all the drama was loud, without any quiet reflection on why mom was in so much pain. It is still a good film.The story shows how addiction and domestic violence affect each generation of a family, by contrasting the boy's choices to his mother's addiction and life. Perhaps people get upset because the film implies that the mother's addiction is her own choice as she at one time refuses help, only to be refused help later after looses her employer provided health insurance.It is unfair to think the film is making any statement on poverty as the film is really about one kid's hardship in dealing with an addicted parent, who eventually listens to the wisdom of his grandma about not becoming an alcoholic/drug addict himself, so he is less prone to poverty. Grandma never says, you better get out of this town if you want to be better off. Grandma never says don't be a hillbilly.It's the film's title that apparently set up critics' expectations that the film should be about poverty and not drug addition, or maybe some felt the film should have delved deeper into the difficulties in overcoming addiction, rather than simply telling the boy's story.I think critics expected something unique concerning hillbillies and poverty due to the film's title, complaining it is preaching the worn out line, 'its your fault you are in poverty.' The film is really only showing that domestic violence and addiction is sometimes carried to the next generation when children follow the bad examples of their parent's addictions, while also showing that families move away from domestic violence and/or addiction, when they decide to avoid alcoholism and drugs. It does not claim that avoiding addiction promises relief from poverty.This film touches on one aspect of poverty- that involving addiction. The film does not cover poverty caused by purely economic woes. It does not cover reason's why populations in towns like Appalachia or any region become impoverished due to economic woe, like industries moving production overseas and closing factories, leaving boom town populations economically depressed.Certainly, since covid-19 pandemic, all Americans, now better understand it takes only economic crisis to suddenly become homeless or impoverished without any bad choices on the part of the homeless person or family. Surely now older Americans can better understand too, that many homeless have sought employment without finding employment due to age discrimination.Artists have understood this for a long time, having suffered devaluation of their work for decades. From the corporatization of content to internet distributors using disruptive pricing to become billionaires, artists have had their pay cut over their careers, devaluing their earnings to a degree that means the difference between earning a living from their work to not earning a living. With inflated housing costs, artists have been pinched for a long time.And this downward pressure is increasing for artists in all areas of the economy, with a recent price war developing between AMAZON/PUBLISHERS/AUTHORS and the US LIBRARY SYSTEM.Recently, the American Library Association has petitioned Congress, claiming anti-competitive behavior by Amazon, because Amazon bans libraries from purchasing eBooks at consumer prices. Amazon does not ban libraries from such, the rights of authors do and with good reason. Amazon also cannot control rights to eBooks outside the Amazon platform. Amazon's business is built to serve the consumer market.The Library is a distributor that now wants to pretend it is a consumer, so it can purchase eBooks like print books, so it (the government) does not have to pay authors and their publishers for distribution rights, even though eBooks are already subsidized for low income families via the Library system.65 million libraries EACH distributed over 1 million eBooks to Library members in 2018, with a 51% increase for demand for eBooks from Libraries during pandemic shutdowns. The Library is also a distributor who is distributing eBooks via 3rd parties-- 3rd party Apps whose developers have no contractual obligations to publishers/authors directly when making deals with Libraries. Libraries are also complaining they can't access digital content from the likes of Netflix, Hulu or Disney+ to lend free to library members.How is Amazon or any retailer suppose to control content rights by licensing to Libraries who want to distribute via Apps... or is Amazon and Netflix supposed to provide free subscriptions to anyone with a Library card, paying authors or filmmakers pennies.Allowing libraries to buy eBooks or movies/TV series, at consumer prices without paying publishers/authors for distribution rights is what is anti-competitive.The Library, a government institution, cannot expect to be on par with Amazon or Netflix or expect to compete with them without paying writers and filmmakers.Libraries get the best distribution deals in the industry already when calculating their costs per reader. Libraries already get to distribute films and shows on DVD paying one time only for any DVD, without paying for distribution rights.If Libraries got their way, they would get to distribute Digital Content paying authors and filmmakers, one time payments of pennies, to potentially distribute a single title to millions of non-paying readers... which, the Supreme Court decided long ago would be unfair to content creators. It is shocking to think Librarians don't understand this or don't care about writers or filmmakers. To allow Libraries to purchase and own single copies of eBooks and allow free distribution would require change to copyrights law.It may be Amazon and Netflix want to distribute to Libraries. It may be they support reasonable terms, and also want Congress to change copyright to allow their platforms to distribute to Libraries without paying for distribution rights. This would be extremely bad for content creators. Hopefully Amazon and Netflix will support creators by supporting per reader pay terms and not Spotify bulk ads pricing terms to creative.If you are a writer or a filmmaker, you need to contact Congress and speak up and remind Congress to protect your distribution rights-NOW. You also need to let Amazon and Streaming Services like Netflix know you want PER READER terms at living wages for any sub-leasing to other distributors if such plans for the future are being discussed. If Amazon and Streaming providers support creatives in this issue, it may be good for creatives."}, {"id": 266, "text": "Great stuff! Really realistic and harshly true!

Ultimately, life is about choices and your own courage to overcome personal struggles and the author did just that.

If you are someone who has been through a similar time, worked your way out of that environment and into a better life, you should cherish that achievement and never let anyone take that away from you.The story tells that of a fairly average (depending on your point of view) low income Kentucky family, told by one of the grandchildren. It shows the familiar circle: Grandpa was an mean alcoholic, grandma fought him off regularly. Her daughter wasn't strong enough to break the cycle, even though she was the second smartest student of her school, and got a medical license. She became used to numbing pills, lost her job and spiraled downwards, taking the storyteller (her son) and his sister along in the fall. Grandma took over, he was going to live with her and she would set him straight: Man up, get rid of the loser friends, study hard and work your way up. When he does and goes off to Yale, he makes the hard choice of leaving his addicted mom, achieve his goals so he could return later and be in a better position to help her.A lot of the things that happen in this movie is the story of many out there. Unable to actually achieve and live that American dream that everyone talks about since childhood and is advertised on TV and billboards, becoming sad and eventually getting depressed and seek solace in alcohol or drugs instead of accepting simple fate.Actors and acting is of exceptional quality, where you can just feel the tension and stress at times. All scenes have been very carefully scripted and directed.I'm somewhat biased about this movie though, grandma (you see her at the end credits) looked quite similar to my mom's aunt Dina, we stayed with her for a week when we visited the U.S. 20 years ago, she lived in a similar house, similar conditions, similar family, just a few steps higher up the economic ladder and with far less hardship.

Highly reccomend."}, {"id": 339, "text": "When a friend of mine suggested I read J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, I shuddered. What flashed across the mind, I told her, were those TV shows featuring the swamp people or Alaskan wild men, depicted now in Appalachian 'hill people' style. She paused and regrouped. She told me again what a great book it was and when I didn't respond, she circled back with another suggestion: Well, would you be interested in watching the movie with us? We both have read the book. How can you not admire her persistence, I chuckled. Afraid of being sucked into an unwanted rabbit hole and seeking a diplomatic exit, I checked the reviews. Could I find a justification for saying no? Certainly! I found was the meanest spate of reviews I have read since Spike Lee's Bamboozled, another trashed film I thought was brilliant. Now reviewers were stomping Hillbilly Elegy. They stomped it so hard that I was taken aback. Why, I wondered. Glen Close doesn't do trash, I reminded myself. Never saw a Ron Howard film not worth my time, I recalled. Yet, this film was being choked to death, suffocated like a line of newly caught fish left, high and dry, on the kitchen counter to die. How could that be? Reviewers who trashed Bamboozled hadn't see its value. They declared it had no value. They predicted it would fail and ridiculed people who liked it. They made fun of Lee's vivid characters and demeaned his film-making. Their message was loud and clear: don't waste your time viewing this movie. That puzzled me. Reading the harsh reviews of Bamboozled was the moment when I became aware of the practice of movie assassination. That's how a movie and its director are killed and in the old days, before Netflix, such movies would not draw and an audience and quickly would be removed from theater circulation. Bamboozled was not just ahead of its time, it was truth-telling. Truth-telling in Hillbilly Elegy similarly may explain why most reviewers are bashing this film. Is it a mirror reflecting their own lives? Is it mirroring back to the audience an unwanted view of the self? For instance, Roger Ebert confesses good things about Howard's film, but undercuts his praise of it by declaring that these good things vanish in the haze of the zeitgeist, while at the same time pointing a displeased finger at Howard's film directing. Ebert describes Hillbilly Elegy as hard to appreciate, as being encumbered by cultural baggage, and he seems unable to grasp what I see as the universal appeal of this film. Instead, he restricts the audience he presumes the film is capable of capturing. He reduces its potential audience to a stereotypical 'culture of poverty' frame of reference. As Ebert suggests, you are more likely to connect with this film if you grew up poor, with addiction and domestic abuse, and with other problems typical of that ilk. If you grew up differently, he further implies under the guise of film critique, then this film is way too trashy for you. By now we Americans all should realize that the classist condescension dripping from Ebert's review of Hillbilly Elegy is precisely what got Donald Trump elected - an inability of the liberal, moderate, and progressive privileged classes to recognize value in the underclass experience. This especially is the case when such characters are not sanitized according to bourgeois taste and standards of comportment. As an anthropologist, I saw in Hillbilly Elegy a richly cultural film. It is not just a case of the hill people's cultural specificity. Far more importantly, the story it conveys is about who people become when they collectively are relegated as a class to the bottom of America society where they end up living lives too ignored to enter the national gaze, unless or soft-soaped, also known as whitewashed. The film offers an astute character study. It focuses on what it takes to keep a family together given their various efforts to survive and thrive as persons in their adverse conditions. The characters in Hillbilly Elegy are living oppressed lives but the film does not preach this theme. It lets the characters themselves tell the story through their action which gives rise to and finally resolves the story's central conflict. Who they are and how they are oppressed is expressed in their postures, in their relations, in their vivid language, and in their struggle against the self-hate threatening to consume them given how meanly they view themselves through American eyes. My friend says that the film is good, but as usual, the book does an even better job at contextualizing their story by revealing the history of America's class relations that creates the disparaged community of J. D's family. Their deprivation is not treated directly but is rendered visible when one of them (J.D.) goes to Yale Law school. As a first-generation college-educated African American, I can relate to what happened during J.D.'s Yale Law dinner party experience. It parallels similar experiences of mine during my own education and academic career. As a white man he entered a higher-class world. As a black man, I entered a white elite world. But the experience is nearly the same. The snide degrading remarks; the fake apology; the downward glances assumed by the elite insiders when a capable man of lower-class origins lauds his mother's intelligence and celebrates his family's ability to overcome the downtrodden parameters of his underclass background. Eating with poor white trash is one thing, but eating with one who does not agree to feel shame about his origins is one with whom they cannot connect. The scrutinizing elites had an opportunity they could not resist. J.D. was there to be vetted. His colleagues and mentors seized the moment to affirm their own elite class distinction by engaging in put downs of this aspiring young man who family roots are deeply embedded in Kentucky's Appalachian working class. I won't say much more about the story, but I must say that the acting was brilliant, and the directing, simply masterful. The action was so powerful that my friends and I were clinging to the edge of our seats. We imagined some better-off friends squirming and turning this movie off, and we surmised that if they did, it would reflect their refusal, like Ebert's, to connect with those deemed beneath them, with those in whom it conventionally is presumed no value lies. We thought Howard handled flashbacks elegantly well, far better than in most films we have seen, but Ebert read Howard's time-management technique as jumping, incoherently. Instead of valuing an incredible study of the way that familial love can threaten to entrap and derail a child (J.D. played by Owen Aztalos) unless someone (his grandmother, played by Glenn Close) is brave and strong enough to break the family's downward spiral. She was able to rescue him from the family tragedy by propping him up until he can swim. Yet, Ebert reads J.D., the central character, as constrained by his culture, as if spurring him on, much like mule, to break free from family drama and get on with a mandatory display of rugged American individualism. Film critics like Ebert often rely on the director's use of filmmaking conventions to judge movies. Hence, in sharp contrast to Howard's use of stark realism, Ebert criticizes him for not having resorted either to black comedy or to surrealism in a scene where in her earlier life (when J.D.'s mother was still a girl) his grandmother defends herself from domestic violence by lighting her assailant on fire. Could it be that the desire for such devices serve as a diversion to relieve the reviewers of feeling? I, for one, am glad I felt every raw feeling that this film evoked. I would not want to see that horrific scene treated surrealistically or comedically through black humor. It's not a laughing matter and I do not need the distance of viewing it from a perspective outside of reality. In fact, I would have found it disrespectful of the subject and of the people represented. It would have given the audience an out, allowing it to enjoy the director's approach in a critical moment when the screenwriter is encouraging the audience to take in what is really happening here in America, as if to say: People, this is real! Perhaps most ignored in this film's reviews is the strength of the women who carry the family, including the rageful, broken daughter, when the men can't show up. That pattern of male unavailability is broken when J. D., the central character, shows up to support his family. He applies the lessons learned from his grandmother when contending with his mother Bev's (Amy Adams) brokenness at a most inopportune time. Rather than to tuck his tail and slink into denial, or throw her away in shame, or regard her as a threat to his intimate relationship and potential for success, J.D. pledges to take care of her for the rest of her life, but no more tonight. He has gotten her a place to stay and evades the forced choice of family or career that capitalism so often imposes. He tackles both and wins in honor of the broken souls who raised him and held him up high, above the fray, high enough to succeed at Yale Law and to craft his family's triumphant tale.

I read some of the professional reviews and many are negative and I can't help but think that if this was focused on the inner city the same reviews would be glowing. It has the same feel as Moonlight in the way it is a lot a young boy with a drug addicted mother trying to get out of poverty.

That said, this film did a very nice job at portraying a man struggling to move on from his past while keeping true to who he is (this is a formula - read or seen The Glass Castle? Similar story of a child who grows up in a toxic environment and struggles to pull themselves out of it while still loving the key players in their childhood). So why the critics' poor reviews? I would argue that the critics want to see a film that focuses on an institutional problem (such as the poor in Appalachia) but provides a blanket fix for everyone involved - not just for the one man who told the story (his fix was that his grandmother and teacher helped him see who he could be). The reviews I have read criticized the film for making the assumption that because one white boy was able to climb out of his station, that everyone should be able to. Hence why I titled this review Politics. The memoir goes much deeper into the economic world JD grew up in and provides a lot of statistics and historical accounts that have led to the past and current economic situation. It also discusses a very conservative viewpoint in regard to a solution - one which focuses on people taking responsibility for their actions and supporting themselves, rather than relying on government aid, etc. The film doesn't go into as much detail, but I am sure the critics are aware of JD Vance's political views, and as this is his memoir, I am certain they have a problem with his interpretation of the resolution.The film is not perfect, but it is very good and is definitely worth the watch.

This movie truly captures the individuality and independent mind set of the Appalachian people who are mostly of Scottish descent. I am so glad that this movie is what it is.

He seems detached from his own personal accounts. The heart of the story is his relationship with his Mamaw but it gets constantly interrupted by Beverly's drama which although influential, it doesn't have the same weight in J.D.'s outcome as his relationship with Mamaw.

Starting off with the negatives, it focuses too much on the current day of the movie setting. Vance in his book talked very briefly about his visit home to Ohio to take care of his mother. The movie needed to focus more on his time in the Marines, how before moving in with Mamaw Lindsey pretty much raised him, JD reuniting with his biological father after he thought he abandoned him, and how Papaw was the only real father figure he had. Including more flashbacks that included these key moments in JD's life would have made the movie much better. Now why the critics didn't get it. The movie might have been too smart with the implications it gave the audience. JD is a conservative that provides a different perspective on why the ills of a culture exist. For social constructionists, the movie doesn't make any sense because it doesn't line up with their worldview. JD believes that people get stuck in a cycle of poverty because the culture they grow up in is inherently negative. If JDs mother grew up in a better house and neighborhood and given the proper guidance, she would have been incredibly successful. The book focuses on this much more where the movie hints at it. At what point can you blame her for being a terrible mother? The only way you can get better, to JD, is if you take responsibility for yourself and slowly get better. JD is an exception. The only reason he didn't end up like his mother was because he got lucky in his youth. Of course he worked hard to improve himself, but he happened to have a good enough social network (early on being Lindsey and Mamaw and later Usha) to nudge him in the right direction. The story is not about JD. It's about his mother, who is in the majority, and about how taking personal responsibility is the only way out. The scene that showed when his grandparents moved to Middletown vs it current day is shown when the factories shut down and the jobs left. This is also the area of the country that helped Donald Trump win in 2016. These people are desperate to escape and JD is writing them a letter on how. The government won't save you so the only way is to do it yourself. The movie and book will resonate more with people who understand that struggle and I feel like the critics who don't understand how Trump won will not understand the point of this story either."}, {"id": 443, "text": "So, I only realized the film was based on a true story at the end of the film.

Though myself and others who watched this film with me, all praised the actors within 10 minutes of the film starting.. So this is solely based on your own opinion of what good acting is. I have always been a slightly harsh critic of bad acting and 'B class films' but this films acting had me emotionally invested.As for the political point, not speaking enough on real issues... This is a man's life. HELLO CRITICS, CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THE BACK. Who are we to say that the film lacks the right message? It's based on the life of a man who lived through these very experiences. I read an article speak on Adams acting, She's a banshee.. For all we know this woman could have been exactly like this. Is this Adams fault? Or the real life character?I feel critics are viewing this film as a chance to speak on poverty, political issues etc. This film touches on that and yes the editing can be improved.. but this was someone's life, just as you can't judge the memoir as it was his life, how can you say it lacks the right message?Great film, could have touched more on his time at Yale or atleast how he got there. This film had hours to take us on a journey through someone's incredibly sad, underprivileged life..

It would be easy to dismiss this discrepancy as an example of how stupid the audience is. Only I am one of the 81. I'll just say this. Years ago I sent one of my movie reviews to Pauline Kael. She loved it. Had me up to her Central Park West apartment the very next evening to discuss it with me. Subsequently, we had many long talks about movie after movie. This isn't to brag. It's to establish my legitimacy.Something is very wrong here with the reviewers. That Amy Adams and Glen Close had to defend the movie as a story having nothing to do with politics says it all. Critics have been swept up in the hyperpolitical craziness of our times. It isn't just Trump and the media. The craziness will continue without him. These critics will eventually learn that the media is going to be a sinking ship, people boxed in by their politics so that they see nothing else.

Is it the best thing since sliced bread, no absolutely not. But it is completely watchable.I think it falls down with the script and directing. They just have a strange flow sometimes. Some parts are just really odd for lack of a better work. I can't really explain why it didn't work.I think the score stands out. It fits the tone perfectly. I think it could definitely be nominated.The acting is also great with Glenn Close being the obvious stand out. She does steal every scene that she is in and i think the make up department did a fantastic job making her look like the actual Mawma. Watching the home video clips at the end you would swear that it was actually the same person. I do think they leaned in a bit too heavy into the quippy dialogue with Glenn but that is on the writer not her. It was a little bit too sitcom-y at times but most of the time her scenes were the most impactful.Also Haley Bennett was great too. She wasn't a huge focus but i found my self wanting more of her because she was great to watch. She played the role really grounded and earnest i thought she was really good.Sometimes i found this movie to be a bit manic, it kind of tapers off towards the end but at the start it really is like a lot of screaming matches and like just strange choices. I think it hinders Amy Adams because it tends to be scenes that involve her. The more subdued parts work so much better for me.I think it had a lot of heart and i really appreciated the message, would i ever watch it again? No. But it was perfectly fine."}, {"id": 446, "text": "A decent movie with a great acting performance from both Amy Adams &amp; Glenn Close who I won't be surprised if she gets nominated for an Oscar. But, the film had some mistakes that prevented it from being a great motion picture that would be nominated for Best Picture in the Oscars.For those who don't know the movie is based on a true story and to be specific, it's based on a book called Hillbilly Elegy. The story is so emotional and touching, the film was able to express that perfectly. But the problem is that we didn't get to know much in-depth about the characters except for J.D. Vance (played by Gabriel Basso) and the movie is just showing one side of the family which is the bad and negative side. For instance, Bev (Played by Amy Adams), we only saw one side of her which is the negative, bad mother, and addicted side except for one scene only which I cannot mention so I don't spoil anything. I didn't see much in-depth, I only saw what is from the outside.The movie switches through different timelines, the past &amp; present which was perfect because after each scene there was a scene from the past that explains why this specific thing happened in the present. The film was not causing any confusion and the film editing was perfect. The screenplay was okay, didn't find anything that would make it great, it was decent and normal which might be why the film is not a masterpiece.On the other hand, hair &amp; makeup was perfect in the film. The characters looked exactly like the ones in real life especially Bev (Played by Amy Adams) and Mawmaw (played by Glenn Close).The film is dramatic &amp; emotional and the acting performances made them more dramatic but one thing that kind of ruined a part of it was the music score that was annoying because the same music was playing over and over again throughout the film. I felt like there was one specific music that they used for the whole film.Glenn Close's performance was so genuine and amazing, she was able to impersonate that character very very well that I hope she wins an Oscar for her performance in Hillbilly Elegy. For Amy Adams, she was not the problem at all, her performance was incredible. But her character is the problem. Like I mentioned we didn't get to know much about her character and therefore I was not able to sympathize with her except for one scene, and I blame the writers for that because Amy Adams could do better than that but her character didn't let her so.In the end, the movie is not bad and deserves better than that. But this is a fail attempt for the production company which is Netflix to get this movie to the Oscars, I don't think the movie deserves to be nominated for any awards except Glenn Close's performance. The writers were capable of making this film a masterpiece especially that they had a great story in hand, but the result was a decent, dramatic, and emotional film.My rating is 7/10"}, {"id": 447, "text": "This is not an Everyman movie. It is not meant to be entertaining but it is educational, revealing and truthful about what it's like to deal with poverty, addiction and abusive family dynamics.

Putting judgment and raw emotions aside, in the end, it is about hope, tough love, determination, resourcefulness and survival.So glad I ignored the reviews saying it was a bad movie because the movie itself is not bad. It's very well-done. I think it's just the cringe-worthy character defects that cause many reviewers pan it because maybe they were not expecting such a giant dose of reality showing up - a reality they want no part of and don't want to understand because it scares them.It shows the ugly side of the human condition and it highlights moments when we have an opportunity to make decisions that can be life-altering.

The performances by Glenn Close, Amy Adams were brilliant along with the performances of a superior supporting cast.This is far from the Beverley Hillbillies sitcom mentality nor is it close to the dramatic series of The Waltons. This film gives insight into the often mercurial red state mentality especially the so called Hillbilly or Appalachian culture.Since I come from a decidedly blue state I have often joked about people from that neck of the woods who are decidedly different from me but, truly, they are not just stereotypes and have important psychological rationales as to who they are and why they harbor the values that they do. Things are often not black or white but shades of grey.If we can try to understand cultures different from ourselves perhaps we could gain some new understanding of and insight into our nation getting to that illusive United States of America. As President Obama once said -- We are not the red states of America we are not the blue states of America but we are the United States of America.

Every single one of these characters are people that I have known, and I suspect many others do too, some just don't want to fess up to where their roots are because it contrasts with the facades we create for ourselves as we attempt to paint away our imperfections for our followers. The truth always comes out, and the truth is, none of us are perfect, we all grew up with some level of dysfunction.It's definitely a tough movie to watch; it's not always black and white in terms of protagonists and antagonists. These are complex characters who, even when they're trying to do the right thing have moments of genuine dis-likeability. The fact that you cringe so much at times when watching these people self-destruct is a testament to how good the acting and directing is.The story is soulful, believable, and real. This must have been hugely therapeutic for the author and I applaud him for using this as a medium to just vent about all the crazy stuff he had to deal with growing up. I didn't read the book but certainly will now as I felt like the movie glossed over some of the generational pain that manifested itself.As for this having anything to do with politics, I found nothing political about this movie.

I actually enjoyed the movie quite a bit. The book has been used in the last 4 years as a good conversation piece about the white working class, the political establishment, and how that lead to the rise of Trump and Trump-ism. The story depicts life in a rural white community full of generational, long-term poverty as the main character overcomes crippling obstacles to eventually make it out of the community and prosper at Yale Law School.In the eyes of many, particularly those on the political left who oppose Trumpism, the story ends up humanizing and sympathetically depicting the demographic that makes a large portion of Trump supporters. I tend to think that is a big reason why it is getting such horrific, negative reviews. If you remove the political backdrop, and just view the film as a story about a man who overcomes a brutal situation to achieve great success, it is a well-told film. Amy Adams and Glenn Close are exceptional actresses and they are both good in this film. At the very least, it is worth watching once for their performances."}, {"id": 451, "text": "Mix themes of family, aspiration, grit, determination and you get a moral tale that's as old as time...Those real figures in everyday suburbs of America that are lower-middle class, the forgotten people who generally dont inspire movie producers.A new age of cinema has been born in my opinion, it doesn't have to be a great epic to start something new in Hollywood.It is the stylized biopic of less than hero's who overcome adversary which makes them real to life warriors.Some great heartbreaking sequences of southern life, universal obstacles to overcome and a feel good outcome which lifts people up is just what viewers need in 2020.In filmschool we get taught to torture the girl - create a crescendo of hostility and Ron Howard sure did deliver.The amount of flashbacks was questionable and perhaps took us out of the moment too often but it all works.Casting was good but not perfect, more experience could have made this a classic but the score covered all sins like only Hans Zimmer can.Those critics trying to offer us a political dissertation from the book and movie adaptation need to get over then own biases, few of us care."}, {"id": 452, "text": "Hillbilly elegy was one film I was really excited for only one reason- hans zimmer reuniting with ron howard who made rush whose direction and music helped the film to be a masterpiece. I hoped they would repeat the same magic with hillbilly elegy. I heard the soundtracks of it before watching the film and hans zimmer didn't disappoint at all and made me more excited for the film. Trailer promised it to be an emotional family drama. The film narrates the story of jd, who is a student at yales, doing several part-time jobs to earn money who has to return to his ailing mother suffering from substance abuse and has to leave next day for an important interview for his internship. The film goes back forth, how jd's childhood was affected due to his mother's drug addiction and multiple relationships and how his mamaw comes to rescue his future. Heard all the negative reviews before watching the film which i couldn't understand. They say there is too much yelling. But that might be how some families behave. I don't find any problem with the film. Its very emotional and heart touching. There are so many families suffering due to any of their member's substance abuse and ron Howard captured it brilliantly. Casting was very good Coming to performances, its glenn close as mamaw who steals the show. She was perfect as mamaw. Look at the end credits showing the original family and glenn looks exactly like mamaw. Amy adams was fantastic as the drug addict bev. Gabriel basso was also very good and the child actor also. Both of them look exactly the same. Hans zimmers music suits the film perfectly. Its emotional as well as motivating which is still ringing in my ears. On the whole, hillbilly elegy is a good family drama which you must watch ignoring these so called critics."}, {"id": 453, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This film is based on a memoir of the same title written by J.D. Vance, the man who gives name to the main character or, in better words, the character whose point of view is what the movie describes. As I always do, my preparation for any film means I don't watch trailers nor try to know too much about the story. I knew this movie was based on a supposedly true story or in some sort of book, and I knew that this could very well be an Oscar-bait due to the talented cast and late date of release. That's it. I had no idea about its political background nor Vance's personal statements. I'm from Portugal, so I don't live in a Republicans vs. Democrats or a Red vs. Blue country. Politics is and always will be an extremely irrelevant, depressing, unimpactful topic in my life.I don't live in the USA, so unless the controversies surrounding films are global problems, I couldn't care less about them. To me, Hillbilly Elegy looked like another family melodrama featuring lousy parenting, drug addiction, bullying, discrimination, and all those formulaic plot points developed in this type of movie. Expectations-wise, I couldn't avoid the first (tremendously negative) reactions from fellow critics on social media, so I prepared myself for the worst. However, there's a reason why I wrote this prologue above, explaining my origins and what I consider to be important in my personal life...Not trying to justify other people's opinions (everyone has their own right to love/hate any film for whatever reasons they choose to), but it feels awfully clear to me that a lot of American critics were influenced by the real-life J.D. Vance, his memoir, and what some people interpreted about his point of view. I repeat: everyone is in their own right to hate this movie (it has more than enough reasons to, and I'll get to those), but I find the worst film of the year statement as exaggerated as the movie's overdramatic sequences. My biggest issues with Hillbilly Elegy concern its editing choices and its looping narrative structure, besides its generic developments of known cliches.Starting with the first problem, Ron Howard (Solo: A Star Wars Story) should have managed to create a really great film from the original story. At its best, Hillbilly Elegy could have been a heartbreaking account about the emotional struggles of living in such a violent, problematic family and about trying to escape this harsh lifestyle and reaching a better life overall. However, the constant flashbacks to J.D.'s young life damage the viewer's connection to the character and the rest of his family members, especially his mom, Bev. The non-stop back-and-forward in the timeline breaks the movie's pacing (James D. Wilcox's editing lacks consistency and coherence) and leads me to my next issue.The entire film is a cycle of dramatic scenes quickly escalating to unbelievable actions. From the repetitive drug abuse and consequent relapses to the horrible parenting displayed in the most random of fashions (in one minute everything's fine, in the next one, chaos ensues), Vanessa Taylor couldn't break her screenplay loop, and Ron Howard failed to realize these sequences in a distinguished manner. In addition to all of this, Hillbilly Elegy also does very little to avoid the common formulas regarding this type of narrative, possessing zero surprises throughout the entire runtime, ultimately being entirely predictable practically from the beginning.Nevertheless, as I mentioned before, this is far from being a contender for the worst piece of cinema in 2020. In fact, it might even get some nominations in the awards season, including the Oscars. As usual with real-life stories, their cinematic adaptations always fill the end credits with images or videos of the real people portrayed in the movie. It's easy to notice the impressive work made by the make-up department. Glenn Close looks incredibly similar to the real Mamaw, and her charismatic portrayal is definitely getting her some nominations, at least in other ceremonies besides the main ones. She delivers yet another emotionally compelling performance, packed with powerfully handled dialogues, detailed expressiveness, and a phenomenal physical display.Amy Adams (Justice League) doesn't fall behind. If Glenn Close has chances as a supporting role, Amy Adams might receive a few Best Actress nominations. Her character, Bev, doesn't receive a fair treatment script-wise, but Adams tries her best to compensate for that flaw. Her performance might be considered extremely over-the-top for many viewers, and I do acknowledge some exaggeration in a couple of scenes, but overall, she delivers a superb interpretation. Gabriel Basso is also pretty great as J.D. (as is Owen Asztalos), same for Haley Bennett (The Devil All the Time) as Lindsay. Hans Zimmer and David Fleming's score is sweet, but it doesn't get too many moments to shine.In the end, Hillbilly Elegy suffers from its formulaic narrative stuck in a tiresome loop of overdramatic scenes that escalated incomprehensibly way too fast. The predictable melodrama features questionable editing decisions that hurt the film's pacing and overall story consistency, as well as the viewer's emotional bond with the characters. Ron Howard and Vanessa Taylor fail to depict an interesting premise in a distinctly captivating manner, consequently resorting to the award-worthy performances of Amy Adams and Glenn Close to save the whole movie from total disaster. In addition to the outstanding displays from the two actresses, the remarkable performances from the remaining cast elevate the flawed screenplay, ultimately delivering a few scenes worth hanging on to. Technically, impressively accurate make-up (guaranteed awards buzz) and a lovely score deserve a much better film. I still recommend it to everyone who enjoys melodramatic family stories, but don't expect anything remotely special.Rating: C+"}, {"id": 454, "text": "Such a letdown, this production had everything to be great but we got a movie of the week instead. I don't know if the problem stems from the lack of usable material, or from the editor's experience being limited to the sausage factory that is second rate tv series, but the editing was appalling. No place was allowed for characters to breathe and grow, and for a tale about one's origins, there was an unforgivable backstory deficiency. The little given was stingily spread. Just enough to give us some understanding of the basics, when it called for a generosity that would've undeniably pulled us in, giving us no other choice but to be emotionally engaged. Instead we got an inorganic pace constantly reminding us of our observer status. The whole movie editing alternating between a painful rudimental formula and clumsy attempts to deconstruct the narrative to try to match the main character's internal discourse and memories. The final product is a frustrating mishmash revealing an absence of direction and vision. I'm really curious of what was left on the editing room floor. It's one of those film where you can't help but wonder if there is a gem hiding in there. One which could be revealed if it was cut by someone with talent."}, {"id": 455, "text": "Family's the only thing that means a goddamn. You'll learn that.Before I actually get to the review portion, I think it's crucial to discuss the significance of Hillbilly Elegy. I didn't know anything about it till after watching it. The only thing I knew was it's based on a memoir and that there was a bunch of hype around it. The hype I knew about was for awards and all that. Turns out there's much more to this. Hillbilly Elegy is about the American Dream and is a voice for Appalachian individuals coming from the point of view of J. D. Vance. Well J. D. Vance has some controversy around him. He has different views than others, is very conservative, and made some comments about Appalachians and how they talk about working more than they work. He kind of trashed talked the roots where he came from because he built his way up into society. This focuses on both his childhood and his return back home in 2016. His mother struggled with drug addiction which altered his childhood significantly. J. D. worked hard in school, joined the marines, and graduated from Yale law school. Because of his work ethic it's kind of known that he thinks he's above some of these Appalachians who won't achieve the American Dream. The memoir supposedly discusses themes of the culture of poverty since he grew up in not the greatest conditions. Anyway, that's as much as I know. Some people think this is a great story and some find it offensive. So there was hype for not only awards but for this project in general.Now that we've covered that, this movie throws all that away. Most everyone, whether you follow movies or not, knows about the scathing reviews this received. I understand that. And Rotten Tomatoes goes by either liking it or hating it. Only 28% actually gave this a positive review. What I'm more focused on is the MetaScore review since it's a most accurate score of every critics review. A 40 is still not great but that makes more sense. Hillbilly Elegy is a mess, but it's not as bad as some of the reviews say it is. Everyone has hype around certain movies. This had a lot going for it. First there's the source material. Then the stacked cast including Amy Adams and Glen Close. Venessa Taylor wrote the screen play who previously was nominated for an Oscar for The Shape of Water. And this seemed to be the comeback movie for Ron Howard who hasn't been consistent, well kind of ever. Rush feels like the last good movie he made. This just isn't it. Mainly due to the poor writing. Venessa Taylor has good moments of writing with some dialogue that could win the actors Oscars, but those moments are only once in a while. Most of it is either basic or cringe-worthy. I feel so bad for Amy Adams because of the writing, but I'll get to that later. The storytelling is inconsistent. Jumping back and forth between past and present can be difficult to get a constant full effect. The present 2016 moments have no effect whatsoever. I felt nothing for these characters at this point. The past scenes have more entertainment value and a more interesting story. There's just never a moment of normalcy. Every scene must have something significant happening where a character has to be demonized. A chance to slow down a breathe never really happens. For those excited for the screenplay, this might be one of the worst of the year.Remember when I mentioned Amy Adams earlier, now's the time to tackle the acting. Adams doesn't deserve all the hate she's getting for this role. She's being accused of overacting and giving a terrible performance. But when the only scenes she has are her having a meltdown, flailing around, and just being an overall terrible mother it's hard to get to the route of the character. It's not her fault and I do genuinely think she gave an excellent performance, but her chances of an Oscar nomination are basically gone. Then Glen Close. We all thought this would be the year she finally wins her first Oscar. She's extremely overdue and gives a great performance. This just isn't her best ever. Once again the writing is taking those chances away. Close has a transformative performance and gives her all every minute on screen, but to give an Oscar for this performance wouldn't be appropriate. Mamaw is the one who is there to keep J. D. in line when his mother can't do so. But all she does is say stuff like you need to do better and family is all that matters and I wasn't always a good person but you can be. There's not a moment to slow down with her. Olivia Colman might win the Oscar over her again. It seems unanimous that Owen Asztalos playing younger J. D. has a better performance than Gabriel Basso who plays him in 2016. Older J. D. is just an asshole to me. I hated him almost every minute. He's so cocky and thinks he's the one who is in charge of this family. I was in utter disbelief at the end of the third act with him. A decision is made that I understand is important to him but no decent person would ever do that. What's even worse is he's painted as a saint because he got everything he wants. If this weren't a true story I think everyone would be so mad at how this ends. Younger J. D. on the other hand gives a more genuine performance and is good. The last person that must be mentioned is Haley Bennett. When will she land a role with a movie that will be appreciated? She great in every role and I actually liked her in this, both acting and character. Even with Swallow and The Devil All the Time (both movies I really enjoyed) those movies have not gained the appreciation needed to have her well known. Good performances by most of the ensemble but can't get to their fullest potential with the bad writing.Ron Howard just seems to have lost clear direction. Maybe not his worst movie like most are saying but there's a lack of fluid direction. Right away it comes off as a basic movie. Honestly if the writing was just better I still believe this would still be pretty basic. He can get some emotional scenes down. I did feel bad for the situation and wanted everything to get better. And there are some enjoyable and entertaining moments. I didn't find myself hating this. But it's just a disappointment from the some choices made both in the story and a filmmaking standpoint. For example, the past scenes are all in handheld mainly. I felt motion sick at some points. It's a common technique to get more immersed into the story but it was just too much. Also the fact to neglect the whole voice of poverty and all that doesn't help. This might be more of a writing thing but it's those topics aren't discussed as much as they should. I really can't say I hated this. I wanted to finish the movie unlike the other two people in the theater who left halfway through. Hillbilly Elegy is a mess, but it's not a movie to skip completely. It'll be on Netflix soon so you won't be wasting any money. I for one just wanted to see it in theaters while available to me because I'm pretentious. It's a shame that the final product couldn't live up to the hype. To make it quite simple, this is 2020's The Goldfinch: so much hype around to only time get awful reviews and a disappointment."}, {"id": 456, "text": "This had the feel of a made-for-TV cable family drama, the kind you see on the Hallmark channel, with some cursing thrown in.

Will this be the vehicle for Ms. Close to finally win an Oscar, after 7 nominations?An artistic flourish that distinguishes this from usual cable fare is the constant cross-cutting between past and present, which I found annoying rather than appealing.The critics are skewering this movie, motivated (I suspect) in at least some of them by partisan animus- the memoir upon which it's based is explicitly right-wing, although Ron Howard seems to have leached the overt political content out of it. It remains at heart, however, a Horatio Alger story, where the hero is able to overcome a dysfunctional family background and poverty through hard work and bourgeois values. Bully for him. Whether you're red, blue, or purple, the cardinal sin of this film is that it's just not that compelling or interesting."}, {"id": 457, "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. We don't use that word. That is law school student JD's reaction when someone refers to those like his family as hillbillies. He's understandably defensive, despite his daily navigations between two distinct worlds. Oscar winning director Ron Howard (A BEAUTIFUL MIND, 2001) presents the true story of JD Vance, a young man who earns his way out of his Appalachian background to gain admittance to Yale Law School, only to get dragged back into the life he worked so hard to escape. Vanessa Taylor (Oscar nominated for THE SHAPE OF WATER, 2017) adapted the screenplay from Vance's own memoir.The first thing noticed about this film is that it stars Amy Adams (6) and Glenn Close (7), who between them, have 13 Oscar nominations for acting. That's a pretty distinguished pedigree for a cast. Ms. Adams has been seen recently in the TV mini-series Sharp Objects and as Lynn Cheney in Adam McKay's VICE (2018). Ms. Close was most recently nominated for her performance in THE WIFE (2018). Other notables in the cast include Haley Bennett (excellent in SWALLOW earlier this year), Freida Pinto (SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE), and Gabriel Basso (THE KINGS OF SUMMER, 2013).As the film begins in 1997, we find a young JD (Owen Asztalos) in a tough spot, and we quickly get a feel for the chaos commonplace around his family in Jackson, Kentucky ... and also the bond that comes with being a family in the hills. The obligatory family photo ends the segment. We then skip ahead 14 years as the family has 3 houses on the same street in Middletown, after some of them find a way out of Jackson. In this blue collar town hit hard by a financial downturn, they admit to missing only hope. The story is told from the perspective of an older JD (Basso), who struggles with the emotional turmoil that his mother Bev (Adams) constantly creates. Remarkably, it's Mamaw (Close) who provides the strength and stability in the family, and yet, she always seems one small step from exploding at the universe. There is an odd grounded nature and tough-mindedness to Mamaw that Ms. Close radiates on screen. It's an interesting performance, that some may call over-the-top ... a phrase also likely to be used for Ms. Adams as she displays the desperation of an addict, and the broken spirit of one whose shot at life disappeared early on.For such a stereotypical simple family, the complexities of the story and characters are sometimes difficult to appreciate. JD's sister Lindsay (Bennett) does her best to raise her own family while also managing her mother and grandmother, so that JD can pursue law school. She understands he has possibilities, whereas she has few. And JD's law school girlfriend Usha (Pinto) truly has no concept of his childhood and family. Class differences are on full display not just with Usha, but also at the dinner where JD (a former Marine) is maneuvering to secure a summer internship that keeps him teetering in the balance of moving forward or falling back.It's at this point where JD receives a call from Lindsay informing that mother Bev has overdosed on heroin. It's yet another example of his own mother inadvertently subverting his efforts to make a new life for himself. Addiction, relapse, financial struggles, family abuse, and untold secrets are the pieces that make up JD's family pie. When his old life collides with his new life, will it drag him back down? He periodically faces decisions that are legal and/or morality based, and given his circumstances, it's never as straightforward as it should be.Without the power of Glenn Close and Amy Adams, director Howard likely would have had the film slide into the maudlin mode so common with Hallmark or Lifetime Channel movies, and while it's not the Oscar bait Howard aims for, Netflix has yet another watchable film in their stable. Mr. Howard's decision to bounce back and forth between 1997 and 2011 does provide the history we need to understand JD's dilemma, but the see-saw approach is at times distracting. Home movies provided by JD Vance are shown over the closing credits, and it's here where we realize just how closely Ms. Close physically resembles the real Mamaw. We walk away easily seeing how the circle of this life becomes perpetual, and just how challenging it can be to break free."}, {"id": 458, "text": "Just because some subjects do not deal with themes treated in a certain way, does not mean that the film, taken away from the autobiography, is not valid and well done. Everyone knows Ron Howard for his immense talent, his true or plausible stories, which have enchanted millions and millions of people; Hillbilly Elegy is no exception. Films with a strong, meticulous and not at all listless cast, even if some characters are not a photocopy of the real ones (as they say), there are still characters of interest and that catch. Glenn Close is a love for the eyes and a punch in the stomach for the acting strength he possesses at age 73, meticulous, amazing and brilliant. Amy Adams? More and more convincing, more and more mature, more and more dedicated to her passion and brings to the screen a poignant character, who wants to be more and who struggles in a tough life with no lights. Although, perhaps, as they say, she has not been able to grasp the suffering of the real Bev (something that no one except those who have experienced her can say with some certainty), Amy Adams gives us yet another excellent interpretation of her career. Gabriel Basso could have done more and will certainly do more forward, but he doesn't disappoint too much in representing a young man who not only struggles with himself, but also with the world around him, taking the weight of the world on his shoulder and his world is his family. Finally, in this salad, Ron Howard who, no matter how many mistakes he may have made, manages to bring a story that is powerful and is undeniable. A film is a film, a story is a story, therefore political messages, situations not portrayed accurately, characters distant from the real ones and so on, have nothing to do with a film that if extrapolated from context and taken away from autobiography, it renders like a story written at the table and written with simplicity, without great ambitions. Excellent movie? No, but that it had a certain depth is undeniable."}, {"id": 459, "text": "I was blessed to not have the addiction or poverty challenges in my family &amp; extended family but I had the same journey and the same culture shock going to an elite school from my steel city hometown.

I think Republicans would too. I do not get the problem with it. But I didn't read the book first . Ron Howard finds what unites us all as humans.It is unifying about what happens when poverty and addiction meet life's challenges in AmericaIt is about universal themes of family, loss, struggle , and more.Glen Close and Amy Adams are literally astounding.It takes about 1/2 hour to get in due to a complex storyline but is well worth staying with it."}, {"id": 460, "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.At the end of Hillbilly Elegy (2020) when credits started to roll I kinda felt a small tear in my eye, or maybe it was something else that got there, but I couldn't deny that I liked this movie very much. Performances by Glenn Close &amp; Amy Adams were Oscar material, especially by Glenn Close who after bunch of nominations should win for a best supporting actress for this movie - she was barely recognizable from anything I saw her before - its a powerhouse acting. Also actors who played J.D. Vance at different ages were both great - this is a one superbly acted movie.Overall, Hillbilly Elegy is a really entertaining movie about family. It was solidly directed by a veteran Ron Howard and has good pacing. But its acting that elevates this movie above its material - it has two powerhouse performances of the year. All in all, this is a really involving and entertaining movie."}, {"id": 461, "text": "Okay I'm not gonna even bother reading the reviews after seeing it's 6.7/10 (maybe it shall increase in a month and I hope it does), they're just going to be a lot of hates or whatnot which only going to serve to disturb by love and enjoyment for this film. So I'm just gonna say how much I love this picture.Hillbilly Elegy is about family and I guess a lot of people can relate to the struggles of these characters. At times you feel like all of our characters' psychology are both right and wrong at the same time. That's a generational thing... the young can't see the struggles of the old and the history behind their aggravating psychological build-up; and the old carrying baggages of their past and whilst intimidating in their behaviors and mannerism towards the young, they still have a deeper and well-meaning intent - all they hope is for their successive generations to be better. All of the characters can easily relate to us the audience - the embarrassed son of an eccentric and crazed mother; the loving grandmother who's harsh but cares so abundantly for her grandson. The film also features the beauty of the hill people's sense of community, I don't know if it's a subtle intention by Ron Howard but it suddenly feels like a small tribute to that culture for me. And I guess I'd have a soft-spot for this film because of the grandmother and how much she reminds me of mine... and that hits really close to home.Overall, fantastic work by Ron Howard, another hats-off to you, sir. And oh but of course, Amy Adams and Glenn Close... these ladies are getting two easy tickets to the Oscar next year. They both disappeared completely in their roles and there wasn't one moment where I saw Amy Adams or Glenn Close but only Beverly and Mamaw. Their performances were FANTASTICAL. Makes me want to point and say now that's what I call acting. Both Amy and Glenn have been so overlooked by the Academy for years and hopefully this film and performances do them justice."}, {"id": 462, "text": "I decided to watch the film after reading both the criticism and the response to the criticism from the director, Ron Howard, and actress, Amy Adams. Having grown up in the south with family deriving not far from the Appalachian area, this film was able to visually and emotionally portray the particular generational trauma that gets past down through families living in poverty in the south.It's not always easy to explain how unprocessed trauma or suppressed emotional distress can manifest into a life of addiction and neglecting responsibilities to take care of oneself which spills over to an inability to properly care for the subsequent children.Ron Howard did a wonderful job in showing each characters struggles without making a single person be to blame for the overall distress the family felt. He also did not victim shame any characters for having issues they needed to grow from.It's an inspiring story and should be recognized for delving into such a complex topic in a way that doesn't invalidate any of the characters challenges or how they fight to break the cycle of generational trauma."}, {"id": 463, "text": "J.D. Vance unspools a complicated family history in his memoir and many of the episodes were so over-the-top crazy, it's obvious that there was a bounty of dramatic material. The film deftly weaves together these generational stories, past and present, into a powerful narrative of faith, love, and redemption - with a whole lot of enabling going on as well. In his book, Vance does an in-depth analysis of the history and mentality of the Hill People, his people. He talks about their good qualities (fierce loyalty to family) and their negative characteristics (the violent destruction of their families wrought by bad life choices.) In the film, we see how the plague of early pregnancies, dropping out of school, low expectations, and, especially, substance abuse, undermines the fate of individuals and their communities. And those who spout white privilege sure aren't talking about these folks, who share many of the same problems as inner-city minorities. The film itself is masterfully done, but would we expect less of a Ron Howard production starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams? The rest of the cast is also first-rate. An important American story well-told."}, {"id": 464, "text": "Everything I heard about this film was negative. A dumpster fire, said one film credit. I watched it, so you don't have to, said another. It's a good thing I didn't listen to that nonsense. This Ron Howard film ranks right up there with his best work.I can only surmise that the criticism of the film was political. Author J.D. Vance, who wrote the memoir for which the film is based, is a right-wing media darling. Ron Howard, the director, has made no effort to hide his anti-Trump sentiments. Any attempt to try and tie this film to the political landscape misses the point entirely. This film is a snapshot of one family and their individual struggles, while also touching on other themes such as family, poverty, drug addiction, health insurance, job loss, education, opportunity, and a host of other relevant topics.Having read a few of the negative reviews, I didn't have high hopes. I was looking for caricatures, overacting, and stereotypes. None of those appeared. What I saw instead was a realistic depiction of rural life that is recognizable to millions of people. I didn't see any political viewpoints because the film was not about politics.For every critic who complained about Glen Close's performance, I say watch the end credits where there is home video of the real person she portrayed. The same is true for Amy Adams. Was her performance over the top? Not if you look at it from the viewpoint of a drug-addicted mother who became a parent at the age of eighteen.While all the actors did excellent work, the two actors who portrayed J.D. Vance, Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos, were outstanding. The two performances blended into one.If there were one scene that felt out of place, it would be the scene where Glen Close sets her husband on fire. It was a flashback scene, but there wasn't anything leading up to it that would leave you to believe that the mild-mannered man seen throughout the film was capable of instigating such a response.This is one time where the critics got it wrong."}, {"id": 465, "text": "It was a good film. Pretty standard but good and kind of heartwarming. We had troubled-family movies before also based on the Hillbilly Culture. Its intersting to see a film out of the perspective of a kid growing up with those troubles who seems to be very honest about his memories and created a loveletter to his Grandma who is wonderfully played by Glenn Close who should be your main reason to watch this film, if you need one. She was fantastic. At first you would think she is very cartoonish and plays a stereotype but boy did she grow into this role and developed it so wonderfully that at the end you couldnt get enough of her. A great turn that hopefully brings her Oscar glory at last. Amy Adams was also good but she can do better. It was a fine performance with many good moments but other than with Close's performance you sometimes noticed the acting wheels turning. Still a fine performance after all. Gabriel Basso was okay but beaten by the kid who played the younger version Owen Asztalos. Still not sure wether Haley Bennett is a good actress or not but she was okay. The direction by Ron Howard was nothing special, sometimes there were some weird cuts that didnt make too much sense. Definitely not his best job. In the end though it is very worth to see, mostly for the accting showcases of Amy Adams and especially Glenn Close. A good score, and intersting characters (because real) kept my attention from the beginning to the end."}, {"id": 466, "text": "I read the book in 2016 and I appreciated that it helped me understand people's points of view that I was having a hard time understanding (voting for Trump). I also work at a school where 98% of the students are extremely impoverished, and while not Appalachia, this book helped me to understand some of their thinking, issues, ways of dealing with things in life, that, I think, made me a better, more compassionate, and understanding teacher. I realize that while I know that education is their way out of poverty, for most kids in poverty, survival is their main priority and unfortunately can't always access that education that is so important. When I read that this movie had been made, I saw that people were upset that it was politicizing the people of Appalachia. Unlike the book, there was absolutely NO political undertone in the movie. I also didn't see anything all that stereotypical about the people of Appalachia. This story could be anywhere in the US where people are living in poverty and suffering the negative effects of that situation. One of my favorite parts of the movie was when all of the people saluted Pawpaw's hearse. I thought it showed a real sense of community and respect of the people of Appalachia.

He said she conferred with the family to make sure she got not just the look, but the mannerisms right, right down to the way she held her cigarette.I had read the book a couple of years ago and was very impressed with it but usually am disappointed in film adaptations. Not this time. Sure, it doesn't portray the entire scope of the book, it can't. It would have to be a 10 part series at least to do that. But I thought they chose the focus well to represent the main ideas.

After it finished, I wanted to know more about the real life family so I googled the movie and was shocked to see the awful reviews- some down right nasty and spewing venom. Why the hatred for this family and JD's real life true story? Then one of the articles about the film written here in Australia said apparently it has to do with Trump and JD's political views- his memoir came out right before Trump won the election and these lower income communities from the Appalachian belt were Trump supporters and JD's memoir hit number 1. So,any film reviewer who hates Trump and the republicans purposely gave this movie a terrible review as some kind of vengeance against JD and his people. How childish! Honestly these reviewers should be fired from their jobs! How unprofessional to leave a bad review for a great movie just because you don't like the authors political choices. Rotten tomatoes are mostly left leaning and will always give a bad review for a movie that doesn't follow their woke narrative and agenda. How ridiculous, honestly! I am an Australian and I have no political persuasion so who votes for who is irrelevant to me,I vote independent but I would hate for people like me to miss out on seeing this movie because they read the negative reviews- which after watching this movie, are false and full of lies. Biden won the election recently yet some film reviewers obviously still can't let go of their psychological issues regarding Trump- and they pan this movie as some sort of revenge against his supporters. YOU WON GET OVER YOURSELVES - and maybe get some therapy- the movie was outstanding and Glenn Close deserves an Oscar for her performance.

Glenn Close is the obvious award contender here, but I don't think she has an 'Oscar moment' in the film.As a family drama, the movie does not break any new ground, but it is not incompetent either. Underwhelmingly directed, maybe. But the story is pretty touching for the most part.Had I read the book and known about J.D.

It's not that hard to do, unless the trash is nuanced, which this wasn't. But Glenn Close was memorable. Partially because we rarely see trashy old ladies portrayed in films. But I felt some soulful energy from her.I agree with the others that the kid actor was great. He really looked like he was going through this stuff and processing it along the way without cynicism. Contrary to reviewers, I liked the adult version too. He had that look of burden on him at all times.

Or at least how she was depicted. But if that's how she was in real life, it's not my business. She seemed a bit condescending toward him. Like he was her cute little heartland, working class teddy bear. But ultimately she was very supportive.Look, no one wants to spend two hours watching dysfunctional losers batter each other. I was checking the time clock to see how much more I had to take. Were there potential ways to make this thing less obnoxious? Perhaps.Like showing us an experience he had in the military that helped shape him. Or how he met his girlfriend. Or the way that church, God, or politics affected people. We never heard anything interesting from the grandpa, played by a fine and famous actor Bo Hopkins. Yet it turned out that he was the cause of most of the dysfunction originally.Did he have any remorse? Did he have anything interesting philosophically to add to the scenario?One thing worthy of mention, and this is not a popular concept, is the role of genes in our life story. They did bother to let us know that the druggie mother had been very bright academically, and sure enough, academics were the boy's salvation. But could he have excelled academically without that gene?So maybe it wasn't just the grandma's tough love, or his own perseverance that got him where he got.

As for the movie, my own family is stacked on both sides with substance abuse and mental health problems, seemingly common in Appalachia, sprinkled with suicides completed and suicides attempted. the movie, I thought, was somewhat over-dramatized, as the people I knew and know are somewhat reticent to fight LOUDLY in public or to have the law called on them.

Amy Adams was good, but really Close was so believable, so real. I can not imagine someone could ever be better. She should be extremely pleased with her work. The younger JD is really far more important in this movie as far as acting goes. The younger JD did well and I think we will see more of him in the future. The elder JD was OK.Ron Howard could be considered for a directing award, but the dark depressing subject matter may hold him back. Maybe not.

In a certain sense, I get it: the film could very easily be described as Oscar bait, yet the writing/screenplay does not live up to that designation (or even come close, in all honesty). But, if one can get past that contradiction and sort of look at the fringes of Hillbilly Elegy, you'll find a perfectly solid, well-acted family drama.For a very basic overview, this movie sees J.D. Vance (Gabriel Brasso), who is trying to break into Ivy League educational tracts, called back to his childhood hometown by sister Lindsay (Haley Bennett) when their mother Bev (Amy Adams) overdoses on heroin. While traveling back to Ohio, a series of flashbacks fleshes out the story of Young J.D. (Owen Asztalos) and how the family came to be how it is.Right off the bat, the immediate glaring weakness of Hillbilly Elegy is that the narrative really lays it on thick. It features none of the nuanced subtly that define truly great films. This is a bit odd considering that director Ron Howard usually delivers better overall products, so I'll lay the fault at the feet of the screenplay. Perhaps, being based on J.D. Vance's memoir, the writers were loathe to venture too far from the source material. Either way, there are times when the story plays out like something you would see on a made-for-TV movie.Yet, those narrative failings do not in any way completely torpedo the rest of the viewing experience. The fact that the story is indeed based on true events actually helps the proceedings in certain truth is stranger than fiction ways, and when the credits roll to comparison photos/videos of the real-life actor counterparts, you'll likely be amazed how close the characterizations really are.The acting here is also top-notch. The next bad performance out of Adams would be her first, so no problems there. Who really steals the show, however, is Glenn Close as Mamaw, a matriarchal family figure. This is truly an award-winning performance and provides much of the legitimate emotion in a film that can be a bit over-the-top in that department. I'll remember Close's performance here for quite some time.Overall, Hillbilly Elegy isn't going to be the darling that perhaps it was presented as. It simply isn't punching up to that weight class, so to speak. But if you can look at it with an eye towards acting and a realization that it is based on someone's life events, much enjoyment can be found."}, {"id": 474, "text": "Those bad reviewers were probably one of those people who think this movie is about inbred people living trailer park, and/or those indoctrinated who think white people do not struggle and stuff like this.Base on where I came from, I must say this movie is accurately brilliant!

Unfortunately, much as one can sympathise with J.D.

Enters Mamaw, who takes in J.D. in, before he gets completely ruined by Bev and from there, it is more or less plain sailing.Except it isn't because the story is told in flashbacks so that we have a constant stream of Bev's hysterics about everything. Therefore, the annoying flashbacks and the insufferable Bev make the movie a stressful experience rather than an elegiac one.However, Close and Adams do a good job, though Adams is really OTT with her manic portrait of the emotionally unstable Bev. Finally even if being European, I cannot relate to the social background, I know about family issues but unfortunately these were melodramatically overdone."}, {"id": 476, "text": "I want to start with a key scene in the beginning of Hillbilly Elegy when J.D. Vance (Gabriel Basso), a brilliant Yale student and aspiring intern in a prestigious law firm, doesn't hesitate to undermine his chances by rebuking a man's use of the redneck word. It's important to know that he's got ambitions but pride too, and we know we follow the story from the perspective of a young man whose values are still rooted in his Appalachian upbringing, values that don't contradict the American Dream ideals.Sure J.D. would never go as far as idealizing his tumultuous childhood but he knows he owes his success to the one one sacred value in Middletown, Ohio: family. Maybe his mother Bev (Amy Adams) didn't majestically embody these values but Mamaw, the family matriarch and pillar played by Glenn Close, sure the hell did. The poster shows the two women that made Vance's life, two women who seem to belong to the same rotten world but only one had the strength to elevate J.D. above it, that the memoir could have been written and become a best-seller is Mamaw's posthumous achievement.Now ever since its release, Hillbilly Elegy received such a harsh backlash that it seemed to have soiled its credibility as an Oscar contender but it also made viewers curious to see what's so bad about it... and speaking for myself, I realized that the film didn't deserve such criticism. I'm not American, I didn't read the original memoir (as a matter of fact, I never heard about it till now), but understanding the context before the content made me fear that the judgment toward the film would be clouded by political considerations. After watching Ron Howard's adaptation, I felt it was so devoid of politics that I don't think it should ever interfere with our appreciation. While not perfect, it's a rather well-made family drama with flaws that never undermine its genuine poignancy. For all the chaos surrounding Bev's life, the film is surprisingly serene.Speaking of Bev, another accusation was of Oscar baiting; fair enough, turning America's sweetheart Amy Adams into a lite version of the trailer-trash mother from Million Dollar Baby and having Glenn Close posturing as a grandmother who's the living antithesis of her glamorous and charismatic persona can pass as baits. But isn't that the stuff Meryl Streep has always been doing in movies that are mostly remembered for having earned her an umpteenth nomination? All of a sudden, critics seem to discover that this thing exists and decides to trash that movie that is no less guilty than any other to raise the attention of the Academy.In all fairness, the only bit of Oscar baiting and perhaps the most glaring weakness of the film is that Amy Adams seems to only exist in a pattern of scenes that start well and end on an incident, as to make a statement of the dangerous corners some well-meaning mothers can be driven to (violence, drug abuse etc.) or just to show how affecting hardship can be. Whenever she's on the screen, she either cries, shouts or does stupid things to the point that she inspires more pity and shame than true compassion. I think her character needed quieter moments like one she had with her son at the end when he talks about his supportive girlfriend Usha (Freida Pinto) or one flashback to show how that 'brilliant' woman started to screw up everything.I doubt the film does a great service to Adams by forcing her to go hysterical all the time and I think that damaged her Oscar chances. Now I might be in a minority but I think Glenn Close is a lock for a Best Supporting Actress nomination. And you know what? It would be a deserved nomination and maybe win. It's true the metamorphosis is so astounding it's literally a transformation but once you see the real pictures of Mamaw, you realize that this wasn't caricature. Besides, Close is used parsimoniously at key moments where she's shown as a a strong and caring grandmother and a true endearing character.Mamaw always had the conviction that this social rot was something that destroyed the soul of the South and if she could even succeed with J.D. in what she failed with Bev, her life would have meant something. J.D. is the hope of the family and Mamaw, as painful as it was to take him off his mother, did the right thing. Close plays the kind of mentor characters that earned Mahershala Ali his Oscar with the colorfulness of Meryl Streep in August Osage County, if the Academy is consistent in its picks and still acknowledge talent, it should nominate her.Hillbilly Elegy does a serious job in showing how the reputation of the bluegrass states can be understood but how unfair and dated are all these rednecks and deliverance clich\u00e9s, it does so by avoiding a political stance \u00e0 la Spike Lee and taking one specific example of a brilliant man who didn't forget his roots. And Basso delivers a performance not as showy and spectacular as Close and Adams but that's the point: this is a man who lived as an observer and in a state of passive acceptance until he was at an inch of falling and his grandmother could save him like T-800 with John Connors. Even as his young counterpart (Owen Asztalos), J.D. is a decent and well-meaning boy who knows good from bad. The appreciation of the film relies a lot on his rock-solid decency of that young man, and his sister (Haley Bennet) who also did well despite the circumstances.The editing is uneven and there might be one or two flashbacks too many or maybe a true confrontation between Mamaw and Bev was lacking but if the film is a critical flop, narratively (and emotionally, too) it works."}, {"id": 477, "text": "I had read a little about the story and had some interest in the author . I also came from a poor background and went to an Ivy league school. I tried to read the book, but in an early scene it had a little kid chewed out by an adult pharmacist , and the parents come to the rescue. They tell off the adult for correcting the kid. Classic revisionist history. I lived thru the 60s, and the world was for the adults. If kids got an adult mad , they got it twice as bad from their parents when they got home. Maybe there were examples of the adult sticking up for the kids, but I never saw it. In the film JD is at a dinner attended by law firm partners where he is applying to work. When one of the men uses the term Redneck he chews him a new one. Totally embarrassing the man for using the term , telling him how smart his mother is and grinding his nose in using a funny joke term. Not something you would do if you wanted the job. I saw Trump do the same thing on The Apprentice . A contestant use the term white trash and trump fired him, even though the guy said he himself was white trash. I wonder if JD knows how much like he is Like Trump? they are both wealthy businessmen , neither who has ever gotten their hands dirty. And yes, rednecks and white trash do in fact joke around using those terms, since they are so ill defined and nebulous that nobody is purely or even mostly either of those two. In other words, those terms are often not used seriously. Everybody knows that not all smart people are educated, only dumb educated people think that. I think Trump and JD are the same. They both want to embarrass and disarm people by using our changing lexicon . gotcha !. They use new and changing boundaries , its power. They feel they have more power if they call someone out for using an out of date term, or one they feel is out of date. The hypersensitivity isn't doing us any good. JD Vance is reportedly a venture capitalist. They are supposed to bring some technical or managerial expertise to companies, and maybe he did. But as far as I know he never saw a patient, built a house, mined any minerals, or did any in the trenches work that the people who suffered that he depicts did. He had a rough childhood, and his mother had an addiction problem. He could have gone to medical school and helped addicts instead of Yale Law and becoming a big investor , which generally gets as much work out of the rank and file paying them as little as possible to bonus themselves the majority of the take. Is't that the American dream? to become a wealthy investor and have others do the back breaking work? You can bonus the profits and claim you are laying people off for the shareholders, the perfect scam."}, {"id": 478, "text": "This movie truly sits right at the center: it's simply unextraordinary in any way. The screenplay, characters, and basic direction is straightforward and down the middle: there are no surprises, little that's especially creative or unique. In and of itself, this isn't necessarily a bad thing when telling a story: some stories are just honest portrayals of life, and life is incredibly straightforward. Unfortunately, this doesn't strike as a particularly unblinking look at the hard lives of a family from a hard place, either. Some of the situations and characters ring false and some of the acting is far too heavy-handed to feel like reality. It just feels a bit lifeless, if not specifically dull. That would be a clever Hemmingway-kind of device to comment on the banality of this world, but it obviously wants to rise above it; it just can't.If you're not expecting much and you're not looking too closely at the strings, it's (I hesitate to say enjoyable) very serviceable, but if you expect more from such lauded figures of the movie business, it's not here."}, {"id": 479, "text": "Beautifully told, relatable, but a tad too melodramatic; Hillbilly Elegy is good but never does justice to its source material.In this drama based on the bestselling memoir, a law student is forced to return to his hometown after a family emergency.Director Ron Howard does a fine job at telling an American story with poise and dignity, but the what's holding Hillbilly Elegy down is its weak script. Thankfully the cast is top notch; Amy Adams is terrific and Glenn Close delivers a fiery and fierce performance. The true stars of this drama are Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos, who really embody J.D. Vance. I don't think the film deserves the negative feedback it's been getting. It's not the great film it should be but overall, Hillbilly Elegy can still make you feel some sort of way.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!"}, {"id": 480, "text": "The negative reviews from critics are interesting, however not surprising. There is a part of America that is the lower class hillbilly and/or white trash that is overlooked. In no way do I want to undermine minorities by saying that. As a white upper middle-class person I think most white middle-class people think of poor people as non-white people. However, since I did not grow up with money, I know that's not true. I've also been to Appalachia on a work project when I was a teenager with my church because I grew up in Ohio (actually close to where the author lived) and I've been to the area of Kentucky that he references, which is extremely poor white. I have seen the poverty these people live in.The reviews are clearly made by people who have never experienced real life. While I have not read the book, I still acknowledge that this is someone's real life experience. Whether or not some critic wants to interpret it as someone's desire to create a new and perfect life for themselves, this was his real life experience. It's awesome that this critic was able to experience the perfect family environment and never have any kind of real trauma in his or her life, but the person who lived this was not so lucky. To critique a memoir, which is someone's interpretation of their real life experience (which is also them coming to terms with the things they've experienced and is also a form of therapy) and rate it poorly because they couldn't connect with it is, to put it frankly, low. (That was the strongest term I was allowed to use.) Good for you. Your life was awesome. If you can't connect with somebody who had a real struggle you shouldn't be a movie critic.I found this movie to be very raw and moving and emotional. Was it probably 100% accurate? No. It's a memoir. It's based on somebody's interpretation of their life. I do not see my parents or grandparents exactly how they actually are/were, because I'm only seeing them through my eyes. That's life. This is through the author's eyes, and that's what should be absorbed. I'm sure my parents will interpret their actions extremely differently than I do. This, like all memoirs, is subjective. It's about our interpretation. It's also about healing and coming to terms with your life. If someone else does not get that, that's on them. We should all have a chance to heal."}, {"id": 481, "text": "I honestly do not understand why so many critics hate this movie?!This is a fantastic movie about overcoming struggle, overcoming adversity, dealing with and eventually overcoming addiction, fighting for the people you love, tough love, letting people in when they are willing to help you and creating your own path.Ron Howard's use of flashbacks and flashforwards to complete J. D. Vance's timeline worked perfectly and never felt confusing or out of place. I cannot give enough praise to Glenn Close, Amy Adams, Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos - they all have incredible chemistry on screen, they gave amazing performances and really bought the real people of this story to life.This is an emotional, heartbreaking, honest movie and it is one of the best movies I've watched in a long time."}, {"id": 482, "text": "I need to say that I understand the bad reviews, and it's true that is definitely not for everyone and at times can be a little bit over the top.

The cinematography really worked for me, I liked the color contrast between both time periods. Performances were so devastatingly real and powerful, Gabriel Basso, Amy Adams and Glenn Close were perfect. Especially Close and Adams, both bringing so much depth and humanity to their characters and becoming them in an incredible way. The relationships that are formed through the script felt so important and part of my own life, I connected with every emotion and moment they proposed. A heartwarming story about overcoming, the impact that our situations and memories have in our life and the determination to become something it seemed impossible you could be. Deep, powerful and phenomenal. Definitely one of Ron Howard's best and with some of the best performances from Adams and Close. Hoping to see more from Gabriel Basso.

Still, give it a shot, you might take out of it as much as I did from this amazing film."}, {"id": 483, "text": "The story of the film is divided into two main lines, a line of events in the present and a line in the past, events move in the two lines alternately, this gave a sweet opportunity for creativity in Editing and it was very good and is considered one of the most powerful aspects of the film This also making the events move quickly and rarely gets boringThe screenplay of the film was also good and benefited from the fact that the story is very rich and have many dramatic aspects, and the film succeeded in making us very sympathetic to many of the characters through strong well-written scenes, Those scenes contain very imaginative ideas about all aspects of the life, here lies the strength the movie is about life, with its punishments and responsibilities on one side, and its sweet moments on the other side. Frankly, we don't have movies that combines all this, recently , even though in the past 2 decades films of this quality were produced every yearUnfortunately, the film's script fell into a big mistake, which is failing to explore all the characters in sufficient depth, meaning that it is satisfied with only analyzing the main character. The rest of the characters which were richer and more complex, were dealt with superficially. The movie failed to highlight the important moments that shaped the characters, and I am here. I'm talking specifically about 2 characters.... the mother and the grandmotherThe second problem in the movie is in directing. personally, I am not a fan of the director (Ron Howard), and I always saw that his style is sluggishn and lazy, but he is a great director and many of those who worked with him said that he is amazing, this may be for reasons other than those that appears on the screen, but for me, he's not among the best ... even though he made excellent movies like (Rush) and (A Beautiful Mind). In the movie Hillbilly Elegy, Ron Howard made a very big mistake when he neglected the most important scenes in the formation of the characters, scenes like the very difficult experiences that the character went through in the past, which are the only explanation for the dark aspects of our characters. These scenes were very few and neglected, and the rest of the film was delightfully shouted, It feels more to you that it is a fun family movie, although the story is very dark and does not suit the way it appeared in the end, This confused me while I was watching, and I thought that his understanding of the script is questionableThe Acting remain the strongest aspect of the film (Amy Adams) who always nominated for the Oscar, but unfortunately she never wins, she gave a wonderful performance as usual, and her character was difficult and full of contradictions, many times those of contradictions happens to be in the same scene, meaning she may remains nice and smiley at the beginning of the scene and after less than a minute she explodes like a volcano, Of course it was not easy, but Amy Adams succeeded in this challenge, and I think she would be nominated for the Oscar if the film is in the academy's considerations. (Glenn Close) also gave an amazing performance She is one of the very talented actresses, and you always feel that she performs without effortIn the end, the movie is definitely worth watching, I recommend it to you all because it suits all tastes We can say that the films like that reminds us of the basics of cinema and its backbone, which is simply a good story and a good actor. If you have thies two your movie will come out well, but if they are absent, the rest of the elements cannot compensate them"}, {"id": 484, "text": "With due respect to the performances from Adams and especially Close, this story has been told a million times in a million settings - make it a million and one. Author J.D. Vance's portrayal of Appalachia as a hotbed of lazy hillbillies who could escape their everyday hell if only they tried a little harder, like the bootstrap-pulling protagonist, completely ignores the systems and circumstances that have made this region ground zero for the opioid epidemic.Alonso Duralde from The Wrap sums it up best, Hillbilly Elegy isn't interested in the systems that create poverty and addiction and ignorance; it just wants to pretend that one straight white guy's ability to rise above his surroundings means that there's no excuse for everyone else not to have done so as well.It says nothing of the proud people that remain in these communities and persevere, what they're up against, how it got to this point in the first place, what could or should be done, etc. Instead we get (ironically) a lazy, shallow and self-serving retread with nothing meaningful to say."}, {"id": 485, "text": "As plots go, this one is quite simple - the story hones in on a couple days when JD is making a last ditch effort to land a summer internship during his time at Yale, when he learns his mother has had a relapse on heroin. JD is faced with a choice that seems a catch-22 - does he abandon his mom and sister to follow-up on a limited opportunity at a firm, and thus escape the impoverished fate of his family, or throw away everything he has worked so hard for to try once again to help a helpless mother?Because the actual current events play out quickly over a short period of time, the bulk of the movie is flashbacks in which we learn what makes JD, JD. Unfortunately, the unproven younger JD is soft, not too smart, and not terribly exceptional as far as characters go. And the JD that is developing in the present is one we barely get to know, certainly not enough to start rooting for him. The connecting piece - how JD goes from squirrely teen to responsible adult - is missing.The production value is earnest, with the actors and writers fleshing out all there seems to be to make the best movie possible from what they were given. By that measurement, it's a great success: a story of the complicated feelings for family members that are both loving and terribly broken, a coming of age story in which a boy with no purpose in life finds his purpose and takes on the world.But it falls short because the story is just not that interesting, despite its careful treatment. For some priviledged viewers, the contrast between JD's life and their own may be significant. However, in entertainment, we want an exceptional story, not one that could be told about millions of Americans if they only had Ron Howard to tell it.As a book, Hillbilly Elegy was significant not because JD's background was so fascinating, but because of his ability to analyze his experience and place it in the context of an often misunderstood populace in America. But without that analysis, JD's story is not that compelling. It is a story not of THE struggle out of poverty, but A struggle, and not the most interesting one. The movie works up to its culmination with a montage of JD learning to take out the trash, respect his mamaw, and figure out algebra. If these are the sole characteristics that got him into Yale, I am not impressed.The movie is warm hearted and does not deserve the malignment it has received from many reviews in the press. But not every book makes a good movie. Hillbilly Elegy the book was social commentary, not entertainment, and should have stayed as such."}, {"id": 486, "text": "The thing about Ron Howard is that he likes to take people by the hand too much, leading them all the way through the rollercoster instead of just put them on the rail so they can enjoy it by themselves. A family drama like this one, so much layered by problems and traumas of at least 3 generations could've been so much better if the director had chosen a less obvious path, which should have been a more honest one, and not driven entirely by drama formulas like Howard is so used to for so many decades. Screenplay by Vanessa Taylor doesn't help either. The overuse of flashbacks throughout the story to homeopathically reveal important matters for no other reason than tie audience thru its never ending 120 minutes is also what makes this movie never works as it could.What does make this movie enjoyable is the acting and make up. Owen Asztalos is magnificent as young J.D. I'm a huge fan of both Amy Adams and Glenn Close's work, what a great partnership. Although Amy's character is so lost in the writing that feels like she was cast for it only because she's so talented that no bad writing can stop her from raising so low bars. Screenplay wastes most of its time trying to justify all the time every action and reaction of the characters instead of developing a coherent arc that could make us understand more clearly the reasons that made that family trully dissolve. Screenplay makes Bev takes most of the responsibility on her back, which obviosly is not. All the answers are thrown randomly and in the end feels like nothing makes much sense at all. Howard never puts audience into the emotional journey of reconnection efficiently, and all the efforts feels meaningless.There's a moment when Mamaw is watching a 90s movie, drinking soda and eating mints. Every single brand is precisely turned to the cameras to make people understand that the story is set at that specific time, and entire direction and production is like that. So didactic that hurts.When Owen is in the car, at the phone with Usha, which was one of the few most interesting moments I could find during entire movie, I couldn't stop thinking that the movie should have started from there, and entire story being revealed during this phone talk while he travels."}, {"id": 487, "text": "I expected a lot from the book, and was somewhat but not totally disappointed. I wasn't totally disappointed by this either. There are some hard lessons learned by the main character, young JD, who ends up being the most sympathetic in the film, closely followed by his sister Lindsay, well-played by Haley Bennet. In many ways she is the most relatable and real character, the steadfast older sister who has to bear the brunt of her mother's chaos but also manages to escape it in the form of what is sorely lacking for the older Vances.......a stable relationship.This movie tries to have a structure, but it's really just a framework and that ends up being flimsy. Pacing, narrative, structure, character development, motivation, overarching themes, all suffer at the hands of a rather TV-Movie-Ish treatment. And no, I don't mean Netflix Film....I mean TV Movie. It feel rushed and slow at the same time. Amy Adams' wild behavior swings as Bev, the mother, are exhausting and ill-explained. I know from reading the book that they are based in truth, and that in fact it was much worse in many ways than as depicted here. If you are going to make her semi-monstrous, then just go for it. I almost got the sense that Vance, as a co-producer, asked them to dial back on their portrayal of his mother, given that she is now six years sober. And that's admirable, but it leaves me not quite knowing how to feel about her character.The acting is good. When it appears to be less than good, I honestly fault the directing. Ron Howard is a good director, but not for this movie. At least not now. He seems unsure of what he is trying to achieve. He tends towards the wholesome, but there is nothing wholesome about what is happening here. That Vance managed to pull himself out of his situation, succeed professionally and personally, is an anomaly. And that's fine, but it doesn't feel quite earned enough at the end. We don't know who the protagonist is. Is it the family? After all, it's All that's worth a God damn. Maybe, but that is not conveyed clearly enough.As a former law student and lawyer myself, I found at least one thing odd. Vance is a student at Yale Law, one of the top three law schools in the country. Yet it appears that he might not be desirable as a summer intern because.....he is not on the Law Journal and doesn't know which fork to use? Utterly unrealistic. You don't have to be on the Journal or Law Review to get a summer clerkship if you go to freaking Yale Law School. And the fact that he is a former Marine from a state school would not have been a strike against him. When he tells the people at the dinner he attends that he was in Iraq, no one seems impressed or thanks him for his service. Sorry, but not even lawyers from top firms are that snobby and out of touch. It's a pretty minor quibble I guess but since this movie is about culture and fish out of water stuff, they could at least get it right."}, {"id": 488, "text": "Hillbilly Elegy is a film that actually has everything to offer.

Vance are necessary, in order to understand the core story of the actual plot in the present better. Their constant repetition and lack of chronology can be very confusing and at times exhausting. The story itself is very simple and the movie is much more about the dynamics within the family. The great emotional touch, which in reality is only felt while the credits roll in the end, with photos from real life, is, however, missing. Unfortunately, the performance of our male lead actor is not tangible enough for this. If you can say something positive about Hillbilly Elegy, Adams and Close's performances immediately stand out. They prevent the film from becoming a total flop and both can hope for nominations at award ceremonies with their performances.But that is the main problem of this film: it's oscar bait.

Hopefully this film captures the raw and uncompromising reality of the white working class that the memoir captured so beautifully. Congratulations to J. D. Vance, you have truly come far.Pros: 1. Haley Bennett (Lindsay), Amy Adams (Bev), Glenn Close (Mamaw) and Gabriel Basso (J.D. Vance) all give fantastic performances. 2. The score not only blends in with the hillbilly background, but it also foments the tender and intimate moments. 3. There is electric chemistry onscreen, particularly between Gabriel Basso and Amy Adams, as well as Glenn Close and Owen Asztalos (Young J.D. Vance). 4. The scaled-back cinematography helps to give the film a raw and honest overlook of the events.Cons: 1. Some of the editing is far too corny with needless slow-motion and numerous cuts, which are more annoying than emotional. 2. The pacing is way off with events just sliding by with no proper focus on them, and other events quickly brought and then forgotten about. It seems like Ron Howard (Director) had a checklist of things to include in 2 hours and was simply ticking them off. 3. Pointless melodrama, that wasn't in the memoir, is inserted and it feels cheap, cheesy, in addition to being a lazy way to force emotion. For example, J.D. Vance never goes off on the interviewer for saying the word redneck, in fact, none of his interviewers mention that word. 4. The non-linear story-telling doesn't work as it shows J.D. Vance at Yale Law School before the entirety of his childhood. The reason why J.D. Vance reaching Yale Law School is so impactful in the memoir is because you journey with him through his highs-and-lows. Moreover, there doesn't seem to be any coherence in the way the story is stitched together. 5.

The best bit is when he takes control of his young life, understanding that taking personal responsibility can get you far. While intelligence runs very high in this particular hillbilly family, their lives get wrecked time and time again. Managing emotions is tough in the part of the USA deplored by the so-called elite, though there is no politicizing in this authentic tale - just a real life empowering story of how you always have a chance to overcome your inner demons, but you have to try and slay the dragon, no-one is going to do it for you, though a family is a great if sometimes thorny resource. Help is certainly not gonna come from class to which the smug hypocrite critics belong, they know that full well and they deplore the movie all the more for it - and the people it tells the story about. But one can certainly give extra points to the perfectly decent movie (and quite above average for a Netflix production) - and this movie does not pretend to be more than it is, a retelling of an authentic, inspiring story about real problems and how they can be conquered - to counter the horrible, despicable critic panning."}, {"id": 491, "text": "The reason for my headline is because I have literally seen every single critic review this movie and not seem to pay attention to what is truly going on and what the director is trying to portray.

I also think that the critics got it wrong that JD thought he was better than his family all the time. In his childhood of course you are going to say those remarks, you're still a kid but when he grows older you see the evolution of how he deals with his mother, though slow, it's a lot to go through. Having had my own trouble with my parents I get not wanting to go back, especially when someone is that bad to be around, but at the end of the day you have realize you just have to let go.

The performances themselves, however, are much more fulfilling. Amy Adams is superb as the addict mother whose son is heading down similarly disruptive tram lines before the intervention of his feisty grandmother Glenn Close. Based on a true story, it relates the not insubstantial trials faced by the family as their dysfunctional unit tries to make some headway against seemingly insurmountable odds. Close is so unlike anything I have ever seen her in before: dowdy, strong, angry, flawed - but determined that despite himself (and his mother) her grandson J.D. (played well as a child by Owen Asztalos; less impactfully as an adult by Gabriel Basso) is going to try to make something of himself. The interweaving chronology of the narrative makes this a bit more interesting too, as they all have their demons to face down. Taken in isolation, the story is just a bit so what - but for once the dramatisation and screenplay give the talent plenty to work with and grim as it it, at times, it has engenders some feeling of redemption that helps it be a bit more than the sum of it's parts."}, {"id": 493, "text": "Yeaaaah I dunno.

Pretty good and that stands for the music and the cinematography too. But Amy Adams' character ruined this film for me. I tried so hard, but it was impossible for me to connect with her and feel for her. It's not Amy Adams' fault, even though she steers towards overacting a bit in this case. It's the character. A person that's so pathetic and terrible, a terrible human being, so selfish, always blaming the others, so undeserving of having a film focused around her.I haven't read the book and I don't care about it. I don't know what's actually real and what's not. This is about the film. JD Vance and Glenn Close's character should have been the main focal points of the film. I understand that Howard tries to make them the emotional anchors of the movie, but unfortunately, I couldn't feel that, at least not until it was too late. Most of the times the film's actually just sad, brutal for no reason and pretentious and it feels like an Oscar bait that's probably gonna end up being an Oscar flop. In the end, this is such a controversial movie that could and should have been better in my opinion. I never had fun watching it, I never really felt engaged even though I tried, but I also think you should watch it and judge for yourselves.PS. Just an update because I saw some comments that really made me mad. I'm actually happy that people liked this film, 'cause well, it's always better liking something than not liking it! When you like something, you're a winner! But liking or hating something, doesn't have to be political all the time. And yeah you can criticize a script based on a true story because, guess what? This isn't a documentary Sherlock, it's a movie script! And thinking that if you criticize something you don't like has anything to do with your life and attacking people this way, whether they liked something or not actually, is at least a sign of having no manners and also totally naive and presumptuous. Just enjoy the movies people or not enjoy them, both are ok, there's no need sharing your repressed anger..."}, {"id": 496, "text": "I haven't read venture capitalist J.D. Vance's memoir, and I have no plans to. I'm surprised to read others describe it as a political text, though, in light of having just seen this adaptation of Hillbilly Elegy, which is such a vacuous picture that it's hard to believe there was ever any sort of substantiated ideology there. I guess there may be slight moments leftover, such as Glenn Close yelling the quotation in the headline above about responsibility, and that's something Close's character finally does after her grandson is corrupted by unemployed youth. There's also that CGI factory that disappears in the Rust Belt landscape. Seems quite bare, though, as does the supposed representation of Appalachian and Middle-American culture, or the American Dream stuff. J.D.'s turnaround from rebellious youth to diligent student is even reduced to a montage. The voiceover narration and timeline jumping hardly helps. If it was more of this sort of banal socio-economic and political banter mixed with an opioid PSA that made the book a bestseller, I'll continue to feel confident in my decision to read something else.As far as the movie goes, I choose to read Close's aforementioned line reading as a call for someone competent to take over this movie and do something interesting with it already. Ron Howard directed Apollo 13 (1995) and maybe a couple other half-decent pictures, but much of the junk he directs screams hack. At least, this one is less mawkish than some of the rest of his oeuvre, but nothing particularly interesting happens nonetheless. I only saw it because it stars Amy Adams and Glenn Close. I can't think of Adams ever being less appealing, and that has nothing to do with her appropriately assuming a more down-to-earth look for the role. Everything she does here is simply based on movement, from the start with the shaky camera following her strides, to that nightmare car ride with her son, the roller skating through the hospital, and that spectacle in the street. It's a waste of talent.Close eventually takes control of the thing. It seemed inevitable what with an actress of her stature hanging in the background for most of the picture. She steals the show with the tough-love, chain-smoking granny act, ripping her IV out, to walk out of the hospital and go adopt her grandson. Never mind, I guess, that her flashback and assuming narration of the picture is entirely inconsistent with a movie otherwise from the perspective of J.D., not to mention the mystery of why she was sick in the first place and seemingly managed to be cured by will power alone. J.D.'s voiceover narration and the drama of whether he'll make it to a job interview in time after finding a room for his drug-addicted mother or whether he'll make nice with his girlfriend is such a trite drama, though, that I'll take what I can get from a great actress at least pulling off a solid superficial characterization. Of course, Close was better in reflexively intelligent movies such as Albert Nobbs (2011) and The Wife (2017), but everybody in this has been better elsewhere."}, {"id": 497, "text": "At the beginning of the Trump trip in 2016, J.D. Vance offered us a chance to understand the interior of the many backwoods citizens who voted for him. His memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, shows in minute, loving detail the virtues and vices of Appalachians too often ill-defined by Deliverance and Beverly Hillbillies. He shows they were more than vice by their somehow preparing him for Yale.On the other hand, Ron Howard's adaptation wallows in the vices to show his protagonist ascending or escaping, depending on how you look at it. J.D. (Gabriel Basso) is a mild-mannered, unassuming hillbilly, who in Kentucky and Middletown, Ohio, reveres and suffers gladly his addicted, train wreck mom, Bev (Amy Adams), and her mom, Mamaw (Glen Close), a tough nut who could give Ma Barker a run.Close acts her usually well-crafted characterization, possibly meriting another of her many Oscar nominations, and Adams peers over the edge to hyperbole, not meriting another of her many nominations. Because Basso shows little range other than stoic sufferer (the casting flaw of looking like Vance, and that's all), the film is left to the two ladies to eat as much of the scenery as they can outside the usual honey wagon.As for the depth Howard is capable of, it didn't travel to Appalachia, perhaps because he knows only the other side of the Mayberry tracks. Insights into the white working class are sparse because of the preponderance of violence and ignorance.In no way could we understand how this young man worked his way to Yale Law School other than winning the best grades in Algebra because Howard and seriously-good writer Vanessa Taylor have him reacting, mostly helplessly, to the wacked-out ladies in his life. And by the way, J.D. extols the intelligence of his mother without showing those credentials, other than her choosing one loser after another for partner.With Howard's adaptation, we are no better understanding a complex society that would have given Trump four more years. With Vance, I at least understood the layers, some better than others. Perhaps Taylor and Howard took too seriously the dark side of the word elegy. Vance saw the poetry. Howard sees the prose."}, {"id": 498, "text": "I enjoyed the content of this film. I particularly loved Close as Mamaw.The message of the film nauseated me.

What's wrong with that?Nothing. It's a good message. Drugs are bad for us. Hard work generates great rewards.Let's pose another question. Why are so many Americans born into hardship?YOU LAZY, EFFETE, LIMP-WRISTED COMMIE! HOW DARE YOU!Our cultural gatekeepers from the upper class love those bootstrapping Horatio Alger yarns. Whether they're Hollywood liberals or think tank blowhards, the rich don't want the poor to think in terms of class structure and policy. We the proles must only be taught to think in terms of personal responsibility.The drug-addled mother and the iron-willed grandmother are stereotypes the elites used to assign to African-American families of the inner cities. When politicians and their corporate overlords gave the post-industrial finger to our black comrades, they chalked it up to personal responsibility. It was all cut social services, build more prisons, and traffic crack cocaine into their neighborhoods. That was during my eighties adolescence.Today, Joe Biden and BlackRock bigshots are giving the the same dirty finger of personal responsibility to white folks in de-industrialized rural America. J.D. Vance is one of the Judas goats for the ruling class. Get the masses to blame themselves for systemic oppression and lead them to the abattoir.Mind you, it's not all one or the other. Richie Rich from Darien also gets hooked on drugs and drops out of high school. The difference is Richie Rich gets to go to a gilded rehab palace in the Poconos. Richie Rich gets a no-show job at Daddy's hedge fund. He can afford to **** up. Billy Bob from Duddie's Branch gets only ONE bite at the apple.Richie Rich and Billy Bob are both human and to err is human. It is in the consequences of ****ing up where we find the deep-seated injustice. Messrs. Vance and Howard will never go there.I did enjoy the story itself. Ron Howard makes the movie fun and tasty. As others have pointed out, Hillbilly Elegy is about as realistic a portrayal of Appalachia as Mayberry RFD. And that's what makes it a good beer and popcorn movie.

The rest of the cast mostly just phoned it in. Amy Adams was good without being remarkable. Gabriel Basso as the 'adult' JD character was very wooden, and occasionally drew me out of what I was watching due to this.I'm not American, but can understand a lot of what is depicted here. You find it everywhere, among all countries. I also have American friends with whom this would hit too close to home. Those same American friends would probably never watch a film like this. In a film that heavily relies on being able to identify and relate to what is happening, this is perhaps an issue.We all have family though, and the majority of us have challenges to deal with and overcome in life. It's these commonalities which provided some of the emotional punches for me.This type of film has been done many times in the past and often better.

With a capital D! Let's call it Hee-haw Hell in Ron Howard's overly melodramatic but compelling film, Hillbilly Elegy, based on J.D. Vance's novel.Mr. Howard's direction is solid, and he captures the hopelessness of the lower class economic struggle most efficiently with his images of boarded up shops and closed factories, but the main weakness in his film is its disjointed screenplay by Vanessa Taylor. Her script continually jumps back and forth in time with its non-linear structure. Movie scenes are stitched together haphazardly like a beginner's patchwork quilt. Some are very effective; others seem overwrought and contrived. Together, they never build to any genuine emotional epiphany. The film is too episodic in its editing and storytelling that one wonders if pieces of film remnants were left on the cutting room floor. There are gaps in the timeline of events in the Vance family and their history that remain missing and the film never give us the full picture.While some of his casting is uneven, other actors interpret their parts with much nuance and verve. In the role as the main protagonist J.D., Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos are serviceable but slightly miscast. They never bring any pathos or a convincing sense of despair to their roles. However, it is the female clan in the film that bring the words and story of family abuse and poverty to life. In their few scenes, Frieda Pinto as J.D.'s devoted girlfriend and especially a wonderful Haley Bennett as his stoic sister are quite wonderful and make their characters more than mere stereotypes. But the real reason for seeing Hillbilly Elegy are the strong performances by Amy Adams as Bev, a junkie mom and abused daughter, and Glenn Close as Mamaw, a tough-as-nails grandmother who takes on anyone who dares to draw near. They are wonderful.Both Ms. Adams and Ms. Close are decked out in their Oscar-worthy worst...all haggard, angry, and worn. Their screen personas may be unrecognizable, but their acting is, once again, memorable. Some critics have criticized their overt emoting as an Oscar grab and complained that these fine actresses left an overabundance of sawdust in the wake of all their scenery chewing. But I found both skillful performers to deliver excellent performances throughout the film.Hillbilly Elegy expertly shows the socioeconomic conditions that trap many families in the spiraling-down of hope and personal pride. Where the film loses some of its footing is in its soap opera origins and blatant stock characters as its spokespersons. Still with Ms. Adams and Ms. Close along for this hayride, you can't go wrong.

Director Ron Howard captures the despair and frustration due to lack of opportunity and family dysfunction but the film runs overlong hammering its point home with the protagonist's train wreck of a mom (Amy Adams).Hillbilly JD Vance is on the verge of breaking the family cycle of poverty and ignorance as a bust out law candidate from Yale. Seriously involved with an Indian girlfriend he's scheduled to interview for a major position with a firm but wouldn't you know it his drug addled old mom threatens to sabotage everything.Most of Elegy is in flashback of JD (Owen Aztalos) growing up in the midst of dreadful circumstance his Mamaw (Glenn Close) doing her able best to keep the boy on the right path while mom bonds on occasion between fixes and boyfriends. Amy Adams is powerfully infuriating as the old lady, blaming the world for all her problems inflicting great emotional pain on JD. Glenn Close is simply her equal as a wobbly tower of strength trying to hold the family together. Howard's direction is poorly paced with overlong phone conversations and an excess of mom infractions, the depressed state of Middle America disposed in perfunctory montage. There is little comic relief to be found and Howard pouring on excess glum asks for the same patience mom does with her incessant drug use when both call for tough love.

But that doesn't mean every one of those stories is worth making into a movie. HillBilly Elegy is a terribly bland and depressing look at the life of a guy who grew up in an abusive household, continues to struggle with a drug-addicted mother, but found a way to overcome the difficulties of his young life to become a successful law student. This is on the same level as the old after-school specials we had in the 1980s, or a modern Lifetime movie. There's nothing that made this story original or even interesting to watch. It fell into so many cliches that I was getting dizzy from rolling my eyes. For instance, can we all agree that we never need another scene about some stupid hick not knowing what to do with all the silverware at a fancy dinner?One big problem was that I don't think Hillbilly Elegy benefited from non-linear storytelling. They weren't linking scenes between the two timelines much, and so it only served to lessen the impact of certain moments, because we have to wait for another flashback (or flash forward.) Of course, since this was all based around someone's real life story it feels true, but this is the type of story we've all seen before. Sure, the makeup work and performance of Glenn Close were great, but the film is rarely focused on the difference her character made in the protagonist's life. And it seems, because the film is based on an autobiography, it is afraid to truly villainize anyone. The end result is an unfocused and milquetoast tale that is completely underwhelming.

Adams is also superb, though her role may be underwritten.It's odd this movie should be viewed as political, given that director Ron Howard is an outspoken liberal.

(Owen Asztalos) with his mother and with his grandmother Mamaw (Glenn Close). I wish the only problem with this Ron Howard film was that permanent temporary alternation that does not allow either of the two plots to consolidate.Hillbilly Elegy is a hideous melodrama where poor J.D. the boy deals with a violent and later addicted mother, whose misfortune haunts him even in his adult life, and a calmer grandmother but with a turbulent past that is also in conflict with her daughter. They want to present it as a strong drama but it is a grotesque succession of screams, blows and emotional blackmail, over-acting and bordering on caricature. More than elegy, an excess of white trash and redneck miserabilism of deep America. Absent (and violent) parents and grandparents, a witch mother and a former (?) witch but savior grandmother. Only sister Lindsay (Haley Bennett) and ... him, of course, are saved. The spirit of Hillbilly ... resembles that of The Devil All The Time, only the latter is more pretentious and with more characters.Obviously, this film had to be based on real events (for Hollywood this is always a merit) to enhance its testimonial value: a memoir of Vance himself, already a successful lawyer, a best seller where it seems that he takes revenge on his family by portraying her without pity and incidentally passes us the meritocratic message of I still succeeded with a horrible family but in their loving way. This is not exactly a Return to Reims...The final titles with photos of the real J.D., Bev and Mamaw could not be missing so that we can see how well they disguised the actors and actresses. For Hollywood, the physical transformation and characterization are absolute merits - how Amy Adams got fat for her role!Sadly, some will see this Oscar-pretended freak as a deep drama like life itself with intense and risky performances.A pity that actresses of the stature of Glenn Close and Amy Adams have lent themselves to get into the skin of these grotesque and Oscar-winning characters."}, {"id": 510, "text": "In a non-pandemic year, late-November/early December would be the sweet spot for releasing films with their eyes on that prize, the Academy Awards. Although theaters are generally still closed, Netflix's prestige picks are coming out weekly, even though the awards season has been extended into April. Last week, Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy premiered with mixed advance buzz and the Oscar hopes of a duo of overdue, multi-nominated actresses, Amy Adams and Glenn Close, in tow. Award worthiness is subjective - here's how I see it.Based on the memoir by J.D. Vance, Hillbilly Elegy tells the story of J.D., a Yale law student, who is in the middle of interviews for summer associate positions, when he receives word that his mother has overdosed on heroin. J.D. has to go home to his family in Ohio in order to take care of his mother. Through flashbacks on his journey home, we see how J.D. got from his meager beginnings, enduring abuse and his mother's drug addiction to Yale with the fierce, no nonsense support of his grandmother. The perspective of people in Appalachia is not a typical one depicted in films, but family drama can be universal as many people in urban, suburban and rural areas endure hardships, lack of opportunity, addiction and abuse. There is also love, sacrifice and support that fill families across the board. While this story is specific to a people in a specific place and time in America, it feels pretty generic - disappointingly so.Ron Howard does not do anything particularly interesting in directing this film. The only exceptions are the two sequences where we see how this Appalachian area has changed and decayed over the decades. Otherwise, Howard lets the emotions of the story drive the action. And, the emotions are very high.Amy Adams plays J.D.'s mother, Bev. She's mired in drug addiction. She's abusive. She's impulsive with men and clearly has trauma and mental health issues. Adams chews all of the scenery. She plays every angle to the hilt, which becomes a bit much to take.The other pillar in J.D.'s life is Mamaw as played by Glenn Close. Close has the wig and make-up to transform her into the chain-smoking, Terminator loving matriarch. Close moves and speaks in a way that helps her embody the character and attempt to make the hillwoman more than a caricature. Close is more successful in her portrayal than Adams as she strikes the right tones and gets the inspiring, emotional touches needed to ground the movie. Unfortunately for both Adams and Close, their scene partners who play the teenage and adult J.D. are flat and uninspired, which drags down each of their scenes.In fact, the J.D. character just solidifies how blandly generic Hillbilly Elegy feels. J.D. should not be the main character of the film since he is the least interesting aspect of the story. I can't tell if it is the poor writing of the character or the lackluster performances by Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos, as adult and young J.D., respectively, that make him so blah. It's probably failures on both ends - on top of the fact that his arc is in no way compelling.While there is merit to this story, the focus of Hillbilly Elegy is misplaced. Glenn Close makes her scenes emotional and engaging, but the rest of the movie is either over-the-top or bland. It is a worthy experience, but other than Close, I wouldn't say award-worthy.

Then the hatred of others, the dismissing of the polish people, the insisting of native americans being called indian, the asking what is she, seeing his girlfriend's colour of skin with actually indian parents."}, {"id": 514, "text": "When I read the critics' reviews for the film, I went into watching this film -- based on the bestselling memoir about a young man's rise from humble Appalachian origins to graduating from Yale Law school to becoming a tech millionaire -- with low expectations. I was surprised to find that the film was not nearly as bad what the critics had said. Most of negative reviews seemed to be directed at JD Vance, the author of the memoir on which the book is based, because of his conservative viewpoints. As a liberal myself, I will say that Hollywood can be notoriously biased.The highlight of the film was the performance by Glenn Close as Mamaw. Owen Asztalos is also very convincing as a young JD. Some of the topics covered in the film are relatable to a wider audience -- the poverty mentality, codependency, substance abuse, and domestic violence -- and certain portions of the film certain pull at the heartstrings of the audience.Still, the film suffers from pitfalls that cannot be overlooked. The dialogue and acting at times come off as melodramatic. Amy Adams, despite doing her best as Bev, comes up short because of a contrived script. Her histrionics are a big detractor, and it makes it harder for the viewer to sympathize with her. The constant flashbacks between JD's past and his present-day setting as a Yale Law student disrupt the overall flow of the film.Hillbilly Elegy in sum is an OKAY movie. Not bad, not great. From what I hear, the book offers a much more nuanced portrayal of JD's Appalachian upbringing and serves as a sort-of political narrative about the rise of Donald Trump among working class whites. I have yet to read it, but it may be a better starting point than this film."}, {"id": 515, "text": "This was the best film I have seen in a long time. Glenn Close is perfect as the chain-smoking, profane grandmother who saves her grandson from a nihilistic life of underachievement. The acting is wonderful, the storyline is inspiring and the ending is great.Just a wonderful uplifitng film. A wonderful tribute to an amazing woman whose iron will steered her grandson away from hopelessness and drugs.There is no politics in this film, so I am not sure why so many people who never watched it come here to give it bad reviews.Will we ever be rid of the scolds who see politics in everything?Are their lives so unfulfilling that they need to find reasons to hate different people?"}, {"id": 516, "text": "When i watched this movie, I was not aware of the story or its content. But I was invested as soon as I saw the people and the situations. My grandparents were exactly like Mr. Vance's. Pregnant at 13 and headed from the hills of Kentucky to a similar place in Ohio. I did not live the same kind of life he did, but my roots are the same. My parents and my siblings all worked very hard at not floundering in the poverty and want that often accompanies ignorance. All the folks who have criticized and railed at Mr. Vance's depiction need to keep their peace. This is his story. He lived it. He was not writing about me or you. If you are upset that his grandmother pointed out the truth of personal responsibility to be the key to climbing out of a difficult situation, then you do not recognize truth. When you set aside what is holding you back, whether it is culture, racism, or economic situation, and you make choices to shift to personal accountability, you will be amazed at what great changes will occur. To deny this as a means of progress is to deny a proven outcome. Anyone who has escaped from poverty and who grew into a better life can look back at their progress and mark each successful step with the acknowledgement of a mentor, a teacher, a pastor or a parent who encouraged them to be personally responsible in all things. Everyone can make that choice. Watch the movie and be happy for Mr. Vance. Stop making everything about you or your agenda. It is a fine movie, well written and well acted by all."}], "reviews_amount": 517}
