The main character is not will smith or the rock, it's a skinny nobody. Dylan Obrien is amazing. The film is funny and the action is great. The monsters are also really cool. The dog is a badass. I'd love a sequel. more characters more worldbuilding stuff like that."}, {"id": 1, "text": "It's not the most expensive movie, or the best plot but honestly this movie gave me flashbacks to the good old days of family adventure movies. It has adventure, it has love, it has companionship, it has humour and it keeps you wanting to learn more about the world. It makes you feel good.I only wish it were longer and I hope they make a sequel."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I was prepared for another boring to death movie flick, making questioning my taste on movies. I was surprised in a good way. The movie had it all, great FX, good acting, Monsters, unseen twists, everything i needed for a Saturday night.And most of all, for bad or good, an open ending that leaves room a return (which traditionally will suck).Highly recommended."}, {"id": 3, "text": "This is one of the best recent adventure films. It avoids many clich\u00e9s that inhabit the genre, with small twists which made watching it a pleasure.Even though the action scenes were sort of predictable, it didn't deter away from getting absorbed into Joel's story and caring what happened to him and the other characters. It had some small lessons in it too, which added to the story.Its a little too adult for young children in my opinion. Young teens though would enjoy it."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Really enjoyable movie and not as predictable as you'd think. I was surprised how funny and original 'Love and Monsters' was considering the overdone genre but it is an adventure worth taking. If you're looking for a decent weekend flick then I strongly recommend you give it a go."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Ignore the bad reviews, it's actually a pretty decent movie. Nothing original, however much better than most movies they make nowadays.Dylan O'Brien is very talented and carries the whole film well. This is not Shakespeare, still it's fun and good for a movie night with friends and family."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Yes, this is a very entertaining movie. A teenage boy survives a global disaster and is in hiding with other survivors in underground bunkers. Yet, he cannot get his girlfriend out of his head, luckily his girlfriend also survived, but is at a camp 126km from his camp. He takes the journey to go to his girlfriend fighting mutated cold blooded animals and insects. The mutants are great, very well done. What this movie almost brings down is the childish script and jokes, the main character, the teenage boy, is constantly denigrated for no reason, even a little girl he meets on his journey insults him only for a couple of poor executed jokes. But, all in all, this movie is worth your while."}, {"id": 7, "text": "This movie was fun to watch, the acting wasn't bad at all, CGI was decent. Compared to Jumanji for example, which I found was a bit too much and overacted, this one is exactly what you would expect, but not too intense and forced. Looking forward to a sequel."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This movie is a solid piece of entertainment. Good acting, some funny jokes, good CGI &amp; it's got a nice pace.

The monster were kinda silly, but the story, the pace and the character were pretty good. Filming locations were also great and different from the usual Hollywoodian sameness. And, Thanks God, there were no in your face PC proselytism, which was refreshing. Love and Monsters is the type of a film that a father can watch with his daughter or a mother with her and son and without feeling embarrassed most of the time."}, {"id": 11, "text": "It's a very entertaining movie. The opening was very funny and it perfectly explained what we are dealing with here. There is some very emotional scenes. The acting in very good. You will love the little girl.

All coated with a good sense of humor. Defiantly one of the best movies of 2020. I saw it twice in a row. Highly recommended. And kudos to the dog Boy. He is a protagonist as much as everyone else."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Its a great movie. So fun and entertaining. Joel is not your typical action hero, He's more like us (and everyday man).

Don't compare it to other apocalypse and zombie or monster movies because it is kinda different. It is also not predictable as you think, you are gonna be surprised especially in the last half hour ,it will go in a different direction in a very good way. Also it does carry a message and it is not just a pointless fun movie. It is suitable for kids and for family watch, it will be really good if you watch with your family in this quarantine, it will cheer you up and it is really suitable for this time in a good way. I really hope you give it a shot because you won't regret it. And of course who doesn't enjoy watching a movie with Dylan O'Brien in it."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Super cute and a good twist on the apocalypse. It kept me interested!

Haven't seen too many good movies this year. But this is quite good. Good action and effects . Recommended"}, {"id": 23, "text": "This is your typical family friendly adventure movie. It has a plain, simple plot (and don't try to put it through the credibility test, because it will fail miserably), predictable and cliched. There's not a lot of character development either. It has some humor (not very good), and some heartwarming moments (kinda...). Overall it's entertaining (considering it's intended for kids and teens), but forgettable."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I don't write reviews, so this one will probably kind of suck, but man I loved this movie!! I went into it with little to no expectations and was shocked by just how good I found it. Enough to be added to my list of favorites for sure. The main character - thank god - is actually likeable, unlike so many protagonists before. The romance, despite being integral to the plot, isn't forced or overwhelming. The characters actually respond to traumatic events accordingly instead of brushing it all off like nothing happened (perhaps it could have been done a little better but at the end of the day it's a rather light movie). And perhaps most importantly - it's chock full of super cool monsters, with an adorable canine companion as the cherry on top. Definitely check this out if you get the chance! Warning though: it might be a bit more emotional than you expect (I teared up a bit at one scene, LOL)."}, {"id": 25, "text": "I wasn't expecting much but after the first 30 seconds the movie hooked me. I watched it with my nephew who at first balked and it pulled him in. The special effects are well-done and pretty solid. The story moves at a good clip and the characters are relatable and you like them. Just regular people just trying to survive. It was just a lovely movie to watch although the plot on the surface is not a nice reality. I will watch again and learn and thing or 2. I highly recommend this film. Well done!!"}, {"id": 26, "text": "I was a bit hesitant at first but it turned out to be amazing.Far better than what I've seen in a while. Fantastic movie with an top notch combo of action and movie.Dylan being Dylan performed wonderfully and I'm looking forward to more sequels."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Dylan did his part the best without any exaggeration and a scene with robot is emotionally well taken which reminds me of fallout game.rooker and ariana on the other hand nailed their roles.doggo named boy is lit with love and cuteness. its a pg13 movie so literally you can't expect kill cam it's a sure entertainer for kids and adults. The only part which i felt odd is during the end how they kinda mushed just to get it done and gave it a ending which ain't deserved which questions arises love or leave.. All together it's a good movie and expecting a sequel."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Its been a long time since i saw a movie where the scriptwriter cared so much about his script. It remind me films from the 90's. clever plot twists, sentimental but not cheesy moments, metaphorical meanings and all this on a teenager monster movie!!!! well done."}, {"id": 29, "text": "Ok maybe a 4 is too harsh, but it doesn't deserve more than 5 stars that's for sure. It's basic acting, basic plot, no originallity...i know very few good movies have premiered since the pandemic took place but we should not lower our standards..."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Good movie to watch on a weekend night when it's cold or rainy outside or you're just stuck in quarantine. Interesting premise, pretty good creature cgi, a main character that becomes much more fleshed out as the movie progresses than he was at the beginning of the movie, lovely side characters and some pretty cool scenery. Straightforward plot with a few surprises and twists along the way, some cliches too. The acting and the screenplay were decent, nothing groundbreaking, but the movie is definitely worth a watch if you're bored!"}, {"id": 31, "text": "The protagonist just won't shut up. Cringeworthy dialogue delivery. all attempts at humor fail, unoriginal story, boring. You can tell you've seen characters like that in other movies, except the dog.CGI was just good enough but the monsters were terribly underused. The events build up the tension, but they are quickly resolved without any effort, so no real moment of rejoice throughout the movie. They even tried to spice up the story by introducing a villain in the last half hour. Nothing special happens though.Better see something else, unless you are easily amused by generic teen-ish acting, bland characters and a plain story with couple of nice moments here and there. The dog was the only likeable character."}, {"id": 32, "text": "I had cheered me up. It's witty and funny. I loved that it reminds me of Zombieland and I love that movie. It's full of hope and shows that good things can happen if you put yourself out there. This is a godsent in 2020. Please consider a sequel."}, {"id": 33, "text": "A movie worth every minute of your time. I loved the creativity and comedy in this family adventure. I'd love to see a sequel and by the look of the first movie and how it turned out we might just get it!!!"}, {"id": 34, "text": "Wait for it to be $10 or less if you must...it will wait for you and still deliver its full measure of movie magic; but if you can safely swing the $20 purchase price currently being asked, I'd say pony up, because the makers of such a special presentation certainly have earned the right to earn their money back on this one, and in these weird days a risk deserves a reward, yes? This is a fun movie that will withstand many watchings, and will be a treasured part of your collection for many years to come...consider it an investment in joy that will pay dividends for as long as you remain able to find the Play button.

This film had a bit of everything really... Great effects, decent story, great acting (inc Boy) and love of course!Great for both younger audiences and older ones too like myself.Could easily have a sequal too but for me... would have to be the same cast and same budget."}, {"id": 37, "text": "Cutie Dylan O'Brien of MTV'S Teen Wolf and the Maze Runner franchise stars in this dystopian Horror fantasy. Some time in the future an asteroid heads towards the earth and is blown up but the nuclear fallout ends up mutating all bug and animal life which puts humans at the bottom of the food chain. Joel (O'Brien) discovers that his girlfriend is alive and 85 miles away. So he leaves his colony and makes the trek there fighting monsters and befriending a dog along the way. The movie feels very refreshing in its subject matter and execution. It's got charm, style and a charasmatic, engaging leading man. Although I never fully bought into the romance I loved the live action Manga feel of the material. It's fun, energetic and feels very much like something new.****/5 Eric: ***.75/5"}, {"id": 38, "text": "I enjoyed every minute watching this movie,very Impressive acting whole love &amp; monsters crew really did a great work.

Some of the monsters looked realistic whereas few are bad CGIs. The story rides on the lead character's supposedly innocent and charismatic looks. But the lead character is only innocent.

It does a great job of keeping a consistent entertaining pace without dragging on drama or romance thankfully. It's action scenes are brief but fun while inspiring a sense of wonder with it's fun monsters. They crafted a world I want so desperately to learn more about! The creature design wasn't very fantastical and that is actually quite good as they are supposed to be mutated versions of Earth's flora and fauna. The movie is visually a treat to look at with some beautiful locales used for the movie that give you a true sense of exploration like any good adventure film should. I found the story to be quite heartwarming and not because of the romantic nature of the main story but the more important side story, a boy and his dog surviving the apocalypse.

I really liked the world of the apocalypse, all the monsters turned out to be very interesting and quite frightening (it's a pity that there was no huge spider, I would have looked). The graphics and visuals of the monsters were good too. All the characters turned out to be charismatic, except for the villain, who seemed clich\u00e9d and silly to me. In addition, the amazing actors Michael Rooker (Clyde) and Ariana Greenblatt (Minnow) were very cool here, and Dylan O'Brien (Joel) surprised me, he played his role very well, I really liked him. The film is very funny, sometimes even sad. For what you can blame this film, it is a bit banal and predictable plot, but it does not interfere with watching the movie.

I really enjoyed the world-building in this film. The atmosphere and monsters were done very well. The post-apocalyptic world in this film is much different than in others where it's dark and murky. This film was bright and colorful and really showed that after 95% of humanity was gone, the environment took over un-restricted. Planes buried in mountains covered in vines, buildings overgrown with plants and trees, etc....It just looked really really good. Also....bonus points for having the cutest dog I have ever seen in my entire life!

This movie qualifies all.It was a surprise to see Dylan and Jessica pair up, although they have less screen time, they both are good. Michael Rooker and young Ariana are a delightful pair to watch. Although I wish they tagged along longer. But probably the highlight of this whole movie is Boy, the dog. He shines in every frame he is in.

I think that this movie is going to get a lot of positive reviews, if it hasn't already. And that should convince them to make a part 2. Where we could see their journey into the mountains.

The CGI monsters aren't going to blow anyone's mind but they're enjoyable.

In this, after 7 years of living underground, going outside is a massive task. The adventure is just a whole lot of fun, Dylan does an incredible job especially with his comedic timing which I didn't know he had. The scenes with Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt)) &amp; Clyde (Michael Rooker) who he meets on the way are great additions &amp; add so much to the film.

The not Marvel grade digital effects give Monster Problems a B-Movie quality that makes it kind of even cooler, because it shows that the production had its heart in the right place and spent the money on quality actors, light, sound and of course story.

This is really a coming of age film. It's heartfelt and endearing with a good dose of humour. The set design is kitsch and kooky and the monsters are really just fun/gross (not overly dark and scary).

And that's not nothing. I was even surprised by the pace that's not only fast, noisy, chunky it's also capable of find slow moments that help the movie to don't rush and think about which is the right way to continue the story step by step.

I chose this over Tenet to watch last night and I'm very happy I did. Dylan O'Brien is incredible, as well as Michael Rooker. Everyone else is very good, too. It's a coming of age story, thriller, and action movie all rolled into one. I guess it's also a romance but it's more about teaching a lesson rather than having this unrealistic meet cute at the end. But I'll give you my flaws. 1. Narration. The narrating is not necessary in this movie, imo. It kinda feels like it was made up in post production because they didn't think the audience would get it. Here's the thing. We don't need to know why the animals mutated. They could have newspaper headlines hint at the asteroid and the missile radiation and that's it. The Quiet Place didn't rely on narration, why should this? 2. The relationship between Joel and his colony is extremely under developed. Like it didn't feel like Joel was needed or wanted there. So by the end they try to cash in this family dynamic that was never set up. It would make more sense if Joel just went to Minow and Michael Rooker. 3. I applaud the way they handled Joel and Amiee's relationship at the end. The problem is the entire section with the yacht captain and the giant crab was completely pointless. The only good part was the callback to the eyes of creatures. Tbh, I think Amiee should've gone away and Joel goes back to his colony to bring them to Minow and Michael Rooker, and on the way they can encounter a monster and Joel can teach his crew how some are docile. It just felt very out of left field. All and all, very good movie. Great characters and great story."}, {"id": 220, "text": "Forget rating, just watch and enjoy!

The satirical reliefs that O'Brien's character provides gives a well rounded range of themes within the film. Overall the film's story is easy to follow but still lacks a few needed aspects. In hindsight the film could have included more fleshed out backstories to some of the characters, in some instances characters like cap are not explained with enough depth. I would have liked to have seen these types of characters with a little more insight."}, {"id": 224, "text": "First of all. People complaining that is a kids movie, saying it's for 5 year old, saying I'm an adult so didn't enjoy it. Where is your sense of fun? Adventure?

Not the best plot, but it's an adventure. The monsters are a bonus and in my opinion are well designed. The main character is ok, but the dog steals the show. The end scene was a bit over the top but it reminded me of the old monster movies like Clash of the titans and Sinbad. This brought back lots of childhood memories for me.

Biggest flaw I saw was with the love story. There is no way that 2 healthy, unattached young-adults don't have sex after saving each other's lives.

As soon as I saw that Dylan O'Brien was the lead I decided I'd give it a go, and it wasn't a mistake. O'Brien is in his wheelhouse here, playing on the likeable beta male sidekick role that made him a breakout in teen wolf. He brings humour and heart to a project that could have easily been a generic and forgettable affair, aided with some great supporting stints from the likes of Rooker and Greenblatt, however brief they might be. Funny, warm and utterly charming. It's a family friendly Zombieland, without the expletives, the gore and...well, the Zombies.

That being said, there is something else about this movie that makes it relatable for the time we live in, as we are becoming more and more afraid to go out, we spend our time cooking and around electronics.. the message here is to go out and enjoy our beautiful world.. make friends (not online) and be more out there and gain skills that we don't know we had in us."}, {"id": 231, "text": "Oh I wish this movie was longer than 109 minutes!

However, the fallout transforms any cold-blooded animal into a mutated monster and within days, most of the human race is dead.This all takes place seven years before this movie, on the night that Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). After reconnecting with her via the radio, he decides to leave behind the bunker where he's spent his life and cross the dangerous world left behind to find her.Joel has no survival skills at all, mostly acting as the cook for his group. Once he gets to the outside, he's quickly saved and taught what he needs to know by Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt). Then, he's on his way, seeking true love, which he learns the meaning of once he gets to Aimee's settlement.If you have older kids who aren't frightened by big monsters, this is a great movie. I'll give you a small spoiler and let you know that Boy the dog survives, if you worry about that like I do.Originally titled Monster Problems, this has moments of true beauty amongst the monster mayhem, such as when the Mav1s robot plays music for our hero and luminescent jellyfish float through the air.I would more than recommend this movie and hope for a sequel.

I mangaged to care about every single character in this movie, and that is so rare nowadays. It was belivable in the sense that the characters were all so human, the dialoge was great and so was the acting. I first saw Dylan O'briens acting in Teen Wolf, and since then I've wanted to see him get to use his talent. He was good in maze runner, and in american assasin, but here he SHINES. Every single muscle in his face just sells thw preformance to me, he is there, in a world of monsters. And that dog was really cute too. Only thing I wish it would've been longer and that we get to see more of minnow and the survivalist guy.

They dont look straight from a TV show, or from a DC movie. Thats really the only positive I can add.Acting was weak. Story was bad. Love interest part was pointless.

The attempts at comedy often felt awkward and fall flat. The writing is not fantastic, hence the underdeveloped characters AND underdeveloped relationships between characters.

The thing that struck me about it, is that, for Teen Wolf fans, this movie is basically what would happen if Stiles Stilinski had to travel through a land of monsters trying to kill him in order to reach the girl he loves haha. O'Brien is basically playing Stiles, IN that setting, except his name is Joel. Name is different, but the personality and way he acts is on point Stiles haha And as expected, O'Brien kills it in that kind of role. He was one of the best things on Teen Wolf, and he's one of the best things about this movie. So if you were a fan of O'Brien as Stiles on Teen Wolf, I cannot see how you wouldn't like this movie.

Confusing? Not really. It's a post-apocalyptic road trip monster filled action love story movie that is a romp and a riot. It's not often you get to see a movie where even it's weakest link is still holding strong... The dialogue is witty, the scenery is beautiful but appropriate, CGI game is strong most of the time, and cinematography crisp &amp; clear, no lightening cuts and shaky camera. All the cast brought their A-game. Hero and Dodge lent so much emotion to their joint portrayal of Boy the dog, they both must be very good boys... and Mavis the robot could almost pass the Turing test.

But I must admit that I was genuinely interested in the movie given the presentation of the poster.And now that I have seen the movie, I must just say: wow!Monster Problems was definitely a wonderful surprise of an entertaining and enjoyable movie. It turned out to be one of the more memorable and entertaining of movies that I have seen in 2020 - and I watch a lot of movies.The storyline told in Monster Problems was pretty straight forward, but it was at the same time a very interesting storyline that definitely appealed to me in many ways, especially since I have always enjoyed a good creature feature. And with the sheer size of the creatures in Monster Problems, then I was in for quite the treat.Sure, you can say that the main plot was somewhat sappy and a bit on the simplistic side, perhaps appealing more to a younger romantically hazed audience. But the combination of the sappy romance, mixed with the action, suspense and monstrous creatures actually made for quite an enjoyable cocktail.Visually then I was without a doubt impressed with how Monster Problems turned out. The creature designs were just spectacular and they looked very realistic in the way they moved, behaved and appeared. So the CGI team definitely delivered some nice eye candy with this movie.The acting in the movie was good, and was definitely impressed with the performance of lead actor Dylan O'Brien. I was not familiar with him, but he was really great in this movie. I think it was a shame that Jessica Henwick and Michael Rooker weren't given more screen time, because they brought a lot of good things to the movie with their performances and their characters. And the dog Dodge (playing Boy), well he was just spectacular, what a well-trained dog, and it had such great on-camera presence.I can warmly recommend that you take the time and effort to sit down and watch Monster Problems, because this movie was great.

It's super funny and family-friendly for all ages. Surprisingly, 2020 has given us several new movies for the Halloween season, but this one is the best by far, in my opinion. It's not really a Halloween movie, but there are some monsters.I was thoroughly entertained by this hero's journey movie. Plus, it offers tips that might actually be helpful if things continue to go wrong in 2021. ha ha I know a movie is good when I can't wait to watch it again and that's how I felt after watching this movie!TIPS FOR PARENTS: Lots of kissing and couples cuddling. Some profanity, sometimes by a little girl. People in perilous situations. There are lots of dangerous creatures, but young kids probably won't be too scared. They're mostly giant, mutated insects. Some violence. People get drunk.THEMES: Couples, relationships, love Courage Friendship, unity Hope ApocalypseTHINGS I LIKED: Dylan O'Brien does a great job as the protagonist in the story who is a noble warrior floating on the wings of love as Michael Rooker's character describes him. He has perfect comedic timing, can do action, and brings on the feels. He's charming and inspiring and extremely effective in this role. Throw in a dog for his companion and you really want to root for him. There is satisfying character growth. He got his start in Teen Wolf but I didn't see him until The Internship and then his breakaway role in The Maze Runner. The exposition at the beginning of the movie is pithy and helpful to understand the conditions of the new, dystopian world. There's a lot of exposition, but it didn't bother me too much since we need the information to better understand certain scenes. You get to see a lot of fun and creative monsters. The protagonist/narrator says a lot of amusing things. The conversation with Mav1s was entertaining and touching. Melanie Zanetti voiced Mav1s and Kala. Cool magical sky jellies. If you love Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical) as I do, you'll get a kick out of seeing Michael Rooker, who played Yondu. He's perfect in his role and is so likeable. Ariana Greenblatt was pretty doggone adorable. Great musical score by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp. There is a little bit of back and forth in time, but viewers won't be confused. I laughed at Joel's reaction when he first saw the Australian stud-muffin. Some beautiful cinematography by Lachlan Milne. The adventure is non-stop and super entertaining. Great CGI and practical effects. For a minute or so, I thought one of the Hemsworth brothers was in the movie. ha haTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: There was a part of the story that was completely left as a missed opportunity. The dog named Boy always held on to a red dress. I thought for sure Joel would find the owner of the dress and that she would be his true love, like Tom Hanks in the movie Cast Away That would have been sweet, right? Instead, we never learn anything about the owner of that red dress, so it's just assumed she was eaten by monsters.

Where he sticks out as the least productive person. While everyone is mastered in surviving and fighting monsters. Seeing him come up from underneath and clueless on where to go is a lot of fun. The direction plays a little like zombieland mixed with a little bit of a road apocalypse film like Mad max but in a family friendly version of it.The film does have some exciting action sequences with them escaping from monsters and fighting back. The visual effects are great. The music score was good. The film does have a climatic battle on the beach with a giant like crab of a monster.Dylan O'Brien did great playing the character. Adding emotional depth to his journey in reuniting with his love. After feeling isolated from losing his family. And being separated from Aimee. Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt did good too. Jessica Henwick was also great playing in a brief role.It is a fun family adventure apocalypse film that delivers heart. Action. Adventure and a bit of humor."}, {"id": 327, "text": "Love and Monsters is a movie that I enjoyed very much. It's similar to - I guess - Percy Jackson (young adult with monsters) and I liked the characters and the story.This post-apocalypse film takes place 7 years after the world ended and radiation created these giant bugs. Dylan O'Brien (The Maze Runner) plays Jo\u00ebl, a young man who has to travel 85 miles through savage land to visit his girlfriend who might be in trouble. Not being a hero (but he can cook and draw!) he's lucky to meet a guy named Clyde (Michael Rooker as a non-villain) and a young girl named Minnow. They both teach him how to survive this nasty world. He also finds a dog named Boy that will accompany him on his journey. Just in time he reaches the colony of his girlfriend...Of course, Love and Monsters is no Oscar material but the acting is good (Dylan is charming and I love Michael Rooker), the deserted world looks cool and the monsters are not scary, but fun. The dog looks fake sometimes, though. Storywise there are also some nice little surprises (the robot!). The movie even ends with a possibility for a sequel and I wouldn't mind that.A charming tale! 8/10"}, {"id": 328, "text": "Love and Monsters starts off as a teen romance interrupted by the apocalypse, but thankfully becomes much more than that and ultimately very entertaining.There is a welcome trend recently in apocalyptic movies (possibly due to the ongoing pandemic) of finding originality vs. defaulting to a zombie plague.Former Teen Wolf and The Maze Runner star Dylan O'Brien is an affably geeky guy that stumbles into the hero role. The monster scenes balance decent special effects with fun action.I would have liked to see more of the beginning's life in the bunker setup as it would likely have given the movie more emotional depth.But overall this is a very enjoyable family-friendly adventure."}, {"id": 329, "text": "At this point in time, Love and Monsters is simply one of the biggest surprises of 2020. On its surface, it appeared to be a very run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic film, but I do like Dylan O'Brian and the reviews were fairly strong.It succeeded my expectations and currently cracks my top ten of the year. O'Brian is fantastic as always, but the journey his character goes on was remarkable. That's down to the writing, but O'Brian managed to pull it off with ease. The supporting cast was also great, but we didn't really spend much time with anyone apart from O'Brian's character, Joel.The effects were astonishing, making the world feel realistic and lived-in. I liked the narrative a lot, but I feel like an extra fifteen minutes could have easily been added to a couple of key areas. The pacing wasn't entirely there for me, but it was a far cry from being bad and I liked that something was always happening.There were also a couple of questionably convenient things that happened, and real-word logistical issues. Aside from those negatives, which don't detract from my score a lot, I was floored by this film.I have already touched on the writing, but I can't stress enough how incredible it was. There were also some surprisingly touching moments. A sequel was definitely hinted at with the closing scene, so I hope it comes to fruition.Love and Monsters is constantly exciting, the action is great, it has a neat twist, amazing effects, brilliant writing, and it was compelling throughout. I cared about the characters, which made me thoroughly invested in Joel's journey.If you haven't seen Love and Monsters, please check it out.

If done right, movies like these are entertaining, easy to watch, somehow nostalgic and formulaic in a way that it doesn't make it boring but easy to digest and fun. This movie is one of those movies. The plot is done a million times honestly, Dylan O'Brien reminds of Thomas from Maze Runner and I liked him in this movie too. All in all, this was fun and a great movie to watch with family, friends or alone when your day has sucked and you want something fun to watch. I've said 'fun' a lot of times by now but that's honestly one of the only words I could use to describe this movie. The CG is not bad but it's not great either. The acting is fairly decent. Bonus points for the dog, Boy. Obviously, the climax was cheesy and a very Disney-esque reveal but I liked the callback aspect of it. The world-building was good and the premise was something that has obviously been done before. I had not watched the trailer, so at first I thought it was going to be an alien apocalypse movie. But giant mutated cold-blooded animals. Nice. it was pretty wholesome if I could say so myself. There's an apocalypse, a wide-eyed cowardly protagonist, likeable tag-along side characters, an adorable dog, love at the heart of the movie and a fairly decent soundtrack. So watch it.

But the humor never goes to deep in like parody mode. Dylan O' Brien is amusing and quite humorous has Joel, kind of spoofing his Maze Runner character. Jessica Henwick is also good.

Once he gets outside and joins others, it can literally breath fresh air. It leads to another problem in the movie. The middle works so well that the last act falls a bit flat. It's a letdown to finish the movie and then there is a ham-fisted suggestion for a sequel. It's a sour note to end on.

Now, I'm not exactly the fan of family-friendly feel-good movies or any such thing, but I do love me some imaginative and well-done movies, no matter what genre.Love and Monsters is at least very entertaining, at best even a very inspiring and unique movie in these times. Is the plot original? Not really. The premise? Nah. But I hope you know the secret: you don't have to reinvent the wheel to make a good and entertaining movie. Take a nice script and a great director, take out all the identity politics that you might feel tempted to throw in, and trust that it'll be fine. And fine it is indeed. The world building is nothing short of impressive here, just visually. This film is an example of how you can create an absolutely convincing world without tentpole budgets, and it's done by creative decisions all the way. Just like in Dredd, you will find that some nice establishing shots are enough to create immersion. However, that doesn't mean that the more complex creature shots aren't pretty good as well. Compliments to the filmmakers for making the budget count - there wasn't a single shot that took me out of the movie, not one.As for the acting, there wasn't a single actor that was bad. Everyone was decent at least, but some were outstanding - like Michael Rooker and Ariana Greenblatt. Their screentime is limited, but they're pretty much the best characters in the movie. I would love to see a spin-off with those two, to be honest, and I haven't felt like that in a long time. Dylan O'Brien does a great job as well, and with some dialogue tweaks it would have been even better. But who am I to complain? Well done, indeed!If anything, I would have given the whole script one or two more drafts to sort out some of the dialogue, but yeah, that's probaly just me.So, if you want to see some nice post-apocalyptic love story with a wholesome twist, some amazing dog acting performances and a really nice score, coupled with some visuals that are actually almost too good for this budget, then dive right into it. You won't regret watching this movie."}, {"id": 335, "text": "The most unexpected thing about Love and Monsters is how charmingly enjoyable it is throughout. Whether it's the well-fleshed out characters (the dog being the clear standout with probably the best arc in the whole movie), the fun monster slayings, or the amusing happenstance luck of the self-deprecating protagonist, there's not much left to hate in this otherwise simple movie.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: A catastrophe mutates and enlarges all the bugs on Earth who then wipe out 95% of the human population. Seven years into the apocalypse, a hopelessly love-struck dork named Joel sets out across a dangerous Earth to reunite with the girl from his past.THE GOODEST STUFF: The pacing is tight, meaning there isn't a single scene that doesn't drive the story forward or develop the characters in some way. Nobody feels wasted, and the script gives you a real good sense of what each person is like, even if they're playing to somewhat of a stereotype (like the smart-mouthed 8-year-old survivalist girl whose all the amounts of plucky we've seen before, and yet still a scene-stealer.)And can I say how refreshing it is to see a post-apocalyptic movie like this where every human isn't a murdering bastard who is just out for his or herself? The humans in this movie are actually helpful to each other, you know, in the way that most humans are in emergency situations. Imagine that!Surprisingly, the movie pulls off several tonal shifts that are quick and well-executed. You'll be laughing one moment, terrified the next, and then almost in tears after certain flashbacks bare a character's soul in an unexpectedly touching way. It's the best kind of rollercoaster ride because it hits all the right emotional beats, even if, in the end, it does feel kind of small.Which is probably my biggest complaint...THE WORSTEST STUFF: Love and Monsters feels like it has a much bigger world to explore than the 80+ miles of terrain our hero journeys across. I mean, it's not like a ton more exposition is necessary, but the story alludes to other survivors out there and hints at an ending that we don't really get to see. Its story is essentially a VERY small piece of what looks like a much bigger puzzle. It's not enough to ruin the movie by any means, but the smallness is enhanced by a couple of hasty editing choices and a third act that feels a bit tacked-on when there is more interesting stuff to explore.CONCLUSION: Love and Monsters is sincere in its sweetness without being sickeningly so. It's got a great sense of humor, an extremely likable cast, and a fresh take on the post-apocalypse genre. It's the perfect feel-good movie for 2020 with a clear message that may or may not have been intentional: enough hiding; it's time to get out there and live your life."}, {"id": 336, "text": "There are elements of Tremors, A Quiet Place and Zombieland in Love and Monsters.After some missiles were launched in an attempt to shoot down an asteroid.

The premise of those adventures centered on embarking on a perilous quest to save the princess (or girlfriend). In this case, the perilous quest involved avoiding huge mutated insects that have taken over the world. Our hero had plenty of room to grow along his journey, since he started out as the least likely to survive two minutes on the surface let alone 7 days.I decided to rent this movie because the girlfriend was played by Jessica Henwick. Henwick starred as one of the Sand Snakes in Game of Thrones. She was also the only bright spot for me in the Iron Fist series.Some of the best moments are when our hero meets up with a man and an 8 year old girl who teach him the rules of survival. His dog Boy was also totally awesome.I enjoyed going along for the ride in this movie. It gave me 108 minutes of escapism where I didn't have to worry about politics or anything in our real world. It had an excellent third act, and if I was in a theater I may have applauded some. I only gave 8 stars because it was total escapism, and it really didn't have much to say about the world, other than perhaps suggesting that lockdowns may not be the way to go in our current pandemic.

I love monster movies and since new movies coming out are rare, I gave it a watch. The premise is simple Seven years after the Monsterpocalypse, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien), along with the rest of humanity, has been living underground ever since giant creatures took control of the land. After reconnecting over the radio with his high school girlfriend, Aimee, who is now 80 miles away at a coastal colony, Joel begins to fall for her again. As Joel realizes that there's nothing left for him underground, he decides to venture out to Aimee, despite all the dangerous monsters that stand in his way. So was this movie a monster good time or a large-bore?Firstly, the characters are all great. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is a very frightened and nervous individual but gradually grows more confident as the movie progress which is done convincingly. Later on, in the movie Joel meets two survivors on the surface, Clyde (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt), who eventually teach Joel the ropes on surviving. Clyde is the cool teacher and Minnow is the very loveable sidekick. The best addition to this movie is the pet dog Boy who goes with our main character Joel on his journey. Boy adds an extra layer to this movie by giving Joel, and the audience, someone to care about on the journey and leads to some intense moments. The director, Michael Matthews, made a great choice in including a companion for Joel as the movie wouldn't have hit the same notes if it was just him. Also, dog companions are great anyway. There are some other characters like Aimee (Jessica Henwick), Joel's goal, and they are all pretty good as well.I do have to give a lot of praise to Dylan O'Brien as he is very charming and charismatic despite playing a kind of nerdy loser type character. He makes Joel seem very relatable and successfully makes us root for him. There are also some surprisingly emotional moments sprinkled in this movie and Dylan's performance is very good, to say the least in making us feel for him. There also some comedic moments and quips from our main character that for the most part land and none of it takes us out from the emotional core of the movie.Let's talk about the monsters, they are great. They all have freaky designs but still, look reminiscent of the animals that they mutated from. The movie only has a few monster moments that appear but it works. Every moment where a monster appears is intense and suspenseful. There is also a great world-building and rules set in the movie that I particularly enjoyed. Not all monsters are the same as each monster have different ways to be dealt with and some monsters who are not as aggressive which was interesting.If I had to give a flaw to the movie then it has to be the predictability and the cliches in the movie. The story isn't anything amazing and you can probably guess all the twist in this movie since it uses so many cliches that you would expect. Right from the first 10 minutes of the movie you can probably guess one of the twists near the end since it feels that incredibly cliche. The third act of this movie is not as good as the first two acts which were focused on the loneliness and struggle of our main character. The last act feels like a completely different movie with its over the top nature that is mostly dumb action rather than intense or suspenseful like the previous action set pieces.Overall, Love and Monster don't do much new but that's okay. In the end, the movie knows what it wants to be which is the growth of Joel on his journey with some monsters and it does that good. The movie has a lot of heart and sincerity that isn't in a lot of movies nowadays. The movie is carried by a great performance from Dylan O'Brien and I hope to see more of him in the future.

The number of times a studio greenlights an original idea that has the feel of something that would've been in theatres over a decade or two ago is slim to none. Love and Monsters, although meant for the big screen, has just become available to watch at home and I feel that this gem of an adventure will go way under the radar. With a fun concept from start to finish and a real emotional core throughout, I had an absolute blast watching this film. Here's why Love and Monsters deserves your time.After attempting to save the planet, the human race accidentally created an apocalypse. Many years later, separated from his girlfriend, family, and now surviving with a group of warriors, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) ventures out to find the love of his life. With the world now infested with giant, mutated insects, the journey will not be easy. The premise itself feels almost too familiar to fully enjoy, but the visuals make it feel unique and the fun tone and uplifting performance by O'Brien made it all worth it. I've also been a fan of his performances for some time now, so I may be a little biased in that regard.Love and Monsters takes the concept of characters being dropped into the apocalypse and spins it on its head. Just when you think it's about to get predictable, it pulls a little fast one and keeps you on your feet. Sure, some of the voiceovers can be a bit much and even a little distracting, but again, Dylan O'Brien is just a very likable actor and he sells pretty much any material he's ever given. At its core, this is a family adventure film, but it's also PG-13, so there is an emotional depth that gives it a layer I wasn't expecting. Yes, it's a little too tame sometimes, but I felt that gave it more charm.More than anything, I'm impressed that director Michael Matthews hadn't worked on anything of this scale before. His work here is miles ahead of many Hollywood directors coming out of the indie realm and I really hope he continues to get more work. It would be unfair if the improbable box office for this movie hurts his future chances. It's not that I absolutely loved this film or anything, but Matthews' touch was very apparent and the movie felt like it had a personality. That's something most Hollywood movies lack these days.In the end, as I said, this isn't anywhere near a perfect film, but it's the most fun I've had watching a new release in many months. If you're looking for something to immerse yourself in a world that's both unique and entertaining, Love and Monsters could very well be the film you need right now. I was invested in the character of Joel Dawson from beginning to end and the emotional core of the movie really worked for me. I watched this film with a giant grin on my face and right now, that's really all I can ask for, especially when the movie itself is well-made. Though it has faults throughout, I absolutely recommend checking out Love and Monsters, now available to stream on some services."}, {"id": 345, "text": "Apocalyptic films are nothing new, but the view of Love and Monsters on this genre is a little more lighthearted and with a bit of humor. Directed by Michael Matthews, the film is based in a post-apocalyptic world where most of humanity has died and the world has been overtaken by giant creatures.This film reminded me a little bit of The Maze Runner, and not just because Dylan O'Brien is in the main role, but also that the main character knows little about an quite dangerous environment in which he is, that he is fearful and, it must be said, he is running everywhere. It seems that these running fragments were even filmed in a rather similar manner. Love and Monster isn't with a very fresh concept, but the script and the charm of Dylan O'Brien make it a rather fun adventure comedy.Sometimes the environment was rather peaceful, even too peaceful, given that there should have been all sorts of creatures around everywhere. But in the end, this was comedy and the overall script was pretty good. So I will say that the film certainly deserves at least 7.Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is 24 years old and lives in an underground bunker with the group of survivors for the past seven years. When he restores contacts with his high-school girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick) over the radio, he makes a spontaneous decision to go to her colony, located 85 miles (~137 km) away, to meet his love again. It would be easy if Joel understood anything from survival outside the bunker, but it certainly doesn't stop him from going. And then the adventure begins.During Joel's journey, the environment is displayed in great expanses, many forests and mountains. Urban environments have been well overgrown (I think a bit too much for seven years). At the same time, the various creatures he encounters along the way have also been shown fairly well.When it comes to acting, it seemed mostly good, especially where Joel spoke to the dog he met as with a real person and expressed himself in a monologue, as well as in a conversation with Mavis (MAV1S), where his emotions were very well represented. The music didn't stand out anywhere, though I liked the moment where Mavis played her final piece of music.In general, I would suggest that you do not go into the little details and don't think so much about those dangers of apocalypse, but simply enjoy it. The film shows this all from a different point of view and the main thing you have to remember is that it's an adventure comedy anyway. Enjoy!"}, {"id": 346, "text": "* There is no end credit scene *The director Michael Matthews and crew brought a fun-loving comedic film. The story is by Brian Duffield and he has written a few movies I loved and now he has done it again. The story sets in a world filled with monsters and Joel makes a dangerous journey to be with the one he loves. The movie is a light charming adventure and having the lead character as the narrator makes everything feel more chipper. Also, the addition of the dog made it more enjoyable and he had so many great moments. As it is already mentioned in the title it is all about love while the monsters are the wall keeping them from it and this film shows how something impossible can be possible. It doesn't take it literally as a simple love, it is way bigger than that it directs on how to take risks to live the life you will love. I'm really eager for a sequel because this film needs one so desperately and hopefully next time they focus more on the monsters.The composers Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp gave this film the humor and the post-apocalyptic atmosphere with their music. It isn't something to grasp and yet it's just as simple to make this film work.The cast was incredible, Dylan O'Brien was hilarious as the narrator and his acting skills were spot on. Jessica Henwick was fantastic as well and I hope for a sequel for her to get more screen time. The storyline of them was perfectly executed there was no better way to unfold their story, loved how realistic it was.

Robbie K here to review:Movie: Love and Monsters (2020) Director: Michael Matthews Writers: Brian Duffield (screenplay by), Matthew Robinson(screenplay by) Stars: Dylan O'Brien, Jessica Henwick, Michael Rooker LIKES:Decent Pace Great Introduction To the World Clever Creatures Good CGI and world building Some funny writing Some good Emotional Scenes Some Good Music To liven up Things The DogDislikes:Action Scenes Are lacking Predictable Rushed Character Interactions Backstory for many characters is pretty lame More Monsters Needed Summary:Trying to be concise on this review, the movie surprisingly opens up well given all the bases it is trying to cover. A humorous cartoon drawing showing the world going to pot, the new Armageddon takes little time to get things going and drop you into the world of despair and big creatures. This pace continues, with little hesitation as Joel and his furry buddy go from point to point in their quest to find love and survive the horrors of the new world. Those horrors are really cool too see, mutated insects and amphibians with a true macabre design that has hints of human qualities, hybridization of other creatures, and the natural instincts of the creatures themselves. It works, and paints a horrifying set of monsters that if they existed would mean much trouble for the human race. The CGI to paint these creatures, and the world itself, is impressive for this movie, bringing the post-apocalyptic world to new realms of high definition details of despair. Now amidst impressive CGI work that will snare you into its trap, the movie also brings about some other gimmicks to help cast that net wider and catch more groups. The writing is quirky, a combination of a self-depreciating monologue, some insult humor, and slapstick/fall down comedy that all mingles well. Other styles get thrown in here or there to help liven things up and it tries to keep the mood of the film as high as it can be given the material. Yet, there are emotional moments that will help bring most back into the film, in an attempt to bring you closer to the characters, or help gain some suspense in hopes you won't see your favorite character reduced to bloody remains. Add some music to help add edges to further liven things up, again a nice selection of components to help round out the movie. Though the part that kept me pulled into the movie the most was the dog. Yes, another display of impressive animal training, the dog kept me into the movie, with most of the suspense coming in the form of will the dog survive. I can't tell you the answer, but I loved the cute puppy in every shot and I think many will as well.Then comes the dislikes section of this predictable tale, the usual manners of a cool concept being pulled into a short time span resulting in some limited portrayals. For one thing the action scenes are rather boring, again most of the suspense geared towards the dog, as intense bouts of running from artificial creatures with loud sounds filled much of the film. Even those with combat scenes are rather limited, only a step above the SyFy channel original movies in terms of plot, build up and excitement. Thus, the action part needs a tune up for this reviewer, injecting close calls, good character involvement, and some major upgrades in suspense. . But you may not care about the action, you are drama lover who wants good characters well again those moments are kind of strewn. Joel's story is well done, but many of the other characters, as well as the relationships between them, is not as well developed as it could be. The compressed time frame has much to blame for this, as well as a potential budget for creature development, but I was rather bored with the rest of the characters. Sure some words of wisdom were shared, a few moments of hugging, and a few orchestra laden realizations have their moments. Yet, the rest is sort of background noise, who after their gimmicks are lost to the background for most of the movie. Given the casting they pulled in, I had hoped for more to help tell this tale. Again this is due to time, but perhaps planning this out, and not having a pandemic as well, could have helped strengthen the resolve.The VERDICT:Love and Monster is trying to impress a wide variety of people with their writing and CGI involvement and the promise of emotional, young love. On parts they succeed given all the circumstances with a well-designed world, gorgeous and creative creatures, and some well-timed comedy. Yet for the other parts, they manage to scratch the surface, promising more than they deliver in the run time provided to them. Love and Monsters almost needed a plan, and the money to support it, to make a planned series where emotional build up could have had time and we could have gotten more investment with our characters. This film almost felt like a good TV pilot or mini-series, and had they done that approach , many of the limitations would have greatly improved. Still, the movie breaks the mediocre movies I've seen at home, and I would give it a shot if you find the time for it. Otherwise, pray that blockbusters return to the theaters soon to help break the mundane films we've been getting.My scores are:Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0"}], "reviews_amount": 349}
