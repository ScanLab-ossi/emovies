Its just bad. It feels like somebody fed the twenty most popular kids movies on Netflix to a computer and asked an algorithm to write a script. Then it was edited and retold by my five year old. And then the voice acting was done by whoever was available at the local community college. Cliche tropes is one thing, but this one is done with no charm, character, emotion, nothing. The story is somehow both standard cliche tropes AND makes no sense. The pacing is slow so there is no excitement, the characters are flat so you really dont care about anything one way or another.Its just plain bad."}, {"id": 1, "text": "It kept the kids quiet for 1h29mins .

This was the worst scripted animated movie I have ever seen! Even the Wallace &amp; Grommit movies have better scripts than this!

I mean..its not like you can't stop it and put something else on."}, {"id": 22, "text": "I don't know why all the negative reviews. It looks like a concerted anti Netflix campaign. It's a kids film and as such it kept my 10yo happy. It's not breaking any boundaries and the animation is not bad. It's not Pixar but it's no where near as bad as some reviews are saying. The story is simple but it is a kids film. I would have given it 7 stars based on my daughters enjoyment but I'm giving it 10 to try to counteract all the undeserved 1 stars and reviews which is obviously some sort of campaign against Netflix."}, {"id": 23, "text": "I put it on for my 2 year old because she loves The Secret Life of Pets.

Not for your 2 year old... it is rated Y7, go read your kid a book or play with them. If you aren't actually watching it may be hard to follow the story. Giggled and laughed during the movie, easy to follow plot, definitely rags on rich snobs, touches on the hardships some face in life and calls out for the unity for the 99% against the 1%.Spoilers: 1) No one dies 2) Bad animals singing is supposed to be bad 3) Isn't a musical"}, {"id": 27, "text": "Uh oh, Netflix, this is a huge step down for you.

I'm one who does their best to finish movies I start so I finished it and I couldn't wait for it to be over... If it wasn't for the underlying bad storyline of the dog finding his owner in the end I would have quit long before the ending. They couldn't even give the bad guy the redeeming quality of changing when he found their long lost dog. They just made him a robot and turned him off.

Pixar, Disney, etc. This isn't it. 4 stars means my 7 yo liked it but I was bored and unimpressed. So I evened out the rating. Young kids movie only.

If you did watch this movie, you would find a whole truckload and more of bad logic, things that don't make sense at all, and plot holes.

Pets United has an unoriginal story with boring characters. Its parts seem to be lifted from many of the great animations of the last 20 years, but with all the cleverness removed.

There is a very loose plot, voice artists sound very stiff with very poorly scripted material. Jokes, were there jokes? I usually watch animation for the jokes.

It feels like a dream. There are some incredible one liners, and the rap done by the three zoo animals is brilliant. In fact, all the songs featured in this movie are incredibly catchy and fun for everyone. This movie is family friendly, very inspiring, and a great watch.

How they got Natalie dormer to sign on I don't know, she must have just been killed off on thrones and thought she wouldn't have got another job like all the other deaths off that show. Don't even get me started with the Ronaldo character and his voice that is just ridiculous.Then the actual animation itself is pretty poor and would expect this as an early 2000 cartoon film.As for the story that is just ridiculous, the story boarding meeting must have been a free for all, they must have gone we like secret life of pets, wall-e, big hero 6 and bolt and then I am legend and thrown it all together and well it is just a big mess.The song with the crocodile, tiger and hyena has to be said is awful.If you can don't bother watching this with your kids as it is no fun nor entertaining."}, {"id": 96, "text": "Something obviously went very, very, very wrong during the making of this computer animated movie. The only theory I have that might explain its general failure to entertain is the fact that it was a co-production between three very different countries - China, Germany, and the UK. With three different cultures working on the same project, it seems that it couldn't be fine tuned to be satisfying to one (or any) culture.The movie fails in two big ways. First, there is the script. It is an utter mess. There are many things that are not explained, character development is usually near zero, and there is obvious padding. The second misstep is that it is directed in a manner that is pretty much free of passion and enthusiasm. Things plod along EXTREMELY slowly, and when there is a scene of action or suspense, the movie is remarkably casual and unexciting. Even the music score throughout is held back so much that you hardly register it in your mind.In fairness to the movie, I will admit that I wasn't unsatisfied by its visual presentation. While the movie didn't have a Hollywood budget, the movie looks fairly colorful and detailed. But even with an acceptable look, the rest of the movie is so tiresome and badly handled that it was a real struggle for me to watch the movie completely to the end. I think even young children will get some sort of feeling that the movie is being held back in many key areas, so even they should not be subjected to watching it."}, {"id": 97, "text": "For me to stop and review something? It's preventing others from wasting precious time.Premise is rock bottom - I mean so empty that I'm questioning a cartoon.Pets, with their people, live in a robot town. That's it. That's the whole thing. Why?My 4 year-old daughter will watch YouTube all day long. It could be Russians doing Frozen. It could be Elsa in German. It could be rich kids opening toys. I can watch some of those.It's like someone in Europe randomly chose several Youtube videos, added some Tom and Jerry, put them in a mixer and shook them up.I feel like the movie should have a disclaimer at the end (didn't get that far), If you like this movie, you were not paying attention."}, {"id": 98, "text": "As a stark hater of movies like Dolittle(2019) and generally a very cynical and unpleasant person, I was positively surprised by this movie. I mean, it looked half-baked at first, as if something was wrong, but then I just remembered my childhood and realized... damn, there is actually a thing called a cartoon for children. As in - a cartoon for the actual children. All the teletubbies and stuff like that. And that's perfectly okay, we've all been through that age. To see a full-sized movie(and not another cheap TV show), rather well-animated, and, despite all the grunts - surprisingly well-voiced, not to mention not devoid of a soundtrack - it's refreshing. After all the propaganda of Zootopia, after all the cringe of Frozen, after the literal ADD bait of Dolittle - a nice and kind cartoon for the very youngest... It's a good addition to any family collection. I mean, at least this movie is useful. It's actually harmless. For all the violence, collateral damage and whatnot - it's nothing compared to what you shmucks have probably been raised on, like Tom'n'Jerry. Sure, it could maybe be a little less... on the nose, but, again, it's all intentional. And really well voiced, these actors could really star in bigger pictures. And I wouldn't mind seeing more animations like this. Everything is better than Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Ugh...Ranking up there with Dolittle for some of the worst child movies ever. Why? Because there are pretentiously stupid movies. They try to be... silly. For the sake of... some circus effect or something. THAT is actually dumb, clown-level dumb. Movies like this one, on the other hand, are honestly stupid. Because they aren't meant for us adults, they are meant for the kids, who literally don't and can't know better. You don't need to pretend to be dumb for them, you don't need to pretend to be silly. You just need simplicity. And, hell, when this simplicity is better animated than Sesame Street - I think it's production budget well-spent.And, seriously, I don't understand the complaints about voice actors here. I have recently watched Stardog and Turbocat, and while I wouldn't specifically criticize the actors there(seeing as some were pretty much the production crew), the budget and the editing quality were actually low, so much that you could hear the difference of the rooms or placement to the mic. THAT is low quality voice track. Objectively. Which is weird, because the animation there was better. Different priorities, I suppose. But here - you have a rich assortment of characters, personalities, stereotypes and even some singing. Actual singing, not a 30 year old sings in a sound booth while we are supposed to believe that a 18 year old girl wants to let it go. How is that bad? Sure, there are a few mistakes, like slightly misaligned grunts(first ten or so minutes are almost entirely grunts, and, somehow, even these grunts are damn well timed, Captain Marvel could learn some character from them) early on, but eventually, when the dialogues themselves begin - it goes fairly smooth. Yes, the animation is a bit ... short on the human part. I mean, you have a problem when your robots have more facial expressions than humans, but that's hardly a huge issue. Once again, with a budget of a Netflix stream flick - it, by definition, isn't supposed to compete with the pinnacles of Hollywood technology.If your child feels like they want to see something more intelligent by the age of 7 - great. By all means. Be the good adult and show them a world of cartoons with some deeper meaning, it's good to start young. If they like Minions, Dolittle and... I don't know, Zootopia more - then... Sure. They may not be the brightest bulbs in the sky, but at least they can smell the budget. Just make sure they keep paying for it and everyone will be happy. But if your child is actually young, that preschool age when kids usually start cursing, learn about drugs and alcohol, family abuse and violence, let's be honest, we all get exposed to that world that early and no amount of modern fake internet controls is going to change that. So, if your child is that age - then this cartoon should be a fresh change from... well, everything I described in the previous sentence. We don't all watch Sesame Street our entire lives. But it was made by humans. Not Nvidia AI. And it was made for humans. Of a very specific and short age. And there is nothing wrong with that.And... if someone wants catch me on a bias or self-contradiction, I mean, if I hate movies like those Meatballs or Dolittle, but like this one... Like I said - pretentiousness. And budget. They all matter. When you spend a fortune to make a purposefully silly and cringy movie - you... are going to be judged thusly. Just like Superman doesn't work outside of comics, simply doesn't, physically and logically(and Captain Marvel only proves that), the purposeful silliness can maybe be forgiven in an honest and sharp parody movie, where it has place, purpose and it doesn't cost too much. But, for me, the bigger picture I see, the higher expectations I have. It's like in our real life... we can be silly and cheap at school, but if you try that stuff in a board meeting... ahem. So, yes, if this movie was any bigger - it would probably be The Secret Life of Pets. With all the consequences. And, potentially, benefits. But, in its own budget league, and its own target audience - this movie works well. It is actually safe to watch, with no racial, national, political, religious or gender propaganda that modern day G-rated schlock is filled with to occupy the adults. In fact, there are a few of moments that probably only adults would understand, and even those moments are well-toned. So, yes, it's not perfect, perhaps I was a bit generous with the 7\\10, it's more of a 5\\10, but there are far too many 1\\10 trolls here, and I don't troll with 10\\10, so 7\\10 is a sound compromise. Which isn't entirely undeserved. I hope your kids would... or could... enjoy it. Even if you don't."}], "reviews_amount": 99}
