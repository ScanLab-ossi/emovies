It lacks all the trappings and worthy moments that the original was high on.The movie is, for the most part, a scene by scene copy of original. However the screenplay lacks the tension. Direction is lazy, to put it subtly. The performances are really below par. You will have to really endure some hamming and over the top acting by a most of the supporting cast.Some scenes/characters which are modified from the original, probably to scare you more end up being silly and funny. For instance the watchman of the mansion, crippled with no hands. The idea was probably to create an impact that the constable felt someone touching his hands but when he asked the watchman to open the gates, he showed his helplessness saying he had no hands. It was meant to be shocking. But did the writers even think how did the watchman go inside the mansion and close the gates, if he had no hands. First and foremost why on earth would someone even employ him for guarding a mansion.The weakest link of Durgamati is its leading lady. Who neither gives a feisty performance nor has the screen presence and elegance that Anushka Shetty so effortlessly infused into the original. You would struggle not to break into a guffaw when Bhumi Pednekar transforms into Durgamati and tries to deliver roaring dialogues. They end up being funny.Jishu Sengupta is good but wasted in an underwritten role. Mahie Gill fails in leaving a mark. Her inconsistent Bengali accent and intonation is irritating. Arshad warsi is good in the beginning. However towards the end, his character starts to look caricaturish. Karan Kapadia is good and leaves a mark. He needs to work on his dialog delivery, though. Others are just about okay.Skip this one. Watch Bhagamathie, instead, which is also available on Amazon Prime with subtitles."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Is there a lack of stories in bollywood. .

The atmospherics of the horror genre plays from the forefront making the genre-blending film watchable.

The length of the remake was 20 minutes longer and I felt it was stretched as well. It could have been wrapped up in 130 minutes.

Chanchal is attacking people around her - including the psychiatrist who she raises off the ground by holding his throat. She is also speaking in Arabic, a language that Chanchal doesn't know, and being yanked by an unseen force in all directions. A few minutes after the first diagnosis, the psychiatrist says that Chanchal should be moved out of the old haveli that she is stationed in because, he says, this place is no good for schizophrenics.

Durgamati which is a cut &amp; paste of Anushka Shetty starrer Bhaagamathie also suffers from the same. For those who haven't watched Bhaagamathie, this remake might come across as a surprise.The movie is engaging in bits &amp; pieces, the political angle is well executed but falters in the horror sequences. G. Ashok's Bollywood directorial debut is simple and pretty much average. Few scenes and unpredictable twists in the second half will surely hold the interest of viewers.Despite the weak script, Bhumi Pednekar tried hard to excel in her performance but in comparison to Anushka Shetty's impeccable act in Bhaagamathie, Bhumi's performance looks dull. The makers also fail to do justice to the potential supporting casts, their performances are let down by a monotonous screenplay.Cinematography is impressive, certain scenes are beautifully shot. Unnikrishnan P P's editing could have been better.Direction 2.5/5 Acting 2.5/5 Editing 2/5 Story 3/5 Screenplay 2.5/5"}, {"id": 272, "text": "After the remake of Laxmii, which hit the OTT few days back, Durgamati is another remake which premiered on Amazon. Let us find if the horror-drama flick is worth-spending time and effort.Durgamati tells the story of Chanchal Chauhan (Bhumi Pednekar), accused of killing her husband, also being interrogated by the CBI officer Satakshi Gangulyy (Mahie Gill) for the 12 stolen temple idols in the last 6 months. As the interrogation might lead to public debate, Chanchal is transferred to a haunted palace near Panna village which reveals the ghost of former queen, Durgamati.Directed by Ashok, Durgamati is a remake of Telugu film, Bhaagamathie, starring Anushka Shetty, which was made by Ashok himself. As you step into the movie, you are greeted with superstition and blind-faith and of course folks who does not believe in ghost. The good thing is that Durgamati has lot of things going initially which will keep you engaged but the moment the main plot is revealed in the middle of the film, the horror drama loses the focus and sadly never recovers.The second half of Durgamati is laid back while the climax starts making sense and this is where Durgamati scores. At the end of watching Durgamati, you will feel that you are watching some old 90's cinema with typical masala ingredients to make it a blockbuster movie. Cinematography and art direction are fantastic. Durgamati suffers from poor editing which could have been trimmed to make it more impacting. Visual effects are hilarious and larger than life. Action scenes are fine. Dialogues are average. Songs are just about okay.Bhumi Pednekar carries the film on her shoulder. The brilliant actress is just improving with each film and after Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare, Durgamati will be another feather on her cap this year. Arshad Warsi was just about okay as I felt he could have done grey character with more impact. Mahie Gill looks absolutely stunning but has less screen space. Jisshu Sengupta gave a honest performance in his role.Overall, Durgamati was a typical masala entertainer which had it share of moments to keep you engaged - 2.5/5"}, {"id": 273, "text": "#sanjuzzreviews The film starts off with a ploy by opponents to defame an honest politician (Arshad Warsi) by trying to get inside dope from his ex- personal secretary, Bhumi Pednekar who is in prison for murdering her husband, Karan Kapadia.Since this is investigation is off the records , Bhumi is taken to an isolated and abandoned palace which is supposedly haunted by the spirit of queen Durgamati. This is when the fun starts... or rather should have started!!Unfortunately, that is not the case. The plot is outlandish and cliched. Thrills and chills are lacking. However the last 15 mins of the film are nice. This is the only saving grace.Seasoned actors like Arshad Warsi , Bhumi Pednekar(too much hamming) and Mahie Gill (with a funny bong accent) are wasted. Jisshu Sengupta of Piku fame has done a decent job but cannot save the film. Background score is too loud and jarring.Verdict: Ekdum dabba film hai . You can give it a skip and watch ramsay horror movies of the 80's instead....

According to me - they both did a good job.Overall its a nice movie, at leats a 7 star movie - not a 10 star or 1 star.

Moreover, Bhumi Pednekar, stepping in to Anushka's shoes, delivers her weakest performance till date.Playing an IAS officer who is imprisoned for killing her lover (Karan Kapadia), Bhumi underacts with a low pitch diction and then suddenly goes overboard screaming and shouting as Durgamati, the witch queen who possess her. Its an uneven and absolutely unconvincing performance from her which drags the film down by quite a few notches.Director Ashok, who also helmed Bhaagmathie, hasnt been able to adapt his screenplay effectively in Hindi. Infact, Durgamati's running time is more than the original and the film appears stretched in the second half.Arshad Warsi is okey dokey as the honest politician helping out Bhumi's character. So is Karan Kapadia as activist cum Bhumi's love interest. Only the chemistry between them is zilch. Mahie Gill hams it up as the CBI officer. Her Bengali accent appears forced and fake.Durgamati starts as a decent horror flick with some genuine jump scares in first half hour. After that, it just disintegrates in to an unintentional joke. Like the scene where psychiatrist (Ananth Mahadevan) is quizzing the possessed Bhumi Pednekar. Lol.Unsolicited advice: Skip Durgamati. Try out the original Bhaagmathie (with English subtitles) or its Hindi dub instead.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."}, {"id": 277, "text": "Durgamati : The Myth (2020) :- Movie Review -Too much of political and personal conspiracies with mythological non-sense. Durgamati was looking doubtful since the trailer because mythological touch given to the film was looking contradictory to it's politically connected characters. Even if we assume two different parallel narratives, one with mythological concept and other one with political conspiracy, still it was big risk. Putting an end to this speculations made with trailer, since the final product is out, and yes the speculations were right. Durgamati is predictably unpredictable yet doesn't offer powerful narrative due to constant mess spread around since the beginning.Durgamati is about an IAS officer Chanchal Chauhan who is put in a Haunted Mansion for CBI interrogation to expose an honest political leader. Later on the narrative opens up lots of secrets from the past and sets itself for twisted ride towards the end. In general point of view, the Personal revenge set in political conspiracy is nothing new and bad. It's mainly in the regular thinking but when it is involved with horrifying mythological story, it loses all the sense and the logic behind the main course of filmmaking. Bhumi Pednekar looks feeble in terrifying scenes with her sweet voice as it was totally opposite to what was required for the character of an haunted woman. Still, she manages to revive somewhat in the scenes which doesn't include that haunting stuff. Arshad Warsi, Jishu Sengupta and Mahie Gill (oh god, that accent) looks unsettled in their characters mostly because scattered writing.Durgamati is a long film coming close about 155 minutes and believe it or not those last 15 minutes have too much to say which rest of the 140 minutes couldn't even hint. So, it looks longer and boring for half of the time and then one or two musicals make it look even more boring. Thankfully, Durgamati has a terrific background score which is one of the highlights of the film. The Screenplay could have been better in terms of sense and detailing. An IAS officer being a secretary of a politician doesn't seem sensible, the plot created in the Haunted mansion is weak and the childish behaviour of cops and CBI was unacceptable.Director G. Santosh should have taken efforts to make this storyline sensible with the use of accuracy in plotting. You should have understood it at first place when you see the original film from south and realise that there are certain loopholes which needs to covered. Anyways, Santosh tries too hard but utterly fails because the overall usability of filmmaking properties doesn't score high and goes in vain due to unacceptable script. Somehow, Durgamati has one or two watchable scenes in the climax having some technical advances which makes it a Below average flick, otherwise it's a fine waste. It's Durga with no Mati (brain).RATING - 4/10*"}, {"id": 278, "text": "The movie at the start itself says that it's a remake of Bhaagamathie, but keeping that aside lets go on to the movies review.The first half the movie is totally under the horror genre and has decent scary moments as well, there is a visible lack of effort with few of the actors but still commendable for the veteran actor Arshad Warsi who keeps you captivated.While the movie moves on to the old and abandoned haveli, it becomes quite obvious that there are going to be jump scares, but still they succeed to get to you in a few instances. If you have the patience to bear the 2 hours of the story build up and wait for the suspense reveal, it is totally worth the wait.Don't want to reveal any spoilers but the last 30 mins of the movie will truly leave you gasped by the brilliant story and acting of the few actors in the lead roles."}], "reviews_amount": 279}
