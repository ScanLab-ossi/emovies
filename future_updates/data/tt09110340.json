Some would call that stylish. Others will say those couple of seconds could have been axed to add some momentum to the proceedings. But here's the thing: writer-director V Vignarajan isn't after momentum. He is after mood. There's a scene where a cricket coach named Vinod (Arjun Das) - he's slowly losing his mind - pastes endless pieces of paper on his walls. I can't say for sure, but I think the gap between each piece of paper is the same. There's some OCD-level attention to detail in this film that gives us the quote: The devil is in the details.

A clever, riveting supernatural, part psychological drama that fits many genres into one film which pays off in the end. Disguised as a Supernatural film but this is actually a revenge driven drama towards the end with frequent character shifts that are fast. The film blurs the lines between reality &amp; fiction to deliver a psychological shock &amp; that will someday have the respect it truly deserves. It does not register or decipher what is happening but follows imaginary stimuli. In this way, reality, and fiction merge, they can no longer be differentiated. Darkness is a popular film element, and it comes across as striking.If one releases oneself from the expectation that there must be a 'thrill' behind the gripping opening where a patient pulls trigger on Dr Indran (Kumar Natarajan) and series of suicide follows. There are no questions left on closer observation when the final title begins. In addition to the quality of the content, there is a formal implementation that works on the story in the smallest detail right from the beginning till the credits roll. And then, we are introduced to Selvam (Vinoth Kishan), a blind librarian, a MEDIATOR helping people in the library whose roots hold a mysterious past. Then we meet Vinod (Arjun Das) a cricket coach who lives in a flat. Unfortunately, things are not going well in his life and there is a sense of guilt that prevails. It is difficult for him to cope with the death of his best friend. The room where he stays is a great setting and at the same time a reflection of his conflicts and unstable character. The environment creates eerie shadows from which indefinable noises emerge all the more clearly in later part of the film. He has a landline to communicate with the outer world and like a puzzle rummaging in the streets for smoke breaks that doesn't look like one at first. And then there is this stranger who keeps calling him to his landline number. Vinod goes crazy because he thinks he is tapped or blackmailed. From then on, Vinod hears strange noises, voices and rumbling in his house. It brings him to the brink of a nervous breakdown. The strange occurrences lead him to believe that there is a psychological problem, and he is advised to fix an appointment with a psychiatrist. Having someone unknown call you and never being able to find them with this as the backdrop the film introduces more threads in the screenplay.What follows is a great mystery and I asked myself whether this topic of Darkness vs Light could fill an entire film. After all, the tension had to be maintained for nearly 3 Hrs and I think the film does that quite cleverly, but it takes some time to get going.On the other hand, the film convinces with a dense atmosphere and good camera work that shuttles back and forth between flashbacks during the narrative. Still, Andhaghaaram  is a very interesting film, which is not entirely conclusive and leaves few questions. It almost looks like a cinematic experiment in genre crossover. If you like horror films to be clear and unambiguous, you won't have much fun here. Anyone who loves suspense and supernatural horror will be in good hands in this film. Kudos to the entire team of Andhaghaaram for this indie gem."}, {"id": 83, "text": "Pros: * gripping narration * Very good cinematography and editing * Extreme care in technical aspects * Strong script, interesting storyCons: ~ seems slow at times(but its worth the wait)This movie reminded me of classic highly reputed hollywood movie Memento for the narration style. To take a simple story like this, and elevate the aspects by changing the screenplay, editing is really risky and the director deserves standing ovation for this.Although the Movie seems stretched, at the end, i dont feel like there is any unnecessary scene. Every scene has some vital role in bringing it closer to the climax(and trying to make sense of the ending).I am fascinated with this movie as lately its been extremely rare to find a movie on streaming services that can impress as much like the big movies.

As the story continues to unravel the mystery, we are drawn into the dark and supernatural world that director has created.The performances of each and every character is mind blowing.

It doesn't provide much jump-scare moments but sets up a scary mood. I am not revealing much about the plot since it might become a spoiler. To be honest it is difficult talking about the basic plot without giving out a bit spoiler. Vinoth Kishan has given a fantastic performance but Arjun Das just steals all our attention. Other actors have done the role given to them perfectly. Technically the film is just spectacular. Edwin's clean cinematography, Pradeep Kumar's terrific music, and Sathyaraj Natarajan's sharp editing take the mood to another level. Some ordinary scenes are given an epic treatment which gives us an edge of the seat viewing experience. The plot structure is interesting and the immense attention given to details deserves applause. I wished the film was a bit shorter or some portion could have been trimmed off since the film is about 3 hours long and at the end of it the payoff became so simple and predictable. The ambiguity which steered the film this long could be guessed in the climax. A shorter treatment would have helped. But that doesn't mean the film gets boring. If you are fine with lengthy films which engulf you into its world then the length will never be a problem. But I felt the climax was short of creativity. Overall I wouldn't say Andhaghaaram is a must-watch but you can give it a try if you fan of a supernatural mystery genre. Don't expect any jumpscares. If you like experimenting with new kinds of films I'm sure Andhaghaaram won't disappoint you."}, {"id": 87, "text": "The genres like horror, fantasy, and supernatural looks illogical in many aspects of its growth rather than any other genres were cinema took the content, I had also felt such kind of repulsion from those subjects. Here Andhaghaaram also connects with the above-pointed idea. But what admire about the movie rather than its subject is the well-locked and handled way of making and detailing. I prefer this film (for the film buffs and novices) as a study material associated with how can be detailing works in a film? For a thriller subject detailing is essential especially in the case of the art property, costume, and even in make-up but how it must be managed is the biggest question that stood in front of us. The detailing of numbers, the braille scribblings, and even everything surround the film feels fresh and transparent. I'm talking about the art detailing of the movie. The construction of (Vinod's) room, the properties assembles there even the end portion of cigarettes have something more to tell in the storyline. Apart from detailing I must say the brilliant cinematography work especially the lighting. The plot is good in the sense of a horror film lover or comparing with other horrors/supernatural products but for me, the technical section deserves big applause more than that."}], "reviews_amount": 88}
