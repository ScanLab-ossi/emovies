It is a western drama aided by solid performances n amazing cinematography and the film does have some very intense scenes.The dinner scene, the hotel scene with the axe n the final scene, they all r tension filled.Visiting a house situated in the middle of nowhere and that too inhabited by bumpkins/yokels is scary man. Imagine the yokels served u dinner and u r particular with kosher/halal food."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Like many I'm a BIG Costner fan. This one could easily have been a rugged but amiable Western drama, but, like the moth flying close to the flame it gets tinged by inflexions of horror - a disquieting experience for the unwary. The plot has at its center the 'kidnap by marriage' of aged Margaret and George's grandson, goaded on by another interestingly psychotic family of near in-laws, resembling to no small degree the Snell Family of Netflix's 'Ozark', though this time featuring North Dakota as that bastion of redneck eccentricity. On the good side, it's a terrifyingly real situation, acted out charmingly by Kevin Costner with his trademark reserve. But the movie was a little long, with those now clich\u00e9d tropes, the sort that better directors do well to avoid."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This was like watching Father Knows Best (salty version) meets MA Barker and her boys! It was a good story that moved along well with the beautiful backdrop of the mountains of the west. There was pathos and you connected with the characters. I like watching a movie geared towards 50+ year olds! Make more."}, {"id": 3, "text": "'Let Him Go' is a tense and powerful movie. It's a slow burn to begin with but turns intense 'edge of the seat' white knuckle ride towards the end. A tremendous dinner scene mid way through is also simple fantastic. Great performances by all the actors especially Diane Lane, Kevin Costner and Lesley Manville... Lane especially is incredible and she carries the film beautifully. 'Let Him Go' is the Best Film of 2020 that I have scene - A truly wonderful masterpiece with an Oscar worthy performance by Diane Lane."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Great casting, cinematography, sets and location, but novice writer and director Thomas Bezucha made this one a very unnecessarily slow burner. The 113 runtime was way too long for this story, and felt twice as long with the slow pacing, long dragged out scenes and unnecessary still shots. If you watched this at 1.2x speed, it'd be bearable. The screenplay needed a good 20-30 mins edited/cut out. The sound/score could've also been better. Not sure if it was Costner's character, or he was bored during filming, because this wasn't one of his finest performances - by a long shot. Never mind all the bogus 9's and 10's, this is an honest and very generous 6/10 from me."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Okay so I'll say ive seen a lot of movies in very different ways than I'm used to however this is a movie I saw in theaters but it's most definitely one of the absolute best movies I've seen this year it's action packed and to the core so much fun very brief swearing which is another plus I say this isn't a sweet happy Thanksgiving movie for family's but it's a very very good movie for those looking for a action packed good time at the movies I highly recommend it"}, {"id": 6, "text": "I expected to like Let Him Go more than I did. While the cast was exemplary and the scenery was breathtaking, the movie failed to engage me more often than not. That's a pity. I won't be recommending it to others."}, {"id": 7, "text": "The whole story is a short 30 minute film at best, but you have to sit through nearly 1.5 hours of exposition, as it meanders and wobbles its way to the end point. You know what's going to happen as soon as you find out the grandson and step daughter have left without saying good bye.The husband (Costner) gets pushed around by his wife. He should've known better, but she gets her way and ends up destroying many people's lives in the process. However, she managed to get by without a scratch. The horse shooting scene says it all, why did her husband have to do it, it was her horse, her responsibility.People may want to tell themselves she (Lane's character) is a strong independent woman, when in reality she's a narcissistic bully who manipulates everyone around her to get what she wants. At least Blanche is open and honest about being a bee-itch.The cinematography was good, the location was nice, and the acting was on point. The story was okay. Worth a watch if you have nothing better to do."}, {"id": 8, "text": "The stupid wife would prefer sacrificing her husband for the estranged daughter-in-law and grandson is so ridiculous! Let Him Go in the end means to let her husband go as the horse is such a stupid title that just makes me sick! I don't think my wife would prefer sacrificing me for anybody. We both cursed loudly after the movie ended. One of the worst movies ever viewed during the pandemic lockdown at home!"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Simple plot with too many side stories. Who's the Indian boy? Just shows up, for what purpose? The Costner character was a lawman, why didn't he use the law to get the kid back? No husband would let his wife run amok. They go to his hotel room, cut off 3 fingers, self defense? Could have been good, actually funny in some parts. Next time stick to the script."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner reunite on screen, only this time it's not as the earthy and earthly parents to Superman (MAN OF STEEL, 2013). Instead, this film from writer-director Thomas Bezucha (THE FAMILY STONE, 2005), based on Larry Watson's 2013 novel, features the two stars as long-time married couple, Margaret and George Blackledge, living a peaceful existence on their Montana ranch. Well, it's peaceful now, as George is retired from his career as a lawman.Their son James (Ryan Bruce), his wife Lorna (Kayli Carter, Godless), and young son Jimmy live on the ranch with Margaret and George. Grandma Margaret's devotion to her grandson and judgmental nature sometimes crosses the line, creating quiet tension with his mother Lorna. George's trained eye sees it all, but he mostly keeps his thoughts private, although the communication he shares with Margaret is often through a simple gesture or nod. Their chemistry is one that's only built through time (and fine acting). When a freak accident leaves James dead, we flash forward three years as Margaret and George attend Lorna's wedding to Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain, who was excellent in this year's BLOW THE MAN DOWN). George senses that Donnie does not possess the highest moral character, but Margaret is hit hardest by the newlyweds moving off the ranch and taking her beloved grandson with them. Concern escalates quickly when Margaret witnesses Donnie being physically abusive to Lorna and Jimmy, and then he relocates them to North Dakota to be near his family ... without so much as a warning or goodbye to Margaret and George.Crossing Grandma Margaret is like kicking the hornet's nest. Poor George arrives home one day to find the car packed and Margaret on a mission to bring Jimmy home. George's feeble attempt to reason with her fails (as he knew it would) and the two are soon on the road through some gorgeous countryside captured by cinematographer Guy Godfree. Along the way, they cross paths and befriend Peter (Booboo Stewart), a Native American who deserted Indian School for a life of solitude on the plains. It's also on this road trip where Margaret and George are inundated with every possible warning about the notorious Weboy clan of North Dakota. No specifics are provided, but the message is clear ... no one messes with the Weboys.A tip leads the grandparents to Bill Weboy (Jeffrey Donovan, Burn Notice), and he provides living proof that the Weboy clan is rotten to the core. Behind an evil grin, Bill invites Margaret and George to the family ranch for dinner and a visit with their grandson. At the ranch, we are introduced to the twisted matriarch, Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville, PHANTOM THREAD, 2017). This meeting of the families is about as tense as any we've seen on screen. A clash of good versus evil is always welcome, which makes it so disappointing that a film so stellar to this point, abruptly shifts from an intriguing psychological thriller into a ludicrous circus of violence, poor decisions, and absurdity.There is a lot to like here, before it spins off the axis. Diane Lane is ferocious in the role, and Costner is very effective as her 'still waters' husband. It's a hoot to see Ms. Manville lose her British accent and go over-the-top as nasty Blanche, and the early 1960's setting looks great, including the vehicles. As mentioned before, the scenery is breath-taking, with Alberta (Canada) standing in beautifully for Montana and North Dakota. Composer Michael Giacchino is more accustomed to working on superhero and animated movies, and the score is often distracting in the first half, but fits better in the final act. Brace yourself for a couple of tough to watch scenes and a jarring tonal shift."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Great acting. excellent screenplay, lovely to look at, but as far as Iam concerned awful ending. For all its production values, I could never watch it again, or recommend it."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Some problems I felt with the first half of this movie (before they went on their quest). There were problems with the flow of time. It just seemed like the movie kept jumping around, it was hard to get a sense of when things were unravelling. I mean, I guess that whole wedding thing was meant to be a surprise, since it looked like they were getting dressed for a funeral, but it was just too big of a jump without a good transition. Secondly, some of the dialogue felt like it was being stretched out with either long sections of silence, or for whatever reason, a character would take forever to finally bring up a point or issue, rather than saying it immediately (like a normal person would). The last thing is they never really say what happened to the son. At certain points throughout the movie, it almost felt like it was supposed to be a murder, with an unknown motive (to get the wife to marry a new person? To take over the horse business?). It just felt like they were dancing around it without really saying what happened, or how it really affected the family. The title 'Let Him Go' - was that meant for the Diane Lane's mother to let go? Is that final scene in the burning house supposed to be the 'letting go' moment? Then the movie changes gears into a Deliverance meets Wind River (the finale), done in a Western style movie. They introduce the native american character, but after finishing the movie, it's almost like he wasn't really necessary. Other than providing the horse near the end. It felt like his character was shoehorned into the film to touch on another issue for the sake of raising it. At the end in the final confrontation, it was a bit sloppy. I'm assuming the second son running up the stairs was shot dead, because mama had originally told him to go out and get the daughter-in-law. I guess Donnie Weboy died in the fire, even though he was cold-cocked by Costner's character with the barrel of the shotgun. And for a household that was supposedly hard to find from the main road, they had no issues leaving it, and going into it again, in the dark. Lastly, it seems like they reference Costner's characters history as a lawman many times, but there doesn't appear any payoff, other than the scene at the police station where he asks the other officer to look up Donnie Weboy's family. But he could have done that if he was a well-respected friend of the sheriff or some other known person in town. The cop angle, with the service revolver, seemed unnecessary, and felt like it was done as a setup for something bigger that never pays off. I got to see this in the theater, so that was a plus. But you may find yourself fast forwarding through many parts, especially in the first half. An okay effort, but it doesn't feel like it was developed really well. More padding just to get it close to the 2 hour mark, and sadly hints of ideas or directions that never materialize."}, {"id": 13, "text": "I'll make this short and to the point. This movie sucked. So many things were weird and stupid. The writing was definitely from a beginner with no imagination. Kevin Costner(who is the best actor in this movie) had very few lines as if he had an issue with talking. They made Diane Lane out to be some sort of 70 year old sex symbol - totally weird and completely unrealistic. Diane's acting was bad. The story is about taking back a grandson that is possibly abused by his step-father. Costner and Lane go on a road trip and literally show up with a chip on their shoulder and make a bad situation so much worse. The entire story is unrealistic and stupid. This movie is close to 2 hours long - yet there is no substance due to crappy writing. Bottom line - stupid movie."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Great acting. Absolutely amazing scenery. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are both two of the best actors today. It makes this movie worth seeing. It is refreshing to see a movie void of special effects and one that relies on great acting to carry it. The story also was first rate."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Covid 19 has been of course a horrible pandemic and we've been living clodef away for the modt part since March. Going to the movies has been my favorite thing to do since i was a kid. I love film, and even though I have a nice home theater at home there us nothing like going to a theater and view a film the way it was meant to be. Of course the studios pulled every big release until next year and when the movie theaters opened they were forced to play older films and pretty much unknow left overs thst the studios had no confidence in. I actually enjoyed watching movies that i already oened on the big screen, but the new releases were mostly average. Utterly forgettable.The trailer for Let Him Go looked very promising. It stars Diane Lane and Kevin Costner Margaret and George. An aging ranch couple that loses their married son in a freak horseriding accident. His wife Lorna who had a son with remarries a guy named Donnie. They move out of her parent in-laws house and move into town. In going to visit them, Margaret witnesses Donnie treating her grandson Jim and Lorna badly. She is horrified but says nothing. The next time Margaret goes to visit, they are gone. Worried, she asks around and decides to look for her grandson. She tells George what she saw and they decide to search together. They find out where Donnie's family lives and go to the Dakotas to look. They find out that Donnie's family us dangerous and are warned to be careful. They are taken to the family house by Billy Weboy slimily played by Jeffery Donavan. They meet the matriarch of the Weboys Blanche played by Leslie Manville. Shevreally is good as Blanche but you know where the movie is going because she is really hamming it up as a crazy, as a crazy domineering mother. The Blackledges see the dangerous situation that Jimmy and Lorna are in so they try to convince her to come back with them. The Weboys find out and tge film turns pretty violent. The weboys attack George and Blanche and warn them to leave them alone or they will hurt their grandchild. The last act is basically a revenge, rescue story.The film is not incredibly original but the performances are very good. Diane Lane is great. Kevin Costner is a good also. They have a good chemistry as an older couple that have gone through alot of pain but still love each other. The focus on that is very good because you care about their situation. All of the cast us very good.

Let Him Go is a beautifully acted movie. The set design, costumes and location photography are all top-notch. It takes it's time telling it's story but that's fine. It's not a Rambo movie after all.

It's a slow burn drama that builds up with emotions and intensity, so if you're expecting non stop action, you probably won't like it. The stars play a couple whose son dies from an accident. The widow of their son remarries into an abusive relationship. The stepfather takes away her and her son to live with his crazy family. The kind of people who would probably kill you if you looked at them the wrong way. Costner and Lane, the grandparents of their sons only son, want to get him and the mother back, and get them away from the abusive stepfather. But they have to go through hell with the stepfather and his crazy family to do so. A meeting of the crazy in laws at a dinner table is so tense, you can cut it with a knife. A confrontation in a hotel room and the suspenseful, emotional ending had me on the edge of my seat. This movie has a story and characters you feel for and care about. It is so far, the best movie of the year. Diane Lane gives a beautiful performance. I predict her to get an Oscar nomination. Highly recommended. And ignore the reviews that call it boring. Yes, it's a slow burn, but a great movie.

She caused her husband to get beat up, badly injured and ultimately killed do to here ridiculous actions and horrible decision making. She was not likeable at all. As for Kevin Costner's character. His character's personality was difficult to like. He was very gruff. He was supposedly a policeman for 30 years, but he showed a complete lact of tactical strategy or situational awareness with regard to the situations that he put himself in.

She cooks and sews, and her first reaction upon learning that her daughter-in-law and her new husband have left without notice, taking her grandson, she packs a pistol because violence is the answer to all familial problems. And this is 1951; how many fathers would have survived if everyone of them who'd ever slapped one of his children received the death penalty?It's good Montana folk against North Dakota trash, except in the book it was the other way around. All I know is either North Dakota people are trash or they aren't. The other people are just filth.I really hate movies that have a big portion of the scenes shot at night so you can't really see much of anything. It's so dark is some parts of this that you may as well be listening to the radio.She treats her daughter-in-law like she isn't fit to be a mother because the water is too hot for the kid's bath? With family like that, who needs family? The next problem is the movie is too long at 1h53m. At least 23 minutes too long, but this might have been OK as a 30m TV episode, maybe.The son dies how? Was it auto-erotica asphyxiation? How was the horse involved? And, no, that isn't funny, my brother died that way. Mama sees the horse return without a rider, and she immediately assumes something terrible happened? Am I missing something? We learn latter that he died of a broken heart, or was it a broken neck? Either way, riding horses is dangerous. I just think that it's a waste of film and screen time to even introduce someone if you're just going to kill him two minutes later. They could have begun when the daughter-in-law gets married again. The book begins with the grandparents packing to go after the kid.It doesn't matter, trimming that bit of fat isn't going to leave you with anything approaching a decent feature film.And can someone tell me how the fire started? I missed that part even though I went back and looked again. It isn't explained in the book either. I don't see what point is being made by not explaining the fire.

It's far too dull (at least for huge chunks of it) for teenagers/young adults.

Hopefully he can redeem himself and become a household name again."}, {"id": 51, "text": "The scenery and old cars and houses are very nice to watch.

Costner and Lane are so professional and interesting by themselves you could watch them build a garage and still be entertained. But movies have to more than the sum of their parts. Here Thomas Bezucha has written an abomination of a script where the real mystery -- why the girl married poorly in the first place -- takes place outside the narrative and off-camera almost before the opening titles. In these kinds of melodramas, there are usually story beats developed early on so, that when the climax comes, the audience is tuned in and feels satisfied. Bezucha doesn't care about his audience at all. He tells the story, it seems, to suit only himself. Just like the main villain that he created."}, {"id": 53, "text": "I just watched this and I thought it was good but maybe not something I would buy.

Just an impetuous trip to take him back. Was I the only one who thought Mrs. Weboy had a few good points at dinner? Sure she was a terrible person, but most of what she said was not wrong. And if George and Margaret were trying to spirit their grandchild away maybe they could have had a plan? Approached Bill Weboy differently? Maybe faked some friendliness at the house? They basically threw all their plans on the table and challenged the family to stop them. Also, what about Peter? A guy with no real home, no one in his life. He risked his own life to help Margaret and George (not long after that weird scene in which Margaret idealizes about staying in Peter's cabin from then on). Did they think to offer him a home? A family? Maybe he could understand the boy or help to raise him? Nope. Just see ya. An odd film all the way around.

Retired Sheriff Kevin and his wife Diane live on a ranch in Montana with their son, his wife and their new baby.

Earlier, Zack Snyder's Man of Steel (2013) coupled Costner and Lane as Jonathan and Martha Kent, the stepparents who took in the orphaned Kal-El, aka Superman and raised him as their own son. In Let Him Go, Costner plays retired county sheriff George Blackledge. Quietly living with his wife Margaret Blackledge (Diane Lane of Streets of Fire) and his son's family, he operates a modest little horse ranch. When their only son dies in a freak riding accident, their daughter-in-law Lorna (Kayli Carter of Bad Education) remarries. Unfortunately, she makes the ghastly mistake of selecting an abusive spouse. Never are we told why Lorna exercised such appallingly bad judgment. Not only does this contemptible varmint treat her grandson like a punching bag in public, but he also smacks Lorna around without a qualm.Initially, Margaret had planned to embark on this road trip alone with every intention of returning with their grandson. George refuses to let Margaret go by herself. Imagine George's surprise when he discovers Margaret has cached his trusty old service revolver beneath the front seat! This unforgettable film chronicles their search and the adversaries with whom they clash after they track down their grandson. Too late the Blackledges realize they have underestimated their opponents. At first, melancholy hovers like a flock of vultures over Let Him Go as the Blackledges cruise along the lonely highways in their vintage station wagon to reunite with their grandson. After they locate the child in North Dakota, George and Margaret must contend with their stepson-in-law's mother and her opposition to their presence. British actress Lesley Manville dominates this epic with her psychotic performance as murderous matriarch Blanche Weboy. Riding roughshod over her own sons as well as the Blackledges, Blanche paves the way for a finale as startling as it is tragic.Let Him Go ladles out irony galore as we watch the Blackledge family at breakfast. James Blackledge (Ryan Bruce of Sinsters) dances around Lorna in the kitchen like a live wire, while she cooks breakfast with one hand and cradles their son with the other. Everybody appears jubilant that fine morning until later when James' horse, which he had groomed earlier before he rode off on it, returns home with an empty saddle. Margaret is playing grandma with her grandson when she spots the empty saddle and rushes out to her husband. Catching up James' horse, George swings astride and rides off. Eventually, he finds James sprawled lifelessly on his back near a stream with his sightless eyes staring into eternity. No sooner has James died than George and Margaret are seen dressing up in their finest to witness Lorna's marriage to a lackluster looking fellow, Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain of Kong: Skull Island), in a stark marriage ceremony. Naturally, Lorna moves out of the Blackledge house, and Donnie and she rent a bare bones apartment in town.In the grocery store parking lot, Margaret witnesses a heartwarming spectacle. Donnie, Lorna, and Lorna's son Jimmy (newcomer Bram Hornung) are enjoying vanilla ice cream cones, until Jimmy drops his ice cream and Donnie smacks him. Lorna tries to intervene, and Donnie lashes out at her, too. Margaret ignores the car pulling up behind her as she watches with riveting eyes as this scene occurs. Later, when she tries to visit Lorna and Jimmy, their apartment house landlord informs her the family has packed up and left. Margaret is crushed when she learns they have cleared out without saying goodbye. She fears for both James and Lorna and then resolves to bring Jimmy back, despite whatever the consequences. Naturally, when George learns about his wife's audacious plans, he ponders what part he must play. Stubbornly, he insists on doing the driving. They load up their Chevy station wagon with enough provisions so they can camp out in the wilderness rather than lodge in a hotel.Along the way, a sympathetic lawman, Sheriff Nevelson (Bradley Stryker of Bruce Almighty), befriends them and puts them up for the night in his immaculate jail cells. Later, Nevelson suggests where they should launch their inquiries. When the Blackledges notify one of Donnie's distant relatives that they're searching for Donnie Weboy, the relative smiles and tells them the Weboys will find them before they find the Weboys. The Blackledges drive into North Dakota and meet Donnie's closest relative, Bill Weboy (Jeffrey Donovan of Honest Thief), and the atmosphere turns ugly. Revealing anything else about what lies in wait for the unsuspecting Blackledges would spoil the slam-bang, combustible ending.Margaret is prepared to break the law to retrieve little Jimmy. Moreover, she is perfectly content to sacrifice the life of her own husband to accomplish her goal. Eventually, the Blackledges persuade an apprehensive Lorna, who is being held against her will, to flee from the Weboys. Screen veterans that they are, Costner and Lane are believable as a seasoned married couple who accept each other's shortcomings. Diane acts with her heart rather than her head, and this places George in jeopardy. Writer &amp; director Thomas Bezucha milks the suspense for maximum effect when the Blackledges find themselves at the mercy of Blanche and her brawny boys. Clocking in just shy of two hours, Let Him Go qualifies as a brooding melodrama that takes some darkly sinister turns during its second half. Comic relief is conspicuously absent as the pressure cooker tension boils over and all Hades erupts in the final quarter hour. Lenser Guy Godfree's long shots of the mountainous Montana and North Dakota terrain are as spectacular as the gloomy Rembrandt lighting in the Weboy mansion when the two families clash.

But a few years later, Lorna marries bad-un Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain) and disappears back to Donnie's hillbilly extended family in the wilds of North Dakota, led by the fearsome Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville). Fearing for the child's wellbeing, Margaret drags retired Sheriff George on a dangerous journey to rescue the child.There are strong similarities in this story with a sub-plot of the excellent Ozark, where the psychopathic Darlene Snell (Lisa Emery) is intent on having a child to grow up with on her remote ranch. The sense of tension there is recreated here, exacerbated by the movie's extremely slow (read glacial) pace in its early stages. It's the same sort of rising dread that I felt with Nocturnal Animals. This reaches its peak at a tense standoff over lamb chops at the Weboy ranch, but we are probably half-way into the film by then.The slow pace however is broken by a couple of extremely violent scenes that earn the movie its UK-15 certificate. One (no spoilers here!) harks back to another Kevin Costner blockbuster where he was a bit luckier! And the finale turns a slightly sleepy tale of two old folks into an 'all guns blazing' action western that's highly unexpected. Although you could argue that this is tonally extremely uneven, it works and makes the movie a lot more memorable than it otherwise would be.The standout leading performance here is the one from Diane Lane as the mentally tortured Granny pursuing her convictions across the country. Here writer/director Thomas Bezucha gives the character full rein. It's a memorable 'strong female' part, that would have been dominated by the male lead in the writing of films a few years back. Lane delivers a dramatic and rock-solid performance that has Oscar nomination written all over it.I'm also a big fan of Kevin Costner, not just because he's a solid and reliable actor over many years. I always remember him gamely appearing as The Postman/'propeller-guy' in Billy Crystal's hilarious montage opening for the 70th Academy Awards. Anyhow, here he has his meatiest dramatic role in many years, and delivers fully on it. Top job, although I suspect this may not be his year for his elusive Best Actor award.Finally, rounding out the Oscar hopefuls is the brilliant Lesley Manville as Blanche Weboy. It's a dream of a role for the Brighton-born star, nominated of course for the Best Supporting Actress two years ago for Phantom Thread. And she is genuinely chilling here, firing on all cylinders like some sort of deranged Bette Davis on speed. She's used sparingly in the movie, but that makes her scenes all the more memorable. Another nomination perhaps? I'd predict so, yes.I found this to be an uncomfortable watch, since I found myself in a moral quandary with the storyline. It's clear that Margaret is genuinely concerned for the safety of Jimmy (and less so, Lorna). Yet, what she is ultimately prepared to do is consider child abduction, when the law if probably on the side of the other party. Sure, the lifestyle and attitudes of the Weboys are alien to this more traditional Granny. But although Blanche rules with a Victorian-level of grit, isn't she - at least before any of her more vicious tendencies emerge - entitled to do that? The film firmly roots itself behind the Blackledge's as the good guys, but the script cleverly has you questioning that at various points,Two technical categories in Let Him Go are also worthy of note. The cinematography is by Guy Godfree, and the sweeping vistas of Montana and North Dakota (actually Alberta in Canada!) are gloriously delivered. And the music by Michael Giacchino - one of my favourite composers - is cello-heavy and fitting for the sombre storyline. I always assess the quality of a score by whether I annoy the cinema cleaners by sitting until the last of the end credits have rolled, and this is one I did that to.As the last movie I see before Christmas, Let Him Go is not exactly a feelgood festive offering. It's a well-crafted and thoughtful story, but not one to make you feel good inside, for the reasons outlined above. If you are a movie-lover though, then it's an interesting watch, if only for the fine acting performances on offer.(For the full graphical review, please check out Bob the Movie Man on the web. Thanks.)"}, {"id": 117, "text": "This new Western blends elements of noir, drama, and suspense to create a generally searing character study. Set in the 1960s, it tells the story of a retired sheriff (Kevin Costner) and his wife (Diane Lane.) Their young grandson has been spending time with his stepfather, whom they view as suspicious and is married to their son's widow. The leading couple leaves from Montana to the Dakotas to visit their step-family and try to get their grandson back, but things go south very quickly. The performances are generally powerful all around. Costner and Lane give clear emotional depth as well as a real sense of genuineness and urgency while in character. They feel haunted with grief from the death of their son, yet also proactively driven by a strong desire to ensure their grandson is properly treated. The film's cinematography of the Great Plains is gorgeous (although it was actually filmed in Alberta, Canada,) and the score is also quietly powerful.In the second half of the film, the dramatic tension is gradually increased both through the slow-burn tone as well as the dialogue. The film's gritty and slow-burn style may remind viewers of thrillers written and/or directed by Taylor Sheridan. Without going into any detail, suffice it to say that characters' instincts may be brought to a boiling point. However, the sudden and occasionally uneven increases in dramatic tension as well as violence do not always feel conducive to the film's tone. As a result, the film doesn't quite comment as starkly on its characters' behaviors or the nature of violence as thoughtfully as it intends to. The motivations of the characters are also rather predictable, and outside of Costner and Lane's characters, I did not find the rest of them to be especially engaging. Even though the characters are well-developed, the roles they play in creating some of the story's suspense are not inherently unique. That said, this is still a well-acted and well-shot thriller that should please patient viewers that know what they're in for. 7/10"}, {"id": 118, "text": "Kevin and Diane make a good movie couple and they go good together in this western drama set in the 60's. I wouldn't say this is a thriller as almost all the scenes are predictable once they start and the pace is quite slow. The scenery is a nice touch for people who haven't seen the Alberta/Montana area but it's not a reason to watch this.For the most part I felt like I was waiting for the good part of the movie and then it ended and I was left still waiting. There are many scenes with dialogue that feels forced and it just make for an entertaining movie.For all the hype that the reviewers have been giving on here for Oscars and 10stars I can only assume that since the virus stuff has the theaters mostly empty, the studios are putting out their bare bones stuff. And that's what this movie is. Filler. Until things clear up and the better movies can be released upon a paying audience movies will continue to be of this quality."}, {"id": 119, "text": "The beginning of the movie is an excellent use of show; not tell as the dialogue is very spare. The settings are fabulous.The story is really about Diane Lane's character. Her love for her family and what she will do for it.The Weboy family is really evil and very convincing.Lane and Costner are exceptional.The little boy in the movie is now about my age so I really connected with him and his mom.The third act is action packed.I loved all the period details including the Red Owl store in Montana."}, {"id": 120, "text": "Let Him Go is a western-gothic crime thriller with a North Western setting and some resemblance to vintage oaters like The Searchers. The search has elemental film roots with mental and physical violence enhanced by Leslie Manville as a bad grandma and her wicked sons.It's fun to see the bad guys get roughed up. It's also satisfying to see the searching-for-family motif of contemporary super-hero films played out in the Western plains even if it was filmed in Calgary. The craggy mountains and little towns complement the late fifties setting when love and crime occur in simple but stark ways.Retired Montana Sheriff George (Kevin Costner) and his wife, Margaret (Diane Lane), search for their grandson, Jimmy (Bram Hornung and Otto Hornung) after the death of their son, James (Ryan Bruce). Former daughter in law Lorna (Kavli Carter) has left abruptly with new husband, Donny Weboy (Will Britain), and grandson, relocating under duress to North Dakota and his family- Weboy territory where matriarch Blanche (Manville) wields absolute power. Very bad move. The chase begins.Lane and Costner are in top-aging form, tough and tenderhearted enough to fight the Weboy clan for the grandson. This is a different, more nuanced role for them when they were Superman's parents. Let Him Go adds an authenticity to the thriller formula by emphasizing the devotion of the loving couple to each other and their quest to keep the family whole, or at least provide a fitting family life for their grandson.The usual Western tropes apply like the corrupt sheriff, bad grandma and sons, the kind stranger, the tough mother, and the epic ending battle. What goes beyond the formula is the sincere love propelling the plot and corralling our hearts. And, of course, the fully-seasoned Lane and Costner.Let Him Go is much more than the genre it represents."}, {"id": 121, "text": "There was a point about a quarter of the way through 'Let Him Go' where I was questioning the protagonist's motives and whether they were entitled to be doing what they appeared to be trying to do. As if the film recognised this may be an issue with audiences, they then do an excellent job from that point onwards of justifying their actions. The characters created in this film on both sides of the ledger are excellent. The heroes are people we can genuinely root for and care about their fate, and the villains are truly horrendous people who we want to meet the worst fate.I really enjoyed the chemistry between Diane Lane and Kevin Costner in this film. It was quite a unique relationship they had, one that isn't often seen in film, yet it felt much more realistic than what we usually get - and that's why I think it worked. I know elder couples who are exactly like these two were. I have to say the whole cast were great, but I also have to give special mention to Jeffrey Donovan. He's so good, especially in these types of roles. He has the perfect balance between being pure evil and being a potentially genuinely nice guy who could trick you into falling for his charms.'Let Him Go' deals with an awful situation that I imagine happens more often than we realise. It obviously ramps it up another level to make it more theatrical, but at the heart of the story remains a genuinely heart-breaking situation. This film works as both a drama and an action/thriller equally. Both genres are handled extremely well. I had a great time with this movie and would highly recommend people check it out."}, {"id": 122, "text": "And I should've listened.The start is rushed and although you get some foreshadowing with the pushy grandma/pushed out daughter-in-law behaviour it left me with no real reason to care about the daughter-in-law. The grandma is annoying in general with her it is all about me behaviour. There is some nice tension, similar to the kind you'd find in a Shane Meadows film, when we finally start meeting Weboys but then we meet grandma Weboy and what a ridiculous character she is. After this meeting everybody's terribleness meter is cranked up to 11 (the policeman in the local hospital being peak we are evil here.)Then the ending. I get that we are meant to see how a guy who can't hold a bowl anymore is so moved by his wife's pain that he decides he has to get his son's son back but I'm pretty sure he would've just stayed in bed if we wanted to stay anywhere near a rational human. Yeah, yeah I know its a film but it was so dumb. The big fire did look quite nice, though.Personally, the film I wanted to see was Mr. Gruff and Mrs. Annoying inviting Pete back home after they first meet him and their new life together skinning animals and breaking in horses.This year has been pretty terrible for films. Vivarium is still the worst I have seen in 2020 and this is a lot better than most from this year but that still doesn't make it a good film. It drags in places, the story is paper thin, and it does get pretty ridiculous.A 4 feels about right."}, {"id": 123, "text": "This is a strong film and a special one I'd say. How unusually unsatisfyingly it unravels, but yet you still totally want to see what happens next. The film is authentic feeling enough to really drag you into it, whether you like where it's going or not. I think for most mature audiences, it will affect them in this way for the most part. Thankfully this is not just another predictable Hollywood film. It certainly isn't unfamiliar territory, not at all, but it's certainly far more uncompromising and the characters are more realistic than most modern Hollywood films; And therefore the film is a breath of fresh air on this basis alone, even though the movies atmosphere is somewhat stifling. It seemed to me that this role was absolutely perfect for Diane Lane at this stage in her career/life. Or is it that she just totally embodied the character and nailed it? Definitely both! In my view anyway. And the Oscar goes to...if I was handing them out. She was amazing in this. I would even venture to say one of the better female performances I've seen out of Hollywood in the last many years. She was that good, and the part was also a pretty interesting one. Subtle and intense I think describe her performance the most accurately. Costner was definitely very understated and subtle himself in another very strong performance. My advice to those with mature viewing eyes, don't miss this film! Best I've seen so far this year.8/10"}, {"id": 124, "text": "The film has a great cast of actors with good performances. But the story itself felt like a film that I would have expected in the late 1970s or early 80s. Domestic violence: Battered female &amp; child abuse were very common topics in the 1970 and 80s. But we don't get a good sense of why the Weboys are the way they are, especially the matriarch of the Weboy clan.Also felt there wasn't a good bond with Kayli Carter character. So I didn't really care for her character. She just wasn't convincing playing the battered wife. I didn't like how the story ends for George BlackledgeThe last issue I had was the pacing of the film was slower than what I would have expected too. It felt like I wanted the movie to move along at a faster pace than it was going. I think the Indian boy story was filler material to stretch out the story because nothing much results from that relationship.I still can't give a Kevin Costner film less than a 6 because he and his co-star, Diane Lane work very well together. I just don't think this film will be memorable. Probably should end up on the Lifetime or Oxygen network"}, {"id": 125, "text": "A very well done and emotional thriller drama with a strong story and characters you truely care for. It was great to see Kevin Costner and Diane Lane teaming up once again as they have an undenyingly great chemistry and you perfectly believe them being an happily in love old couple. Kevin Costner gives a very warm and fatherly performance. He shares a certain calmness with his character which is quite comforting and needed considering the circumstances the characters find themselves in. A beautiful and quiet performance. Diane Lane shows off more emotions and she follows her characer during different stages of character development making her unpredictable in many ways, although at first you thought its a very predictable character. She really lived it and created it way above of what was written ont he paper. A great performance. Lesley Manville gets to play a rather loud and kind of cartoonish character but she still manages to perfectly balance it between overacting and giving it depths. She is really good - scary at times and gives yet another memorable performance in a role that could have been easily over the top. The cincematography is impressive, especially in the first half of the film and the score constantly beautiful. Its a well crafted modern Western that takes its time to introduce and develope its leading protagonists before giving the audience the right amout of tension. Very worth to see."}, {"id": 126, "text": "Thomas Bezucha's captivating and heartbreaking family drama that is skillfully executed and is based on Larry Walson's 2013 bestselling novel. About an retired veteran Montana sheriff George Backledge, and his wife Margaret, magnificently played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane in two sensational Oscar worthy performances, who's beloved son is killed in a freak horse riding accident, leaving behind his young wife Lorna, superbly played by Kayli Carter, and baby son Jimmy. Lorna soon remarries an abusive man named Donnie Weboy, well-played by Will Brittain, who is viewed by George and Margaret as suspicious, he, Lorna and Jimmy move into town away from George's farm. Concern presents itself when one day Margaret witnesses Lorna and Jimmy being physically abused by Donnie, and then without any word he relocates them to North Dakota to live with his twisted mother Blanche, chillingly played by Lesley Manville in a brilliant scene-stealing performance, and her psychotic family. Margaret persuades George to go after them for the sake of their young grandson Jimmy, but when they get to North Dakota it will soon turn into a very disturbing and dangerous encounter with the Weboy clan that will have some tragic consequences. Astute direction by Bezucha, with absolutely stunning cinematography by Guy Godfree, and a wonderful score by Michael Giacchino. Exceptional supporting performances by Booboo Stewart, Jeffrey Donovan, Ryan Bruce, Adam Stafford, Bradley Stryker, and Greg Lawson. One of this year's finest films."}, {"id": 127, "text": "Let Him Go is a new western crime drama directed, partly written and produced by Thomas Bezucha. He has also directed Big Eden, The Family Stone and Monte Carlo.In the movie, retired Sheriff George (Kevin Costner) and his wife Margaret (Diane Lane) have lost their son. The two decide to travel to North Dakota to visit their ex-daughter-in-law and grandson after learning that she has remarried. The Weboy family their ex-daughter-in-law is married to appears to be a dark criminal family. George and Margaret are unsure whether it is a suitable family for their grandson and try to save him from this family.This film comes across as an old-fashioned Western with a slow but intense pace where two different families try to keep the grandson in their family. For example, the film sometimes comes across as a long Game of Thrones episode where the characters argue with each other, but if someone says something wrong, it can cause more restless tension.The acting is also done well by the film cast. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane have great chemistry together in this movie and come across as believable as an elderly couple. Lesley Manville, along with Jeffrey Donovan, creates some uncomfortable tension in the film as the Weboy family."}, {"id": 128, "text": "Don't stays what you can't finish.I received a screener for this expecting a basic movie. The trailer kept coming up and it always caught my attention of looking pretty good, but I just figured it would turn out basic. Thomas Bezucha hasn't had the best track record for his movies. Let Him Go must've been a passion project for him because you can see the work put in. He, the cast, and crew put in enough effort to make this an actual good movie. The opening scene felt strange to me because of how well directed it is. The cinematography is beautiful, the score is one of the best of the year, the acting is great, and the direction is good. What got me even more was that it continues on throughout the entire movie. Like I said earlier, this must have been a passion project and you can see it right from the beginning.I came in most excited for the acting and I must say I'm not disappointed in the slightest. We have two leads we've seen together before, those being Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, and then taking the supporting role is Leslie Manville, who I just think is one of the best actresses out there. Kevin Costner has been sort of quiet these past couple years. It's nice seeing him again. I will admit I felt his performance was sort of dry in the first act, but as the movie continues he showed us that he is anything but mediocre. Diane Lane stoke the show for me. I expected Leslie Manville to but Lane has so much to offer. From the very start she puts herself into this role completely and you really feel for her. As for Manville, she's great as always. With this and Ordinary Love, she's had two great roles this year. The moment you first see her on screen, it's a given that this is going to be a great performance.Thomas Bezucha has a certain style of directing with this. It's good but doesn't work all the time. He's going for a quiet, slow burn. That is to be taken literally. The movie is really quiet. The sound design is great, but sometimes it doesn't feel right. It's great for building the suspense, but when not much is happening it feels like you're watching nothing. Slow paced movies are hard to master. In the first act, the pacing feels very slow. Until the main conflict happens, the pacing doesn't work. Even sometimes after the main conflict has happened, it still feels a little slow. It's not awful but when I think about the movie there's only three main events that happen. Those scenes are handled well, especially one with shock value. But by the end it does feel like not a whole lot happened. And one problem I had is with our antagonists: the Weboy family. There's not much of an explanation for them. We just have to except that they're evil. Other than that, this does have a lot to offer. The acting is great, good cinematography, good sound design, I'm going to mention Michael Giacchino's score once again because I've been listening to it ever since. Maybe another watch will help. And that watch won't have me going in thinking I'll be watching a mediocre movie. I'd still recommend Let Him Go as a good thriller and something to go see right now."}, {"id": 129, "text": "It is considered a drama, crime and suspense movie, and this is a great category that offers wide areas for diversification, but the film decides to focuse on one main story without any side stories or any scene that is not related to the main event The story is simple and almost poor, but I cannot say that this is a problem itself, the problem is it's difficult to tell a story that simple in a two-hour film without leaving the viewer feeling bored, and this is the main defect of the film. It's Very slow in events and taking more time than necessary To go from chapter to chapter, and that killed the tension that it created very well many times.The weakness of the story along with the slow events affected the level of excitement, but it was rich at the level of drama, it was excellent especially in the relationship between the husband and the wife, and it wasn't traditional and distinguished. It grasps The viewer attention and makes him thinking in order to understand it, and this was impossible without the wonderful performance of the two leading actors (Kevin Costner) and (Diana Lane), especially Diana and I personally consider her to be one of the best actresses of her generation, but the sad thing is no one talks about how good she is. Diana in recent years has presented many roles, all of which are dramatic, supportive but important roles that have a noticeable presence, this time she takes the leading role which is amazing and she was so great About Kevin Costner, we can say that he acted in the movie with experience. His performance was simple and calm without any exaggerations or moments of explosion, and this easy, reluctant, was appropriate for the character and expected of an actor like himThe directing of the film was simple and straightforward, but it had no problems, and the cinematography was very good with comfortable shots. The music was also very nice and suitable for the calm events, and I really liked the absence of music completely in the scenes in which the tension was reaching the maximum, because this increased Stress.The film has another important problem, which is the ending, which was very hasty and not at all brilliant, and its flaws were the defects of the script and directing at the same time, so the scenes were illogical and poorly executed."}, {"id": 130, "text": "Having just watched this, i'm not sure about all the 'film of the year' and 'Oscar-worthy' reviews on here, but I guess that's because the bar *is* low thanks to 2020 being the worst year for new movies in living memory (yeah i know, covid).However, I digress, this is still a watchable film with particulary fine performances from veteran leads Costner and the ever lovely Diane Lane. Chemistry between the two as an aging married couple is impressive and very believable. Also a shout out to main female protagonist/matriach Blanche Weboy played with evil aplomb by Lesley Manville (Maleficent).To its credit, accurate representation of the era (60s), great cinematography of the stunning Badlands vistas and an atmospheric score add to the proceedings, but alas, the pacing is a bit slow over its linear two hour run time while the outcome becomes pretty apparent once we meet the movie's surrogate family from Hell.The storyline is well documented already so I won't bother going into min-ute detail, but if i do have a major gripe it's that Lane's relentless obsession with waltzing into a perfectly legal if dubious situation focused only on her own selfish motives was rather obviously short-sighted and foolhardy, as you will no doubt see for yourself.All in all not a classic by any stretch, but still a competent slice of old-school Americana with a couple of decent twists and turns by journey's inevitably lonely end."}, {"id": 131, "text": "Let Him Go is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a retired sheriff and his wife trying to find their grandson and their daughter in law after the sudden death of their son.

The direction which was made by Thomas Bezucha was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job because they made us feel what his main characters being through. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to mention both the interpretations of Diane Lane who played as Margaret Blackledge and Kevin Costner who played as George Blackledge because they were simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned too, were Kayli Carter's who played as Lorna Blackledge and Lesley Manville's who played as Blanche Weboy.

Stunningly heartbreaking performances by Lane and Costner. The film effuses an honesty that guides the pair through the inquietude of the North Dakota terrain.While the film is classified as a thriller, the undying love between George and Margaret serves as the impetus that guides them.

It could've been a little shorter and I think that would've worked better. Aside from that, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are incredible.

Substitute Bette Davis for Diane Lane, George Brent for Kevin Costner, and Mary Astor for Lesley Manville, and the structure would have been pretty much the same. Because the key conflict was, and is here, between female characters, such films were labelled women's pictures, which was meant as a derogatory term. But history's whirligig has brought about a welcome reassessment, by way of outstanding revisionist works such as THE HOURS and CAROL, as well as reimaginings such as THELMA AND LOUISE, in which the rivalry is replaced by partnership and cooperation in the face of common goals.In LET HIM GO, there are two strong-willed mothers who fight, by fair means or foul, for possession of a child. There's a nice moral ambiguity: it's not at all clear that Lane's character is any less ruthless than her nemisis, played by Manville. However, on the acting front it isn't ambiguous at all. Lane is very good. Very good indeed. But she's up against Manville, who is great. Very great, and in a mere handful of scenes. It might seem an unfair comparison when Lane's character carries the movie on her shoulders, but that's the way it is. The acting all round is high standard, but from the moment Manville appears she's the one you're interested in.All in all, it's a nicely-paced, old-fashioned movie, raised to a higher level by a knockout performance."}, {"id": 135, "text": "After losing their son and watching his widow marry, a couple learn that their grandson and former daughter-in-law have found themselves in an abusive situation.

Maybe it's because I am a Mama Bear type and well, let's just say I would've handled things a bit differently than Lane's character. It may be a bit slow for some folks but with the actors giving such great performances, the pace didn't bother me too much.I'd suggest it as a decent, yet captivating film that wins you over by way of the actors performances.
