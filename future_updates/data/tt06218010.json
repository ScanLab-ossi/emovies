Too much, too little, too late, yes? Throw in Arnold Schwarzenegger, a few European retro stars and lots of Russian vodka lime twist with Eastern and western mythical creatures thrown into the mix and viola, 2 hours of silly whack. The acting of all the actresses are blatantly cliche and nubile so prepare to dumb down. I gave a 6 for costumes, good enough special effects, scenery and enthusiastic over acting by all the extras. It's not everyday so many get to make some coin and see Jackie and Arnold buddy up."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Costumes are bad. Very predictable story line. I like Arnold and Jackie part but they don't get that much screen time. At least make the characters has some language barriers. The dubbing is very bad. Quite bad CG and there are a lot of them in the movie. Apart of Jackie's fight scenes, the rest or quite mediocre."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This is advertised as a movie starring Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger but this is complete FRAUD. These 2 actors play side-line characters, which can't even be considered supporting roles, and appear for a minuscule amount of screen time.The story is a nonsensical mess and the opposite of entertaining. The actual main actors are terrible and, I am not sure if they are to blame or the dumpster fire script, but calling them B-Movie actors would be a massive insult to B-Movie actors so I don't have the words to describe how bad the acting is.This movie is not worth going into a more detailed review on, it is just complete garbage and someone should sue the producers for false advertising.

It's like many Chinese films of this genre with fabulous sets, epic scale, and really if you take this movie seriously you're missing the whole point of it.

The witch (Li Ma) and black wizards have captured the two and imprisoned them. One in London and another in Moscow. The witch has allowed the eyelashes of the dragon to grow, get heavy and put the dragon to sleep. The Master still has the seal.This is where the fantasy adventure starts. In spite of the harsh criticisms I liked the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan had smaller roles than expected.

There are plenty of unpredictable events in this movie which makes it great. Perectly performed by Jacky Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger but also the other cast members. im just so sorry it has received such a low score and i believe this is due to the fact that it wasn't directed in USA. That alone can't determine whether a movie is good or not. I saw it and it is plenty of action, scenes and sories mixing up together to make up a great movie like this one. It is really a must.

The only other good thing was the scenery and the costume design.Besides that it's definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was worsened by the horrible english language overlay. The story moved way too fast and was not well presented, I was confused through almost the entirety of the film.

The movie jumps very quickly from one thing to the next and moments that should be dramatic end suddenly with a Yes, I believe you now. or Do it immediately. The CGI is lacking as well.

Actually, the plot of this film is hardly worth any form of scrutiny, while much of the dialogue seems (badly) dubbed. It's also a frequently silly and occasionally very dull experience, but for all its faults, for young kids it will be hard to dislike this fantasy mess.

This drivel is on par with Killing Gunther. I noticed the credits said 'With the special participation of Jackie Chan' I didn't notice Arnold's name outside of listing him as an Executive Producer.Arnold and Jackie Chan arrive early on, then disappear around the 40 minute mark, and turn back up at the end. His screen time is about 15 minutes if I'm being generous. It could be as low as 10 as he is in a few scenes, but he is not actually on camera. So I'm not sure why Randy was so thrilled with his  substantially bigger roll he shares most of his scenes on screen with Chan. As for his love of Arnold's hand to hand fighting, I'm amazed if he does not realise that was done with a stuntman/stand in.I knew what to expect going in, but I was still surprised at 1 minute 22 of 8 studio logos, then we get the opening credits which doesn't feature cast names, but a list of producers, executive producers, co executive producers and co distributors!!Awful ADR, poor acting, woeful attempts at humour and some poorly executed fight choreography really drag this drown. It does look pretty though."}, {"id": 70, "text": "I don't really know where to start, but I must assume that I love this movie, and no critics will change my mind about that. But this movie is badly done that is for sure. Okay so this movie is the equivalent of an American blockbuster in terms of production, an insane amount of people worked on this movie. But it's Bad. It's badly filmed, the action is confused, the camera angle are rarely motivated and barely understandable. And the special effects, which the movie is full of, are dated, they look like pre-2010 CGI, and it came out last year ! The story telling is confused, and pretty clumsy. And the dialog are... Out of this world most of the time. And there are more flaws to this movie it's for sure. But still I love it. Why ? Because it's fun ! This movie doesn't take itself seriously in the first place, it's not here to revolutionize cinema, or transcend it's public. It's a relaxed adventure movie like we don't do anymore ! There are jokes all the time. It's a movie that makes you feel good. And once you've accepted that your not watching the latest Nolan, and that you're here to have fun, you suddenly jump into the movie. And quite frankly even though a lot of the VFX are badly done, a lot of them are really interesting. And the costumes, the sets are really interesting to. For me this movie is a modern B series. It's not a nanar, because as I said, it's not serious, so you laugh with the movie, not at the movie. And it reminds me a lot about these movies from the 80's, where they didn't take themselves to seriously, with jokes and a lot of good vibes (we have a French expression for this I can't get the English one), and a distance from their story. So despite all it's flaw, I love this movie, because it's fun, and it invites you to have fun with him in a huge universe of myth and legends. And it's refreshing. It's refreshing to see a movie like this, in contrast to all the dark movies that Hollywood is producing now, and that really can't be bothered with just putting some distance with their stories."}, {"id": 71, "text": "The Pros: Consensus is that the iron mask prisoner in the UK was Louis XIV twin brother, but Peter the Great was touring Europe 1690-1710 time frame &amp; these parts of Russia &amp; China were in conflict over rule so it's not a hell no premise. The film has excellent pacing and you actually find yourself invested in the film's love triangle.The Cons: Does Peter the Great in this look 6'8? As a viewer you don't get that feeling. The film offers very little in exposition on the villians. The film goes from a they at the intro to a her at the end &amp; doesn't really explain why.Overall: If you think of this film along the lines of Around the World in 80 Days it's an enjoyable ride where you feel it ends to soon. If you liked Mulan even a little I think you'll like this more. I mean the 2020 Mulan and not the animated classic. They are very diffierent films. There is no Mushu in 2020 Mulan.

I've watched a lot of these style of movies and would say it's not for everyone but if you like this style it's definitely something you could enjoy :) it's got martial arts style fighting reminds me a lot of the wu-tang dubbed collection type movies but more modern! if you have no love for B movies you probably won't enjoy this one ... their is definitely a lot going on in the plot but I still think it's something I understood easily and although Arnold and Jackie were not main characters I still very much enjoyed the movie!

I hope you can enjoy this movie too !"}, {"id": 73, "text": "I didn't expect quite terribly from this based on the reviews, but it even got a little surprisingly positive. But perhaps the worst misconception in advertising is the big cameo role of the two big stars. Not this movie can be recommended to Jackie Chan fans in principle because of one fight. The rest of the main stars are quite unknown, at least to me, although it doesn't necessarily make a bad movie.The staging and visual side are basically in order. At times, the effects are quite faint looking, like a cgi city from the air or otherwise strongly in the background involved. It lacks something ... sharpness, or is it intentional. In some respects, on the other hand, it is very functional and beautiful to be seen as a class b film, or one can get a picture of it as a whole.After all, this is an overall entertaining adventure and I could imagine a physical recording of this movie could be challenging to get in the future.

This movie was awesome, one of the more funny ones I've seen in quite some time.

So i got positively surprised by this movie. As said, first you'll laugh and then you're actually in a small adventure. Yes it's predictable if you need to predict it and can't just let yourself go with the flow. CG is definitely not terrible AT ALL. I've seen terrible, and this even in higher end productions (no clue what this movie did cost but it surely wasn't a cheap one!) and the dragon is gorgeous and well animated!!!! And the little flying monster thingy was also sweet. When I had a moment during the movie where I actually noticed the wardrobes and settings I was totally satisfied. For me that was fairly enough authenticity. It's a fantasy movie with a great comedian touch after all, hello? Yes here and there you could improve maybe a little, but the CG is really really better than just OK! Too many whiners and cry babies here, this movie was so cool, something else, and definitely recommended =) Sorry for everyone who didn't enjoy it, but I think that's actually up to you and your silly expectations just because you saw some names and then as they didn't meet your expectations they could have done whatever job and you'd still be like that^^! Movie is great, smoke one up front and it's even better :'D Why does arnie or jackie need to have main roles? What logic is that? Just think about that once, I actually enjoyed them in the side roles as the actors were not bad at all, most of them are also well known, not only jacky and arnie but nearly everyone I knew from somewhere. Also the fights are great. No idea at all what you people are all flaming about^^"}, {"id": 75, "text": "Viy was mainly a Russian movie, with a few English actors thrown in to get Western audiences. This film is the sequel and it is as much Russian as it is Chinese, if not less so. But the actors are still thrown in to trick audiences rather than provide value to the film. I mean, one of the best scenes is Arnold Schwarzenegger fighting Jackie Chan. Yes, you get that! Only it is a tiny little scene and then none of the two actors bring anything else to the film.I have to say that this was much more fun and entertaining than the first. The budget is way bigger, too. Yet it still brought that lost in translation feeling when Chinese and Russian sensibilities are being poorly translated to an Anglo-saxon culture. The result is a fairy-tale like movie, with a lot of cinematic value and decent acting, with a lot of action scenes, but that feels disjointed, like someone tried to edit together three different films, then dubbed the result poorly.Bottom line: a much better film and I want them to continue with this kind of production, but I wish they would finally turn from the business of making audience traps to creating entertaining movies."}, {"id": 76, "text": "I somewhat like and i'm somewhat disturbed by the chosen Plotenpoints, humor, action, and production design of russian Boxoffice-Movies. This one was even stranger with Jackie Chan an Arnold Schwarzenegger in it.What i enjoyed to see and hear point of view and storytelling is alway newCrazy/unseen over and under the top decisions What i didn't liked Studio recordings with bad lightingsclearly visible and distracting CGIJackie Chan an Arnold Schwarzenegger are only here for audience fishingThe action between Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger could have been good but was clearly not usedI watched it in english an the sound was sometimes all over the place = vaguesomeday the most logical shots are not there, like i missed something,"}, {"id": 77, "text": "As a fan of Jackie and Arnie in the 80s, this film is supremely droll and disappointing. I am perfectly fine with a movie that is light on plot, as long as the action is well put together and exciting. Unfortunately, this movie just felt like a lot of noise and movement pieced together.An action movie doesn't need monsters and expert fights to be exciting. It only needs tension and risk. The best action movies are ones where the stakes and risks are high, and the chances of the heroes winning are low. That's it. It could be a movie about ice skating or a football game - it will be exciting if it has those elements. This movie instead is just movement strung together with zero tension, and the audience feels like they don't really care.This is so disappointing, because there is a lot of action in this movie, and it just doesn't need so many. It just needs good action scenes, and good action scenes can be short. Just look at the fight between Thanos and Iron Man, Cap and Thor - it was actually very short, but very exciting because the heroes were outmatched. Rather, this is like watching 2 hours of an NBA team vs an elementary school basketball team: 2 hours of non-stop but boring action."}, {"id": 78, "text": "We should have seen it... the 9 producing companies at start. I even joked about it saying oh, none of the usual people wanted this. Then the mysterious special participation of Jackie Chan - wait what? Wasn't he THE actor with Schwarzie? And by the way, where is Schwarzie? Oh, there he is. As an executive producer. We let the move start. A very weird feeling like... there is something wrong... and then we saw it: we made it a game to see when it was dubbed and when it wasn't. And then there were so many painful oh please coming out that we just decided to fast forward. Maybe, just MAYBE there would be some cool fighting scenes? Nah. Everything was ugly. The acting was ugly. The script was ugly. The voice over was ugly. The special effects are not even remotely special, and hardly deserve the word effects either. When what's-her-name's eyes look half a meter away from the flying hairball, when she's supposed to look at it, I admit I cried out a little. So for the first time ever... we quit. And wondered why on earth did we RENT (yes because we RENTED IT) the movie before reading the reviews?! Hitting a toe in a rock is less painful than this piece of dung."}], "reviews_amount": 79}
