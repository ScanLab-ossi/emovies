Well, it's so beautifully artsy with amazing cinematography, many stunning shots, beautiful locations and costumes, awesome Hollywood vibes, and brilliant performances by everyone. But unfortunately all of that didn't save the movie because of its bad script. The plot is incoherent, messy, and disturbing. I really felt so confused at certain points. Mank is obviously a very well made movie but I hated it, it's just boring and uninteresting to me. What a missed opportunity!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "The characters and the subject matter made this a film I was looking forward to seeing.

Perspective, interpretation and imagination are the keywords and, on this occasion, it helps if you have an interest or familiarity with some, not all, of the characters portrayed and the products of their toil and travails - as this will definitely impact your view on the rendering which, in my opinion, was enhanced by a spectacular performance from Gary Oldman, further elevated and reinforced by three stunning constructions from the supporting ladies and embellished with my ability to acknowledge fact from fiction in the name of entertainment.

Every single review I have read says it is a masterpiece or the best Fincher movie ever. There's no element that point to the director signature. It is a bland, predictable, boring and poorly acted film. The B&amp;W only exacerbates how bland this film is. The constant flashback gimmick is tiresome. The extreme manerism and vintage vocalizations from actors is distracting and take performances from fully develope. It is not historically accurate, but Oliver Stone's JFK proved a film can create it's own aspect of reality by giving a tour de force, Mank is just it's own aspect of reality in a wheelchair, overweight and on sleeping pills. Where is the Social Network fast violent pace? Where is Gone Girl political incorrection? Where is Seven drama and surprise? Nowhere.

Liev Scheiber is amazing as Orson Welles and John Malkovich is a fine Mank."}, {"id": 16, "text": "With Mank, Fincher is able to capture the essence of Citizen Kane. It is widely regarded that Citizen Kane is one of the greatest movies ever made. Orson Welles managed to create this masterpiece during his first spin in moviemaking: writing, directing, and producing it on his own. What many people don't know, and what Fincher is trying to tell us, is that the screenplay was primarily written by Herman J. Mankiewicz. Starring as the titular Mank is Gary Oldman, in another Oscar worthy role. Tom Burke plays the legendary Orson Welles, portraying him as kind of an annoying show off. Of course, Welles had a right to be prideful, he was making the greatest movie ever made. Fincher's Directing is sublime, I'm hoping with this he can finally win the coveted best director Oscar, which he surprisingly hasn't won yet. Also the cinematography is spot on, perfectly matching the feel of Citizen Kane. Ultimately this is a must watch for movie fans and i would be very surprised if we don't see plenty of this movie during awards season."}, {"id": 17, "text": "It's a strangely lifeless rendering of the period and the people. It was as if Mank was filmed in a museum and the parts played by automatons. Everything thing looked right, the costumes fit, the actors uttered their lines at the correct moments with the appropriate inflections and in the right tone but without eliciting any thrill of discovery or illumination of character to make this film very interesting. Herman Mankiewicz was a legendary figure in filmmaking. I felt like I gained no insight into this man (or any of the other characters, really) and what made him tick. He deserved better than this puffed up, but empty, rendering."}, {"id": 18, "text": "The film is done in the style of Citizen Kane...so B&amp;W and poor sound...I can't give any special kudos for what seems a gimmick that just gets in the way of the storytelling. It makes the film feel heavy and dated and in that respect it succeeds but all for no benefit. I'm reminded of the '1917' film which gave the illusion of a single shot but just ended up ignoring the benefits of editing etc and became a bit corny.PS: Cant help feeling that Orson Welles would be furious with a modern filmmaker squandering their advantages and making a film seem deliberately old."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I'm a big fan of Citizen Kane and always heard how witty and interesting Herman Mankiewicz was. I was well into the movie, waiting to see this wit emerge, and it never did. I just saw an irritating man who wasn't particularly interesting. He was insulting, boring, not likeable. That has to be Fincher's fault. I was hoping Orson Welles would be in this, as part of the mystique of 'Who wrote Citizen Kane?', but he was only in the movie about 5 minutes. That actor who played him was very good. He had the voice and attitude, and Fincher shot him in an interesting way. So why don't we see more of him? Some of the dialogue was spoken in a stilted way, as if the actors were reciting lines they just learned. Charles Dance was good as William Randolph Hearst, as was Arlis Howard as Louis B Mayer---that's why I'm giving this a 4. Three quarters of the way into the movie, I was pretty much tired of the Mankiewicz portrayal, but that's when Fincher decides to show Mank's drunken rant against Hearst at San Simeon. The rant was a bore, with no punch, just abrasive. No one told him to shut up. I wanted to. The movie also spends way too much time on the 1934 election for governor of California. Who could possibly care? This was a terribly made mess of a movie, and shouldn't get praise solely for choosing an interesting subject."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Actually the film disappointed me. Not interesting at all. Even it is Boring. I think this film has really nothing to say. Despite the fact that I really like classic films, biography genre and even citizen Kane movie, I did not like Mank."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Fincher doesn't disappoint on the formal level of his latest movie, the reevaluation of the 30's and the Hollywood studio system is visually stunning and convincing. Acting is solid throughout. It's clear he shows the business as a morally corrupt system of mutual dependencies and exploitations. Manipulation on social and political levels leading into destructive and self-destructive consequences in almost every shown relation. I think the reason why it left me a bit indifferent, even bored in the end is, that the script often meanders in many aimless directions, when a bit more of focus and concentration could have tightened it up. Not the masterpiece I was expecting, but maybe I was just expecting too much."}, {"id": 22, "text": "This is a dreary, poorly lit, murky drudge of a visual exercise, painful to watch . Each scene is worse than the next, with dark, fake, annoying backlighting...indistinct faces in shadows, people sitting in dark rooms with distracting lamp-lights and false window lighting everywhere. It is tiring just to look at such mud-splash cinematography. And then there's the casting choices. Not one character is believable, likable, or even unlikable to any dramatic effect. In general everyone is a cartoon or a a buffoon. Early on there is an absurd scene with LB Mayer walking and talking to the two Manks about his  three rules. The scene is so absurd and out of place you might expect Monty Python to interrupt and stop the sketch. The story is underserved by a script saturated with cliches. It parodies old Hollywood instead of evoking it. But actual parody is too high praise. It bores. Same with the soundtrack - a mish-mash of tired jazz riffs that only intensify the cartoonishness of it all. I feel bad for all the true-to-life folks this movie portrays.

A vacuous vessel. Eminently unwatchable. Coppola discussed the pitfalls of making a pretentious film in the Doc, Hearts of Darkness, when deriding his own struggles with Apocalypse Now. A snail's pace requiring a 20 minute catnap for miraculous completion. This coming from someone quite comfortable with Kubrick's pacing; the only Director worth mention. My how the mighty have fallen; this and the Laundromat. I am not sure what Oldman is thinking these days. That movie offered gratuitous, gruesome violence out of left field not worthy of completion. Filth masquerading as art. Back to Mank. What Hollywood movie would be complete without the requisite recycled Socialist sympathies and propaganda. Nothing could be more appropriate for 2020.

No connection to today's media (Hearts to Murdoch); what a lost opportunity! Fincher is visual cartoonist. He has nothing to say.

When he's in charge I marvel at how tone-deaf he is to what is, and what is not, story and character.There's more creative cinematography in today's YouTube filmmakers. I could only watch 30 minutes. So take this review only as a warning to check your critical faculties at the door if you're a literate film buff.

One thing that I didn't like, was that Gary Oldman (fine actor though he is) was just way too old in the role. Marion Davies and Herman Mankiewicz were the same age, both being born in 1897 but the actors portraying them had an age difference of 27 years (Oldman born in 1958 and Amanda Seyfried in 1985). It is such a Hollywood clich\u00e9, have a 62 year old man and a 35 year old woman both portraying people who were the same age.On the whole, the acting was excellent but I would have liked to have seen more of Tom Burke who I thought was perfect as Orson Welles."}, {"id": 37, "text": "One of the most anticipated films of 2020 and most awaited by David Fincher, turns out to be not only a success in the structural sense, but also from the point of view of history, script, dialogues and interpretation.

Impeccable direction which leads to an impeccable technical sector, with one of the best cinematography to bring out the best of the narration and with a perfect sound compartment.

Dull picture. Pointless use of black and white."}, {"id": 43, "text": "Inaccurate, uneven, and a rushed biased ending I'm still trying to get over.I'm very familiar with old hollywood, in particular with the present time this film is projecting. I appreciated the filmmakers had an affinity for this era as well. I found, personally, where they would introduce a plethora (do you know what a plethora is?) of the persons of old Hollywood to be overhanded and distracting. Full name to full name to full name at a fast paced editing was dizzying. I could barely keep up and I'm pretty well versed. I can only imagine those unfamiliar trying to keep up.The story should be simple, but it was hard to find in this bogged down drivel of the first half. It was mostly told in flashbacks during this time instead of centering us with where we're supposed to currently be at and with whom, being Mank, so once we care we can then properly go with him to discover more to the why and how he came to this point in his life.Structure aside. The second half is where I woke up. There were some brilliant moments with corrected pacing that allows the scenes and actors of Oldman's caliber to breathe. I really enjoyed his performance. Amanda Seyfried, as Marion Davies, was the breath of fresh air for the film. She had that rare glow where she was truly the living/breathing character she was embodying and not just putting on a performance.I have a confession: I've been a huge fan of Trent Reznor since 1990. His scores with Atticus for Dragon Tattoo, Social Network, and Gone Girl were some of the best of the 21st, so I was expecting nothing less here. I read where they only used instruments of the era (that might be a grapevine thing). I think that's very commendable but truthfully didn't feel it translated well here. It was largely forgettable, which pains me to say. This is just from the first viewing.I really enjoyed the cinematogaphy and the choice for the black and white film (I assume it was film). Loved the reel change marks throughout. There was a shot near the opening that did a slow fade to all but a lighted room, which I thought was a nice touch. The film had a lot of promise. The weight of it for me was in the last quarter. The film was a comedy for awhile there, then somehow a touch of a political thriller, before finally getting to where it wanted to be, which was a story about a man's life.I've read where it was actually Mank's brother that was tied into the political drama about Upton. I understand creative licensing and the need for suspension for disbelief, but it's a hard turn off for me when I begin to think that there's crucial parts of the story here that people will take down as fact. Stripping the writer from the birthplace (if you will) of the Rosebud construct seemed completely unnecessary. It's been well documented where that came from and his use of it in Kane is utter brilliance. Don't know what the creative choice was there to ruin it.What it all came down to for me and my rating of a 3 out of 10 had nothing to do with the technical side or the performances, which were quite captivating (I was amazed at the voice of Orson); it was a disagreement with some of the choices that were made in the script. The very uneven first half that mostly consisted of flashbacks, keeping us from anchoring, and the choices in the last 20 minutes.The dialogue was sheer brilliance in areas and seemed too overhanded and self aware in others. My problem was that I've seen interviews and read many articles about Orson to know he's the one to make sure Herman got his credit; so much so his name was listed above his own. He also gave Gregg Toland his due in the credits although Orson had his fingers in everything.Orson Welles didn't even need the film to cement his name. He had the 1938 broadcast of War of the Worlds that stirred the nation, the all-black play if Macbeth he oversaw in Harlem that overhauled Shakespeare's witchcraft with voodoo and had lines around the block. Everything he touched turned to gold, especially when there was source material. Mank provided the story and Orson did what he's always done and rewrote it into oblivion until it was ready. It was a team effort, and they created the draft for the great American motion picture. If he didn't get the writing credit, it would make more sense to the story and create an empathy that would carry more weight.It's pretty, but is it art?"}, {"id": 44, "text": "This was supposed to be one of the best movies of the year. What went wrong? Fincher's direction is very good obviously. Reznor and Ross's score is brilliant as always. But the story. What was it really? Why did it left me feeling nothing. Why did I feel like I learned nothing new. Why did I not get the same feeling I get after watching other David Fincher movies? This was a movie about nothing honestly.

Shot in black and white with an anachronistic jazz score, the film begins in Victorville, CA where Mank is recovering from a severe leg injury after a car accident. Assisting him is his secretary Rita Alexander (Lily Collins) and housekeeper Fraulein Freda (Monika Grossman). He also receives visits from the Kane producer, John Houseman (Sam Troughton) who worries whether he'll be able to finish the script in time. One can understand why Fincher decided to make this movie as his late father Jack wrote the screenplay and the project was in the works for years. But I think it was mistake on Fincher's part to have done a film focused mainly on Mankiewicz-yes there were flashbacks depicting the various Hollywood luminaries with whom Mankiewicz interacted beginning with the advent of sound in motion pictures around 1930, but this might have been much better as an ensemble piece (including more detailed points of view from characters such as Orson Welles, who gets remarkably short shrift here considering he was the creator of Citizen Kane). But the larger mistake was to believe that Mank could be considered good fodder for a full-length dramatic film. This is borne out by just how slow-moving and dull the Mank narrative appears on screen. Mank himself, a curmudgeon and alcoholic, is hardly a likable enough character to sustain interest for the full 131 minute running time. Nor does the screenplay barely convey any of the charm (or idiosyncrasies) of the previously alluded to luminaries including Louis B. Mayer and William Randolph Hearst. Interestingly enough, it's made clear Mankiewicz's portrait of William Randolph Hearst and his actress companion for many years, Marion Davies, was an exaggeration, decidedly fictional in nature. Mank even goes so far to apologizing to Davies (in one of the truly good scenes in the film) for creating negative portraits of both her and Hearst in the Kane screenplay, in which he basically admits that he used this false portrait as a means to restore his career. Well not quite. Mank still believed that Hearst had betrayed the progressive values (so ably highlighted in the first half of Citizen Kane) by becoming a right-wing reactionary. One cannot criticize Mankiewicz for taking such a tack but it's the way in which he went about taking down Hearst in Kane, which basically amounted to a cheap shot. Despite its technical wizardry, Citizen Kane becomes an ordinary melodrama in the second half when Kane (Hearst) becomes a pathetic, withdrawn recluse, haunted by the memory of his bad childhood (ironically represented by his pet sled, Rosebud). It's as though Mankiewicz was projecting his own failings onto his fictional (second half) Kane character. Just as both Mank and Welles pretended to themselves that they were above the real-life Hearst (and their Kane amounted to some kind of tragic figure), Fincher treats Mank the same way! Indeed in one of the most significant scenes in the film, Mank, while completely inebriated, tells Hearst off (while his guests cannot tolerate the diatribe and begin leaving in droves) at Hearst's San Simeon estate. Fincher actually wants it both ways. On one hand, his script acknowledges that Mank used Hearst perhaps to restore his career, and his self-destructive tendencies amounted to a portrait of some kind of tragic figure. But at the same time there is the implied tacit admission that the Citizen Kane screenplay was one of the greatest screenplays ever written in American cinematic history (regardless of Welles's contribution). So Mank gets the full Netflix (substitute Hollywood) treatment in a biopic in which he's a tragic self-destructive sourpuss but also deserving of accolades as a towering figure of a screenwriter. Fincher attempts to buttress Mank's reputation through various flashbacks in which he exaggerates Mank's affiliation with progressive causes (in reality, Mank was not the progressive firebrand whom Fincher makes him out to be). Much is made of the obscure 1934 California gubernatorial race which pitted socialist Upton Sinclair against his conservative Republican opponent. Louis B. Mayer (along with MGM Executive Irving Thalberg) lines up against Sinclair and Mank attempts to have Davies convince Hearst to squelch a doctored documentary that besmirches Sinclair's reputation (that of course never happened). Fincher trots out a complete fictional character, Shelly Metcalf (Jamie McShane) who supposedly betrays his principles by directing the bogus documentary much to Mank's chagrin. The coup de grace occurs when Metcalf commits suicide, again implying (falsely) that this was a big disappointment to Mank (allegedly such a progressive). Worse yet are all the tedious machinations at the Victorville ranch house where Mank is slaving away to complete the Kane screenplay. More false information about Mank is conveyed when it's explicitly stated by housekeeper Freda that Mank was responsible for helping 100 families escape Nazi Germany after contributing money (in reality, he donated money to help refugees but hardly was responsible for directly saving so many lives). Gary Oldham is saddled with a script that holds its protagonist up as thoroughly unlikable. Tuppence Middleton can do little with the role of Mank's long-suffering wife, Sara, who has little to do throughout, except basically berating Mank for all his self-destructive tendencies. Only Tom Burke as Orson Welles has the interesting (albeit very small) part in which he argues with Mank over whether Mank deserves screenplay credit at film's end. Ultimately Fincher holds Mank up as a Hollywood icon despite his self-destructive tendencies. Both Mank and his screenplay deserve recognition as part of Hollywood history but are hardly worth the full blown treatment afforded here."}, {"id": 51, "text": "I love Black + White films but this wouldn't have been any different if it was in colour.

The film is set in Herman J. Mankiewicz's house, where he is writing the screenplay of Citizen Kane, while using flashbacks to tell his motives for making the screenplay. I overall just didn't like this choice. The film is too jumpy, there's too many flashbacks; none of them lasting that long. Some flashbacks felt absolutely pointless, especially the flashbacks in the first half of the movie. I would've preferred a more linear way of telling this story.With Gary Oldman being the main performance, it's obvious that you'd get great acting. Most films feel like a film, it doesn't feel like you're looking at real events, but Gary Oldman is one of those few actors who could make a movie feel real. His performance in Mank is seriously Oscar worthy, and I expect him to win the Oscar for best leading performance, or at least a nomination in that category.Overall, Mank was a disappoint for me. It was really dragging, with the flashbacks and the long runtime. I really did enjoy the way this film was made. David Fincher is such a legendary director, and Mank proves his status. But If Mank's screenplay was as good as the directing, then Mank would've easily been a 10/10; but with the way the story was handled, it's a 6/10."}, {"id": 53, "text": "First, I have to say that I love the look (B&amp;W), it really has the look of 1940's Hollywood. The costumes, sets and decor are excellent, especially San Simeon's interior and exterior grounds. The acting is an A. The casting all around is good. My personal favorite is Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies. I also was impressed that the make up department got the handsome Charles Dance to look like William Randolph Hearst. Gary Oldman is always excellent and Tom Burke nailed Orson Welles. However, the script - meh. I'm not sure that I am going to continue watching the full movie. It's so hard to follow. I know it's mostly old time studio politics and the writing of Citizen Kane, but it should be more clear as to what was happening.

Names of 1940's Hollywood players are pulled out of the air for a one-time impact, ie: I had dinner with ?F. Scott Fitzgerald and he said you were a drunk.

How could a director, obviously attracted by the forces behind the legendary Orson Welles, make the same mistake as the subject of his inquiry?

It begins with Mank writing the screenplay and then delves into flashbacks when he was highly thought after in the early 30's. The black and white cinematography is stunning to look at with the shadows and bright lights. Gary Oldman as Mank is terrific portraying a great screenwriter but also showing his dark side with the drinking and gambling and womanizing. The screenplay is very cleverly written with some great snappy dialogue, with some witty one liners. The direction from Fincher is top notch and I think he is a lock for Best Director at the Oscars. Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davis is terrific, very witty and pops off the screen her performance was a pleasure to watch. There is the argument over who really got more credit over the screenplay for Citizen Kane, i personally think Mank wrote the bulk of it and Orson contributed.

The main story in itself, Mank's co-writing for Welles' Citizen Kane, was also not very well developed.

I think another flaw in the story is that it shows nothing of Mank and Orson Welles' relationship until the end where they fight.I also think that the best thing about the film is its photography because it pays homage to the cinema of that time and apart from that homage in photography it also makes a critique of the film business of the time.The performances are good but Gary Oldman is by far the best and could win the Oscar.In short it is a good movie but it is disappointing."}, {"id": 89, "text": "A fun and engaging depiction of screenwriter Herman J.

David Fincher, he said. I stumbled.Fincher has done some wondrous work, and some perfectly hideous work. I was so looking forward to what I thought was going to be a biopic of the brilliant director Joseph L. Mankiewicz.It turns out Mank is about his older brother, Herman Mankiewicz.And it is almost unwatchable.It works on a utterly-contrived visual level. It is shot in black-and-white and passes sometimes for a product of the years it allegedly catalogues, complete with the cigarette burns at the end of each reel.While it has some snappy lines, the screen play (the sole output penned by Fincher's father, who died in 2003 - ?!?) works so hard at being droll it's a wonder it doesn't just keel over. Clever! We've got to be clever! Clever, clever, clever!The performances are, for the most part, shadows of cartoons.There is, basically, no plot, no character development, and the score - by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who deservedly won an Oscar for The Social Network, which shows how good Fincher can be - is so utterly wrong in every aspect. Boys: this is the decade between 1930 and 1940, not the 1950s.It looks nice. There is good detail to the recreations of MGM's back lot in the 1930s and San Simeon (which I have visited twice). Too bad none of the people who populate these well-thought-out and over-busy locations can hold your interest.A total disaster. And to think: critics are calling it a masterpiece and a certain Oscar-winner.I am now going to cue up Nomadland. Frances McDormand has never given an even mediocre performance, has she? I'm hoping that will alleviate some of the numbness of the past two-and-a-half wasted hours.If you are at all curious about these sorts of literary sects, by all means watch the vastly underappreciated Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, which is so alive and present you can smell the cigar smoke in the Algonquin dining room.

There's no real drama to this piece and it starts to become wearisome about halfway through. The actual script writing of 'Citizen Kane' (or 'American' as it was originally titled) strangely takes a supporting role to the writer's alcoholic self-loathing and the internal politics and machinations of the Hollywood elite at that time.

Other than this, the film still somehow continues to keep my attention, even if it feels slow at times. Gary Oldman and his fellow cast do an amazing job with playing their roles in subtle matters and really get invested into their characters.

They consider directors are some kind of a null element in the process of film making and given more priorities to writers more than directors.

This film, above all else, is a treatise on the power of film and media to change the perceptions of the general public. At a time when fake news and the outright denial of reality are embraced by 70+ million Americans, this film shines a light on the history of misinformation in this country, and how a few hats in a smoke-filled room are the ones calling the shots for an entire country.I think viewers need to stop expecting this film to be what they want, and start accepting it for what it is: an allegory. Why do you think the parable of the organ grinder's monkey is brought up twice? This is a political film disguised as a love letter to old Hollywood. If you didn't get that in your first viewing, I suggest you rewatch it.I believe this is David Fincher in peak form. I love how carefully selected the shots in each scene are, all leading to a claustrophobic climax.One gripe I have is that there are two instances where flashbacks are intercut with the present, and I didn't find any payoff in editing those scenes as such.This is a film for people who love films. In an era of bang-bang-boom tentpole films, it's incredibly refreshing to hear strong dialogue and watch even stronger acting combine with some of the strongest direction I've seen this year. I personally believe that this film surpasses The Social Network, but that's just my personal opinion. I'm sure I'll get downvoted to hell for saying that, but Mank is a prime example of why I fell in love with cinema in the first place.I would give it 10 stars, but I do agree that the writing needs to be buttoned up. For instance, the running gag of L.B. Mayer fake crying is finally punctuated by him throwing a kerchief out the window at Thalberg's funeral, indicating that the strong display of emotion he was showing was all an act. I got it, but I don't feel that important bits like this were given the service they deserved.Further, the verbose Quixote speech was all too on-the-nose and could've just as easily been cut to make way for more screen time between Welles and Mank, the central conflict in the story.All in all, this movie made me smile and I clapped once the credits rolled--even all alone in my room in quarantine. I can't tell you the last time in the past four years a film made me feel so in love with cinema. To give this film 3 and 4 stars because it's boring or niche is to completely miss the point of cinema altogether.

Credits to David Fincher's father (Jack Fincher) writing the screenplay, which I guess explains a lot on why there's so much heart to this as it is a passion project for David Fincher.I strongly suggest though that before watching Mank, check out Citizen Kane first and some behind-the-scenes stuff about it."}, {"id": 188, "text": "I was so surprised by this movie.

The 30s were a special period in the history of film industry and the film portraites some exciting conflicts and the main characters are somewhat defined.

I was too, especially since I just finished watching a David Fincher film. Fincher is diverse, dark, and talented. He's a director that has been known to touch greatness (just watch 2007's Zodiac and you'll know what I mean).Anyhow 2020's Mank is my latest review. It was released in November by Netflix and is filmed in black and white. Truth be told, Fincher gives us one heck of a gimmick here. Watching Mank is surreal because it feels like you're literally taking in a flick from the 1940s. The lighting, the set design, the sound editing, and even the opening credits really bring you aback.Starring Gary Oldman and featuring a stirring musical score from a couple of Fincher veterans (Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross), Mank runs a languid 131 minutes. Minus the solid performances and a bit of the whimsical, I felt like I was taking in a less entertaining version of The Aviator.So yeah, Mank is filled with flashbacks while being choppily edited and/or all over the place. David Fincher who's normally a supreme storyteller, loses a little bit of his focus here. There's a lot of scenes where the concept of point a to b almost doesn't exist. Added to that, Mank is dialogue-driven and it is dialogue-driven in the most recyclable way.Mank chronicles screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. Herman co-wrote the infamous Citizen Kane but that sort of takes a backdrop. Mank is more about Mankiewicz the man and less about his involvement with Kane.Mankiewicz was an alcoholic who died young at the age of 55. Oldman channels him brilliantly but where's the stuff where Mankiewicz is doing some actual writing. Fincher sees him more as a drunken depressive who's witty, opinionated, and off the cuff. I liked Mank's technical prowess and old worldliness but I'm going with a mixed rating."}, {"id": 197, "text": "Orson Welles had such a distinctive voice and although he could do accents his natural speaking voice was American.

Fortunately, this isn't the case for the supporting characters played by Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, and Charles Dance.Finally, Mank is a good film.

Film studio RKO hires 24-year-old wunderkind Orson Welles under a contract that gives him full creative control of his movies.

That film is Citizen Kane and this is the story of how it was written.I was quite excited at the release of this movie. Citizen Kane is one of the greatest films of all time and the making of it deserves a movie. And here we have it, directed by the great David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, Gone Girl, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) no less and with a good cast - Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, Charles Dance, Lily Collins. Surely a recipe for a masterpiece?Unfortunately, no. On the plus side, the story is reasonably interesting and the cast put in solid performances. Fincher's direction is spot-on, with the black-and-white cinematography an homage to Citizen Kane.However, the plot is never very engaging. The story never really finds a centre and pretty much drifts along. It's not dull but has a listlessness to it nonetheless. The flashbacks, while adding information, don't help the momentum either, resulting in a start-stop feel to the main plot and a bit of confusion at times.The conclusion is also a damp squib and is disparaging to one of the greatest creative forces in the history of cinema.

And to be honest, it is a work of art which is a must see for film fans. When news came out that David Fincher was making a movie about the writing of Citizen Kane with Gary Oldman as the main star, I was curious about it. This morning, I sat, watched and wondered what was the purpose of this movie?You must be an absolute fan of 30s hollywood, know the names of everyone who worked back then and really care about the little snippets of Citizen Kane's background history to admire this picture. If you don't tick all 3 of these criteria, you are highly unlikely to enjoy or even endure it. It is a film about the writing of another film and if Fincher's name wasn't attached to it, most people would have never even noticed it.I don't particularly hate this film, just find it extremely niche, self-absorbed and average. Despite formidable directing, there is nothing Fincheresque about it, just a black and white movie with decent visuals and respectable acting. The film lacks intrigue, drama or anything human to keep you engaged for 2+ hours. The movie drops random names, jumps in time and crawls at a turtle pace thinking that the audience cares about the inner workings of MGM studios and California elections in 1930s.While Citizen Kane is a highly enjoyable classic, Mank on the other hand, is extremely full of itself and is nothing but a high class Oscar bait. It is one thing to make an artistic film but it is a whole different thing to make a monotonous story without a heart that requires the audience to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of 30s Hollywood.

To quote Robert Carringer, the expert on the matter: A virtually complete set of script records for Citizen Kane has been pre- served in the archives of RKO General Pictures in Hollywood, and these provide almost a day-to-day record of the history of the scripting. Once this record is reconstructed and all the available pieces of evidence are matched to it, a reasonably clear picture emerges of who was responsible for what in the final script. The full evidence reveals that Welles' contribution to the Citizen Kane script was not only substantial but definitive (370)... Herman Mankiewicz's principal contribution to the Citizen Kane script was made in the early stages at Victorville. The Victorville scripts elaborated the plot logic and laid down the overall story contours (398).... The Mankiewicz partisans would have us believe that this is the heart of the matter and that by the end of Victorville the essential part of the scripting was complete. Quite the contrary... Major revisions begin as soon as the script passes into Welles' hands, and several important lines of development can be discerned in sub- sequent phases of the scripting. One of these is the elimination of dramatically questionable material, especially of a large amount of material drawn from Hearst. Another is a fundamental alteration of the nature of many of the scenes; this may be described generally as a shift from scenes played continuously to scenes fragmented according to montage conceptions (399). (Here, the evolution of Mankiewicz's rather humdrum scenes involving Kane and Emily into the film's concise, witty, montage is a perfect example.), Yet another is the evolution of Charles Foster Kane as a character. The principal strategy is the replaying of certain key situa tions and moments in his life over and over again as a means of testing and discovering the character (399)....:Not even the staunchest defenders of Mankiewicz would deny that Welles was principally responsible for the realization of the film. But in light of the evidence, it may be they will also have to grant him principal responsibility for the realization of the script (400). (See Robert L. Carringer. The Scripts of 'Citizen Kane.' Critical Inquiry, Vol. 5, No. 2, 1978pp. 369-400; Also cf. The Making of Citizen Kane, 985). More interpretively. Welles was preponderantly an adapter of others work, whether from Shakespeare, lesser classics or thrillers, whether for radio theater, stage theater or film. Citizen Kane can be viewed as Welles' adaptation of Mankiewicz's ungainly, 250-page American, his first script for Kane."}, {"id": 205, "text": "Much as I wanted to like this film, I didn't. Even if I love B&amp;M movies of the 40s, sharp dialogues and I watched Citizen Kane at least three times.I liked the photography playing a tribute to Citizen Kane, with dark, cavernous, sinister settings and also the few moments when Tom Burke (as Orson Welles) was on screen, which was not often enough.We're supposed to believe that drunkard Herman Mankiewicz, brother of the more famous and accomplished Joseph, was actually the only scriptwriter genius behind C.K. The plot twist is that Mank used to be an entertaining figure in Randolph Hearst entourage, but the relationship turned sour and Mank wrote Citizen Kane as a revenge.Mank had a reputation as a witty man, but none of his scripts were successful and his career was second rate. However in Fincher's version, Mank takes center stage and writes the Oscar-winning script while recovering from an accident and temporarily drying out.The story is told in innumerable flashbacks from which you gather Mank was a resentful drunk who unleashed his sarcasm on everybody and thought he was entitled to a better career. Unfortunately, he seems moved only by envy and I felt no sympathy.Besides the occasional sparkle, since most characters in the movie are completely forgotten, it's hard to understand fully the circumstances. The only clear things are that Mank himself did not deserve a whole movie and 2/3 of this are a snooze-feast."}, {"id": 206, "text": "I'm a huge fan of both Citizen Kane as well as David Fincher's films, so I was extremely excited to see this. Because of how much I enjoy Fincher's films as well as how good the trailers looked, I wanted to (safely) see it on a big screen rather than wait until Netflix. Needless to say, this is a good movie, but not a great one--and it does not quite live up to the quality one would expect from a Fincher film.The story focuses on Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman,) the screenwriter who worked--often tempestuously--with Orson Welles to write Citizen Kane. However, the amount of time the film spends on material related to Citizen Kane is relatively little. Instead, the film tends to focus more on Mank's political activity, personal life, ascent into the movie business, and alcoholism throughout the 1930s. Oldman does a good job playing Mank, and is completely believable in the role. As one can expect from a Fincher film, the editing and cinematography are top-notch. The stylish, black-and-white aesthetic that feels both slightly understated (in the best way possible) and posh is beautifully complemented by a relatively steady camera and editing techniques common to films of the 1930s and 40s. The screenplay is generally well-written as well, although it doesn't feel as taut as you would expect in a Fincher picture, and the leisurely pacing is very well done.Despite these strong qualities, Mank unfortunately is not quite great. The film develops Mank as a character, but he is portrayed in too static of a manner to really make for an engaging protagonist, or even one that can simply have clear ripple effects on the rest of the film's narrative and the characters around him. His characterization is not especially interesting. Fincher probably uses flashbacks a bit too much in the story, as many of the flashbacks to the early 1930s don't do too much to provide additional context to Mank as a character or the time period as a whole. Also, the supporting characters (such as the roles played by Amanda Seyfried and Lilly Collins) are not especially well-developed. As a result, the film doesn't completely work as a character study. However, it is still a generally well-acted and well-shot depiction of early film history that is worth seeing for viewers interested in the subject matter. 7/10"}, {"id": 207, "text": "If you took a group of random movie fans, all familiar with David Fincher's work, sat them in a theater, showed them this film sans-credits, and then asked them at the end who directed it? not one of them would say David Fincher. This film is missing every single aspect that people loved about all his previous work.There is no mystery here. There is little drama. It's a film about the writing of a film, and it comes across about as boring as that sounds. To be fair, Mank never really sells itself as anything different, but seeing the Fincher name and the (ridiculously inflated) IMDB score was enough to make me think there must be something more here. Or maybe I just didn't understand it, because I certainly felt like much of the film was flying over my head, with all of the time jumps, characters appearing with little explanation like we were supposed to know who they were, and the constant 'name drops' in the dialogue of prominent people from the 1930s hollywood and political scene. For me this last one was the fatal flaw. The film takes for granted that the viewer will know all these names and backstories of people that are now obscure and long forgotten. So the entire film from start to finish has these references to contemporary people and politics flying over our heads, leaving us bewildered in their wake. If one hasn't actually seen Citizen Kane a couple times and doesn't have some rudimentary knowledge of Orson Welles, then this experience would only quadruple, as the film constantly references Citizen Kane without mentioning it by name. This film essentially has a pre-requisite: you must watch Citizen Kane first, or it will make absolutely no sense to you.But the most glaring thing missing from Mank is the distinctive dark and brooding style that Fincher has cultivated over the course of his career and that is entirely absent here. Going in, I was excited to see how Fincher would translate his style over to black and white. The answer is that he doesn't. It's just a standard black and white film. And while it looks good, I was left underwhelmed by the cinematography all the same. Something about it made me feel like it was 'made for Netflix.' In fact, the first jarring realization I had in the theater is that I was watching something in standard 16:9 wide televesion aspect ratio. Not cinemascope or widescreen. Digital, not film. It felt like watching a crummy made for Netflix movie in a theater.

However, the movies that are anticipated have been... well... disappointing such as Tenet and unfortunately -- Mank.David Fincher is one of the best working directors with fantastic films such as Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network, Zodiac, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera and luckily enough, he once again went above and beyond and made this movie all the more watchable. When it was announced that David Fincher would be directing another biopic (after the hugely successful Social Network) I -- like many others -- was ecstatic. In preparation for the New David Fincher Film I went back and watched his entire catalog of films. Each of his films (with the exception of Alien 3) is HIS film -- it belongs to him. With the notable yellow/blues, wide shots, static camera and the especially intriguing material, his movies are masterpieces. Then I grew worried. Mank was sounding less and less like David Fincher's other movies. It is okay to make something new and different but I wanted more dark and suspense-filled cinema. Mank was not that -- which was not a bad thing and in fact, he pulled it off! Stylistically the movie is a masterpiece but the material felt empty and that became Mank's downfall.With a David Fincher movie it is unlikely to be disengaged yet during Mank I found myself getting distracted, antsy, and even checking the time! I was confused and disappointed. The acting was great, the directing was once again great, I did not know what it was that was causing me to be so bored, then it hit me: nothing happened. You cannot capture a man's life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one. The movie was called Mank, I was expecting a thorough analysis on Mank -- but I was not even left the impression of Mank. He was an alcoholic and wrote Citizen Kane... that was really it.The directing and acting make this movie worth a 7/10. The story had potential but did not fulfill expectations. It is stylish, playful, well edited and an homage (not love letter) to 30s Hollywood making it worth a watch -- I continue to look forward to future work from David Fincher and his upcoming remake Strangers.7/10"}, {"id": 209, "text": "For some reason whenever there's a movie about or centering around Orson Welles he's always a villainous man-child, and this is no different...

Instead there's this conceited drollness that assumes we're gonna love the character right off the bat because he's so... conceited and droll and sarcastic...Here they shove this boozing anti-hero in our faces without explaining what he's up against, or why he's a boozing anti-hero in the first place... It's as if the audience will adore him since it's Gary Oldman being directed by David Fincher... This Self-Aware Cinema, refusing to do any real work to enlighten the audience, is just tiresome...For a cinematic guy like Fincher, this entire movie looks and feels like a cable movie, which it is, actually, during a pandemic without theaters... And that's not entirely bad because the best stuff is on the small screen nowadays...But there's also a lack of urgency that Fincher's provided in the past, and the whole thing, again, plays out like yet another hatchet job against Orson Welles...

Mankiewicz as he races to finish the script for Citizen Kane and also offers an interesting glimpse into the influence &amp; inner workings of 1930s Hollywood industry through his shrewd eyes &amp; scathing wit.Directed by David Fincher, the film marks his return to the cinematic medium after a gap of 6 years and is adapted from a screenplay written by his late father. While it is a departure from his forte, Fincher's direction does retain the sublime craftsmanship &amp; technical perfection that goes into his works and effortlessly transports the viewers to its period setting. The script sculpts the characters with deft care but the narrative still lacks the fluidity necessary for a story like this.The crisp black-n-white photography, methodical camerawork, ideal lighting, clever humour, smart editing &amp; fitting score certainly enrich the experience but the relaxed pace &amp; unduly focus on flashbacks also makes the ride a bit tedious. Performances are top-notch. Oldman plays the eponymous role from inside out, Amanda Seyfried is captivating in her role, and Tom Burke embodies Orson Welles to near-perfection, nailing the physicality &amp; mannerism of the wunderkind to a tee.Overall, Mank is an ambitious &amp; audacious venture that presents David Fincher in complete control of his craft but it also isn't a tale that's going to satisfy everyone's palate. More a withering study of power, corruption &amp; politics within the filmmaking industry than a love letter to cinema, Fincher's latest is gripping when covering the writing process of Orson Welles' debut feature but loses steam whenever it reverts to an earlier timeline. All in all, Mank has its merits but unlike Fincher's best-known efforts, it fails to leave behind an indelible imprint."}, {"id": 211, "text": "Mank from David Fincher is a Netflix production. This provider of streaming services has produced a couple of good films the last few years, such as Roma (2018, Alfonso Cuaron) and The Irishman (2019, Martin Scorsese). For Fincher it was his first feature film since Gone girl (2014), and a very different film then the ones I have seen from him thusfar. Apart from Gone girl I have seen Seven (1995), The game  (1997) and Zodiac , all films with touches of crime in it. The script of Mank is based on work of the father of David Fincher, Jack Fincher.For me Mank is above all an ode to the Hollywood studio system at its peak in the late '30s and early 40's, just like Blancanieves (2012, Pablo Berger) is an ode to the silent movies and The artist (2011, Michel Hazanavicius) to the early talkies. Not that Hollywood is depicted as a sort of heaven on earth, see the malicious manipulations with respect to the election of the governor of California in 1934, but in the other mentioned films the sun does not always shine either.The main character of the film is Herman Mankiewicz. A perfect role of the versatile Gary Oldman. Herman is the older brother of director Joseph Mankiewicz (1950, All about Eve) and has been somewhat forgotten. He has (co)written the scenario for films such as Dinner at eight (1933, George Cukor), The Wizard of Oz (1939, Victor Fleming) and above all Citizen Kane (1941, Orson Welles).In the 70's film critic Pauline Keal wrote an article in which she claims that the scenario for Citizen Kane was not a co production between Welles and Mankiewicz but actually written solely by Mankiewicz. This theory has since become obsolete. As a matter of fact I think that the article of Keal has to be interpreted in the context of a discussion she was involved in with the directors of the Nouvelle vague. These directors saw the director of a movie as the author of the movie. Keal saw a movie as team performance. I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. The relation of a director to his movie is different from the relation of the writer to his book or the painter to his painting. Nevertheless the director still is the central point where all the creative decisions converge.Does Mank try to revive a theory which has already been found incorrect? I don't think so. The films ends with the first draft of the script, which is the point in time where the role of Mankiewicz ends and the role of Welles begins.The subject of the film is the making of Citizen Kane (1941, Orson Welles). Mank tries to do that in the style of this film. Therefore Mank is (of course) in black and white. The film uses also many flashbacks. The present is Mankiewics working on his script in a remote country house, the numerous flashbacks tell the story of his Hollywood past. In one respect Mank falls short of his subject film. In Citizen Kane we get numerous opinions (and thus a multi facetted image) of Charles Foster Kane. In Mank we see all the action through the eyes of Herman Mankiewicz himself."}, {"id": 212, "text": "Let me start off by saying that this movie is not going to be for everyone, and I fully understand if anyone ends up feeling bored or dislikes the movie. It's wordy, complicated and doesn't try to push the audience in any particular direction. I however loved it.There are very few things Mank doesn't achieve in an almost perfect fashion, this is a passion project and a love letter of the highest caliber. The acting is superb all around, Gary Oldman delivers one of his absolute best roles ever perfectly embodying the tormented but talented Mank, Seyfried shines as a cleverer than you think movie star and everyone else helps you forget you're not watching the real persons themselves.The biggest highlight of this movie however is the incredible visuals, the best cinematography Oscar is practically in the bag already. Very seldom do you watch something that so perfectly captures a different era, this one being of the old Hollywoodland, with great compositions, lighting and mood this is truly a feast for the eyes in every possible way! I truly felt transported to another world and what i wouldn't do to experience that old Hollywood glamour just for one night, corruption and backstabbing aside!There are many more things to discuss but I'll leave it to you to experience this firsthand, overall this is an excellent return to the big screen for David Fincher and Im beyond excited to see what he can cook up next.

That's the real magic of the movies.David Fincher puts it all on the line in his latest film, Mank. The result is a gorgeous and heartfelt film that takes the viewer back to 1930's-40's Hollywood.Gary Oldman is great as the cynical, alcoholic writer who has no filter and rarely has anything nice to say. He is surrounded by a terrific supporting cast that makes each scene and interaction truly enjoyable. It is obvious that everyone involved in this project, took thier roles seriously.This is a much different film than the gritty, violent, and dark pictures Fincher has become known for. However, the attention to detail, editing, gorgeous cinematography, and use of lighting and sound is still as effective as ever.I expect Mank to be popular when the Academy Award nominations are announced, as it deserves."}, {"id": 214, "text": "Mank (2020)The movie that everyone wants to like. But why?Oh, Gary Oldman as Mankewitz is rather terrific. And the subject matter should hold water, concerning William Randolf Hearst and that 1930s world of excess, not to mention Orson Welles and that obvious Citizen Kane connection.But there are so many scenes where the writer is straining to make sure the audience is keeping up with things, for example giving us first names (and variations on first names) to clue us in on who is who. The strain of having to inform the audience chokes the intended authenticity. The scene early on where some screenwriters (including Ben Hecht) are chatting about screenplays and ideas is so forced it's embarrassing-especially since it's about screenwriting.The movie has its beauty, for sure, filmed in greyish black and white that is a softened, more detailed version of classic Hollywood. Films from the time it is set, mid-1930s to 1940, are noticably harder in tonality, meaning deeper blacks and more overall contrast. Citizen Kane is a prime example. It's worth noting that the photography for Mank is generally very poised and luminous, lots of backlighting and delineated grey scales, not much like the photography in Kane.Now you might expect the film to grow into its own vocabulary, to have a style of its own whatever the borrowings of its substance. But no, the script is stubbornly derivative and simplistic (almost as if the writers were in their 20s and just discovering Hollywood, and literature). And the reason for this is as old as the hills-the son David Fincher is adapting the screenplay of his beloved departed father, Jack Fincher. A natural mistake, but not one to put $50,000,000 on.The plot, what little there actually is, blunders along, dull as pancakes in July. The cliches abound, the supporting cast spouts obvious quips, and the name-dropping is endless and revealing. I do love Citizen Kane, and admire Welles, and I also greatly admire many of Fincher's films on another level, so it all is a disappointment.The saving grace is certainly Oldman, who acts his heart out, and sustains many scenes, even ones that don't offer much worth saving. True, he's a 62 year old playing the part of a man between 37 and 42, roughly, and that doesn't help. But he's committed and complex. A good job.And the movie isn't a total wreck...but with all the hype, it really deflates and confounds. How and why, with all this talent, did it end up so underachieving? Or then again, who really cares?"}, {"id": 215, "text": "As a pretty big fan of David Fincher, I'm disappointed to say that I'm mixed on Mank overall. Fincher's work deserves to win the Oscar for Best Director, but the film is less than the sum of its parts for my taste.The craft and filmmaking is sensational. Fincher strikes dynamite with an approach that blends imitating and homaging this specific early moment in time of Hollywood. It goes without saying, the photography, production, score and sound are undeniably sublime. The cast ensemble gels with the created style as perfectly as possible.All the while, I respect Mank more than I love or even enjoy it.The screenplay boasts cleverness and surprisingly funny humor, which, when meant with Fincher's execution create a nice bouncing momentum. The screenplay has more creativity and better, snappier dialogue than Trial of Chicago 7, but I care so much less about the plot in Mank. There could have been a better plot or a different focus to tell this story.Oldman's work holds up to the hype, Seyfried less so.More Citizen Kane and Charles Dance, less Communism v. Socialism."}, {"id": 216, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Before I share my thoughts, a quick disclaimer. Mank will undoubtedly generate quite a divisive response from the general public. Why? From something as simple as the fact that the film is on black-and-white to the crime that is people not knowing a single thing about Citizen Kane (including never seeing it) but still choosing to watch Mank, there will be countless examples of viewers who will watch the latter with terribly unrealistic expectations. Audiences all around the world will find this movie boring, uneventful, and say stuff like, I fell asleep five minutes in, another artsy B&amp;W uninteresting film for critics to blindly love. Some of these comments will unavoidably come from people who just sat on their couch and clicked a random flick that they saw on Netflix.The marketing campaign could never place a pre-requirement to watch Mank, but I can, and I will. As straightforward and honest as I possibly can: if you've never watched Citizen Kane in your life, then either you do it before even opening your streaming service, or please, skip Mank because you'll probably not enjoy it at all. I firmly believe only 1/1000 viewers will like the latter if they have zero knowledge about Orson Welles' iconic movie. Ideally, (re)watch it, and research a bit about its background: what lead to the creation of the film, who was involved, what controversies surrounded the movie... I know what you're thinking: isn't that what Mank is supposed to tell me about? This takes me to one of my issues with the film.There are basically two options in this genre: either the director and/or the screenwriter choose to help the audience follow the story by introducing them to what they will witness, or they jump straight into the narrative itself. Fincher doesn't waste a second helping the audience understand what's happening or, in some cases, who even are the characters. Either the viewers know what they're getting themselves into (like I advise above) or prepare yourself for an incredibly intricate narrative, wholly packed with flashbacks, side stories, and many, many characters.This will be a significant reason why some people will definitely dislike this movie. I researched and studied Citizen Kane to exhaustion, and I still felt lost during some periods due to the overwhelming amount of subplots and its characters. Then, even though the following is connected to one of the aspects I love the most about Mank, there are at least a couple of other characters besides Herman J. Mankiewicz who I wish I could have learned more about, mainly Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried) and Joseph L. Mankiewicz (Tom Pelphrey), the protagonist's brother. On the other hand, this also means that despite the high number of characters, most are indeed quite interesting, possessing emotionally compelling arcs.I just noticed I started my review stating my issues with the film, but don't be mistaken: I really, really like it. However, since I'm already here, I might as well let out my remaining problem. So, this isn't close to anything Fincher has done before. It genuinely feels like a remarkably personal project that he surely would have loved to share with his late father, Mank's posthumously screenwriter, Jack Fincher (I'll refer to him as Jack from now on, keeping Fincher related to David). If there's one thing I expected from this movie was Fincher paying homage to Citizen Kane through the technical aspects, including the narrative structure profoundly based on flashbacks to justify a particular opinion, conversation, or event happening in the present.Evidently, Mank follows the exact same storytelling method as Citizen Kane, and despite it being a brilliant decision from David and/or Jack Fincher, the former lets it take over the story instead of elevating it. The flashbacks are mostly earned and well-placed in the narrative, but sometimes it comes across as a mere technical feature exclusively to make that comparison with Citizen Kane, instead of its execution improving the story both Fincher want to tell. Nevertheless, these issues of mine are far from ruining the entire viewing, much on the contrary.When it comes to my number one requirement, Fincher nails it perfectly. I loved getting to know the real-life inspirations that led Mankiewicz to create one of the greatest screenplays of all-time, as well as the shocking (and unknown to me) conditions he had to work on. It's truly a filmmaking miracle to be able to write a masterpiece in the space of two months, being physically and mentally debilitated. Despite the imperfect efficiency of the flashbacks, most develop impactful characters in Mankiewicz's life, and I can't deny that it's a joy for any film lover to see or even hear the mention of some famous filmmakers from that time. Nevertheless, a character is only as great as the actor who portrays it (and vice-versa).Gary Oldman is undoubtedly a contender for this year's Best Actor awards. It would be a major snub for him not to be exhaustingly nominated on every single ceremony. I believe his performance in Darkest Hour as Winston Churchill is more visibly riveting (I've never been so captivated during a war drama before), but his phenomenal display in Mank is hard to deny. From his hilarious yet grounded portrayal of a drunk Mankiewicz to his more sober, sincere attitude, Oldman demonstrates mind-blowing variation, with his physical performance having a notable influence on the overall result. There's no doubt that he carries the entire narrative on his shoulders, and he does it effortlessly.However, Oldman is far from being the only bright spot. Amanda Seyfried can very well get her first serious awards season as the extremely captivating Marion Davies. Seyfried manages to deliver an exquisite balance between the purposefully exaggerated voice mannerisms and Marion's real personality. Tom Pelphrey is also extraordinary as Mankiewicz's brother, whom I immediately researched about as soon as I finished the movie. The intensity with which Pelphrey expresses some sentences is becoming one of his trademark characteristics.I've seen many people talking about these two actors, but Lily Collins (Rita Alexander) portrays my favorite character besides the protagonist. As Mankiewicz's secretary, Lily explores her character in such a heartfelt, authentic manner that, at times, I wished to go back to the present not because of learning more about Citizen Kane's screenplay actually being written, but due to Rita Alexander's interactions with her boss. Their conversations are some of the most satisfying moments of the entire film, and I genuinely cared for both of them.I know that most of my readers probably don't care about technicalities, but if you've been following me for enough time, you know I value the technical aspects when they significantly impact the movie. Well, I dare state that a massive reason why I enjoy Mank so much is the near-perfect technical homage that Fincher pays to Orson Welles' precedent-setting film. From tiny little details like a cigarette burn here and there (I counted eight, and if you don't know what this means, then you clearly didn't watch Citizen Kane) to similar shot composition, Fincher creates flawless resemblances to the greatest movie of all-time in almost every scene, including his own version of a Rosebud moment.This obviously means that Erik Messerschmidt's cinematography is absolutely stunning. Erik previously worked with Fincher on Mindhunter, proving now that his film career still has a lot of ground to cover. Kirk Baxter could very well be nominated for Best Film Editing, and I can easily picture the exact scene the ceremony would show to demonstrate the seamless, clean cuts which make dialogues easier to follow. Donald Graham Burt, who has worked with Fincher since Zodiac, offers an exceptional production design, but it's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score that steals the show for me. Using only period-authentic instruments, Reznor and Ross deliver a rich, unique, memorable tribute to Bernard Herrmann's work.All in all, Netflix releases another massive contender for the awards season, Mank. With the perfectionist, dedicated David Fincher at the helm, his late father's screenplay ends up being Fincher's most personal project so far. It's a wonderful homage not only to Citizen Kane but also to the 30s/40s decades. Technically, every single component is award-worthy: cinematography, editing, production design, and especially the score. Fincher works with his team to deliver impressively similar iconic scenes and precedent-setting technical characteristics from Orson Welles' impactful movie. Outstanding performances across the board, but expect nominations flying the way of Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, and Lily Collins. However, Fincher's identical narrative structure to the 1941's flick sometimes feels just like a clever tribute instead of actually elevating the story. Jack Fincher's screenplay is overwhelmingly crowded with side stories and characters, making it challenging to follow comprehensibly, especially for viewers without any knowledge about the respective matter. Fortunately, the primary mission of representing Herman J. Mankiewicz's real-life inspirations that led to arguably one of the best screenplays ever written is flawlessly accomplished, making Mank a must-see for any film lover, as long as the viewer has at least watched the so-called greatest movie of all-time.Rating: A-"}, {"id": 217, "text": "David Fincher has made a new film about Herman Mankiewicz, the storied screenwriter behind the writing of Citizen Kane, one which is a gripping, insightful portrayal of Hollywood's golden age but also slightly lumbering on account of the film's use of flashback sequences and footnotes. It's possible this film would have benefited from a more linear narrative. The film flirts with greatness at several different points.From the outset, there is a recurring theme of Mankiewicz's tenuous relationship with the Hollywood executives, including Louis Mayer and Irving Thalberg. The film is at its most compelling when it touches on Mankiewicz's doomed friendship with William Randolph Hearst. As portrayed here, the two men shared an initial rapport, one which gradually gave way to staunch political differences which over time became such a gulf that it served as the strongest impetus for Mankiewicz to take on this radical project. The theme of bitter political rivalries within Hollywood is well-presented here.There is ample period detail here, including every effort to make this look like a 1940s film. And the performances are quite good. Gary Oldman shines in this role as the alcoholic but doggedly principled Mankiewicz, a man beaten down by own flaws but also quietly determined not to bend to those in power especially in his own creativity. Lily Collins makes a nice supporting turn as his assistant. Tom Burke is uncanny as the young Orson Welles before he was known for anything beyond radio. And Amanda Seyfried is a joy to watch as Marion Davies, a famous actress and a rare Mankiewicz friend within Hearst's inner circle. My only major criticism would be that this could have also spent more time in the editing room. And the dialogue is occasionally so frenetic that it is difficult to follow, almost to the point of being gibberish. But these are minor flaws in an overall workmanlike effort.Fincher has been quiet for some time now and it's great to finally see another feature film from him. Although this is not his best, it certainly ends up as the most uncharacteristic film out of his repertoire and therefore a testament to his versatility as a director. It will make for a fascinating film experience even to those unfamiliar with the story being told here. Recommended to cinephiles and casual viewers alike."}, {"id": 218, "text": "Considering how much talent is involved, this is a strangely uninvolving movie. It's technically impressive, but these days what does that mean? The level of expertise in the film industry seems to be getting higher with every passing year. But it doesn't mean the movie's going to be as riveting as the cinematography, acting, production design or special effects. It's all a bit, well, obvious here. What's the point of the monaural sound? Of getting Reznor and Ross to write the score against their grain -- fun for them, I expect, but it would have been more idiomatic to hire a composer to whom the idiom of the period is second nature. The screenplay leaves gaps for reearch afterwards: is that a good thing, to get audiences to go do homework in order to find out stuff about the period? I can't help feeling this was a labour of love for David Fincher to honor his late father's script. As the tale of one man's struggle, it leaves too much unsaid to be satisfying. As a tale of the way Hollywood treated its writers, it's not as hard-hitting as SUNSET BOULEVARD or BARTON FINK. There are treats along the way: Amanda Seyfried and Tom Burke are particularly strong.

The film follows parts of the life of screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz mostly around the time he was writing Citizen Kane. The film is also shot in the style of how films were made back then and effectively so as it does look like a 1940's film. I was looking forward to this one quite a bit but was pretty disappointed. Firstly the dialogue is mixed too low and without any sonic breadth, rendering maybe 30% or more o f the spoken word inaudible, The film is also constantly under lit, so whilst I was straining my ears to hear, I was also straining my eyes to see. A few tweaks could have fixed these problems but whilst those points were both annoying, it s the script that does not work as a whole. The script has some good parts, particularly in the second half but feels very bits and pieces rather than a fleshed out story. The first half of the film is really quite a trudge and I think the subject matter deserved more. It's not all bad though, the period detail is all as great as expected and the performances are top flight all around. I would not be surprised to see nominations for Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried or Charles Dance. In the end we are left with smart looking (though too dark) film with a script that does not live up to the promise of the material. The second half was much more enjoyable and I would say that all film history lovers should at least check it out for themselves.4.5/10"}, {"id": 221, "text": "Mank is a movie aimed squarely at film buffs that tells the story of the writing of Citizen Kane. I am a film buff. I love Citizen Kane. I am this movie's target audience. It is bad as a movie, and worse as a movie eager to be compared with the works of Orson Welles.In the film, Gary Oldman plays alcoholic scriptwriter Herman Mankiewicz, who holes up in the middle of nowhere with a broken leg and the assignment to write a full script in a month. He bases the script on the life of powerful millionaire William Randolph Hearst. In flashbacks, we see Mank's dissolute life as a screenwriter, drunk, and witticism machine, as well as his friendship with Hearst's mistress, Marion Davies.1. Mank as a movieI want to take about Mank's failures as a film for film buffs and it's failures as Welles-lite, but I don't want that to get in the way of the most important point, which is that this movie is simply dull. Oldham is persuasive as Mank, but the character is like one played by Thomas Mitchell in old 40s movie; a side character whose witticisms are fun but never make you want to find out what makes him tick.The alcoholic writer isn't an inherently uninteresting subject, but it's also not an inherently interesting one, and the movie doesn't give us any particular reason to care about Mank. The flashbacks are sometimes interesting and sometimes not, but in neither case do they change the movie from basically being a guy in a house typing and getting blackout drunk. There is nothing within the movie that makes you curious about the characters or the situation - the only thing that kept me watching was curiosity about Citizen Kane, and if I'd never seen that movie I wouldn't have finished this one. The acting is good, and Amanda Seyfried is actually exceptionally good as Davies, but there's really not much to this at all. It doesn't pull you in at the start, and the end feels as meh as the rest of it.2. Mank as a film buff movieThe best thing about Mank is the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, which does a dead-on impression of Greg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, down to emulating specific scenes. Set and costume design are also first-rate.But as behind-the-scenes look into Citizen Kane the movie is a failure. One thing I wanted to know was why, if Mank was friends with Hearst and with Davies, he turned on them so savagely.Some say that the treatment of Davies was the thing that most harmed Kane most of all. True, Not only was it reportedly the main reason Hearst wanted to destroy the movie, but Davies, a talented light comedian pushed into inappropriate roles by her sugar daddy, was charming and well-liked (which Seyfried captures wonderfully) and threw big Hollywood parties and because of that, Hollywood would not rally around Kane as Hearst attacked it. Even Welles admitted, years later, that he had been unfair to Davies.So why did Mank trash her? The movie offers a simplistic answer involving Upton Sinclair that doesn't make much sense and, when I researched it, isn't remotely what happened. There is no thoughtful attempt to consider why a writer would use his friends as grist for the mill, even though other writers have successfully looked at the very subject without reducing it all to petty, self-righteous vengeance.The movie also falls onto the long-exploded Pauline Kael side of the who-wrote-Kane debate, suggesting Welles did pretty much nothing on the script. A little research shows scholars have conclusively refuted this (one of the top of the most helpful IMDB user reviews gives a good overview of this).The only reason I kept with this movie was for the real-life story that it couldn't bother to tell.3. Mank vs. Orson WellesBy making a movie about Citizen Kane, and making it look just like Citizen Kane, director David Fincher would seem to be *daring* people to compare his work with Welles. But it falls short of Welles work in every non-superficial way.Welles was certainly a big fan of flashy cinematography. He could be gimmicky. But there was always intent to it. Gimmicks were always both oh, cool! and look how that emphasizes the point he's making in a fresh way.Beyond the flash, Welles was a filmmaker who never gave you all the answers. He gave you clues. Citizen Kane is about the search for Rosebud, but once you know what it is, you still don't know Kane. It's another clue, but it's up to the viewer to decide how to sort these clues. Welles gave you jigsaw puzzles with some pieces missing and some extra pieces. It was true of Kane and pretty much everything he did through his final film, The Other Side of the Wind. Welles did not consider people explicable. They lie about their motives to others and themselves, they change from moment to moment and year to year. It is the complexity, not the cinematographic tricks, that make Welles one of history's greatest filmmakers.But Fincher's Mank isn't complex at all. His story arc is straightforward. He's a brilliant drunk. His motives are simplistic. He's self-destructive in a predictable fashion. Like all of us he has his good points and his bad points, moments of spite and moments of grace, but then, so does every character in a Hallmark movie.And the gimmicks in Mank are just gimmicks. If you know Kane's opening scene you'll recognize the falling whisky glass as a callback, but what does it say? Not a thing. Not. One. Single. Thing.Mank is a dull, unimaginative film that is infuriating because it has so many of the hallmarks of a good one. That makes it feel like a cheat. I regret watching it, and recommend everyone skip it."}, {"id": 222, "text": "Mank feels like an experiment to see if hardcore film buffs and fans of old Hollywood would enjoy prequel-style member berries as much as the geeks of the world. The whole film is bursting at the seams with references, and prioritizes those over telling any kind of compelling story. To someone like me, who is not a film scholar that reads up on Hollywood history and has only seen Citizen Kane once, it was nearly incomprehensible. There are clearly so many references to things that happened at the time, and people who were famous back then, but I could not track who was who and what they had to do with the story being told. The bigger problem was that the plot of Mank didn't make me care enough to find answers to my questions. If this were a more cohesive and well-told story then I could see myself delving deeper and researching more about Marion Davies or Charles Lederer. Perhaps I would even feel deeply compelled to watch Citizen Kane again to catch all the references. But about halfway through, the only thing I was looking up was how many more minutes I had to watch before the movie would end. What should have been an interesting look behind the scenes of one of the most iconic films ever made, actually managed to be boring.Mank is deeply hindered by the fact that it wants to emulate Citizen Kane. The non-linear storytelling is much too chaotic, and denies us the needed time that could possibly make the protagonist a relatable character. Instead I found Herman Mankiewicz to be a loud-mouth drunk that was utterly devoid of charm. Even when he's in the right and his anger is justified, I found it hard to root for this man, because he was so unpleasant. I suppose Gary Oldman delivered the performance that was expected from him, but I found it quite underwhelming and cliched. Even the look of the film came across like a winking reference rather than an authentic recreation. Perhaps it's just because I recognize so many of the actors and I'm used to seeing them in color, but watching this film in black-and-white just felt like looking at one of those old-timey photos that you get at an amusement park booth. It's a cheap facsimile that looks much too pristine to actually feel real. Even the fake cigarette burns digitally placed on the screen are just one more detail shoved in to make Mank a faux classic. I'm already the type of person who hates prequels, and add to that the fact that I'm a film watcher not a film scholar, so that makes Mank a movie that did nothing but disappoint me."}, {"id": 223, "text": "It will be forgotten alongside Benjamin Button and Panic Room.The script discovered what it wanted to be about around 2/3rds into the film.

Oldman was Oldman without direction. The editing was apologetic. Go and watch Touch of Evil or Citizen Kane; you'll quickly realize those films are as efficient and down to earth as the Die Hard films.Thought about the script: A character who is cynical and disenfranchised cant be the same exact way he is in the present day as he is in the flashbacks. Mank is the same both past and present.Thought about style: Makes it seem like there is a puzzle to solve all the way through. But there is no puzzle to solve. It's a shallow script with no interesting ideas intentionally obscured by t i dont even care everyone who wants to is going to ignore my review anyway.Cinematography: muddled. The characters are constantly in shadows. Either gray, black, small or have bright white light behind them which makes it impossible to see the profile of their face. The human face holds a bounty of interesting information and they're hidden in every shot.Editing: Not only is the cinematography a silly anti-composition exercise, but the editing is completely indiscriminate.My theory about Netlix is that they are like the cool teacher who says they have no rules in their class. But we all know they clearly do but they want YOU(the director) to accept it on their own so they can save face. No producer intervention, the director has all the control is what Netlfix is known for. I'm starting to doubt this severely. Curation. Curation. Curation.Go watch 8 1/2. Black and white done right.

It has a powerful cast of characters and one of the best roles by Gary Oldman. Fincher has made again an excellent movie, but it lacks the excitement that will always make me think that David Fincher is one of the great directors living.What makes Gary Oldman one of a kind is this kind of movies, where he has all the inspiration he needs to make a great character. Herman Mankiewicz has made a great movie and his life was difficult and intriguing. What Oldman did with this character was that he took the role and made it intriguingly inspiring for others who will make a career of acting.The way that we all will know Citizen Kane is of course the black and white cinematography. Mank is also made as a black and white film with all of the characters that we need to make a 30s or 40s film. It's absolutely beautiful to watch.I couldn't believe when I heard Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross where the ones who were making the music. But when I looked at the movie and listen to the music, it all makes sense. Reznor and Ross has a mark by doing collaborations with each other and it doesn't betray us in Mank. Their is also the difference in the films music that made me hesitate the movie but Reznor and Ross pulls it of marvelously.Fincher has made yet another movie that will make it to the top 10 movies of this year, but it won't make it to the top. The movie is talking and that may be pouring to most of the viewers. I myself was a little bit pored in the second act. It didn't grip me like all the other movies that Fincher has made. Fincher has made so many different kinds of movies and this is one of them. Some people like it others won't.The script is talking and it does have to have the energy and the intriguiness that makes a movie great. Jack Fincher made the script and unfortunately he passed before David Fincher (his son) could make the film. Their are some elements that will make you yawn, because of the talking, but their is the last act that will make you think about the movies familiar ending to other movies by Fincher.All and all this was a great movie that I will watch again. The ending was beautifully done and the intriguing way that Oldman made the movie live is one of a kind.

Mankiewicz, nailing the role of a scathing alcoholic who was just trying to make his mark on the world. Amanda Seyfried and Lily Collins were also excellent, but I was equally as impressed with Charles Dance who I haven never really liked as an actor outside of Game of Thrones.The screenplay is really good, but my main issue was that I was never fully invested in every scene. I was engaged for most of the third act, especially when Mankiewicz and Orson Welles were having major confrontation and the screenplay was coming to a close, but the first and second act were hit-or-miss for me on whether I was engaged or bored by what was happening on-screen.That being said, Fincher's direction was outstanding as always, and I did really enjoy watching the trials and tribulations of Mankiewicz. The last scene took place at the Oscars when Citizen Kane won for best original screenplay, and I was taken a back by how wonderfully it was executed. Similar to how Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was Quentin Tarantino's love letter to films from the 1960s, Mank felt like Fincher's love letter to the 1940s and it was surprisingly moving.Mank was motivational and inspirational, challenging the audience to keep moving forward if you have a dream that you're working towards. This message was profound, and I loved it.The cinematography, editing, musical score, and everything else on a technical level was perfect. If only the screenplay has been a little better in the first and second act, I would have gone so far as to say that I loved this film.Nevertheless, I still highly recommend watching it.SCORE: 85%"}, {"id": 226, "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. Just a writer. The line made me laugh. How many times have writers not received the recognition they deserved, or were underestimated, only to have their words create a lasting impact? Hollywood often likes to portray writers as socially-awkward, loner types who rarely contribute much during conversations. Not this time. The subject is Oscar winning screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz, who was as quick with a dinner table zinger as he was writing the script to CITIZEN KANE (1941) while bedridden.More than 20 years in the works, this is director David Fincher's first film since GONE GIRL (2014), and it's based on a screenplay written by his late father, Jack Fincher. Dad receives sole writing credit here, though David and producer Eric Roth (Oscar winner for FORREST GUMP, 1994) admit to some polishing. It's a film seemingly designed for us film nerds, but likely entertaining and interesting enough for expanded appeal. CITIZEN KANE is often regarded as the best movie of all-time, though the origin of the film is much debated. We do know that struggling RKO Pictures gave 24 year old wunderkind Orson Welles free reign over his first film, and the result was something quite special.Director Fincher's film offers up three distinct aspects here: a look at Mankiewicz's writing process for 'Kane', some background on Mankiewicz's career, and a somewhat fictionalized dissection of 1930s Hollywood politics. Oscar winner Gary Oldman (DARKEST HOUR, 2017) stars as Herman J Mank Mankiewicz, an international correspondent-turned NYC cultural critic-turned playwright-turned screenwriter. Herman was the older brother of Joseph L Mankiewicz, a four time Oscar winning writer-director (ALL ABOUT EVE, 1950), and grandfather to Ben Mankiewicz, a well-known host of Turner Classic Movies. Herman was also renowned as a boozer and gambler, and in 1940 (where this movie begins), he was a bedridden mess recovering from a car accident. Herman was part of the sphere of the infamous Algonquin Round Table, and in most of this film, he talks like he's still at one of those gatherings.Mank is taken to a desolate ranch house in Victorville, California, along with his assistant Rita Alexander (Lily Collins), his nurse (Monika Gossman) and his handler John Houseman (Sam Troughton). Orson Welles (Tom Burke) has given Mank 60 days to finish the script, and his only guidance seems to be write what you know, and don't drink. The result was a controversial, yet brilliant script that Welles and his crew (Oscar winning Cinematographer Gregg Toland, Editor Robert Wise, a 4-time Oscar winner) turned into a classic film that still holds up 80 years later.We immediately start seeing flashbacks, as noted by old style on-screen typing. Ten years prior, Mank was the Head Writer at Paramount, where his staff included Ben Hecht, George S Kaufman, and Charles Lederer ... writers whose work would later include NOTORIOUS (1946), multiple Marx Brothers movies, and GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES (1953), respectively. Lederer was also the nephew of starlet Marion Davies (played here by Amanda Seyfried), who was the long time mistress of media mogul William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance). Are you starting to see how this wicked web all fits together? Of course, Hearst was the model for Charles Foster Kane in Welles' classic movie, while Ms. Davies was supposedly the inspiration for Kane's wife, Susan. Other key players in these flashbacks are Producer David O Selznick (Toby Moore), Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley, son of Oscar winner Ben), MGM founder Louis B Mayer (Arliss Howard), Mank's brother Joseph (Tom Pelphrey), and Mank's wife Poor Sarah (Tuppence Middleton).Director Fincher's masterful film features a couple of standout sequences. The first involves the initial meeting between Mank and Hearst, while Marion Davies is filming a scene on the grounds of San Simeon (Xanadu in CITIZEN KANE). Rapid fire dialogue, multiple characters, and terrific editing with Mank keeping pace as Hearst overlooks the filming. Much later there is a scene following Mank and Marion as they stroll through the manicured gardens with the nearby exotic animals on display. The scene is fascinating to watch, while also reinforcing the kindred spirits of Mank and Marion - both talented, yet not quite allowed in the club. Beyond those two sequences, we also get a quite funny segment where Mank and his Paramount writers are improvising a pitch to Selznick and director Josef von Sternberg, plus a telegram sent by Mank to Lederer that states, Millions to be made here and your only competition is idiots (a sentiment some believe still holds true today).Quite a bit of the film is focused on Hollywood politics of the 1930s, both in the studios and nationally. In particular, the 1934 Governor's race focuses on the campaign of writer and socialist Upton Sinclair (played by Bill Nye, the Science Guy), and the concerted efforts by Hearst and studio capitalists to prevent Sinclair from being elected. The symmetry and contrasts of modern day Hollywood and politics cannot be overlooked. Also made abundantly clear is the disconnect between studio heads, directors, and writers - quite the mishmash of disrespect.The brilliance of Fincher's movie is that it can be relished from multiple perspectives. Is Mank attempting to salvage a near-dead career or is he settling a grudge against Hearst? Did Welles intend to hold firm to Mank's contract and prevent him from receiving a screenwriting credit? And then there is the filmmaking side. Superb performances from Oldman and Seyfried highlight the terrific cast. It's filmed in black and white by cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt (Mindhunter), but not the razor-sharp images we are accustomed to these days, rather soft and hazy in keeping with the look of the times. The production design from Donald Graham Burt takes a couple of viewings to fully appreciate, and the music from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is spot on, as usual. Even the opening credits provide nostalgia, as does the 1942 Academy Awards ceremony, which neither Mank nor Welles attended. Netflix delivers another winner, and one likely to receive awards consideration."}, {"id": 227, "text": "This film is sincerely telling a story about a man behind so many of our movie memories and making a new one in the process. It has a structural approach reminiscent of Citizen Kane, used to build a portrait of Mankiewicz and his time similar to how Kane explored its titular character. However Mank is truly made perfect by its intoxicating style. It completely feels like a facsimile of a 1930s film, yet it plays itself more dynamically. Fincher's attention to detail behind the camera and the sharp dialogue written by his late father Jack Fincher made this an ambitious and intoxicating watch that will no doubt go down a storm this award season. This is a talky film, with Mank giving speeches about everything from the Germans' war strategies (it's 1940) to the many ways he hates Louis B. Mayer to the reasons he detests the ways moguls use and abuse everyone for their selfish purposes. Oldman shines best when he's going toe to toe with Dance, a formidable actor who was born to play powerful men. Visually, the film is stunning, with striking, relevant use of black and white and acting was at its best. Fincher is a world class filmmaker and he employs his signature wide shots effectively and composes the scenes to stress Mank's state of mind. I've to say, every second of this film is immersive and hypnotic."}, {"id": 228, "text": "MANK is pretty much sensational. The story of Herman Mankiewicz' writing the script for what would become CITIZEN KANE is also a story of Hollywood's power system. Anyway, Gary Oldman is mesmerizingly wondrous as Mank, a witty, smart-ass alcoholic who's a so-so success in tinsel town because he can't keep his mouth shut and he eventually pisses everyone off. He writes the script after a car accident and he writes it alone. Orson Welles swoops in after receiving the first draft and tries to wrest it away from him so he can put his own spin on the story (and take sole writing credit).The background of this shows the Hollywood of Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg, William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies, and pushes its powerful grasp into the world of politics when Upton Sinclair runs for governor of California. Ultimately, Mank has a Pyrrhic victory by winning and Oscar (with Welles) for Kane but basically never works again.Amanda Seyfried plays Marion Davies with, as one review put it, world-weary effervescence. I was a little put off by her slight Noo Yawk accent but she captures the essence of Davies, although Davies stammered in real life (but not in this film). Charles Dance plays Hearst as royalty and Arliss Howard plays Mayer as a putz. Oh, and the one time Oldman pronounces Davies' last name he reverts to British and says DAVIS.The look of the film (B&amp;W) is totally stunning and perfectly captures the era. A definite must-see film."}, {"id": 229, "text": "This is a film about how we want to be seen by people and what legacy we leave behind after we're gone.This is very much unlike any of David Fincher's other films, it's a black &amp; white Hollywood biopic character drama, that's rated PG. Well reader, I don't quite see this as a David Fincher film, rather A Jack Fincher Film.Mank's screenplay was written sometime in the mid to late 90s by David's Father, Jack Fincher. This is Jack's one and only screenwriting credit, as he died in 2002. This is a story about a man's life slipping away and his one last creative expression which will make a legacy for him, written by a man with one last chance to try and express himself through the screenplay before passing away.David Fincher is one of our greatest living filmmakers, and once again he knocked it out of the park. With the help of Fincher's absolutely maniacal approach to directing actors, he essentially made these 21st century actors into living, breathing people alive in the 1930s and 40s.The cinematography, aside from it being cool to see a black &amp; white film in a theatre, was just gorgeous. The lighting and shot composition were a real treat for the eyes; THE SPLIT DIOPTERS!Along with the pretty pictures and cool techy director stuff the sound mixing &amp; score are absolutely top notch. It's incredibly hard to overstate how much this feels like being transported to the 40s and the sound and score are largely responsible for those feelings.Gary Oldman is good, I think he's too old for the part, but he's still a great actor, just nothing to write home about. The supporting players from Lily Collins, Tom Pelphrey, Charles Dance, Arliss Howard, to Tuppence Middleton and Jamie McShane; all suit their roles perfectly. A special shoutout to my boy Tom Burke, I love to see an astonishingly talented actor like him succeed in this way. Personally, I think this films real standout, acting wise, is Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies. I've loved her as Karen from Meangirls since junior high, but I think this proved to every casting director in the biz that she is beyond talented.Without dragging this on for too long, I just wanted to say that this is a very special movie that I was beyond pleased to see in a theatre. As my mother talked about when I came home from the film; I wish my grandfather, Bill Thompson, who was a filmmaker in his own right, had been alive today to see this with me. Citizen Kane was among his favourite films and I wish I could have shared this with him.You cannot capture a man's life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one. Herman J. Mankiewicz"}, {"id": 230, "text": "Don't get me wrong, I like classic Hollywood flicks. But only if the are worth it. I have even watched Citizen Kane a couple of years ago just to understand all this chitchat about the black&amp;white classics. It was okay, not a deep story but quite convincing considering the date it was created.Now, to Mank, that movie was not convincing. They tried to establish some kind of pathos around the persona of the famous script writer but it doesn't sell. Who exactly does care about the bed room stories among the movie industry pros ALMOST A CENTURY AGO?On top of that, man, Gary Oldman is good but he is just too old, man, about 20 years older than the real Mank when he wrote Citizen Kane. It simply does not fit.And in the end they try to make a point. But I just don't see the punchline. The movie goes on, ends, and the outcome is meh... not even a summary of the fate of the real Mank. Just pointless."}, {"id": 231, "text": "David Fincher is an excellent director. Gary Oldman also gives a great performance, the black and white cinematography is beautiful, but everything else falls pretty flat. First of all, the opening includes a title card informing the audience that Orson Welles was looking for a collaborator on his next project, implying that this movie will be about Citizen Kane, a relationship between Welles and Mank, and how it was created. This movie is not that. Instead, it decides to focus on his life and everything BESIDES Citizen Kane. It could have been more of a biography without all the Orson Welles stuff.Part of the complexity of the film and the script is how confusing this movie can be. Since it does capture Mank's life there is a lot to be covered, but sometimes there's so much going on you don't know what is happening. There is a blend of politics and Mank's divided opinions, but those mix with his writing and relationship with his wife, it becomes too much. There are some unnecessary characters that do not develop the story very much.Honestly, this movie was a disappointment. Some people will enjoy it, others will be like me, but some might hate it. It's hard to compare this to Fincher's other movies, Social Network Fight Club, Se7en, but it does show the variety of Fincher's talent. I'll be looking out for other Oscar contenders as well as how this movie does."}, {"id": 232, "text": "Critics are no doubt head over heels in love with this self-reverential bit of nepotistic overindulgence, made worse by an unholy intersection of politics and Hollywood gossip which never quite gels.The script by Jack, father of acclaimed director David, is abysmal. Son David's direction fares little better, full of Hollywood clich\u00e9s, beholding to a lifeless script full of overlong soap opera-ish moments of excruciating dialog. Revelations about Mankiewicz' character and the Hollywood machine around him are for the most part absent; instead we get dull, seemingly endless conversations, any wit or humor lost in the overbearing seriousness of it all.On the bright side, the black and white cinematography is worth watching as is some of the acting, most notably that of Oldham even if his overlong scenes with Seyfried lack sparkle, almost as if the two are reciting lines instead of living them."}, {"id": 233, "text": "For all that's been penned regarding the authorship of Citizen Kane (1941), one could do worse (and better) than viewing two movies on Netflix to get the gist of the debate over who wrote the screenplay for the so-called greatest film ever, Herman Mankiewicz or Orson Welles. Mank takes the side of the former and is evidently largely based on the discredited research of Pauline Kael (author of Raising Kane, as well as famed film critic). The other Netflix movie is The Other Side of the Wind (2018), the completed incomplete film from Orson Welles where his semi-autobiographical stand-in slaps a thinly-veiled caricature of Kael. One could also read Robert L. Carringer's The Scripts of Citizen Kane (or book The Making of Citizen Kane) or another factual account from actual film historians that make an open-and-shut case that the shared screen credit for Mankiewicz and Welles was an accurate representation of a collaborative effort, with the man, Mankiewicz, who made the most substantial contributions credited first, but where's the simplistic, counterfactual, score-settling drama of a contest of wills to be had in that. Cue yet another entry in the industry of belying the brilliance of Kane by dumbing it down. Ironic, though, that this is exactly what Mank valorizes its eponymous screenwriter for not doing, as his sticks to his convictions by not making his script any less biting or complex. David Fincher and company giving his late father sole screen credit for its script, though, for a movie about giving a writer his due, while not acknowledging that the movie basically rips off Kael's thesis, that's beyond ironic--it's insolent. And, that's still nothing compared to its travesty of history. Otherwise, Mank is entertaining and fairly well acted, although it's no Citizen Kane.I appreciate to an extent what they were trying to do here by making the movie in the manner of its predecessor from 1941: the desaturated black-and-white look, the supposed film cigarette burns, chiaroscuro lighting, some rear-projection car views, old-fashioned-looking matte shots, some deep-focus cinematography, the flashback structure of the narrative, a gubernatorial election and even fake newsreels. There are a lot of little moments recalling particular scenes from Kane, including a bedridden Mankiewicz dropping a booze bottle instead of a snow globe or Welles angrily tossing things as though Susan Alexander Kane had just dumped him. Stylistically, I wish Mank went even further than being a fair pastiche, though, or rather went in another direction. Go with the 4:3 aspect ratio instead of widescreen or shoot on actual film instead of digital, for instance. Don't half-ass it. Mostly, Mank just isn't as visually appealing or adventurous as Citizen Kane. With the exception of dialogue that bristles with wise cracks and pontification in the vein of the News on the March reporters of Kane, the same goes for the screenplay.What makes Kane great has very little to do with its titular character Charles Foster Kane being loosely based on William Randolph Hearst. But, the notion otherwise is another dumbed-down contest of wills for TV movies and entertainment critics to vomit for easy digestion. Along with his eventual argument with Welles, Mank spends most of its time on the supposed conflict brewing between Mankiewicz and Hearst, as well as on their various go-betweens like Marion Davies, Joseph Mankiewicz and Louis B. Mayer, and complete with a demonstrative speech of a movie pitch for a climax. It's enough to make me think The Social Network (2010) is perfidy, too, because it's the same sort of dramatics at play; I just don't know enough about social-media backstories as I do of those from film history to call BS on it. Kane is an ambiguous and complex scenario told from multiple perspectives just as the film is photographed from various angles while keeping everyone in focus. The flashbacks here are perfunctory by comparison--elaborations of supposed past inspirations for the screenplay. The most compelling part of the Hearst connection to Kane is that it's a character--newspaper man, politician, overseer of his lover's career--who shapes stories, even from his deathbed with the mysterious last word, Rosebud, which is just what the plot as narrated by different characters is about, too. Similarly, Mank is about a screenwriter, but the perspective is entirely one-sided, unambiguous and superficial.The worst part of all of this may be the politics. The movie fabricates a connection between Mankiewicz and Upton Sinclair's 1934 campaign for California governor. The pains this picture goes to make its anti-union, GOP-donating protagonist into a passionate supporter of socialism is shocking and entirely unfounded. His antagonism to Nazis is on firmer ground, and I'm not quite sure what to make of sad Sarah, his wife's claim of his silly platonic affairs, let alone a throwaway scene featuring a stenographer and only woman in a room full of male screenwriters being topless aside from pasties. Anyways, more outrageous is the invention of a fictional character to direct the fake newsreels just so to suicide him and fabricate that Mankiewicz had anything to do with any of that. Besides, the real radical leftist of the screenwriters of Kane was Welles. It's surely part of what led him to be exiled from Hollywood, taking up the mantle of the self-financed auteur and persona non grata upon studio lots--very much in the spirit of Kane. Mank, on the other hand, is what the character of Kane became. It's Hollywood fluff. Everything managed and packaged by a small country of executives and contributors, running roughshod over facts and nuance, and sold off to Netflix, to the point that its story of a singular auteur is but a stupid joke. Hypocritical lies."}, {"id": 234, "text": "A poorly constructed movie about a topic that should have been fascinating. This story is told almost entirely in flashback, thereby breaking the cardinal rule of screenwriting: no flashbacks. Of course, the only exception to this rule is the monumental screenplay Citizen Kane, written by Mank himself! There was no compelling reason to write this movie that way whatsoever and it could've easily been told in sequence. The classic problem of writing a movie about a writer is that there is no action; the guy just sits there and types. However, in this case, it's worse: the guy actually lies down and doesn't even type- he dictates. His arms barely move. Plus he's drunk. So the screen writer faces the unsolvable problem of writing a story zero action to show on the screen. The usual answer is to say no! The second best answer is to say OK, I need the money, so I'll dig out the spine of the story by looking at the guys life. But still without the flashbacks. It's a real stumper and this movie, with that classic conundrum going against it, fails as anticipated. What a waste of Gary Churchill Oldman! I know they tried, but you would need to actually hire Orson Welles to pull this sort of thing off."}, {"id": 235, "text": "I really tried to get into this film, having seen the critical adulation heaped upon it and what with it being by David Fincher, a Director who's work is generally of a very high standard.The film does look good, and the makers have clearly put a lot of effort into aping the sound and look of Citizen Kane. At least that's what I assume is going on (it's been a few decades since I saw CK) as the aesthetic choice would be quite baffling otherwise.I personally found the look and sound quite distracting. It didn't add anything to the storytelling and instead came across as an overly self-conscious exercise. It's a film about the writing of Citizen Kane - and you'll never guess what we've done - we've made it look like Citizen Kane too! Aren't we clever!. Well okay, I get it ... but ... so what?There were several moments when I found myself pondering how they'd got a particular retro effect to the imagery, rather than listening to the dialogue. Fincher's films always look good but usually it's not to the cost of the story. I didn't feel that was the case here.And when it comes to the story it's self, the characters, the plot... I don't see that there is anything of interest unless you're particularly interested in the making of Citizen Kane.Otherwise this is just a film with a bunch of characters talking about stuff that are and nothing much actually happening.Okay, so that person there is a Mayer of MGM fame. And that's the guy who wrote the greatest film of all time. And that's the guy who's meant to be the main character in the greatest film of all time. Fine.

Aside from the astonishing technical points, the plot fails to engage its viewers as it drifts from its central points during the movie.To begin with, though being a Fincher's film, the plot is really sluggish and so incoherent that confusion about the events of the story becomes the only visible point. The several names brought up without any forewarning tell us that the movie can be considered as a pure masterpiece only for 30s moviegoers. The confusion we are dealing with make this movie extremely self-absorbed and dull. Personally speaking, having not Fincher's name attached to it, no none would even notice it. With the rapid flashbacks, at points where you are finally about to understand something, the plot drifts along and never finds a center.On the plus side, Mank is a great perfection in technical points. The performances are well executed, the cinematography is phenomenal and the sounds and music could be no better. Aside from his average plot, Fincher has done a skillful job in taking old Hollywood films essences and, unlike many other movies, didn't make a flop out of it. To be honest, at some points I wondered if the movie really belonged to 2020! I definitely think it deserves nominations for sound and cinematography.I expected more of this talented director. I think it just smacks of trying to be different and controversy.

Mankiewicz and his creation of the legendary Hollywood script that became Citizen Kane, that we could really start getting excited about the adorded directors next piece of work.Based off a script from Fincher's own late father Jack, Mank is a typically astute production from the famously picky director who alongside his crew has gone to great lengths to capture the essence of 1930's/40's Hollywood, going so far as to capture sound using technology of the day, filming black and white and crafting a score alongside Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that feels as though it could've been lifted from the era itself as it accompanies Fincher's talk-heavy dramedy.It's a prestige film if I've ever seen one, one of Netflix's most prestigiously made so far but for all its technical marvels and wizardry and a great double turn from its leads Gary Oldman as the alcoholic Mankiewisz and Amanda Seyfried as actress and friend Marion Davies, there's an overwhelming sense of coldness to Mank that keeps you at arms lengths from its main characters and time crossing story throughout the entirety of its two hour runtime.For anyone that has only a small knowledge base of Hollywood of this time and Citizen Kane as a film, Mank will be even more hard to fall in love with as Fincher assumes a certain level of interest already in his subject matter and those that litter its story, with even Mankiewicz himself remaining a rather aloof figure throughout the tale as we see him bedridden after an accident beavering away on the script that would become his masterwork while also seeing him in action (eg mainly drunk) at various industry get togethers talking politics and world issues.Viewers hoping to get an insightful look into the mindset or creation of Mankiewicz the person, will leave disappointed while any enthusiastic Citizen Kane fans may find enjoyment in parts from seeing how real life events helped formed the films narrative but a rarely used Tom Burke as Orson Welles and a rather intriguing finale with little of Kane's legacy explored makes one feel as though there was a lot more to explore about this films main character and the feature he helped create.The work of the aforementioned Oldman (in rare non-makeup form) and Seyfried is certainly likely to attract great interest come awards season, much like the film itself that is the exact type of production that old Hollywood loves to fawn over but despite their best efforts and the craftsmanship that surrounds them, there's an overriding sense that Mank badly misses the mark when it comes to enrapturing you in its heart and soul.It's rare to see Fincher this playful and even reflective, outside of his underrated classic The Curious Case of Benjamin Button this is his most humanistic tale and one that he clearly relished exploring, you just wish he was able to make you fall in love with the collection of players littered throughout while stringing together a narrative that felt like more than a self-assured showing off of accurate period recreation and call backs to a whose who of the era.Final Say -Sure to find a place in the hearts and minds of many viewers and esteemed industry thespians, Mank is a hugely impressive showpiece for the craft it explores but despite all of this its a film devoid of emotion or heart and therefore only entertains to a certain level as we struggle to care beyond an outside interest level of engagement.3 Giraffes out of 5"}, {"id": 238, "text": "Because I was so looking forward to it, I'm sorry to say MANK is a beautiful, tedious disappointment. It rattles on like a non-stop spoof of the Algonquin Round Table, with no breathing room for a hint of emotion, and seems to be competing for the world's record number of unnecessary cuts per scene.To be sure, none of the responsibility for failure falls to the technicians or the actors. It is unquestionably beautiful (though there is a very odd quality to the dialogue soundtrack, a strangely persistent reverb, even outdoors). Gary Oldman is wonderful, but like his accompanying cast, can't catch a sustained moment of screen time to reach the soul or touch your heart.I'm quite sure many will be overcome by the Fincher pedigree. With references that are likely to go over most of their heads, viewers will be left furtively glancing side to side as they slowly applaud what they mistakenly believe is a ponderous success."}, {"id": 239, "text": "Oh boy, what a film this was. It's been a real long time since a film has managed to touch or capture emotions on so many different levels. It is an astonishing, mesmerizing film that has the ability of keeping the audience glued to the screen. Whether you have the opportunity of seeing MANK in cinemas or not, it will still get to your heart either way, because that's how good it is. It is an enchanting, thrilling drama that although might not be for the average viewer, it is still worth the watch. The writing, acting and directing in this film were absolutely soul-touching and (almost) perfect. With such a well written dialogue, MANK manages to keep the viewer at the edge of their seat, always making them wonder on what's about to come next. It is a puzzle well shot, well directed, but most importantly, it is well told. Although at some point it might get fuzzy and confusing, it all gets clearer as the film gets to its grand finale. David Fincher is back after 6 years of a totally deserved and well earned break from Hollywood and somehow, despite the circumstances, he finds an absolutely beautiful way of returning to the director's chair. In terms of direction, MANK is a new and different approach from Fincher that actually worked perfect for the film. There are some amazing shots that only an artist like Fincher could have pulled it off. It is such a privilege to witness him at work, as every single scene in this particular film(and not only) is a pure masterpiece. Each scene is so well directed and shot that you can't help but want more. It truly is one of his finest work yet, a marvellous homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood. As for the cast, well... what is there left to say? Gary Oldman delivers yet another stunning performance as the alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who desperately tries to finish the screenplay for Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, an absolute gem. Each and every single that he is in is simply out of this world. His acting skills are brilliant once again and I truly believe that with this latest performance, he proves that he is one of the greatest actors of all time. His accent, his way of speaking, his movement and his personality is nothing but perfect in this particular film. Oldman's portrayal of the infamous screenwriter is one for the ages. The acting he delivered at Hearst's dinner party at the very end of the film was simply outstanding. On the other hand, Amanda Seyfried portrayed the stunning Marion Davies in such a unique and beautiful way that truly deserves some recognition. Her character is very important to the story and she managed to do justice to her character by delivering an amazing performance. Lily Collins, Tom Pelphrey and the other actors also delivered some fine performances, contributing to the brilliance of the final product. The cinematography in this film was simply out of this world. It was unreal and so, so good and well crafted. With the film being shot in b&amp;w, it feels like a time machine transporting you to a classy cinema back in the '30s, which is something really hard to achieve, but somehow, the crew managed to do so. The scenes are well shaped and there are some particular moments throughout the film that simply take your breath away, that's how astonishing the cinematography was. On the whole, I personally loved every second of MANK. Fincher proves once more that he is a one of a kind artist and that he can't make a bad film. This is truly a masterpiece that in the years to come will be seen as one of David Fincher's finest work. Oldman and Seyfried have a brilliant on screen chemistry and of course, they bring their share of magic to the film. For a one of a kind experience, I truly enourage you to see MANK as soon as possible."}, {"id": 240, "text": "I struggled to stay awake to the end of Mank directed by David Fincher on Netflix. It's an unmitigated disaster, confused and turgid from beginning to end. For example, in one part, a guy, Shelly Metcalf--who?--commits suicide, but the next scene shows the funeral of another guy, Irving Thalberg! Duh? Wha? Half the time you can't figure out which woman is Mank's wife, Sara, and which is his British amanuensis, Rita.The only good thing you can say about it is that Gary Oldman, an actor I've never heard of, will probably get at least an Oscar nomination for best actor because he's in every scene, most of the time playing a tousle-haired drunk. As if playing a tousle-haired drunk is original! Duh? Wha?The best acting in the film was by Amanda Seyfried, who plays William Randolph Hearst's mistress, Marion Davies. But even she gets short shrift and lost in the shuffle. Orson Wells--Tom Burke--doesn't even show up in person until 14 minutes from the end. This is not a spoiler.Bottom line: you are led to believe by the hype and publicity that this film is going to be about how the greatest American film ever made, Citizen Kane, was made. You would be wrong. Citizen Kane is not even mentioned once and there are only fleeting references to it.Mank is, essentially, the biopic of a drunk who died of alcoholism at the age of 55.Di-sas-ter!"}, {"id": 241, "text": "An excellent return from Director David Fincher. With everything getting postponed till next year, this easily shot up to the top of my most anticipated for winter. It's a little confusing for the first 25 minutes of the film but you soon start to get the grasp of it once the film starts moving along at a quicker pace. Gary Oldman's performance is easily one of my favorite performances of the year although it's not my personal favorite. His portrayal of screenwriter of Herman Mankiewicz is incredibly accurate and mesmerizing. He absolutely steals every scene he is in and he is incredible at showing this drunken genius. In fact, there isn't a single bad performance. Everyone does a great job although they aren't as fantastic as Gary Oldman. Speaking of screenwriting, the writing is great. Fincher has always done a good job at subtlety showing his characters and their changes and there isn't any difference here. The film looks great too. Fincher made the smart decision to make the film look like it came out of the 1940s meaning that audio and quality looks like the 40s which works very well for the tone the film is going for. I thought the story of Mankiewicz life mixed in with his inspiration and writing of the critically acclaimed Citizen Kane. Citizen Kane is obviously the better movie but it was great to see the inspiration Mankiewicz had for the film. There is a lot of political talk in the film relating to socialism vs capitalism which could turn some off but I enjoyed how the incorporated it by showing how different Mankiewicz was from his rich friends. I would definitely recommend it to fans of Fincher or want a film with good performances and potential Oscar talk."}, {"id": 242, "text": "I had been looking forward to seeing this film. When you like movies, then movies about movies are double fun. In this case the subject looked promising: the making of Citizen Kane, regarded by many as one of the greatest movies of all time.But I was dissapointed. 'Mank' dives deep into 1930's Hollywood. Perhaps a bit too deep, because the viewer needs to know the ins and outs of the studio system and all the big players, in order to really appreciate this film. And even when he does, the story in itself is a bit thin. The film is essentially a portrait of Herman Mankiewicz, who wrote the screenplay for Citizen Kane. But the parade of Hollywood people he deals with, is not very exciting and sometimes even confusing.A part of the film is also dedicated to politics. It draws a parallel with the present when it shows how Hollywood studio MGM produces film clips with misleading information, in order to let the Republican candidate win. An interesting observation, but it makes the story even more complicated.On the plus side is the beautiful cinematography of the film. It is shot in black &amp; white, in the style of the era, and it looks simply superb. But that's not enough to make this film appeal to an audience that goes beyond die-hard fans of Citizen Kane."}, {"id": 243, "text": "The making of Citizen Kaine -- and William Randolph Hearst's efforts to suppress the film -- are fascinating topics, but somehow all gets lost in a meandering, unfocused script.In addition, Gary Oldman is badly miscast as Mank, who was some twenty years younger at the time of these events than the actor here portraying him. Oldman also lacks charisma in the role.Amanda Seyfried -- as usual, the best thing in a movie in which she appears -- shines as Marion Davis, but again her part here amounts to little.On the positive side, the mise en scene and black-and-white cinematography are superb and more than adequate to the task of transporting contemporary viewers out of the miseries of Trump World and back to the miseries of the Great Depression, Hollywood-style.In sum, classic movie fans will have to consider Mank a swing and a miss..."}, {"id": 244, "text": "We get to delve into the trials and tribulations of Hollywood screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he attempts to finish the screenplay for the 'masterpiece' we know today to be Citizen Kane. However, we also delve into his alcoholism and the chaotic characters of Hollywood. I've just realised my title saying that Mank isn't a love letter to Hollywood may infer it's miss its mark however that is not what I mean. We don't see the bright lighted charming Hollywood dream you may expect but we instead get quite a dark and unfiltered insight into the inner world of Hollywood. Old movies and old Hollywood do hold a very special place in my heart so even classic black and white shots stir up a sense of magic for me so I found there was still a feeling of grandness and excitement to Mank despite its subject material. You can see Fincher has used the techniques and style of old Hollywood movies and even echoes the film-making in Citizen Kane and despite other people thinking it was a feeble attempt to replicate the old style I loved the fresh take. Mank serves as a brilliant ode to past film-making whilst offering up something fresh and I really enjoyed that aspect of it. Mank does not feel like a David Fincher film in the slightest. I'm not saying that as a bad thing, if anything it proves Fincher as an even more talented director than he already is as he can vary up the tone and atmosphere of his films and bring his audiences something completely different to what they're used to and that makes me very excited for possible future projects of his (let's hope we don't have to wait 6 years again). Despite all this, I wasn't as entranced and gripped by this film as I thought I would be. I don't really know why it is, it could be that I wasn't just in the right frame of mind or that the film narrowly missed the mark for it to be the perfect feature that ensured I never took my eyes away. Nonetheless, I think it's a brilliant film that displays Fincher as a brilliant directorial force (oh and how amazing were the performances in this? Oldman and Seyfried were the standouts for me). Definitely worth a watch even if you don't have a connection to Citizen Kane (because I bloody don't), it's for sure one of the top films of 2020."}, {"id": 245, "text": "Overall, I'm a bit disappointed with this film, technically it's flawless, Acting is top-notch but the script is never engaging enough. In spite of the homage this film pay to Citizen Kane like the cinematography and the narrative style, it never really come close to what makes Citizen Kane epic. When you compare Mank to Citizen Kane it's only then its main flaw comes to light.Citizen Kane is an epic story filled with multiple flashbacks and multiple point of view but it's the framing device of Rosebud that keeps the audience anchored. Mank by comparison, has no anchor. The story skip back and forth throughout Mank's life with seemingly no rhyme or reason, and it's difficult to tell what exactly the movie is trying to tell about its troubled protagonist. The cause of rift between Orson and mank, could have been an effective central conflict and anchor for the audience, but it's resolved as soon as it pops up. The performances are world-class esp Gary Oldman's, his portrayal of the brilliant washed-up alcoholic writer Herman Mankiewicz is terrific and award-worthy, Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies is excellent, John Burke as Orson Weller is well-casted, he's got the voice and the whole mannerisms right, I'd have love to see more of him. Charles Dance as William R. Hearst is memorable as well. The cinematography is first-rate; the B&amp;W is a nice throwback to the 30s/40s movies, the production design, costumes, sets all felt authentic to the era. I also enjoy the fantastic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, as it fits the atmosphere and does it job.Overall, Mank, in terms of craft, presentation and technical aspects, it's very impressive but as a story, it's a cold movie that is a struggle to connect with, on a deeper level. Technically brilliant but emotionally distant."}, {"id": 246, "text": "This film works like a time machine back to the very golden age of cinema. Not only is it set up and looks like a film from the decade, no every little aspect and detail fits it perfectly and if you wouldnt know better you would think it is production of those days. David Fincher did a masterful job and offers one of the best hommages to this era we ever had seen on screen. What Steven Soderbergh tried with The Good German was brought to perfection by Fincher. And the film is obviously also a love letter to his later father Jack Fincher who offers this unique screenplay. A Screenplay that feels so unreal in our current era of film as it bears many similiatires to Citizen Kane, the film that is depict here. A great piece of work and Fincher was ambitioned enough not to change any line of it. Acting wise it is superb. Gary Oldman once again proves that he is one of the finest actors of our time. Here he embodies so many different characters he played int he past and puts it into his Mank which should easily bring him in serious consideration for a well deserved second Oscar. He really gave everything here and will be hard to be beaten this year. Gary Oldman and David Fincher is a collobaration that came very late and hopefully will continue in the future. Amanda Seyfried also was fine enough. It could bring her a nom, but I dont see a win here. She was good however and more subtle than usual. She fits her role perfectly. Nice support by Charles Dance and especially Arliss Howard with a noteable mention of Tom Burke who gave us a great Orson Wells. Absolutely astonishing cinematography and a score that coudlnt have been chosen better.

Critics love films about the movie world, and when one thinks about it there are plenty of examples - Hollywood, being a typical one for instance. But Hollywood, for all its flaws, appealed to the masses with its galaxy of stars still not forgotten and the way it displayed what it takes to get to the top in the cutthroat town of Hollywood. But this is a film about a Scriptwriter, the man who wrote the famous movie 'Citizen Kane'. Scriptwriters rarely excite people the way movie stars do, usually are underrated and as fairly recent events shown not long ago, underpaid as well. Mankewicz or 'Mank' as he was usually referred to, seemed to have been an exception, having worked on some fairly prestigious movies. He also had a drink problem, and this became a problem for me as a viewer because he seemed to spend half the movie lying on his bed, too drunk to write or even speak. And when he was on his feet, he was like most drunks, loud and uncouth. Oldman is a great actor, he had a firm grip on the part he was asked to play. The trouble was, the story was plodding and boring, with much name dropping and back slapping, and talk about politics. And I am sure this is all riveting stuff for professional critics, but for me it was downright boring. And I suspect a lot of other viewers will feel the same way. We have seen too many films about men and women who live their lives staring into a bottle, and perhaps Mank was lucky, he got his oscar in the end. As for me, I felt like I deserved an oscar for watching it to the end, gorgeous though the whole production looked. You have to have a good story, and this was not a good story, it played out like some upmarket soap opera."}, {"id": 249, "text": "I love David Fincher's films. I haven't seen all of this but from the ones I've seen, I can tell he is a very talented director. Mank is yet another brilliant film by him but it is certainly not one of his best.Mank shows 1930s Hollywood through the eyes of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he writes the script of Citizen Kane.This was easily in my top 5 most anticipated movies of 2020. It's been six years since Fincher's last film and for Mank to be starring Gary Oldman and revolving around Citizen Kane and old Hollywood made me extremely excited. With Mank finally releasing on Netflix, I can say he did it again but it's one of his more divisive films.Mank is a very different Fincher film and I appreciate him for trying out something beyond his comfort zone. Its subject matter and content won't interest a lot of people and so this film is mainly targeted towards cinephiles. Like The Social Network, Mank is a very talky film. It is mainly dialogue driven and moves at a leisurely pace which may put some people off. I wasn't ever bored during the film but I wish the pacing would speed up at certain points. I should also mention how most of the film doesn't even focus on the battle between Welles and Mankiewicz over Citizen Kane. The film rather puts its attention on Hollywood and its relation with politics at that time which made the film more interesting to me but some people may not enjoy it.What I absolutely loved about Mank was its presentation. There is so much detail and care put into the overall look. The black and white felt very suitable, the costume design was great and I loved how the sound quality was adjusted to sound like how it would during the 1930-40s. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was so different from what they normally do but I thought they did a great job and it matched perfectly with the time period. It truly impressed me how much effort was put into making the film feel like it was from that period of time. I also liked how the structure of the story was reminiscent of Citizen Kane.The acting was solid throughout. Gary Oldman did a great job and may possibly get a Best Actor nomination. I thought Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins and Tuppence Middleton were fantastic in their roles. Charles Dance was also extremely good here as William Randolph Hearst. Tom Pelphery and Arliss Howard were equally amazing and the rest of the cast did a fine job with each of their roles.All in all, I really enjoyed Mank. The attention to detail in recreating the 1930-40s style of film was extraordinary and Jack Fincher's screenplay was pretty solid. This film is definitely going to be a frontrunner in the Oscars and I cannot wait to see it again."}, {"id": 250, "text": "Magnificent, masterful and memorable; Mank showcases Hollywood's golden era in what feels like a feverish dream and adds another extraordinary film to David Fincher's repertoire.In this drama, 1930's Hollywood is reevaluated through the eyes of social critic and alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he races to finish the screenplay of Citizen Kane.It's hard to find the words to express how Mank really makes you feel; an alcohol-induced and cigarette smoking period piece that expertly captures the time, the place and the people of Hollywood in the 1930s-40s. Written by Fincher's father, Jack, prior to his death in 2003, Mank brings old Hollywood to life and focuses on these real-life characters perfectly. The script itself is outstanding. Anyone who's ever been interested in the golden age of Hollywood will have a field day with all the characters seen or mentioned in this film. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is pitch-perfect and jazzy for the period. Name me a better sounding score this year; I'll wait. Fincher's attention to detail is what drove me over the edge, in the sense that everything is researched and so authentic. Shot in glorious black and white and did I mention the sound? It's like you're watching a film of that era. The mono sound is an incredibly nice touch by Fincher and so are the cigarette burns in the editing. The performances are some of this years best. Gary Oldman is a firecracker and breathes, walks and talks like Herman Mankiewicz. Are we even surprised that Oldman can embody any character on screen? No. Amanda Seyfried is so elegant and majestic as Marion Davies. The starlet delivers one of the best supporting roles of 2020. A special mention goes to Charles Dance as William Randolph Hearst, who delivers an impeccable performance. Mank is without a doubt one of the years best and most beautifully shot films and it's a film that will become a classic in its own right.

That is a whole other movie and a huge controversy, so I won't go into it.Boring, self-conscious, inaccurate, there are a few acting kudos - Gary Oldman as Mankiewicz is remarkable. I love Lily Collins, and she doesn't disappoint here as Mank's secretary. Tom Burke makes a marvelous Welles.There is other good acting to be had in Mank, but there is also very self-conscious, let's pretend we're in the 1930s and '40s dialogue and acting. It all seemed very put on. That was mostly from minor characters.I loved the character of Marion Davies - her character is sympathetic - but I could have done without Amanda Seyfried's bad acting. Charles Dance was a fabulous Hearst.All in all, a big bore. However, if it inspires you to read more about Mankiewicz, the fight over the Citizen Kane screenplay, and old Hollywood, I recommend it.

That being said, The Coen brothers will probably always make more money. Why? Because US movie audiences are traditionally not erudite (and 90% of them don't even know what that word means), conventional, and prone to sex and violence. The Finchers have bravely gone where few others fear to tread in Hollywood; to the intellectual part of our collective brain in the audience. Kudos for bravery and an earnest attempt to scale Mount Stupid in Hollywood. I like Gary Oldham, but not as an intellectual; I think he was miscast. The filming was quite correctly done in black and white, but the lighting was a bit too dim for my tastes. I really don't want to feel as if I am dying while I am watching the screen. The San Simeon scenes were well done and accurate according to my Uncle Arthur, who was a waiter there for 23 years. He kept a lively journal with over 200 anecdotes which he left me. He retired to San Diego. I did not care for the time hopping and flashback sequences; they might be confusing to the average viewer. Also, it might have been more interesting to see how the career of Herman developed. We know how Joe's developed, but this was supposed to be a picture about Herman. Actually, Joe was a better writer than Herman. Mixing politics and careers is usually a bad idea.; ask those who were blackballed during the McCarthy era. If you want to be a communist; fine; just keep it to yourself. If you want to be to the right of Adolph Hitler, like Louis B Mayer and William R Hearst; fine; just keep your views to yourself. I personally met Patricia Hearst in NYC a few times during meetings several years ago after she headed Hearst Publications, and she was a charming woman, who never gave a hint of her political views. I had always respected that from people in power. But back to the review: the performances are top-notch, although a few are over the top. But, hey, this is Gary Oldham, king of over the top. Here he is the most restrained I have ever seen him. Citizen Kane angles have been done to death in the last 20 years, as Hollywood has become less and less original. At least the Fincher brothers are a breath of fresh air, and I look forward to their other projects.

By this I mean I feel like I could have watched 2 more hours of this movie easily without feeling tired and droopy and that's with me watching this movie on only 5 hours of sleep.Positives: To begin with I want to discuss how perfectly the film is shot. The movie's cinematography is stunningly great. The film's use of black and white, a constant score in the background, the sound quality, and the use of cigarette burns in the right corner of the film give the film the quality of looking like it was filmed at the same time as Citizen Kane. The movie's acting is outstanding, but especially the performance of Gary Oldman who shines in this role as he has shined in many previous roles. Oldman truly captures the feeling of Mank and makes the character sympathetic and feel real. The costumes and sets also give the film the feeling of being made in the late 30s. The writing of the film by Jack Fincher is just top notch and flows so well. This is all aided by David Fincher's brilliant direction for which he should win Best Director. The film engrossed me throughout without ever leaving a feeling of dullness while watching it.

So Mank is the new straight to Netflix movie directed by David Fincher from a script written by his late father Jack Fincher . The movie is a biopic about the late Herman J Mankiewicz who is best known for writing the movie , Citizen Kane , which is considered one of the greatest movies ever made. Herman or  Mank  as he's referred to in the movie is played masterfully by Gary Oldman who's performance is aided to from the cinematography of the movie being all film strip esque and 1930s ish and will no doubt be a serious contender at the Oscars. Amanda Seyfried was also great in this movie. Despite the top notch production and great talent though , I felt this movie was boring and I'm someone who actually enjoys arthouse movies. Now the story is set in 1930s Hollywood where Herman is in isolation writing the script for citizen kane for Orson Welles aided by someone to dictate to and a german nurse . Then there are flashbacks to before his isolation where he meets producers , Gambles , drinks and all Hollywood - ish stuff. But its very hard to keep up with the characters cause you don't know anything about them other than that they are either studio heads , politicians or both . And since you're not familiar with any of them , it just doesn't work . If you've seen the popular HBO show Entourage or even the netflix show Bojack Horseman , you know how great shows set in Hollywood are . There's agents , writers , directors , scandals , crisis management , PR teams and so much more things there to set up drama , and the one other thing common to both shows is how they use current politicians , current actors with cameos , pop culture references and a whole lot of stuff we could relate to . This movie is pretty much Entourage in the 30s without an Entourage for Mank . Mank meets people , has smart stuff to say , brokers deals with production houses and that's just about it. Mostly it has to do with the fact like I said before that we dont know this world , in Entourage someone says  James Cameron's directing Aquaman  and we didn't need the show telling us who he was and in Bojack Horseman when someone says  this movie is going to cannes  we didn't need the show explaining what it was , cause we just know things from pop culture. This movie on the other hand needed to tell us that for us to know the world , what's at stake and who the characters are , instead it just doesn't and I think Jack Fincher didn't feel the need to do that since he wrote this script at a time when 30s pop culture was common knowledge , atleast among film critics. Now David Fincher is one of my favorite directors working today and I'm a huge fan of his movies for the different themes in them and how perfectly crafted the movies look and are acted . Speaking of themes , Fight club was about anti consumerism , Gone girl was about pretending to be someone else and all that . Now this movie doesn't really have a theme , or maybe it does and I didn't notice said theme , which only means its subtle. Now David Fincher has made few masterclass movies in his long career as a director and that's cause he's worked with different writers such as Gyllian Flynn , Steve Zailian , Andrew Kevin Walker and Aaron Sorkin , despite working with different writers , he's made his movies with his own vision in mind and you'd distinctly know each one of them as his own movie , but his father I don't think is someone who Fincher would collaborate with if he was not his father , cause I wouldn't have guessed this movie to be directed by him had I not known about it previously . In the end , Mank definitely doesn't look like something Fincher would've made unless he was paying homage to his late father , nevertheless the movie doesn't dissapoint you completely cause of its great acting and quality of production ."}, {"id": 256, "text": "Once upon a time, screenwriter and journalist Jack Fincher crafted a script for a biopic centering on hasbin screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz. Intended to be directed by his son, acclaimed filmmaker David Fincher, the film never came into fruition for over 20 years, even passing Jack's death in 2003, until the late 2010s when the project was officially announced, with Gary Oldman starring in the lead role. Released to critical acclaim and audience appraisal, the ends seemed to have justified the means for this project to finally see the light of day. But how does it hold up after so many years in limbo?The film's main narrative centers around famed yet alcoholic screenwriter Mankiewicz, whose career in 1930s Hollywood connects to his written draft of Citizen Kane. As this is a character piece focusing on the events of Mank throughout his time in the motion picture industry, there's so much worth unraveling. Whether it'd be Mank's personal demons throughout his life, the corrupt bosses he works for at MGM, or even his own opinions on the famed political businessman William Randolph Hearst and his mistress Marion Davies, it's clear that his career was met with so many encounters of hardship. The way the film structures these events is through flashbacks of Mank during his time working under big named people, and present day showcasing him crafting draft 1 of Citizen Kane. The flashback sequences showcase Classic Hollywood at its peak when major studios were thriving, as well as the people behind it like Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg, and yet Mank is depicted as just another writer. It's no wonder the audience would feel for Mank as a cynical grump towards the bigger dogs.As for Gary Oldman portraying Mank himself, he is able to create internal and outer despair both in the past and present. His alcoholic tendencies may have destroyed his reputation as a sophisticated man of show business, but his clever craft of script structure made his contributions to the revolutionary Welles film justify the means. Outside of Mank's conflicting relationship with his family, including young brother Joe and wife, and the studio big wits, his more standout relationship centers around Marion Davies, who was more trustful and intelligent than the public gave her credit for. In addition to Amanda Seyfried capturing her personality through her spunk and thoughtfulness, Davies just happens to be connected with the powerful Hearst, for she still has a mind of her own and her conversations with Mank are quite charming and friendly. It makes their time together feel more genuine than the pretentious politics that surrounded Hollywood back then, since it becomes a contrast of the corrupt conservative executives and the more free thinking liberal minded artists.Given the film is set in the 1930s, it is also recreated to the look and feel of an old timey black &amp; white movie from said time period. Not only is Erik Messerschmidt's cinematography look authentic to how those older films were presented through grainy cameras, but the sound design adds that extra spice of believability with a bit of muffledness and less clean audio as opposed to the modern day stereo. In a way, Mank feels to fit the time period a lot more than most biopics set in a specific time period around Hollywood. In addition, the setting of 1930s Hollywood looks phenomenal with the scope and scale courtesy of production designer Donald Graham Burt, who made every possible location in the motion picture industry look like a relic of that time period. Based on their past collaborations with Fincher, composers Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross have a quaint balance of upbeat jazzy tempos and very somber grim scores to reflect the film's more dramatic moments. Coincidentally like Kane, there was more than one artist to make this experience memorable.Now it's no doubt that Mank is certainly a thrilling experience, but one thing is for certain once you watch it on Netflix. Considering that it's still debated whether or not Welles himself wrote a single word in the script for Citizen Kane, ever since Pauline Kael's controversial Raising Kane essay, this film does reflect the Mankiewicz side of things more than the Welles side. However, one thing that can be said for certain is that Mankiewicz was really only one piece of the puzzle to a film that would influence people for decades. So whichever side you agree with, take this biopic with the utmost grain of salt possible."}, {"id": 257, "text": "I've written a few things in my life, and I can affirm that writing is a peculiar business. To me (Spartacus Super Bowl), writing something original feels like living underwater for hours at a stretch. Two films I kind of like have tried to represent writers' processes: Capote and Mank. It doesn't really work out in either case.Writing is a peculiar business and not necessarily dramatically intriguing. While you can show how the writer is developing his material (Capote interviewing Perry Smith, and Mankiewicz jestering Hearst), you can't really show where their desire is leading their literary art. What vision of the infinite are the writers pursuing? Neither film really assays that inquiry--that isn't really film art, it's the definition of literature.Mank pushes the actual writing offstage for the most part, and uses a lot of its run time on a political subplot that seems like it was thrown in to make the film relevant to 2020. It doesn't quite figure out the relationship with Marion Davies, either, and that's the most attractive element in the film. It comes across as kind of boring, a long harangue by an angry drunk whose script takes a nasty shot at a woman who didn't deserve the scorn. That's something Mank and Capote share: they are stark and uncomplimentary depictions of the nasty consequences of the drinking life.I'm glad Fincher made Mank because it looks and sounds fantastic, and I suppose it's appropriate that a movie about writing a movie would fail in part because of the writing. Writing is a peculiar business."}, {"id": 258, "text": "Hollywood in the 30's, through the eyes of Herman Mankiewicz, an alcoholic screenwriter whose task is to write what for many is the best film ever made: Citizen Kane.The narrative starts in a hurry, as if we already have some knowledge about the subject that is told in the story, which in a way can be advantageous (but not mandatory), to appreciate the film.It's an attractive biopic, because it's boring at certain times, in a good way, at least for me. It has its controversies, for being a faithful portrait, or not, of what really happened between Wells and Mank.Gary Oldman's interpretation is very solid, there is a clear at ease with the character, with very fluid expressions. The photography is good, with careful work in relation to the detail given to the techniques used in the Golden Era of Hollywood, in a certain homage to the style."}, {"id": 259, "text": "Hollywood likes to portray Hollywood, like the narcissistic city that it is, and so from time to time you get these high budget, grand cast extravaganzas that do nothing but explain their place of origin. Mank is a black and white ode to the 30's Hollywood era, all wrapped around a conspiracy theory core. You get Gary Oldman playing the cowriter of Citizen Kane, the most important and beloved film that no one really watches anymore, and the story of how the story of this film was written. It wrongly assumes that you not only have watched Citizen Kane, but you are also familiarized with its history, the importance of the little details and the big personalities of the era. And therein lies its failure to connect to the audience.If you ignore that and you don't give a damn about Citizen Kane, you can enjoy a fast talked snapshot of an era film, very well acted and complete with references to events and political strategies that mirror the present. You need to watch it even if only to see that fake news is not something new to 2020. It may be a little too presumptuous, a little self absorbed, but a good film nonetheless. I am sure it's better if you know what the hell it is referring to, though."}, {"id": 260, "text": "I'm sure Mank will find an audience among cineastes, especially those who love movies about the movies but despite all the craft on display I doubt very much if this will set the box-office on fire, (though David Fincher aficionados might give it a go out of curiosity). Mank, (not a good title, by the way), is Herman J. Mankiewicz, co-writer with Orson Welles, of Citizen Kane, and this movie, written by Fincher's father, Jack, some years ago, posits the idea that the screenplay of ...Kane was written by Mankiewicz and Mankiewicz alone.This is a movie strong on name-dropping, (we are told who everyone is as soon as they appear), and it's definitely smart and, thanks to Erik Messerschmidt's stunning black and white cinematography, it looks incredible but it also has a strip-cartoon like quality giving it the feel of a potted history of Hollywood at a time when MGM had more stars than there were in the heavens. It is, in other words, a niche movie for a niche market.Mank is Gary Oldman, (excellent in an Oscar-bait performance). Welles is British actor Tom Burke, a splendid Charles Dance is William Randolph Hearst and Amanda Seyfried is an outstanding Marion Davies and there are scenes in the movie as good as anything you will see this year. It's also very good on the 'Hearst is Kane' idea and if we have to have gossipy show-biz biopics then we can't complain if they all look and sound as good as Mank. This is the kind of film, come Oscar time, I'm sure the Academy will honour in a self-congratulatory frame of mind as if finally honouring Citizen Kane itself. It may not be Fincher's masterpiece but it just might be the one that will finally win him that little gold-plated man we call Oscar."}, {"id": 261, "text": "... that being people who are really into film history, and quite a bit of obscure film history at that.The film tells the tale of screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz as he labors over the screenplay for Citizen Kane in a remote desert bungalow, attended to by more people than he would like. The structure of the film is much like Kane itself - you have a story set in the present explained by a series of flashbacks. And those flashbacks explain who Mankiewicz is now and why he is writing such a hit piece on William Randolph Hearst in the first place.This is something I would probably want to watch a second time because there are quite a few things coming at you fast and furious. In particular, there is a scene at Hearst' San Simeon where, besides the well identified Irving Thalberg and L.B. Mayer, according to the cast list there is Norma Shearer and Charlie Chaplin in the crowd - I think he is at the piano but I'd have to watch again.Why do I think so many people think this is just an average film? A lot of the flashbacks have to do with the 1934 California governor's race in which the Democratic candidate is socialist author Upton Sinclair and the Republican candidate seems to be Brand X. In a year when I think most Americans have had it with listening to politics, political ads, and political bickering of all stripes, this might not be something that very many people want to watch. I wasn't familiar with this episode in political history and thus I found it interesting.A couple of questions the film raised - Was John Houseman of Paper Chase fame really such a complete nuisance that Welles and Mank just wanted to smack him with a fly swatter? Also, I'm pretty familiar with Marion Davies' filmography. There was a scene where she was about to be burned to the stake in what appeared to be a western. I have no idea what film that was supposed to be.I highly recommend this film, but your mileage will probably vary."}, {"id": 262, "text": "Mank is a biopic slice of the career of Herman Jacob Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman), the Hollywood screenwriter who was the pen behind what is regularly voted by critics as being the greatest movie of all time - Citizen Kane. Citizen Kane was written in 1940 (and released the following year) and much of the action in Mank takes place in a retreat in the Mojave desert when Mank, crippled by a full-cast on the leg, has been 'sent' by Orson Welles (Tom Burke) to complete the screenplay without alcohol and other worldly distractions. Helping administer to his writing and care needs are English typist Rita Alexander (Lily Collins) and carer Fraulein Freda (Monika Gossmann). However, although Mank produces brilliant stuff, his speed of progress exasperates his 'minder' and editor John Houseman (Sam Troughton). (Yes, THAT John Houseman, the actor.)In developing the story, we continuously flash-back six years - - nicely indicated by typed 'script notes' - - to 1934 where Mank is working at MGM studios for Louis B. Mayer (Arliss Howard) and mixing in the circles of millionaire publisher William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance) and his glamorous young wife, actress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried). Allegedly, the Citizen Kane script was based on Hearst. But what souring of the relationship could have led to such a stinging betrayal during those six years?Mank has an embarrassment of acting riches. Mankiewicz is a fascinating character: charismatic, reckless, passionate and the definition of a loose cannon. Basically, a dream for a great actor to portray. And Gary Oldham IS a great actor. After doing Churchill in Darkest Hour, he here turns in a magnificent performance as the alcoholic writer. Never more so than in a furious tirade at a dinner table late in the film, which will likely be the equivalent to the Churchill tiger speech come Oscar time. Surely, there's a Best Actor nomination there?Equally impressive though are some of the supporting cast.Tom Burke - so good as TV's Strike - gives a fine impersonation of the great Orson Welles: full of confidence and swagger. It's only a cameo role, but he genuinely 'feels' like the young Welles.Amanda Seyfried: It took me almost half of the film to recognize her as Marion Davies, and her performance is pitch perfect - the best of her career in my view, and again Oscar-worthy.Arliss Howard for me almost steals the show as the megalomaniac Mayer: his introduction to Mank's brother Joe (Tom Pelphrey) has a memorable walk with me walkthrough of the studio with Mayer preaching on the real meaning of MGM and the movies in general. Breathtakingly good.But - I said nearly steals the show.... the guy who made off with it in a swag-bag for me was our own Charles Dance as Hearst. Quietly impressive throughout, he just completely nails it with his organ-grinder's monkey speech towards the end of the movie. Probably my favourite monologue of 2020. Chilling. I'd really like to see Dance get a Supporting Actor nomination for this.The screenplay was originally written by director David Fincher's late father Jack. Jack Fincher died in 2002, and this project has literally been decades in the planning. Mankiewicz has a caustic turn of phrase, and there are laugh-out lines of dialogue scattered throughout the script. Write hard, aim low implores Houseman at one point. And my personal favourite: Mank's puncturing of the irony that the Screen Writers Guild has been formed without an apostrophe! A huge LOL!Aside from the witty dialogue, the script has a nuance to the storytelling that continually surprises. A revelation from Freda about Mank's philanthropic tendencies brings you up short in your face-value impression of his character. And the drivers that engineer the rift between Mankiewicz and Hearst - based around the story of the (fictional) director Shelly Metcalf (Jamie McShane) - are not slapped in your face, but elegantly slipped into your subconscious.In addition, certain aspects are frustratingly withheld from you. Mank's long-suffering wife (a definition of the phrase) Sara (Tuppence Middleton) only occasionally comes into focus. The only reference to his kids are a crash in the background as they remodel the family home. Is the charismatic Mank a faithful husband or a philanderer? Is the relationship with Rita Alexander just professional and platonic (you assume so), or is there more going on? There's a tension there in the storytelling that never quite gets resolved: and that's a good thing.Mank also has an embarrassment of technical riches. Even from the opening titles, you get the impression that this is a work of genius. All in black and white, and with the appearance of 40's titling, they scroll majestically in the sky and then - after Charles Dance - effortlessly scroll down to the desert highway. It's evidence of an attention to detail perhaps forced by lockdown. (MUM - I'm bored. Go up to your room and do some more work on that movie then.)It's deliciously modern, yet retro. I love the fact that the cross-reel circle cue-marks appear so prominently... the indicators that the projectionist needs to spin up the next reel. I think they are still used in most modern films, but not as noticeably as in the old films... and this one!A key contributor to the movie is cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt. Everything looks just BEAUTIFUL, and it is now a big regret that I didn't go to watch this on the big screen after all. Surely there will be a cinematography Oscar nomination for this one. Unbelievably, this is Messerschmidt's debut feature as director of cinematography!Elsewhere, you can imagine multiple other technical Oscar noms. The tight and effective editing is by Kirk Baxter. And the combination of the glorious production design (Donald Graham Burt) and the costume design (Trish Summerville) make the movie emanate the same nostalgia for Hollywood as did last year's Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood.... albeit set forty years earlier. Even the music (by the regular team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) might get nominated, since I had to go back and check that it actually HAD music at all: it's subtly unobtrusive and effective.The only area I had any issue with here was the sound mixing, since I had trouble picking up some of the dialogue.Although I can gush about this movie as a technical work of art, I'm going to hold off a 10* review on this one. For one reason only. I just didn't feel 100% engaged with the story (at least with a first watch). The illustrious Mrs Movie Man summed it up with the phrase I just didn't care enough what happened to any of the characters. I think though that this one is sufficiently subtle and cerebral that it deserves another watch.Will it win Oscars. Yes, for sure. Hell, I would like to put a bet on that Mank will top the list of the most nominations when they are announced. (Hollywood likes nothing more than a navel-gazing look at its history of course). And an obvious nomination here will be David Fincher for Best Director. But, for me, this falls into a similar bucket as that other black and white multi-Oscar winner of two year's ago Roma. It's glorious to look at; brilliantly directed; but not a movie I would choose to readily reach for to repeatedly watch again.(For the full graphical review, please check out bob the movie man on the web, or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks.)"}, {"id": 263, "text": "As I'm reading J. Hoberman's An Army of Phantoms, it's quite fascinating to see persons that are subject in the book be beatured on the big screen. Albeit a bit fictionalized, it takes place before the events in the book. Back in the day, politics shaped movies way more than they do now. (Although there are examples of this happening to appease certain nations in the world.) Propaganda in movies to shape the public's mind is something only Herman J. Mankiewicz frowns upon in Mank.It took me longer to watch because I had to keep consulting Google and IMDB for the period correct mentions of events and persons. I left the movie not only better informed about how Citizen Kane came to be written, the impression I now have of the people involved helps me to humanize them. They're no longer just names on a page for me. The magic of the movies.One has to mention the thorough effort to establish the particular sense of nostalgia for the 80-year old setting. They way it is filmed brings forth the unmitigated sense that this is a passion project. David Fincher did not hold back turning this era-defining story into this skillful product, although I do feel sorry for the actors having to go through multiple takes to reach his defenition of perfection. (Stanley Kubrick-flashbacks anyone?).However, that leaves us with a picture that has accomplished acting, remeniscant of old Hollywood that is neither glamorous nor dismissive.

Most biographies or historical movies are cheesy Oscar baits with over the top acting, something Mank isn't. Ignoring the historical accuracy and over dramatization of alcoholism Mank is one of the finest works by David Fincher. Fincher who is usually known for adapting thrillers and psychological dramas experiments with a satirical biography on screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, a script written by his late father Jack Fincher.Herman (Gary Oldman) is now a past it alcoholic screenwriter who is given an opportunity by the young Orson Welles (Tom Burke) to write the screenplay for his upcoming motion picture. Herman aka Mank takes time away from his wife Sara (Tuppence Middleton) to recover from his leg injury and alcoholism living in a farm house accompanied by caretakers Rita (Lily Collins) and Frieda (Monika Gossman). He spends the next few weeks there adapting the screenplay of what we know as Citizen Kane. The movie follows a serious of flashbacks in a non linear narrative where Mank's politics and acquaintances with Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried) and William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance) help him write his last script.Given the time period Mank is set in we except to see a lot of popular characters in it but they all have very little screen time including Orson Welles. The three leading actresses are given important roles but its Amanda Seyfried who had the most potential to show her talents. Gary Oldman gives the best performance of the year and in his career, the dinner scene monologue is similar to Daniel Day Lewis's all time great performance in There Will Be Blood. David Fincher does a great job at adapting this script, his choice to shoot it B&amp;W is brilliant. In this way, the authenticity of the time period is maintained.Mank does feel a bit long towards the end, some viewers would find it a bit slow compared to Fincher's previous work. You can't say the story of a man in two hours, you can only leave an impression of it; this is precisely what Fincher does."}, {"id": 265, "text": "Initial Thoughts: In some ways this film ranges from a 4/10 to a 9/10 style film. Why is it a 4? Because the beginning feels like a mess. As if the producer and director weren't sure on what direction they wanted to go. In addition, I thought this film would include how the filming was done for Citizen Kane, and not just how the film was written. Why is it a 9? The main body of the film shows how Mank had lots of time to write a screenplay to very little time all the while going through the motions of Hollywood drama.Pros: For me the film depicted the tumultuous lifestyle of Hermann J. Mankiewicz very well. Through all the years of his drinking, gambling, and fighting for his name to be credited on the films he wrote. The black and white filming also brings the emotions of the day into a better perspective although it made it dreary at times and hard to focus. However, the style of film was well enjoyed as compared to modern day films, night scenes were hard to see. I also enjoyed the numerous flashbacks as they are the main part of the film that brings the back and forth between how Mank lived and how he was living by the end almost simultaneously.Cons: Going back to the black and white filming being dreary and hard to focus. At times I would zone out due to the fact that a lot was happening and I couldn't focus so I listened to what was going on for a minute. More of my con than a movie con is the fact that I also felt out of element, as I was not fancy enough to understand such marvelous mind(s). I digress, however, as to me, there were not many cons to go on.Overall: A long bio-drama that should be enjoyed, especially if you enjoy early style movies. I wouldn't recommend watching in theatres, but if you have an inkling to watch it, wait for the Netflix release on Friday, December 6th.Enjoy the show!"}, {"id": 266, "text": "Even 9 years after the Best Picture Winning The Artist, black and white films seem like an impossibility.

His latest - Mank is a film that's both nigh impossible and is yet a miracle of a film, his skills behind the camera pop out once again, as Mank with its black and white often dark picturing sets the tone that it feels like if feels like it was filmed in the early 40s, plus it might be hard to spot at times but you can even hear the static of an old fashioned cinema projector. It's almost as if the Golden age of 30s Hollywood is relived in thriving life. And with Gary Oldman's brilliant Oscar worthy performance he brings his Herman Mankiewicz to life in glorious tones that are humorous, rustic and even sounds close to his Darkest Hour performance, not that, that is in any way a bad thing. As he races to write his masterpiece, Citizen Kane. Granted Mank is a little slow as it takes a long time for it to finally kick in but again that's not bad either because as it's set in the 40s it feels as if Fincher filmed it with all the time in the world. And thanks to Jack Fincher's (David's late father) sharply written, Mank like Citizen Kane 79 years before it will become a classic in its own right, a film like is rare and to exist at a time like this is nothing short of a miracle. 5/5. Fincher does it again. A must see."}, {"id": 267, "text": "Mank (2020) : Brief Review -Watch it only for Gary Oldman's performance and to know how Classic Citizen Kane was written. You know i think David Fincher doesn't have fine hands in drama genre like he has in thriller genre so expecting too much is unfair alright. Mank is biographical drama based on screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz's (pet name Mank) days during 30s in Hollywood and how he developed the idea of Orson Welles's most acclaimed film till date Citizen Kane. Well i was more interested to know about Cirizen Kane than knowing about Mank's life which does showcase anything useful or spectacular at all. The writing of Mank is at fault because it failed to clarify the main reasons behind peculiar activities done by him. What was he upto, why was he drinking too much, why was he having platonic affair with a married woman when he had faithful and loyal wife (and why she was still staying with him), why the hell did he put his earned money and reputation at stake for some election results? All these questions goes without any answers and that's why his character don't make much sense in 130 minutes long film. Gary Oldman's fantastic performance is the best thing to watch in Mank. I loved this guy in strong supporting roles in Nolan's films but in leading role he is overwhelming. Rest of the cast if fine but the problem is wrongly taken reference from the real characters. You need to have plenty of knowledge about old Hollywood (1930-1940) to feel the nostalgia here because set designing is awesome but if you do not know much then all of it will look damn rough to you. David Fincher's direction is good i would say despite the not so good writing. Fincher's idea to tell the past and the present on alternate occasions was nice. Overall, Mank offers you two big things one is Gary Oldman and the second is backdrop of Citizens Kane (if you have watched the film already). Rest, there is nothing notable.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest"}, {"id": 268, "text": "Mank is one of those films that they can only really release close to the end of the year. A definite one placed for the awards ceremonies with a stellar cast, big name director and ambitious story, this one actually lives up to the hope.We have Gary Oldman as 'Mank', who is the writer of the classic Citizen Kane movie original script, and we have here a movie filmed in a parallel style to Citizen Kane retelling the underlying story to it. Mank is no angel, but you grow to be engaged in this story of his time in a politically charged 1930's, which doesn't paint a fairytale view of the management of Hollywood. If anything, this is practically a film noir.There's no getting round the parallels this story is trying to make about the modern day 'fake news' and media manipulation, but I'll leave the politics out of this write-up for a more appropriate forum. However it's still a thoughtful reminder without shoving any points down your throat.I found the entire story to be captivating, although admittedly a bit tough to follow early on as its dialogue but let's the actions tell the story rather than any direct exposition. Gary Oldman is fabulous in the lead, and surely must be up for Oscar contenders for his sublime performance as the wailing alcoholic maverick screenwriter. However the whole cast is at their peak: Charles Dance as the cold Hearst, Amanda Seyfried as the 'Rosebud' inspiration and especially Tom Burke as Orson Welles are brilliant. Tom Burke's performance is so uncanny it's untrue.It was a brave choice to film this all in black &amp; white, but the whole thing is lush. You could actually watch this whole film without the sound, it's so good just to look at. Add in a wonderful soundtrack and a fine pacing, you have a wonderful film.I just took out a Netflix subscription (yes, I know I'm very late to the party), but I still went to watch this film in the cinema. It was worth it! This film deserves to be seen on a big screen with others. This film is about cinema, and about the light &amp; shade of the world. I really highly recommend this."}, {"id": 269, "text": "You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one.Mank is a cinephiles wet dream, a poignant, incredibly sophisticated look at Herman Mankiewicz's career, social life and relationship with Orson Wells with a career-best performance from Gary Oldman and a screenplay so good it's practically guaranteed to win at this years academy awards.The thing that surprised me most about Mank is it's incredibly dense look at the Hollywood system and chokehold over creative freedom and political bias. What I believe to be the absolute best aspect of Mank is the incredible and fitting use of flashbacks to key elements in Mank's life as he is dealing with new struggles brought to him by Orson Wells. As for the film's depiction of Wells, yes, I do believe he has definitely been vilified a tad, however, neither Wells nor Mankiewicz are alive to defend who really wrote Citizen Kane, so we will never know the validity of the events of the film. As for if the film gave me any new thoughts to the meaning of Citizen Kane, yes, it did give me a whole new potential perspective on what the film is really saying and who Mankiewicz is trying to portray with his characters. I think most fascinating of which is what Mankiewicz says about William Randolph Hearst in the film and there incredibly telling conversation in the third-act.The performances here are top-notch. Gary Oldman's portrayal of Herman Mankiewicz is absolutely unbelievable. I believe he's in every scene of this film and he kept my eyes completely glued to the screen throughout the entire runtime. Oldman's performance here might be a career-best and he should get some serious oscar attention; I honestly think a second oscar might be in Oldman's future and I wouldn't be opposed to that at all. I know that Amanda Seyfried's performance has been getting a lot of discussion, I think with her small screentime she is indeed fantastic. Her charisma and charm here are unmatched with the rest of the cast and she's a definite scene-stealer, however, I do not know if she will be getting the best actress oscar that many people seem to think is a guarantee. However, I must give a huge shout out to Tom Burke who not only sounds freakishly like Orson Wells but has an incredibly similar likeness to him, it was uncanny. As for the rest of the supporting cast, they were all truly great there was no weak link within the cast, everyone should be incredibly proud of what they've done here.No matter your thoughts about the film itself, what everyone will undeniably agree with is that the film looks fantastic, the cinematography here is my favourite so far this year. The black and white and 40's aspect to the feel of the film add so much to the atmosphere of the film and Mankiewicz's mental state. There is a scene in particular on election night were Herman and crew go to a nightclub and Herman goes in and out of an altered state of consciousness, the way it was portrayed was seriously incredible.As for the screenplay written by the late Jack Fincher, (the father of the film's director David Fincher), it was by far the standout element of this entire film. What Fincher is saying here is very interesting stuff, however, if you are not knowledgeable about the film industry or the film Citizen Kane, you will have a really hard time getting the most out of this film. Thankfully, I like to think I'm pretty knowledgeable about both subjects so I really got a lot out of the film. The dialogue here especially is so smooth and sharp, some of the comebacks here are truly hilarious.In finality, Mank did not disappoint. What David Fincher and crew were able to make here is really astounding, I recommend you all go watch Citizen Kane again and have a quick read about the state of the film industry during the great depression, then go watch Mank and get the absolute most out of this incredible film."}, {"id": 270, "text": "Have you ever heard the parable of the organ-grinder's monkey?After six years, David Fincher is back.With Mank, Fincher and his late father Jack tap into a sense of nostalgia for Old Hollywood that doesn't feel loving, but rather refreshingly cynical and spiteful, just like its main character. Although the film can sometimes be unbalanced under the weight of its many subplots and storylines, Gary Oldman turns in another brilliant performance as Herman Mankiewicz. If there's only one reason to see this film, it is him. He toes the line between sanity and eccentricity so well, as Mank and his values are put through the ringer and he constructs his unique revenge against the opposing system.But the real unsung star of Mank, the best thing about it, is the filmmaking and technical brilliance of it all. From frame one, we don't even get Netflix presents, but rather Netflix International Pictures; a minority of frames boast imperfections and cigarette burns; the sound design feels like it's bouncing off an old fashioned movie hall when in reality, I'm just sitting on my couch; every new scene features a scene heading; Erik Messerschmidt's gorgeous cinematography and lighting (no surprise given the former gaffer's previous work on Gone Girl); and Reznor/Ross strike gold again with an amazing throwback of a musical score.And then there are the story similarities to Citizen Kane. Whether telling it's story through flashbacks, or providing and account into the mind of Mank, or even having its own Rosebud moment, Fincher relies heavily on your knowledge of that film to pay off so many big and small moments here as well as provide some insight into the making of the script beyond what's already been famous. I can't wait to see all the general audience be confused and/or bored by Mank simply because they don't know what a Citizen Kane is. But you might need a refresher if it's been a while.Overall, Mank is a great start to what looks like a packed end to the moviegoing year. This would have looked gorgeous to see on a big screen, but it's a technically brilliant film nonetheless, and makes me really excited for the rest of Fincher's Netflix films lying in wait in the future."}, {"id": 271, "text": "I just finished watching this movie.

You may think that the film was filmed in 1940 and was presented with beautiful directorial shots and wonderful cinematic paintings showing the struggle to produce this film. The Era and everything looked like the '40s, the sound effects, light, and directing style that 1940s filmmakers were completely using.The wonderful cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt takes the responsibility of shooting the movie as it was shoot in the 1940s to realistically capture the era and was excellent and identical to the filming of the 40s to make you feel as if you went back 70 years in time to live that period. The text is more realistic than you think, as it was written by the late Jack Fincher, father of David Fincher, before he passed away in 2003 for health reasons. Why do I say that the text is realistic because it was written by an old man about a true story of an old man writing his last story, wonderful dramatic dialogues and jokes Politics and a drama that seems like the drama of a classic movie released 70 years ago. Yes, Oldman gave the best performance in the movie calmly, the man who reached the end of his life and excelled in the perfect role to embody the character of Mankiewicz in a wonderful way. In the period of the Great Depression that destroyed the economy, the staff gave a quiet performance, and the viewer may notice the calmness of actress Lily Collins, who plays the assistant Rita Alexander in a good quiet female role with the performance of actress Amanda Seyfried, who played the role of actress Marion Davies, which the film did not focus on much except that  Seyfried did the role excellently, as actor Tom Burke played the role of director Orson Welles, beautifully and as a real persona.

Consider this: the only reason Mank exists is because Orsen Welles made Citizen Kane, and the only reason we are even talking about Herman Mankiewicz is because he co-wrote the film. PERIOD. Prior to Kane this guy was an undistinguished, on-salary script writer-doctor for a slew of now long-forgotten MGM cornball melodramas in the early days of the talkies. After Kane, ditto - the talk may have been more sophisticated, but most movies were just as cornball and melodramatic. Someone took a rambling, 250 page first draft called American and turned it into Citizen Kane. (Gee, I wonder who?) Mank gives us about 10 minutes of Kane stuff and two hours of boring, endless chit-chat at San Simeon etc. etc. that has no real subtext and no narrative that ever draws us in. The whole thing just flows because it's about the drunken, vomiting guy who co-wrote Citizen Kane so we're supposed to love it - and him. Sorry folks, he's not loveable or even likeable, and his drunken, slurring shtick wears real thin real fast. Simply put, he's an annoying SOB throughout. Now the good news! For those who have seen Citizen Kane 101 times (like me) and know everything about the cast of characters (like me) and have toured the ranch at San Simeon several times (yep, like me), you will love it. But for the rest of humanity, you'll start to wonder about 15 minutes in why the movie was ever made and you'll still be wondering when the credits roll. For get-a-life movie geeks only, but what a treat! (I didn't think the filmmakers would have the nerve to do a white wine came up with the fish scene, but boy was I wrong!) Thanks, Netflix!!"}, {"id": 274, "text": "I wasn't sure how satisfied I was with Mank halfway through, but the central theme of a small group of powerful men controlling many areas of life shone through late in the movie. There is little to quibble with technically - the score, cinematography, and direction are all excellent and strongly evocative of 1930s Hollywood. Oldman is excellent as Mank, bringing out the quick-witted rebelliousness as well as an underlying dedication to his craft. I also quite liked Seyfried's performance and would see her as a deserving Best Supporting Actress, and I also loved Hearst's speech with the monkey allegory at the end of the movie. The moments that are most meaningful in Mank are those where we see the immense power taken for granted by the powerful men in the film, studio heads and Heart, juxtaposed with the powerlessness of everyone around them. Those men know they can do whatever they want, and everyone else has to adapt to their desires. Mank is seen as a loose cannon because he doesn't always abide by these hierarchies and social expectations, which puts him in difficult situations. It's hard for him to make the films he wants and get the credit he deserves, and there is a constant sense of pressure for him to churn out work. He clearly is a man who cares deeply and is thoughtful about the movies he writes, and turns to alcohol in part due to the ever-present pressure he feels to produce a script. Mank doesn't fall into generic tropes, which could have easily happened with Seyfried's character being a trapped pretty young airhead, or Mank being a man driven to depression through external pressure. Instead, we get more nuanced portraits - Mank still finishes the script and it is exceptional, and he even gets the credit for it, but he never writes another movie and dies 11 years later due to drinking, feeling like he was trapped (presumably within the power structures of the industry) and could never really escape. The governorship race was an interesting allegory to throw in as we see how little people in power care about all people's wellbeing - they just want the system that allowed them to be at the top to continue. Oldman is really great and drives home the challenges Mank faced as a good but imperfect man caught in an unpleasant power structure. I am curious to see how Mank does - I imagine it'll get many nominations, but could it win BP? Regardless, this is a film that I will not mind if it cleans up at awards season (though I have very high hopes for Nomadland)."}, {"id": 275, "text": "'Mank' is a film that requires a good deal of knowledge on the part of the viewer. He / she should be well acquainted with Orson Wells and his rivalry with William Randolph Hearst. You'd better know about Louis B. Mayer. Also Irving Thalberg. Also the 'war' going on between Lefties and Righties in the film industry of The Thirties. Also MGM's history versus that of R.K.O. Also the Mankiewicz Family. And most important, the viewer has got to care about these things. And frankly, the movie does little or nothing to foster such caring.It is a film with no heart. We hear that a character has died; no one seems especially saddened. We learn that a character has been found alive; pretty run-of-the-mill. Characters drink to excess; we'd be saddened if we were invested in them, but we're not. There is no dramatic arc to the film. No build. Characters do not grow; not even change. There is about 'Mank' no sense of humanity. The film is as cold as the white that offsets the black of every frame.On the plus side, the film is a marvel to watch. The absolute clarity of the black and white images is startling in the best of ways. The set pieces at railroad stations, mansions, and on the California High Desert are breathtaking.If I were to recommend the film with the sound turned off you'd think me insane. So I won't."}, {"id": 276, "text": "Great films work on several levels, some of them outside of the film's reality. Here is a movie that celebrates screenwriting by celebrating a screenwriter who himself wished to celebrate another screenwriter. It was made by David Fincher from an old script by his late father Jack, and tells of writing legend Herman J. Mankiewicz, the drunkard genius who co-wrote RKO's world-changing Citizen Kane in the early days of talkies - even more cleverly, the story of Mankiewicz is told to us nonlinearly, \u00e0 la the very feature it focuses on, signposting the time skips with title cards made to look like scene headings.In terms of imagery and audio, Mank may be the most perfect replication of 1940s cinema since The Man Who Wasn't There (all we're missing is a pre-CinemaScope picture size). Last but far from least is Gary Oldman, yet again getting lost in a character that's hard to rightly compare to anyone else he's portrayed.Other faces of Old Hollywood turn up, cast with the likes of Amanda Seyfried (flawless), Lily Collins, Arliss Howard, Tuppence Middleton, Tom Pelphrey, Sam Troughton, Charles Dance (as the media tycoon on whom the character Charles Foster Kane would eventually be based), and Tom Burke in the role of Orson Welles. Garbo, Chaplin, Gable, and others can also be spotted, all in a monochromatic La La Land that's lit and shot exactly right for the era of picture-making it portrays.Its view of Old Hollywood is at points nostalgic and magical, but it is also quite critical of what the Hollywood system was, is, and has always been.So, with all these things to praise and pick up on, why is it that many viewers got angry at Mank when it came to Netflix? On top of seeming one-sided in its depiction of the conflict that ultimately erupted between Welles and Mankiewicz over proper credit for Kane (the idea that Mankiewicz was the real genius, when he wasn't too inebriated, came from a 1971 Pauline Kael essay that has since been hotly contested), Mank has also angered people for casting reasons.Mankiewicz and his wife, Susan, are meant to be around the same age; the former is played by Oldman, who's over 60, and the latter by Middleton, a woman in her 30s (any actress older than this allegedly tends to get erased, which is an understandable concern). Both are intended to be around 40, making the casting of Mankiewicz all the more strange. But what does it say about an actor's prowess that Oldman, with minimal SFX and makeup, is still more convincing than any digitally de-aged star of last year's The Irishman? That said, the accuracy of his socialism and endorsement of Upton Sinclair has been questioned as well.This might be one of my more boring reviews; indeed, a cineast on Twitter pointed out that names like Mankiewicz, Selznick, Hearst, Groucho, and even Welles might be gibberish to those who use Netflix for escapist fun or just didn't go to film school - even if they're generally media-savvy. Even so, Netflix is not just for casual binging anymore, if it ever was.It has become a place where creativity gets to flourish, whilst Hollywood is becoming more of a soulless, cash-grabbing factory that rarely distributes said cash to the heavy lifters in any sort of sensible way. Mank, a movie for the buffs, puts it in black-and-white (pardon the pun).It's too early to do a #KeepingUpWithTheOscars prediction, but there is no doubt that this will be another film about films adored by the Academy (who might not grasp the critiques of Hollywood, but no matter) and Oldman's chances of winning Best Actor are pretty good. This would be true even if the COVID pandemic hadn't caused an unprecedented scarcity of film releases throughout the year; then again, it might also cancel The Oscars. Where will Maya Rudolph make her funny faces now?"}, {"id": 277, "text": "Mank Directed by David Fincher. Written by Jack Fincher I should warn whomever is reading this that David Fincher is easily one of my favorite filmmakers. He has not made a feature film in six years since Gone Girl. That one I saw in Las Vegas. I took a walk down the street in the wee hours because it wasn't playing in the movie theater at my casino. It was a unique experience.He's been busy with Mindhunter which was a terrific series. But he is most certainly a filmmaker. Honestly Mindhunter worked as a very long movie too. Not the point. The point is he's back with a new movie that is being dropped on Netflix on my birthday. I must have done something nice to deserve such a gift from the cinema gods.It's one of those few positives in the year 2020. I also for my poorly maintained mental health need to stop reading the comment section of articles about streaming services. Not Christmas is turning out just splendidly. I'm not entirely sure what to do anymore.Back to the movie at hand. Mank is about screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz as he navigates through the script for Citizen Kane. As he pushes through the pain of his accident and his alcoholism rears its head, he flashes back to events that lead to this point. You would understandably be thinking this is an inside Hollywood movie focusing on the mechanics of how Hollywood during that time worked. It is somewhat about that but it is also about bringing an end to a man's life and why he feels the need to bring reckoning to this world hidden away.He gets invited to the inner circle of William Randolph Hearst, newspaper icon and the studio heads. He gets to see the machinations when Upton Sinclair threatens to bring their existence apart. I'm not entirely sure I'm even bringing this up in a good way. Mank is content just feeling superior, making money and spitting out witticisms with reckless abandon. Mank is observant though. He notices how downtrodden the people are during the Depression and how the studio heads and Hearst are fighting against any help for them. It rattles around in him and it reverberates out through the work and his increasing alcoholism.Mank is a beautiful movie shot in black and white where the shadows pop and there is a veneer over the image. From my research on the film, David Fincher used a digital monochrome camera so there is no color version of this. The movie feels like it was made during that era. The story lives in the Hollywood of old and Fincher usually lives in a fluid camera style. He adjusts his style to fit the story. He combines it with the techniques of how movies were made then. Even the score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross creates music that enlivens the scene and helps create dramatic swells.Gary Oldman is terrific in this movie. He imbues this steely wit and his voracious appetite for alcohol and even bombastic drama. You can also tell that the loud, clown like personality is a shield from this world that he lives but doesn't necessarily agree with. Amanda Seyfriend is also excellent at living in the skin of Marion Davies. She has the star shine of a Hollywood actress in the 30s but at the same time she clearly is holding back her intelligence for the benefit of the powerful men. She also has a way with Mank, a back and forth that shows her to be his intellectual equal. Her relationship with Hearst is almost more than just ingenue and benefactor.This is a beautifully sweet film into creation and what the movies can mean. They can mean just mechanical, people preying upon the magic that cinema creates to further their own goals and a writer who didn't realize at the time what he was crafting and what it would cost him. This was a terrific movie. I give it a B."}, {"id": 278, "text": "The streaming race is getting super competitive. Prestige and originality is Netflix's strategy. I assume Netflix will release an Oscar bait every December from now on. Orson Welles was a genius, a man with monumentus talent,David Fincher isn't any lesser. David Fincher as a director has the most modern and provocative style, he is a true artist. Interesting how their paths interconnected in such an unusual way. David Fincher's movies have always been dark and has had clean cut, beautiful cinematography. This movie is no different. Interestingly enough, the cinematographer really tried to emmulate the cinematography of Citizen Kane.Personally I think you need to have seen and know the backstory of Citizen Kane to fully understand the movie. Our protagonist Mank is an alcoholic tasked to write a screenplay, he is aided by a secretary. We see flashbacks of Mank's earlier career, his daliances with Marion Davis, his meetings with film executives, the parties at Hearst Castle. As outsiders we are invited to see the inner workings of the movies business. You know what they say, there is no business like show business. This is a boring movie that would only appeal to die hard fans who are interested in old Hollywood.This must be David Fincher's most personal project to date, a tribute to his father and to film as an art form."}, {"id": 279, "text": "There is no doubt that Mank tells a great story of Old Hollywood (1930s-40s) and its studio-driven system. It also does a fine job of intersecting current political or cultural themes with that of the times (showing how certain issues remain the same no matter the time period). The biggest potential viewer hurdle in really enjoying Mank, however? The fact that one should (dare I say needs to) watch Citizen Kane (or already have a deep understanding of Hollywood in that time period) to truly get all that is being presented here.For a very basic overview, Mank focuses on Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman), a maverick (because of his progressive ideals) Hollywood screenwriter writing the script for what will ultimately become the iconic film Citizen Kane. While hammering out the screenplay and jousting with star Orson Welles (Tom Burke), flashbacks show how Mank--a decade earlier--feuded with Louis B. Mayer (Arliss Howard), head of MGM studios, and befriended Marion Davis (Amanda Seyfried), partner of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance).There are many scenes in Mank that absolutely crackle with life and relevance. Practically any time that Herman jousts with the Hollywood execs or high-profile personalities, Oldman is electric. The repartee back-and-forth is not only entertaining, but also enlightening in that many of the same issues are likely bandied about today in similar scenarios.The major problem I had with this overall experience--which sapped it of at least a star ranking--is that clearly (by not being an amateur historian of the time period) I was not in on the joke, so to speak, in many scenarios. I've seen Citizen Kane, but not for years. I know very little--aside from the basic structure--of the old Hollywood studio system. While viewing Mank, I could clearly detect times where a moment or character was supposed to be significant, but I just didn't know why. Watching Citizen Kane again and then re-watching this would almost assuredly up it at least a star ranking.Another oddity: director David Fincher--in trying to be period-accurate--used only mono sound (one track) for this film. As such, any background noise, music, or effects tend to severely drown out the dialogue or make it seem echo-y. While I understand the aesthetic choice, I don't think it improves the experience at all (I'd argue for the opposite, sadly).Thus, Mank is a rather odd viewing experience. It is clearly a great screenplay, yet requires a great deal of extra-curricular activity from the viewer to truly appreciate (for better or worse)."}, {"id": 280, "text": "If you want to watch a thriller/crime movie (like Fincher normally makes) I don't think this is the movie for you, if you have already watched and liked Citizen Kane, interested in cinema history, know the presented persons (if you don't you can google them like I did, probably you're watching on Netflix and can pause it after all) I think you would like Mank.By far Mank is the most comfortable film (for audience) Fincher ever made. Of course he didn't compromise the high quality of the production. You can enjoy clever dialogues, wonderful acting (especially by Gary Oldman), beautiful cinematography... I didn't get bored for a moment (may be the last part could have been a little bit longer, it ends very quickly)Compared to the high quality of the production, the plot is a little bit weak I think. Yeah, the time jumps are nice but I have concerns about depth of the story. Mank more likely deepens Citizen Kane's story rather than its own."}, {"id": 281, "text": "After six years of waiting there is finally a new movie from David Fincher. Since Gone Girl 2014, Fincher mainly worked in series production. I've seen Mindhunter in recent times, in which few episodes were directed by him. There were really good episodes there.

The story moved near the border to insignificance. In Finchers previous movies he has realized this much better. I would most likely compare The Social Network here, since it is also based on a true event.The story always jumped between the now and past narrative strands. I found this very confusing. Although these actions had their purpose, they appeared to be randomly and arbitrarily placed.Gary Oldman played great, otherwise nobody else stood out in my eyes.You can definitely watch the movie, but I had hoped for more.

Any movie that he makes, I'm gonna be watching. The concept of the film sounded deeply interesting too. A David Fincher movie about the creation of the most influential movie ever made and starring Gary Oldman. It was also made in the style of a 40s movie. Sounds amazing. However, while Mank definitely had some positive qualities, all in all, it was a bit disappointing.Let's start with the good. From a technical standpoint, the movie is phenomenal. The beautiful and creative cinematography, the immaculate editing, the set design, the costumes are all utterly astounding. We should expect no less from Fincher at this point who has consistently proven to be masterful at technical achievements.Gary Oldman also gives a great performance. He completely disappears into the role, and it's not hard to forget that it's Gary Oldman who is playing Mankiewicz.The movie is also very unique, surprising, and ambitious. However, I'm afraid it's one of those movies that you can more appreciate than actually like.The movie feels inconsequential and insignificant a lot of the time. I love dialogue heavy movies (when done right), but some of the scenes in this movie just get downright tedious. The film's pace is, for lack of a better word, a bit meandering. The movie gets more and more repetitive as it goes on.Being a big fan of Citizen Kane, I did enjoy the scenes of him writing the movie. But at the end of the day, did I learn anything THAT interesting about the making of the movie? No. Was I thoroughly invested in everything that was going on. Unfortunately not.Add to that, the film also can get incredibly confusing, as it assumes the audience has knowledge of this era's film industry and politics. A lot of the time, I just didn't care because the film never really communicated to me why I should care. This can make some of the movie feel emotionally shallow.However, I did love the stylistic concept of it all. It was a good love letter to the golden age of Hollywood. Also, the ways in which the movie replicates the structure of Citizen Kane... while talking about the structure of Citizen Kane, is brilliant.This movie is commendable, bold, and utterly impressive in many ways, but it's not enough to save this movie from feeling like a disappointment.

Brilliantly directed by David Fincher, the film not only captures its era to perfection, but it celebrates the essence of filmmaking and the creative process in general. It is a monumental achievement, especially for film buffs and those who see this cinematic media as a valid art form. Some moviegoers might not truly appreciate its impact unless they have prior knowledge about film history, most specifically, one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. The connection to that 1940 classic is the direct inspiration for Mr. Fincher and his crew and they replicate the look and aura throughout their movie. It is magnificent in its execution and a thought-provoking testament to the art of filmmaking.Mank tells the story of Herman J. Mankiewicz, an alcoholic screenwriter, who sets out to write an indictment of wealthy William Randolph Hearst and the corrupt Hollywood system by teaming up with the unorthodox enfant terrible Orson Welles to make a little movie called Citizen Kane.Technically, the film is one of the best examples of artistic expression of this or any year. The glorious b&amp;w cinematography by Erik Messerschmidt becomes an impressive homage to Welles' masterpiece with its stark lighting and use of chiaroscuro effects resembling that earlier film. Donald Graham Burt's production design dramatically evokes a long gone era. Kudos to him and Kirk Baxter's concise editing. His use of montages is excellent and aligns with Welles' film. The period costumes by Trish Summerville showcase the glamour that dreams were made of and the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross adds a lyrical and haunting atmosphere to the festivities.The cast is exemplary. Gary Oldman, a tad too old for the role, plays the boozy writer and he is superb. His one lengthy drunken tirade at a sumptuous dinner at San Simeon is a masterclass in acting. Providing solid support are Lily Collins as his loyal assistant, Rita, and Tuppence Middleton as Sara, Mankiewicz's long-suffering wife. Playing more recognizable personalities are Arliss Howard as L. B. Mayer, Tom Pelphrey at Herman's talented brother, Joseph, Ferdinand Kingsley as Irving Thalberg, Tom Burke as Orson Welles, and Charles Dance as the villainous Mr. Hearst. All are terrific. Yet the most memorable performance is delivered by Amanda Seyfried as the tragic Marion Davies. She invokes an air of vulnerability to her character and yet a savvy survival instinct. This is, by far, the actress' personal best and she just may garner much attention at award time.The script, written by Mr. Fincher late father, Jack, is so wonderfully crafted with marvelous insightful dialog and many rich characterizations of the Hollywood elite of the 30's and 40's. The story does follow that non-linear structure many filmmakers seem to overuse these days and one does have to adapt to the breakneck flashbacks that come frequently. Still, the end result is so worthwhile, even if the end credits fail to add details and tie up the loose ends of some of the supporting characters' careers. (Many moviegoers may not know about the careers of some characters unless they research these people's lives. After all, this all happens some 80 years ago, even though there are current links to the divisive political climate and endless propaganda that still goes on today. History does repeat.)But it is Mr. Fincher who has crafted his best film to date and he has made some other gems. (The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, Zodiac, and Gone Girl are just a few examples of his growing legacy.). He expertly plies his craft to recreate Hollywood's Golden Age and brings his large cast of characters to life by never simplifies his narrative. His mantra: there will be no trivializing here and any moviegoer experiencing this film must be attentive and learn.Mank will be seen as one of Mr. Fincher's finest directorial achievements in an illustrious career. This is masterful filmmaking, the likes of which you may not see for another 80 years. Do not miss this masterwork! (GRADE: A-)"}, {"id": 284, "text": "I should have loved Mank.Set in the Hollywood of the 1930s and 40s, featuring a bunch of actors playing such cinematic icons as Orson Welles, Louis B. Mayer, Irving Thalberg and the like, telling the story behind the writing of Citizen Kane, one of the most seminal movies in film history, shot in a film noirish style reminiscent of Kane itself.So then why does the whole thing land with such a thud?I don't know about Gary Oldman. I thought we was a good actor. Maybe he is. But he's just so hammy in everything he does lately. Outside of Hollywood movies, has there ever been an alcoholic who walks around stumbling drunk, slurring his words, and crashing dinner parties like John Barrymore on a bender? The alcoholics I have personally known (and I've known an alarming number) never actually get drunk, and in fact try as hard as they can to hide the fact that they're even drinking a lot. But this movie is just one scene after another of Oldman acting like someone's best guess of what a really drunk person would be like.The film is all about how amazing the screenplay for Citizen Kane was, which is true, and which is why it's ironic that the screenplay of Mank is the worst thing about it. It tries to recreate Kane's fragmented chronology, but while in Kane that trick was enigmatic, in Mank it's just messy. The problem with trying to literally emulate a classic film in style is that if your film isn't really good in its own right, all you do is remind people of how much better than your own movie the classic one is.The attempts to point out the political and cultural parallels between America in the mid-30s and America of today feel shoe-horned into the film. They may be true, but they're telegraphed with all the subtlety of a Broadway marquee.There were scenes I really liked, like one where Herman Mankiewicz and Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfreid) stroll around the grounds of Randolph William Hearst's estate, the one that inspired Citizen Kane's Xanadu; and other scenes that I really didn't like, like the one late in the film where Mank crashes one of Hearst's dinner parties and ends with him barfing on the floor. It goes on forever and served as the tipping point for my patience with the movie.There's enough professionalism and craft behind Mank to keep it from being outright bad, and anyone who's interested in the history of Hollywood will probably want to see it, but it's almost painful to think how much better it could have and should have been given its subject matter.Grade: B-"}, {"id": 285, "text": "So, let's start with the assumption that Mank is a great movie. The soundtrack is fantastic, the sets, costumes, and makeup as well. Erik Messerschmidt's cinematography is exceptional (the film manages to be a film of the 40s and at the same time a film of 2000). Even the editing, as in every Fincher film, is excellent and manages to find a way to merge with the fictional sound of the 30s on several occasions. That said, what's wrong with Mank? In my opinion, the weak link in a film that had the possibility of being a masterpiece, exactly like the film from which it is inspired, is undoubtedly the script. Obviously, I am not referring to the perfectly written dialogues or the numerous insightful lines in the film, I am referring precisely to the structure of the story and the different elements that are treated in it: in fact, what seems to want to be a story about the screenwriter of Citizen Kane, ends up by transform into a glimpse of the Hollywood of the 30s / 40s. Nothing strange up to here, except that the script to implement this maneuver goes against its own nature, showing more than it should, but less than it really should (especially from a political point of view). In fact, a boundless number of characters from the American political and social history of the time are mentioned, who, however, are introduced in a hasty and almost fast way. The consequence of this oversight is the inevitable presence of a huge number of characters who are deepened in an incredibly superficial way. So the film, especially in the first part, gets lost and easily disoriented, leading to a not too satisfying ending. Despite everything, Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman are fantastic in their roles and Fincher's directing is perhaps the most flawless of his career."}, {"id": 286, "text": "In case you don't know, Mank is based on a screenwriter named Herman J. Mankiewicz when he was writing the screenplay of the movie Citizen Kane which was released in 1941 and won the Oscar for best original screenplay which is the only award that the movie received.Firstly, this movie is not for everyone. If you don't know or have much information or background about Citizen Kane you won't get it and you will miss much stuff especially that Mank had many references to Citizen Kane because it is literally talking about how Citizen Kane was made. Which brings me to the first thing that I didn't like about Mank. Now I personally didn't watch Citizen Kane and therefore I couldn't be able to understand some details, Mank did not explain these little details, felt like the movie expects the audience to know this information and background about Citizen Kane that's why it wasn't explaining any of them which is a mistake that many films that are based on true events do.The directing and cinematography were fascinating. There were some shots and frames that were showing the whole set design around in a pretty and visually stunning way. Loved how the movie is in black &amp; white and kind of shot like one of these old black &amp; white films. This part might be why I liked the film a lot because I haven't seen anything like that in a long time. Set design and custom design were also great.The screenplay was a bit of a problem because, after the first half, the film was repeating itself, same way of storytelling but different events, there weren't many events that would excite you or grab your attention and make you want to continue watching the film. The movie jumps backward and forwards through time to chronicle the key aspects of Herman J. Mankiewicz so we can better understand him which was a good thing and a bad thing. A good thing because it was well made, what I mean is that it wasn't causing any confusion. A bad thing because It was going backward and forwards through time, so many times like over the limit and at a very fast pace, the film could go backward and forwards through time in just 5 minutes or less. The pace of the film was like chaos, it was trying to tell and be many things at the same time which caused all of that chaos.The casting was great, especially Gary Oldman who played Herman J. Mankiewicz, wouldn't be surprised if he gets a Golden Globe or an Oscar nomination. Lilly Collins' performance really grabbed my attention, she is a real talent and I wish to see her in big films in the future like Mank. Although Amanda Seyfried's performance was great, I still feel like she wasn't putting much effort in that role or she was trying so hard to be great but couldn't be able to be so, didn't feel anything towards her character.There is something that I noticed about the sound mixing and sound editing and that's whenever a character is speaking, it is like an echo that's coming out. It is like they are sitting in an empty room and speaking in it which was great, also loved how in some scenes you can hear different voices in the background while the characters are speaking which was not a problem at all, it actually gave the film its own style and taste.In addition, the music score was brilliant, it is giving the film that old and classic taste of these old black &amp; white films.To sum up, I really expected more from the film, especially that 2020 is not a good year for cinema and I said perhaps this film will save everything and because it's also directed by David Fincher. Not saying that I didn't enjoy the film, I was just expecting more. A great film that has a great story and great directing &amp; cinematography that could be nominated for directing, cinematography, production design, and Gary Oldman's performance in the Oscars and Golden Globes. But, the film is not for everyone because many will get bored and won't continue watching it.My rating is 8/10"}, {"id": 287, "text": "Where do I start with this movie? I really don't know. First of all you need to watch/rewatch Citizen Kane before watching Mank, they just fit perfectly. Citizen Kane makes Mank better, Mank makes Citizen Kane better. At first(for about 30 minutes), I didn't know where the movie was going, it was unclear and some might get bored by that but as you continue you will see why that 30 minutes is very important for setting the story. I thought it was going to focus on how Citizen Kane was written but it was actually more like a character study of Mankowics(which was a pleasant surprise).The timeline in the movie is also very similar to Citizen Kane, the story is told in present but is more about the past. The film is about 2 hours long but it felt a lot longer. Some might consider this a bad thing but I loved it because I wasn't bored. Gary Oldman is, again, fantastic and the cast is also pretty good. This movie is going to be divisive, for sure. It won't work for the general audience(especially Netflix audience), because this is not a movie to watch on a Sunday night. The movie wants you to focus, it wants you to draw parallels between Mank and Citizen Kane as you watch it. If you want to have fun or relax by watching a movie, Mank is not for you. Mank is nothing like Fincher did before, it isn't trying to catch the focus of the audience like Gone Girl or Fight Club. It presents its story and asks you, Do you want to study the movie as you watch? rather than asking, Do you want to see where the movie is going?"}, {"id": 288, "text": "Yes, it's a great performance by Gary Oldman. But not as Herman J. Mankiewicz. I''m thinking drunk Oxford don from any of a dozen films. I see Peter O'Toole, possibly Alec Guiness pre-David Lean. What's he doing in Hollywood in 1934 (where much of the film is set, if in flashback.) Mank arrives on stage in Pauline Kael's account and in all contemporary reminiscences in three tones: American, New York and Jewish. Oldman is none of these and apparentlly doesn't even try in a film which otherwise goes to great lengths to recreate '30s Hollywood when the New York wisenheimers took it over and changed it forever. We are given pitch perfect visions of Kaufman, Perlman, Joe Mankiewicz and even (Oscar for Arlis Howard?) LB Mayer himself. Way too old, not bald, too veddy veddy Brit, Oldman just destroys the illusion so much money and talent has been spent to create! And not really about CIT K even though Burke is great as Welles, but about the ordeal of ideology (disappointment at Upton Sinclair's failure in 1934) that enabled Mank to write the script, which the movie pretends was the fundamental creative act, not Welles's magic acting, filming and editing. Sad: it makes Mank boring"}, {"id": 289, "text": "I gotta make a rather obvious note here that 2020 has been a sparse year for the motion picture industry (of course, in many other ways as well) and we are now, perhaps more than ever, desperate for the flickering creations of the mind-bending machinery. Nonetheless, that should not take much away from David Fincher's latest. Mank, from frame one, is pure quality.Paying homage to the dawn of the sound era in movie making by using some wonderfully updated classical techniques, while guiding us deep behind the dark scenes where Hollywood becomes even bigger and more political than what it seems like from the outside and somehow, magically managing to make the black&amp;white picture relevant to today's whirling events. Fincher has his well-established crew on the technical side, with the likes of NIN duo, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, Erik Messerschmidt helming the camera and Kirk Baxter in the editing room. With Netflix behind his back and apparently giving him free rein he is aiming high. And does not fail to deliver.Alongside the regular team we have Gary Oldman as titular character Herman Mankiewicz, (co-) screenwriter of Citizen Kane himself, guiding us on the two-hour long journey and his meandering life moments. It is simply not easy to navigate when one moves around in such echelons blessed with wit and literacy mixed with perhaps a tad bit too much alcoh...khm...khm...confidence. So in comes the beautiful blonde, Marion Davies played by Amanda Seyfried, to aid Mank through those evil circles.Both lead actors shine spectacularly and it is most likely their best performance to date (well, we keep saying that about Oldman like every 3 years so...meh) but it is just as much fun to see familiar faces like Charles Dance, Arliss Howard or Joseph Cross popping up in smaller roles.It is a relief to finally feast our eyes on something worthy just before the end of this year when we nearly forgot there are not only Tv-shows on our home screens. Thanks to Fincher (who also has just popped back from TV) and co. there is hope for the future and after watching Mank that old flame has just been rekindled in many of our longing hearts. The flame that burns for that stinky celluloid.Verdict: 8/10 Mank is definitely one of the best pictures of the year and surely will go down as a classic in cinema history. It is the director's most mature, peerlessly painstaking and sincerely personal creation. Truly Fincher-esque."}, {"id": 290, "text": "As pedant as it sounds, I guess any movie should be made for movie lovers... but the new Netflix sensation Mank goes a little further than that: it is not just for those who love movies but those who love to know about movies as well. Wasn't IMDb designed for these gold-diggers of film trivia and Oscar stats we call geeks?But even after 16 years of geeking on IMDb, I realized how my knowledge about one of the greatest American classics was limited. I thought Citizen Kane was the work of a cinema prodigy, a genius who at the age of 26 wrote, directed and starred in a film that revolutionized the art of storytelling and pushed the envelope in terms of filming techniques. IMDb informed me that Orson Welles actually co-wrote the screenplay with Herman Mankiewicz while I gathered from Wikipedia that Willam Randolph Hearst the then press-mogul and iconic tycoon pulled out all the stops to prevent the film from being released.I guess I was so admiring of the titanic achievement which was Citien Kane that I figured the second writer was some sort of assistant or just a rewriter who polished Welles' original draft. If it wasn't for David Fincher's Mank I would never had figured that the lion-share of prestige in the writing department had been usurped by the colossal legacy Welles forged through his long career... and I suspect I am not the only one in that case. So Mank does more than telling a story about how a classic was made possible, it repairs an injustice.And like many other films about the making of classic (Shakespeare in Love, Ed Wood...) the story is told with the right self-referential angle, using all the visual delights that made Hollywood Golden Age... and I am not talking of the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography from Eric Messerschmidt which, as splendid it is, became a sort of requirement after movies like The Artist or Roma more recently. I was more impressed by the writing (which fits the film's subject) from Fincher's father Jack who died in 2003. All the interactions, the shadows of ambiguity interfering with cigars' smoking cloud give the film the flavor of the very era it underlines.Stylistically, even the use of scenes heading appearing on the screen as if they were written from a typewriter and with the Courier font, will satisfy the wannabe screenwriters like myself. When the first heading appeared, my immediate reaction was Why didn't I think of that before? That's the kind of original masterstrokes I thought only Charlie Kaufman could come up with. This is a film about screenwriting embracing the magic of screenwriting, that a bunch of squared-shaped words on a blank paper could contain the embryo of a masterpiece to transport the eyes of all these people in the dark... I don't think it'ss a bold prediction to say this might be an Oscar winner, perhaps the second of the ceremony.There I just dropped the O word... well this is Fincher's first film since Gone Girl six years ago, a director of his caliber was bound to come back with something big. And not to diminish the film's merit outside the realm of competition, but Mank does have the makings of an Oscar winner (besides being about one), the cinematography resurrects the charm of old movies without overstating them, the editing uses cleverly the same flash-back devices of Citizen Kane without overplaying them either... and acting wise, Gary Oldman ensures his third Oscar nomination as the flayed and alcoholic writer with a certain penchant for self-destruction in the name of self-esteem, a non-conformist who should have tons of enemies if the venomous wit he infused in his words weren't so delightful to hear.More amusing than malicious but more principled than his detractors, Mank is his worst enemy and can only count on his talent and the support of his wife Sara (Tuppence Middleton), so devoted that the epithet poor has been grafted on her name. This is Herman Menkiewicz, a much interesting subject for a character study and a biopic, but the film has also to offer a fine gallery a supporting characters, among them Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies, Hearst's wife, and the current frontrunner in the Best Supporting Actress category. I read many forum comments on her roles echoing the Oscar winning performance of Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential but that kind of limits her appeal more than highlights it.To be honest, I'm always perplex when it comes to performances such as these, playing a woman of a certain period sounds like an actress' challenge but the more codes and restrictions there are,, the easier I think the acting is because the path is clearly shown and the risk of a false note is lower. Seyfried embraces the glamour of the era but doesn't fall into the easy trap of playing it like a femme fatale of a gangster's mole, she adds a nuance of sensitivity that makes the interactions with the more intellectual Mank a real treat for the eyes. Both have great chemistry but I was far more impressed by Arliss Private Cowboy Howard who played L.B. Mayer and had some of the best lines in the films especially in a riveting passage where he recites all the credos of the MGM company.Now, there's a lot of politics, Hollywood politics and politics politics but the best thing about Mank was his awareness in fine that he had written a masterpiece and that he wanted to have credit for it proved his flair of genius, including his own. The reaction of Welles (Tom Burked) inspired the climactic finale and ended their collaboration, but at least, Mankiewicz shared the film's sole Oscar win and sticked long enough in the credits to inspire a script from Fincher the father and a film from the son. Both the film and the script are posthumous victories."}, {"id": 291, "text": "If you're a cinephile and enjoy the background story of historically famous movies like the 1941 film Citizen Kane you're sure to enjoy Mank as I did. Garry Oldman is superbly cast as Herman J Mankiewicz who won the only Academy Award that was awarded to Citizen Kane in 1942. He shared the award for Best Screenplay with Orson Welles who played Kane in the film and in Mank Tom Burke gives a superb characterisation of Orson Welles,especially his voice, its eerie.The character of Herman Mankiewicz is another great portrayal of a very brilliant but very flawed man and in some ways I felt there were some similarities in style to Garry Oldman's superb portrayal of Winston Churchill in The Darkest Hour. That's why I'd be surprised if he wins the Best Actor Oscar for Mank in 2021 because he won for Churchill. If he hadn't won for The Darkest Hour arguably a better role than Mank he would be a certainty and he will certainly receive a nomination. While I acknowledge that Citizen Kane has earned its reputation as a great film it's certainly not my favourite film of that era. The things I love about Citizen Kane are the imagery that creates the brooding foreboding of William Randolph Hearst's world and the incredible music score by composer Bernard Herrmann. I read that Mank was shot on RED Monstrochrome 8K cameras, no color version of this film exists. The acting of course by Orson Welles is superb but in some ways I think the film itself while great art is a tad pretentious. I mention my appraisal of Citizen Kane because I can't help thinking the same about Mank . I love the monochrome imagery of this film , especially in one scene . The drunken nightclub scene where Mankiewicz political candidate for Governor is defeated. It's a definite homage frame by frame to Citizen Kane and the films excellent score by Composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is at times very evocative of Citizen Kane and also award worthy. Herman Mankiewicz died prematurely at age 55 just 12 years after writing Citizen Kane and I'm not surprised considering the dangerous alcohol fuelled life style he led . Its amazing to me that he achieved what he did . The screenplays he contributed to are brilliant in films like Dinner at Eight , The Enchanted Cottage, It's Wonderful World , The Wizard of Oz, Man of the World and his most famous Citizen Kane. His even more famous brother Joseph L.Mankiewicz who wrote an equally famous Screenplay which many say is the Best Screenplay ever written in Hollywood history All About Eve (1951) which he also directed .Joseph must have led a more sedate ordered life because he lived well into his eighties. Joseph also wrote and directed A Letter to Three Wives (1950) this gave him a record of consecutive academy awards totalling 4 in 2 years for writing and directing. Mank is also a talented family collaboration of father and son the late Jack Fincher who commenced writing the script of Mank over 30 years ago in the late 1980's . Sadly he never got to see his project come to life on the screen as he died in 2003 because the production was delayed by decades and his son David Fincher has skilfully directed the film for Netflix. Some stand out performances apart from Garry Oldman in Mank are Charles Dance as William Randolph Hearst ,not a large role but a possible Best Supporting Actor nomination . Amanda Seyfried is perfect as Hearst's mistress Marion Davies .She was Hearst's pampered magnificent obsession and the very lightly talented Queen of Hearst Castle San Simeon which today is a National Historic Landmark. Amanda Seyfried was quoted as saying that David Fincher made her shoot one particular scene approximately 200 times, for an entire week, just to get it perfect. She didn't even have any lines of dialogue. in that scene but she has some great lines in the movie like   Nobody but NOBODY makes a monkey outta William Randolph Hearst! Remember the character Susan Alexander Kane in Citizen Kane who Bernard Hermann composed the famous aria Salammb\u00f4 well that's Mankiewicz and Orson Welle's characterisation of Marion Davies. I so enjoyed the scene in Mank where the royalty of Hollywood are assembled for a San Simeon banquet when a drunken Mank enters uninvited to try explain his fictional but unmistakable treatment of Hearst in Citizen Kane its breathtaking and tense and Charles Dance as Hearst says very little but his expression of disdain and dismissal is worth an award. It's a dinner party I'd love to have attended or just to have been a fly on the wall to witness the event. I can't help thinking and comparing recent events concerning media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the outgoing President of the United States to Mank just imagine if there was a screenwriter clever and brave enough ( Aaron Sorkin comes to mind) to write a 21st Century Citizen Kane style expose of these two iconic characters that have historically influenced our media perception today. There's a very telling quote in the film made by Mank which is attributed to Joseph Goebbels  If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. Sound familiar? I said earlier I enjoyed Mank I think it's a film that I need to watch a few more times there's a lot in it for me regarding film history. Like  Citizen Kane  I think it's very clever but a tad pretentious. I'd be interested to know how audiences ,especially those that are not really into Vintage film history react to this very fine film."}, {"id": 292, "text": "As soon as I saw the first poster and heard what this film was about, I couldn't wait to see it. I became filled with inexplicable anticipation, and I'm still unsure as to what caused it. Perhaps it was the fact that it was directed by Fincher (one of my favourites) or perhaps it was the topic, it might've even been due to Gary Oldman being in the lead. Whatever the case may have been, I was very excited to see this film. While Mank didn't disappoint, it left something to be desired.Mank's biggest problem is that it never quite reaches its potential. I kept waiting for it to pick up the pace, or increase the intensity, and while it kept constantly moving towards that direction, it never quite reached the goal. Although something was always happening, I was waiting for something big to happen, and it never did. This could have, probably even should have, been just as great as Fincher's best. And while it felt like one, for the most part, it always lacked something. It didn't have the grand reveal of films like Zodiac or Fight Club, nor did it have the intensity and exhausting pace of The Social Network. Quite frankly, I'm rather frustrated by how close Mank was to being up there with Fincher's others.I would like to now compare this film to The Social Network, my favourite from Fincher and one of my favourites of all time, a film that I would consider a masterpiece. The reason for this comparison is quite a simple one. Both films follow a rather similar structure, relying on flashbacks to tell the story leading up to where we are now, and dealing with a somewhat similar topic. However, while I consider The Social Network to an absolute masterpiece, I can't do the same for Mank. What made The Social Network so absolutely fantastic, was its deliberate style. A style that I now associate with Fincher. Mank, which could've greatly benefitted from that style, lacks it almost completely. And it saddens me to say that. The story in Mank is far more interesting than the one in The Social Network, yet that film kept me engaged, as well as more interested.Well, now that I've gotten all that off my chest, I would like to say that I still thought that the film was great. Although Mank wasn't as good as I was hoping and expecting it to be, it's still a great film. It captures the era with style and commits fully to its agenda. The agenda that Mankiewicz was the true mastermind behind the film that many consider the best ever made. Whether that's true, is ultimately quite irrelevant for this film. The story it tells, as a result of its agenda, is one filled with excitement and fantastic moments. Oldman, as per usual, is fantastic with his performance of Mank and is the carrying force. The flashbacks, which become a near-constant occurrence, do end up becoming somewhat tiresome after a while, but they are also what keeps this movie going. And it's not that I don't like them. Indeed, I think that they provide a great way to explore the character of Mank and the journey he took to get where he is now. I suppose I wish they had just been used a little less often.Mank ended up becoming one of my highest anticipated movies of the year. And while it didn't disappoint, it didn't satisfy me completely, either. It is certainly one of the best releases of the year, but I guess I'm just so accustomed to expecting greater things from Fincher that I ended up yearning for more. At the end of the day, though, it is a fantastic story that deserved to be told. And Fincher told it in a way that made it justice."}, {"id": 293, "text": "I thought this movie was wonderful, either because of the great way the story is told or because of how Fincher makes it possible for us to link the content and relate each part of the film to the Citizen Kane script and still enjoy the story. Mank's staging fascinated me, but I was even more fascinated by Gary Oldman's brilliant performance, this man joins the film, he is the film. Thanks to his brilliant performance I think he deserves the Best Actor Oscar this year (competing with Chadwick Boseman for his great performance in Ma Rainey's black bottom). Mank is a masterpiece, maybe not David Fincher's best film, but it's still a majestic film. Maybe a lot of people are upset that the film has factors that aren't very Fincher-like, but personally it doesn't bother me at all. Thanks for the movie David Fincher, a total wonder."}, {"id": 294, "text": "Even for younger demographics who haven't seen the classic film Citizen Kane, I feel like the majority of entertainment connoisseurs are at least aware of its existence and cultural relevance. Infamously being known as one of the greatest films to ever be released, it was only a matter of time before a film like Mank was made. Not directly about the making of Citizen Kane, but rather about the life of one man involved in the creation of it, Mank is now streaming on Netflix. Being David Fincher's latest project was enough to get me to watch it already, but I must say, even though I very much enjoyed watching it, it's absolutely one of his weakest films. That's not to say this is a bad film by any means though, because he's just that talented. Here are my thoughts on Mank.The story at hand takes place around 1939, with Herman Mackiewicz (Gary Oldman) trying to overcome his alcoholism as he attempts to write what some people will call his greatest screenplay of all time. With the help of flashbacks to the early 1930s in order to keep you invested in this otherwise thin premise, I found myself taking in the wonderful look and feel of the film, as well as the set pieces. Everything about this film feels authentic for the time period and the central performance by Gary Oldman really makes this film feel a million times better than it is. Yes, the content throughout this film is interesting, but I truly felt that there were about 30-45 minutes of amazing content in a film that's over two hours long. The slower portions of the film were still very, very admirable from a filmmaker's perspective, but I just didn't feel that there was enough meat to the story to call it a masterpiece or anything like that.That may seem like I'm going to be giving this film an average grade, but that's actually not the case. Yes, there is a very limited number of memorable moments from this movie, but I will always remember watching it for the terrific direction by David Fincher and the Black and White tone to the movie, along with the make-up, costumes, and set design. These all made for a film that left an imprint on my mind. These are also the things that most film lovers can get behind while watching Mank, even if they aren't immersed in the film for its story. I wasn't blown away by the content presented here, but I did appreciate learning some behind-the-scenes information about a film that's nearly eight decades old.I think Netflix was the absolute best place for a movie like this to end up in today's day, simply because I believe it would not have reached a wide audience. This is a very niche film in terms of how invested the average moviegoer can be. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane or at least know certain aspects about that film, there will be revelations toward the end of Mank that don't seem all that important. I knew what certain characters were talking about, but only because I've seen Citizen Kane. It's hard for a film like this to garner the attention of a new audience, especially when the backbone is of a film as old as Citizen Kane.Overall, Fincher has made some of my favourites films over the last 10-20 years, so I will always be eagerly awaiting his next project. For me, Mank was one of his weakest outings because it felt the least like his style. That's not usually a bad thing, but I feel that his director's touch is very much present throughout all of his projects, until this one. Yes, the elegance of direction is there and everything about this film is top-notch in terms of garnering awards and things like that, but it just didn't have enough to warrant a best picture nomination, at least in my eyes. I really enjoyed watching Mank for what it was, but I wish the film had a lot more to offer in terms of story. Still, it's a great watch for film lovers and if you were someone who has knowledge of the film Citizen Kane, I absolutely recommend checking it out."}, {"id": 295, "text": "So it's agreed Citizen Kane is a masterpiece. It made Welles famous and infamous. Directing, Producing, Starring and writing. The writing was a joint(ish) effort though. Shared with Herman J. Mankiewicz. He rarely gets a mention and this is perhaps why Fincher has chosen to tell his story in Mank and however this turns out I'll forgive it for giving me reason to watch Kane again. The writing of Kane is a well known topic with any cinephile. Welles is known for taking the credit. Mank had to fight for his credit with RKO and eventually got second billing, despite being responsible for the genesis of the screenplay. It's true though that Welles brought a lot to the table, adding his own scenes and more than likely crafting it in a manner that Mank would never have taken it... maybe. Who knows? This is all a bit of guesswork. Everyone tells their own story, but it's certain Mank doesn't get the praise he rightly deserves. Back to the film. First of all it has to be noted that this is gorgeous to look at. It's made in a classic 40s style and I'm staggered at how well it works. Surely it's shot in black and white and hasn't be graded? I'll have to find out, but either way it's absolutely beautiful. The sound too, there's a subtle tone that makes it feel like it was captured on arcane equipment on a sound stage, it's lovely. Now I left out the origins of Citizen Kane in my review of that film. Knowing that much of that would be covered here. The inspiration for Kane's character was a friend of Mank's, William Hearst, played here by Charles Dance. But I'm jumping ahead, Mank (Gary Oldman) is set the task of creating a screenplay in 60 days by Welles (Tom Burke... who nails the voice), but before that... are you spotting a theme? Yes, we've a fluid timeline a la Kane. It works well here, in fact I think it would suffer if it were simplified. It playfully skips around, introducing characters and the Hollywood machine. Mank is a player, but an alcoholic one. The lovable drunk with a head full of ideas. Citizen Kane is a life story in 2 hours and this is the same. It doesn't compare, Mank himself doesn't have the range of the fictional Kane. But back to the inspiration. Hearst may have been Mank's starting point, but the character grew, thought now to be an amalgamation of up to four people, Kane came to life on the page, both Mank's and Welles'. It's quite remarkable it feels coherent with so many cooks. I guess Welles' final cut status helped, both in pulling it all together so well and fortifying his creative genius mantel, albeit at the expense of Mankiewicz. It's good to see the focus on Mank here though. Welles is a bit part. This essentially tells the story of Mank's world, his experiences and how he brought that to Citizen Kane, with hefty doses of the political undercurrent that surrounds Mank and how they subtly manipulate Kane's fiction. Write what you know. Oldham is fantastic as the poetic plain talking writer. Sticking to his political guns, even at the sake of his career as we build to a fitting finale. It's dramatic and entertaining, with several memorable set pieces, namely whenever Oldham is let loose with a monologue. I don't imagine that this is for everyone though. On its own it'd struggle, only with the context and a love of Kane, could you love this. I don't love it, but I did really like it. In fact, I could happily watch it again right now. A movie for movie lovers."}, {"id": 296, "text": "Mank - C- (Disappointing)I love a good old Hollywood movie, or movie about old Hollywood. I recently watched Secret Window and Gone with the Wind for the first time and absolutely loved it. Now here Mank had everything renowned director, actors, budget and Studio but it failed miserably.Netflix movies don't get screened or get tested for audiences gives directors free hand which can be a blessing but somehow for a curse for Netflix. As they throw money at all big directors and actors, they bring their half baked ideas which no studio will make bring to Netflix. There is a reason very few Netflix original movies people still remember or regards as masterpiece. Mostly good Netflix movies are the ones they bought from festivals than they actually sanctioned. Considering Netflix makes around 300 to 400 original movies this is truly sad that they don't respect their audience to make something good rather than just paying big names enough money so they can slap their names on just about anything to drop every Friday.Mank was an absolute pain to watch as story didn't make any sense at all. Promoted as how Citizen Kane was written, the movie actually just follows Mank back &amp; forth being washedup alcoholic through financial crises, MGM politics and inner workings of studios. He is writing something, which everyone keep saying it is a masterpiece but that's about it you get about Citizen Kane.This is the most disappointing movie of the year for me considering the technical achievements, budget, Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, Charles Danes and above all David Fincher's return to director's chair after Gone Girl and Mindhunters. It was just a ramblings of an old alcoholic man for 2 hours. Gary Oldman's performance was good but nothing extraordinary. His performance was overshadowed by incomparable Charles Danes and enchanting Amanda Seyfried every time they share screen.I can understand David wanted to honour his father's story, which he wrote many decades ago but his refusal to acknowledge todays audience and make sure it reaches people's hearts and mind is unforgivable.

That's the real magic of the movies. And don't let anybody tell you different.Before I start I should say that- it isn't for everyone, definitely not for the casual moviegoers. Mank is totally a classic tale of Old Hollywood (30s-40s); a contemplative and scrutinized look at the making of 'Citizen Kane'...focusing on Mankiewicz's struggle to finish his best work- the screenplay of Citizen Kane and later the controversy about the writing credit of the film. This movie is how exhaustively researched I can understand that..including Pauline Kael's theory around this matter. Actually this film demands little bit research from viewers also, those who know more about the old Hollywood or studied about the controversy, naturally gonna enjoy it more...really liked Herman and Joseph L. Mankiewicz scenes, wanted it more. Mank is not just about Mank, it shows the politics that devoured Hollywood that time, then the great depression and its affect on Hollywood. For me, it's an overwhelming experience. Definitely it's an tribute to Hollywood of 30s, but not the kind you're accustomed to seeing...a noxious kind of admiration. Daddy Fincher wrote the screenplay of this movie and it was a dream project for our Fincher, and he succeeded to fulfill it and gave the respect to the man who inspired him. Let's talk about technical aspects. Cinematography is top-notch, a miraculous presentation of 30s. Specially any frame of this film clearly shows that how remarkable it is..one cannot differentiate whether you are watching a modern masterpiece (yes it is) or an classic film from golden age. Actually it got green signal in all the technical departments. Performance- Gary Oldman is a genius, possesses all the adroitness needed in acting..even one can watch and enjoy the film only for his performance. Other supporting casts are also good, Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies is great, probably her best performance...really liked Arliss Howard's performance as Louis B Mayer. Tom Burke as Orson Welles is really unrecognisable, not just look, he brought the perfection in attitude also. So, I'm happy that failed to find any mistake. Now some people complain about it being boring, but I enjoyed it really..Citizen Kane is not an out and out entertaining, same goes for this movie. It needs certain knowlege and patience about the era and the film. This is totally masterful filmmaking..now it's time for Fincher, so hope for the best.A great achievement in filmmaking. A work of formidable artistry. What can I say, one of the most perfect and well-made biopics I've ever seen.You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one.Facts- Despite Welles' denial that the film was about Hearst( bcz if it was that, it literally proves that Mank wrote the screenplay..Mankie and Hearst both were well known to each other and Hearst himself was an great admirer of Mank) , few people were convinced-including Hearst. After the release of Citizen Kane, Hearst pursued a longtime vendetta against Mankiewicz and Welles for writing the story. Certain elements in the film were taken from Mankiewicz's own experience: the term 'Rosebud' was based-according to some sources-on a very important bicycle that was stolen from him...even some of Kane's speeches are like copies of Hearst's. Most personally, the word 'rosebud was reportedly Hearst's private nickname for Davies' clitoris. (which fact is also mentioned in the film)Richard Meryman, the biographer of Herman J. mankiewicz described the evening like that- //On the night of the awards, Herman turned on his radio and sat in his bedroom chair. Sara lay on the bed. As the screenplay category approached, he pretended to be hardly listening. Suddenly from the radio, half screamed, came Herman J. Mankiewicz. Welles's name as coauthor was drowned out by voices all through the audience calling out, Mank! Mank! Where is he? And audible above all others was Irene Selznick (daughter of Louis B. Mayer)- Where is he?// (Collected)"}, {"id": 300, "text": "Income inequality and blatant disregard for the working class may have prompted Herman J. Mankiewicz (Mank) to write a screenplay in 1940 that Orson Welles crafted into the greatest movie ever made, Citizen Kane.

R. Hearst's newspapers brutal propaganda against progressive author and gubernatorial candidate Upton Sinclair. Fueling Mank's fire is movie mogul L. B.

The specter of socialism is the dog whistle employed then as it is now by the Republicans.Watch Mank in tandem with Citizen Kane where in an interview with the reporter Jed, played by Joseph Cotton, the case against Hearst/Kane is candidly stated. (He did brutal things.) Mank connects the dots on the CK puzzle that has entertained many for almost 80 years."}, {"id": 301, "text": "MANK is a biographical drama film based on the life of Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. Starring Gary Oldman in the title role and directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network, Gone Girl), it takes an unapologetic approach in telling the story of how one of the greatest movies of all time was conceived.In 1940, Herman J. Mank Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) is recovering from a broken leg after a car accident when he receives a phone call from Orson Welles (Tom Burke). Welles informs Mank that he wishes to recruit him to write the screenplay for his upcoming movie Citizen Kane, after the studio allows the former full control on the project. With only a limited amount of time to complete the entire script, Mank works around the clock to get things ready, all while battling his own alcoholism and creative differences with the Hollywood elite.It's safe to say that those with even the most basic level of cinematic knowledge are aware of the existence of Citizen Kane. After almost eighty years since its release, the film's influence and effect on the movie industry itself still has the power to leave a major impact on first time viewers due to its pioneering storytelling techniques and scathing critique on the upper class. While a film like MANK may not be the first to dramatise the production of such a monumental film (see RKO 281), it certainly feels like the most essential look into the mindset of one of the people who was instrumental in its creation. What this film succeeds greatly in is bringing to light how this brash, unashamed screenwriter was able to call out many of the higher ups in Hollywood on their BS and helped shatter that image of perfection it tried so desperately to uphold to the general public. We the audience cannot help but cheer for Mank as one by one he ends up clashing with his employers over his creative decisions which ultimately led to him making several enemies along the way. This type of boldness was almost unheard of during that era so this makes it that much more fun for us to watch. It really makes you think of how different things could have turned out for Hollywood had someone like Mank never been involved in the making of this important film.With a director like David Fincher at the helm, you should know what to expect when it comes to his depiction of a character like the title subject here. Something I've always admired about Fincher is his ability to take an otherwise unlikeable character, real or fictional, and have his audience sympathising with them during any misfortunes they may face throughout the story. This is due to his talent in bringing out that spark of their human side, which is something viewers can identify with and make them temporarily forget about any of their negative traits. Fincher, whose late father Jack wrote this film's screenplay, directs very much in the style of Citizen Kane itself, with a non-linear narrative littered with flashbacks and vignettes. Of course, the most obvious thing viewers will notice right away is that the film is shot in black-and-white with mono sound. This was done to add an air of authenticity to the era this story is set in, complete with specks on the screen and some cracks in the audio. This provides an immersive experience to the viewer, so long as they are familiar with the films from these decades. The one major problem I have with this film, though, is that it may prove too confusing to the uninitiated. Anyone who enjoys cinema from this era will no doubt appreciate the effort Fincher has gone to with bringing it back to life, however, others will likely be scratching their heads trying to comprehend what may be happening. A prior knowledge on Citizen Kane definitely helps but it does unfortunately place a limit on how many modern audiences will be convinced to watch a film like this.It practically goes without saying that Gary Oldman is in fine form yet again, having given consistently great performances for over forty years now. Here, Oldman uses his versatility and a surprising lack of makeup to bring to life an individual like Herman J. Mankiewicz in a raw, reckless, and challenging light that audiences just can't look away from. It's hard to say where I would rank this role among so many others, though I would easily place this in the top ten. Worth mentioning as well is Amanda Seyfried as actress Marion Davies, whom Mank strikes up a friendship with. It seems that Marion was one of the few people Mank didn't intentionally try to make enemies with during his tumultuous time of rubbing shoulders with the Hollywood executives and this serves as a reminder to the audience that he was still a human being who enjoyed a positive connection with other people.As the film industry continues to evolve and change its scope, a film like MANK serves as a reminder that this has been happening for several decades now. It proves that we have a need for people like the title character to take risks and prevent creativity from stagnating. Naturally, this kind of approach has shown that it comes at the cost of making many powerful enemies but it also shows that if things are successful, the results will speak for themselves. If you ask me, modern cinema needs a new Mank-like figure to speak up against the Hollywood of today and at this stage it's only a matter of time before we get one.I rate it 8/10"}, {"id": 302, "text": "When watching a movie, there are many things to consider. The acting, the writing, the direction, cinematography, and what you take away from it. David Fincher's black and white masterpiece as told through his Father Jacks eyes is one of those movies. Some will find that none of those factors involve this movie , others will most certainly think they do. I knew this was going to be a subject where many people would beat it up, no one touches the great white whale and expect nobody to hate on it. I think he did an exceptional job with the cinematography on this movie, capturing the time in the movies essence at that time. Gary continues to be one of my favorite actors ever! There is also a great supporting cast. David continues to be one of my greatest Filmmakers, and I will continue to appreciate his work. We all have a right to our opinions, but sometimes you need to sit back enjoy the work. Reading a lot of these reviews, it's amazing how some people bash somebody over what their views are. When you can't step in to the head of the actual maker of the project, and enjoy it for what it is. Some will find it boring, and not as exceptional as his other work, I think he definitely stepped into an area that I can't wait to see what he does in the future."}, {"id": 303, "text": "This features another quite impressive, powerful, performance from Gary Oldman as David Fincher uses his stylish and authentic portrayal of the borderline iconoclast Herman J. Mankiewicz to take us on a tour of Hollywood in the 1930s. It's told by way of flashback, as the bed-ridden Oldman is working on his screenplay for Citizen Kane and through his frequently drunken hazes we experience much of the politics, bigotry, misogyny, and pretty blatant corruption that prevailed in the upper echelons of the studio system as espoused by the likes of Louis B. Meyer (Arliss Howard); Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley) and most especially the king of the hill - WR Hearst (Charles Dance). The monochrome photography adds much to the rich look of the film, and Jack Fincher provided the star with some wonderfully eloquent (often wittily loquacious) monologues - particularly towards the end as his battle against the booze starts to become more of an effort for him to fight and his friends begin to redefine their relationship with him. I was less impressed with the supporting cast - Dance dressed like a circus ringmaster for much of the time and Amanda Seyfried and Lily Collins struggled to make much of an impact, even though both roles are significant in the lives of Mankiewicz and Hearst respectively. It's a considered work, this - it doesn't dwell on the salaciousness of the scenarios; indeed it seems hell bent on avoiding dirtying it's hands with any of the concomitant scandal that accompanied the era, and that is quite odd. It robs the storyline of the oxygen of the underling politics and power-broking that created the ambience Mankiewicz so resented - even loathed. I saw it on the big screen about a day before Netflix rolled it out, and on balance I think a television viewing is all this needs. It's good - but not great."}, {"id": 304, "text": "This is a business where the buyer gets nothing but a memory for his money,what he bought still belongs to the man that sold it says Mayer,co-founder of MGM studios which runs as one of the glaring themes of this technical juggernaut from the legendary David Fincher and serves as a reminder that a film will always been known by the person who made it.Herman J. Mankiewicz,a gifted but rather brazen screenwriter with an exquisite way with words, battles his demons of alcoholism and compulsive gambling to finish the screenplay for the film 'Citizen Cane' within the stipulated time span which is to be helmed by Orsen Wells. However,David Fincher doesn't limit his narrative to Mank's involvement with the film which proved to be revolutionary in terms of writing and making,he proliferates into his personal turmoil and exposes the hypocrisy of the major Hollywood production houses in the run. Gary Oldman who is 60 years of age in real life, nonchalantly reprises the bloated alcoholic lead who is nearly half his actual age to near perfection. The tenacity of the plot coupled with impeccable cinematography augments the narrative a notch higher making up for the rather tardy start to the movie. 'Mank' may not be one of Fincher's best, it appears rather like a loving son's respectable homage to his father's most ambitious project. The technical and narrative proficiency of David Fincher which the audience is accustomed to is far from seen in this flick.That being said,the film cannot be written off as bad,from a director known for his meticulously structured psychological sequences and exemplary technical skills,Mank have have fallen short of the high expectations. However, the ominous performances from the lead actors and some good writing makes this film a good watch. Keeping in mind the fewer releases the year had,Mank may even land David Fincher his long overdue Academy award (fingers crossed)."}, {"id": 305, "text": "An exceptionally well-written screenplay by Jack Fincher for a biopic on yet another talented scriptwriter. Both are dead. Jack Fincher was the father of David Fincher. If they give a posthumous Oscar for a screenplay writer, he deserves it, and it is sad that this was his only work for films. I have never read his essays or his other published work. I will now attempt to locate and read them. Great talent. David Fincher' casting of Gary Oldman and Amanda Seyfried was very astute, both delivering Oscar winning performances. I have always felt Ms Seyfried (whose birthday I share) had great potential for more meaty roles ever since I viewed her in her second and unfortunately little discussed film she worked in called Nine Lives (2005). Finally, kudos for the cinematography of Eric Messerschmidt, (or is it Director David Fincher?) who seems to have borrowed a lot of visual ideas from Konchalovsky's award-winning Russian film Paradise. Charles Dance, who plays William Randolph Hearst, seems to reprise his role as director D. W.

His name is Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman). He was assigned to write a film by Orson Wells (Tom Burke) in sixty days. Herman Mankiewicz crafts a story from his many life experiences from where he has been and what he has done.Mank was a film a bunch of people were eager to see. I have never found Citizen Kane as breath taking as many people do but I always have enjoyed the film. I also don't watch many David Fincher films but I have seen the Social Network and a few others. I really wanted to see this film because of how good it looked. The film seemed different from what we normally get today. When the film came out I watched it a day later. I got what I wanted from the film and nothing more. I thought it was going to be a good film. I didn't think the story was going to be bland though. The story wasn't all bad. The thing that held the film back was a bunch of the middle act. There were some good bits in the middle act but majority of the middle was dragging. The rest of the story was really lively though. The start really got you wondering how he got on the bed and how he got the job. The end was a good bow on the present that told you what you wanted to know. David Fincher didn't write this film. In fact his dad, Jack Fincher wrote the film. He doesn't have any other writing credit besides this film. You probably won't find a lot of this film interesting unless you can't go by a day were you don't think of Citizen Kane. I am not that much into Citizen Kane so that might be why I found this film boring. The story was just bland and wasn't what I wanted from this film.The acting was the best part of the film by far. Gary Oldman gave a marvelous performance. He was funny but also really good at delivering tough lines in many scenes. There is a really good chance he will take home an Oscar after the award show because of this film. Amanda Seyfried played Marion Davies an actress from the thirties. She did a solid job but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Lilly Collins who is actually Phil Collins daughter did really well in this film. She has been in Emily In Paris and Okja. The acting was just amazing in the film mainly because of Gary Oldman.Another stand out part of the movie was how it felt. They nailed the feel of a thirties film. The score in particularly perfected the tone of the picture. It was always really cool to hear the drum beating in the background was they go into a flashback scene. Something really cool about the flashback sequences was they would say something on the screen about where they were but it was set up like a script. Also how the film looked was fantastic. Obviously it was black and white but they also added the blotches on the screen you see in the corner every once in a while. There were also sometimes hairs that ended up on screen. Those were some small things that really added to the experience of watching the film.Mank looked like something from the thirties and the acting was some of the best of the year but the story just fell short of what it needed to be. I would recommend Mank to anybody who likes Citizen Kane or just anyone who is looking for a film to watch."}, {"id": 307, "text": "You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one. Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman)David Fincher's Mank, about the Oscar-winning co-author of Citizen Kane, Herman Mankiewicz, is less about his entire life and more about the characters involved in the Orson Welles firmament as they in one way or another contribute to the romantic story of Kane's genesis and the world of '30's and '40's Hollywood.How writer Mank maneuvers in the movie jungle to produce the greatest filmscript of all time is the subject, and Mank is almost sober enough to convince us of his brilliance with words both written and verbal. Powerful people with whom he has to deal are MGM head Louis B. Mayer (Arliss Howard), newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance), and producer Irving Thalberg, (Ferdinand Kingsley), to name only a few.Some might say too many important figures with too little screen time but enough for Mank's verbal excellence and inebriation for us to get why the controversy and brilliance.The most important puzzle of all is how much Mank and Welles each contributed to the Oscar-winning screenplay. Fincher's take is that Welles did little if any writing but had a contract with Mank to give Welles co-writing honors. Although actual authorship proportions seem unknowable, Fincher draws a world where, despite the intrigue, such a masterpiece could have happened.At several points, Fincher uses Wellesean techniques like deep focus and hollow sound to echo Citizen Kane itself. Almost distracting, the stylistic flourishes give Fincher the period feel as well as the reflection of Welles's genius.Trish Summerville's costumes, Erik Messerschmidt's Cinematography, and Donald Graham Burt's production design make Mank not so much an Oscar winner as a satisfying trip back in time to when Hollywood was dominated by genius, not digits. Mank should be seen by those who want to know the intricate design of Citizen Kane and the historic importance of Hollywood to cinema."}, {"id": 308, "text": "I really really loved this film, in fact I already knew since the trailers that this would be the best film of 2020 and it didn\u00b4t dissapointed me not one single bit, however: I\u00b4m a guy who believes in coincidences and in this case this is an odd and unbelieveable tree of references and coincidences that really messed up my mind even now that I stopped watching this film. In a Biopic (Mank is not a fully-formed Biopic, Mank is a very subjetive and non-linear film) I don\u00b4t really care about historic innadequacies (Unless they are too rude like Anastasia or Bohemian Rhapsody) I do care only that the whole story get\u00b4s me hooked and excited and Mank isn\u00b4t the exception. But there was a great curiosity to watch the historic fight of Mank Vs Welles about the custody, sorry the credits of Citizen Kane, I personally think that both deserves the credits for making that awesome film, but in this film\u00b4s vision, Mank is the main responsible of the success of Citizen Kane\u00b4s screenplay, that didn\u00b4t affected me as many people did, but it made me reflect in a very serious way about this film in general.I like David Fincher films, but I\u00b4m not a fully-time-fan because I just don\u00b4t enjoy too much his cinematographic philosopy, It\u00b4s too clean and digital that annoys me a little being a Film\u00b4s better than Digital type of guy, but when David Fincher had the opportunity of making a vintage film about 30s-40s film industry, it was a sacrilage to me to watch such cleanest images with bad CGI, high ISO levels, it distracted me, even if he did edit the audio and film grain to make it more antique, David Fincher\u00b4s place is digital, and it\u00b4s a shame that erased a star out of this film, this truly bothered me.But why this film is my favorite one released in 2020?, like Mank did wrote Citizen Kane the best film of all time, it\u00b4s all because of Jack FincherI was about to call this, David Fincher\u00b4s Magnum Opus but the reality is that the wonderful suspense of the movie, the fast paced timing, the funny as hell Mank responses, the smartness, and all of that is part of the original screenplay of Jack Fincher, he is the Mank of our times, a talented screenwriter like Charlie Kauffmann, but with only one big hit in his hand, and gone too soonDavid Fincher does not pays tribute to Citizen Kane, to old Movies or Hollywood, he pays tribute to people like Mank, to people like his father and to the screenwriters in the world in such a forgotted and underrated job, but with a highly important value, because a movie is a whole, there are the beautiful images, the powerful acting, the enchantment of the soundtrack, and the feelings that a movie produces to the public.But above all, cinema is storytelling, we go to the cinema to watch stories that make us believe we are in other worlds, and the screenwriter is the mother of those stories and the director, the narrator of those.So above all the great stuff about the movie that I won\u00b4t mention, this truly showed me between the lines the huge love of David Fincher with his dad, and Mank is truly Jack Fincher\u00b4s masterpiece and I hope that as Citizen Kane, Mank stays with us for a very long time into our minds"}, {"id": 309, "text": "This movie tells about screenwriter named Herman J.

This film captures Old Hollywood of the 1930's and 40's. In fact, the film does this so well, you will forget it is a period piece around halfway through the movie. The story becomes more interesting around this point, especially if you know of Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, as you can't help but fill in the missing pieces. While Citizen Kane is about William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies (played excellently by Charles Dance and Amanda Seyfried) Mank takes us on the journey of the brutally honest writer Herman Mankiewicz played by Gary Oldman. Oldman gives us another brilliant performance. As Herman Mankiewicz spirals out of control mainly due to his alcohol dependency and his unwillingness to compromise, we really understand Oldman's character's inner thoughts and his contempt for the people in power who surround him. This puts him at odds with everyone powerful throughout the movie, even if they try at first to befriend him. The political subplot is a nice added dimension to Oldman's character and the story as we start to believe his convictions are truly warranted. Oldman emotes and lashes out as Mank but never overplays his character. And we feel like we are witnessing him in the flesh try to pick up the pieces each time he makes a spectacle of himself. Surrounded with an exception cast, Oldman brings us a very memorable character in Mank, one that we weren't sure at first if we would root for. David Fincher, who directs, brings his late father's script to life and treats us to a in-depth look of Old Hollywood power and the strings it weaves. Fincher who is known for dark films such as Se7en, Zodiac, Gone Girl and Fight Club, subtly moves a grown up audience without the use of a character who is a psychopath or sociopath.

Yes, it is a story about writers, but the decision to have the actors deliver their lines in the rhythm of old style films, leaves the viewer annoyed rather than amused. These artistic choices on the part of the director distract from the overall storytelling, rather than contributing to it.The acting was unfortunately uneven. With the exception of Amanda Seyfried's Marion Davis, the female characters are weakly performed and less memorable than the pasties on one of the steno workers in one of the earlier scenes.As for the men, Charles Dance as Hearst is terrific as the kingly mannered king maker who enjoys playing at politics. Gary Oldman, as always, brings a solidity to the film as Mankiewicz that many of the actors cannot muster: I'm looking at you Lily Collins. I'd have like to have seen more Orson Welles, the ambitious dynamic force that got the film to screen, but I suppose that would have detracted from the focus on Mankiewicz.I feel this is picky in a film celebrating the writer of one of cinema's best movies, but it could have used better editing."}, {"id": 313, "text": "Senhoras e senhores, o mestre est\u00e1 de volta.

A stylish and beautifully looking old-school classic movie, Mank throws you back into the old days of Hollywood following screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz through back and forth flashbacks on life events and political activity of the time, giving him ideas and inspirations for what would end up being his masterpiece Citizen Kane. That being said, if you're expecting loads of Orson Welles and Citizen Kane references, well you might be a little disappointed on that front. Mank instead stays interesting through the drama and learning more about the guy and the people and events he encounters through the different times and settings. It may sound like a slow drama and perhaps it still won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for me personally the film's running time was never an issue and it zipped by faster than expected.There's always the question on my mind whether Mank would still work for someone having never seen Citizen Kane. I'd say yes, although catching some of the little nods throughout the film and the people related to it might help make things more coherent I suppose. Maybe a re-watch would help connect the dots better. I don't doubt some of the film's scenes were probably fictional, but that's fine in my books if the story and character stuff is consistent. The music and use of sound is very good, all the performances are great especially from Gary Oldman which is no surprise I guess, and overall the film is a nice companion piece to the legacy of Citizen Kane. It's definitely got that Oscar Buzz appeal to it, so I suspect it might get some big award nominations. Just goes to show Netflix can deliver great films, and Mank is definitely up there for this year.8/10"}], "reviews_amount": 315}
