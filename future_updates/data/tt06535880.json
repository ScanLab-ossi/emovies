I am not normally a fan of the torture/slasher genre, more of a supernatural horror fan. But I really enjoyed this movie. Yes there is nothing to much new here, but let's be honest, those truly original stories are few and far between. The acting was great, the set up was good, and the various traps and puzzles were fun. The film doesn't try to explain itself, just a mental scary haunted house.

Sadly yet as expected you can know who will survive from the beginning of the movie! The acting, directing, atmosphere fails to add any memorable moments and conclude with only a killing time experience that will be quickly forgotten."}, {"id": 7, "text": "What a pretty mask...There are some fun ideas that they don't milk to heavy which allows them to stay fresh and can be expanded on if sequels happen.

No backstory, no deeper meaning, no satisfaction for the viewer.The kills are ok and not too torture porny, but a little too on the nose given this is a random group of teens.

Good question, no answers here though.The final girl may as well have had final girl tattooed on her forehead - she has suitable boast traumatic history that makes her the perfect patsy.There is no final a-ha moment, and the whole premise would instantly fall apart if someone had a cell phone or a firearm.I wish the writers and producers would put more effort in, the production value was ok and the actors were ok too given the lack of material they had to work with.Spend another week writing and make the story better would be my advice, you can only suspend disbelief so far..."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Eli Roth movie so cookie cutter characters and a lot of gore.No character backstory besides basically men are bad they beat their girlfriends and wifes.The haunted house is pretty cool and the face prostethics of the bad guys are well made and some of the kills are well executed but it's your average slasher flick nothing too crazy.Maybe a watch on halloween if you have nothing better to do.

In one scene, the main character is trying to release a shotgun from a mechanical contraption. I thought, That's very smart trying to do that. But, sadly, she is unable to get to free of the device, and has to run. that is absolutely forgivable. Also, I should mention, even with it fixed in that contraption, she managed to use it to kill two bad guys. Nice! Right? Then, she and another character manage to catch and severely injure a freak who has a handgun. In fact, they practically amputate the arm holding the gun. I was like, There you go, kiddo! That one is NOT locked in place. Grab it! But, no. She doesn't. Instead, she and the guy grab each other's hands and run away, leaving that nearly fully loaded pistol behind. Well...I stopped caring about the movie right there. I didn't care anymore if they lived or died. The inconsistency of the character broke the fourth wall, the veil was lifted and I was reminded I was just watching a low budget horror film.

Having Eli Roth produce, and Beck and Woods directing/writing hot off their momentum from writing A Quiet Place, you would think the studios would have been confident enough and should've because this was higher quality than most big budget horror's released this year.The film starts out in usual fashion and introduces us to what appear to be standard teenage horror characters that were definitely more tolerable than most other characters in other films yet still fit the cliches. As we get a bit more introduced, you can tell that one of them has more emotional depth to her which is an important factor for audience relateability that's overlooked these days in most horror films. When things progress in the plot we are introduced to the main setting in which the mayhem unfolds and for the low budget they were working with, they executed the set designs flawlessly and creatively. The haunted house/maze aesthetic is elevated to new heights of fright through wide arrays of different set pieces, colorizations, and overall foreboding environments. They absolutely knocked it out of the park with the overall visuals and camerawork as well, and it added so much to the already supreme tension. When the antagonists start showing up with their ill intentions, the creepiness and chaos takes hold and never lets up building into a brutal conclusion that honestly will stick with a lot of people with its ultimately disturbing reveals and shocking plot turns.This film really deserved to be released in a major theatrical format and i honestly believe it would have been a hit at the box office. I expected it to be solid but did not expect it to be my favorite horror film of the year. It has so much tension, atmosphere, and an incredibly visceral visual style. It has potential to become an underrated cult classic once word spreads and a definitive haunted house/halloween film. I really hope Beck and Woods stay in the horror genre because they have some clear cut talent in creating tense atmosphere that oozes through the screen."}, {"id": 20, "text": "The film Haunt is really a good surprise, a movie popcorn that focuses on the atmosphere and its concept.

I have seen scary movies when the group is so annoying and overacting and you just want to turn off the movie, but in this one the group was ok. my first rating was 6 but since there was not a lot of profanity I raise it to 7.

It's apparent the writers behind A Quiet Place and Eli Roth are behind this, as there are many moments of fantastic tension, ominous atmosphere, and sheer brutality. Some excellently weird and bizarre set pieces and utterly disturbing moments throughout keep this from being a standard release. There are also some plot twists that keep it intriguing. This will probably go under the radar at first but eventually people will definitely hold it as the go to haunted house horror film."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Fairly good movie. Can't complain too much.

I hate movies that don't offer any explanation as to why the killers kill. It would have been a fantastic movie except for they dropped the ball in the third act.

The gimmick of a sinister, carnival-style haunted house run by actual killers is great for 15 minutes. But too many people give this film high praise just because of that premise, when the overall movie fails on so many basic levels. A gimmick does not make a movie.And this film even fails at its own gimmick. The villains are a cultish group with no motive except playing cat-and-mouse with their victims. In a slasher film, that's plenty! But this movie can't even hold up that simple promise. Instead, the villains are all moronic thugs who just like to kill. They're totally happy just stabbing or clobbering their victims like a goon, so why did they waste time building this huge, incredibly elaborate house of deathtraps?It leaves you feeling cheated. Imagine a Saw movie where Jigsaw builds a bunch of twisted games for his victims... but instead of using the games, he just stabs everyone for no reason. This of course ruins any chance of being scary, and it's all the worse because the setup had such obvious promise.A lot of horror movies get weak in the third act, but this is a movie that straightup stops caring, and it takes the hastiest path to the ending. In the third act, a bunch of characters quickly die in really lame and stupid ways, and then the movie basically shrugs and says yeah, it's over. That's all we got. Then there's a cliche final scene where one killer returns (in full costume, in the middle of town, in broad daylight like an idiot) just so he can die and the main girl can say a stupid quip. Roll credits.It's like they forgot to write a climax. Or they wrote the movie for stoners who would be too baked to notice. The entire last third of the film isn't even average or OK; they simply didn't try. It's really, really disappointing.For example: Mitch the Ghost has the most personality and screentime of the villains, and he's basically the most memorable character in the movie. In one scene, the main girl bonks him in the head once and runs away... and apparently that killed him, because he never comes back. It's not anticlimactic in a clever way, it's just the filmmakers losing interest in everything they'd built up. It's a major screw-you to the viewers: you took the time to watch our movie, but you don't deserve a payoff!Oh and also, the main girl had an abusive dad, and now she learns to stand up for herself because she runs into these slasher villains. That's not deep, people. That's a cliche.In the end, Haunt works if you just want something to play in the background of your Halloween party.

I was not expecting much from Roth after The Green Inferno and Knock Knock were both fairly disappointing to me. The writers of this movie were the same ones who wrote a Quiet Place which I wasn't actually too big of a fan of. There was definitely a good amount to gore, but not too much to the point where it was disgusting and hard to watch.

Eli Roth is the producer of this film, if that helps or hinders your decision to watch this.With nothing to do on Halloween, a group of friends decides to enter an extreme haunted house that promises to feed on their darkest fears. The beginning of this feels a lot like Channel Zero: No End House, with each of their biggest worries dramatically coming to life.Quickly, the group of young adults learns that some of the monsters inside this house are absolutely real. Either Beck or Woods has a major phobia of stepping on a nail, as that same horrific image from their past film happens twice in this one, along with plenty of other carnage.Lead actress Katie Stevens also starred in the movie Polaroid which was lost in the dissolution of Miramax. She was also an American Idol finalist. Her best friend, Bailey, is also played by a singer, Lauryn McClain of the pop act McClain. The Devil masked character is played by Damian Maffei, who was the leader of the Strangers in the second film in that series, The Strangers: Prey at Night.While I really come down hard on most modern horror, this movie isn't all that bad.

A Halloween themed Jigsaw movie. How hard can it be to make it fun and scary? All you have to do is think of some cool rooms and smart puzzles, slowly make the characters understand it's not make believe. No, that was too much to ask apparently.1- This must be the dumbest group of bad guys ever. Why are they all improvising? Why does no one have a plan? Why did that one guy suddenly decided to fully commit to pretending to help them in the middle of his show, give them his keys and everything? They could have killed him right there since they had already witnessed a friend's murder, a broken hand and a cut arm. No you can't convince me it's acting when someone just broke my hand dude. Why did that one guy fry 3 phones and left the rest? What was the point of cutting that rope in the knife room as if the whole room is gonna come down when it only brings down a pathetic door? It would have to coincide with the girl going under it so what's everyone's hurry? And why are they never talking to each other instead of attacking them one by one. Of course you're all dead, I'm surprised you've come this far running such a messy operation.2- The bad guys are not the only dumb ones of course. The group finds not one, not two, not three, not four, by my count 5 or 6 weapons and discard each one after a single use. One weapon entrusted to the fat guy completely disappears. Why would you go through the tunnel first and sprint off like a maniac if you're not gonna wait for that creepy guy in a mask that none of you trust? It's so simple, two people first, they wait by the end of the tunnel, than the creepy guy, than the last two people. Why the hell would you leave him alone to do whatever he likes? And turn your back to him after he finds you, just by himself? The guy has a hammer in his hand, your friend was murdered in front of you while two others were attacked. What do you mean?! Just think what you would do in that situation, it's not that hard. It shouldn't be this off base. That one girl acting like she lost her arm because of a couple cuts and having to be carried along the way was also super annoying. And what was the main girl thinking walking towards the rifle hoping for the best when all she needs to do is step to the side?! Three people on each side could avoid getting shot at if they just turned sideways and walked along the wall. Sooo dumb!!3- This. This made me wanna write a review in the first place. What terrible idea demon possessed you to make that weird cut and not show the hammer guy's face reveal and fatso's death? That would have been the one saving grace for this movie because that was some nice makeup. Really creepy. How and why would you completely skip the suspense and fear that reveal and attack would give you on a silver platter? How has Eli Roth okayed this?Terrible, terrible, terrible movie. Absolute trash.

The fairly routine set-up - a group of friends enter an 'extreme' haunted house and find themselves hunted by the characters within - allows directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods to create a palpable sense of dread with their ominous Halloween attraction, but they blow it all with a collection of bland victims and a lack of inventive kills with very little gore.Considering all of the opportunity for intense horror that the creepy locale provides, there are surprisingly lame fates in store for our cookie-cutter characters, with death by pitchfork and hammer failing to provide the creative splatter. For such a weird looking bunch of psychos (their faces more scary than their masks), the antagonists sure aren't very imaginative when it comes to the kill, which makes the film less effective overall. The first half of the film works best, when the viewer is still on edge about what horrors await those who enter the haunted house; the second half, when the disappointing kills actually take place, is far weaker.Haunt does end on a high with final girl Harper (Katie Stevens) turning the tables on one of her attackers, but It doesn't stop me from chalking this one up as an also-ran."}, {"id": 116, "text": "I loved this movie.

I really didn't expect so much from this type of Halloween haunted house flick. There are so many similar movies out there with tons of cliches so I thought this was one of them, but the trailer looked pretty good and I decided to give it a try. Now I am very glad that I watched it. If I watched this in a theatre, I would have given a standing ovation. In fact, I was clapping my hands while watching the end roll.The people who didn't give this movie many stars seem to complain about the characters' dumb choices which are mainly about not keeping the weapons with them all the time. Although many reviewers say that the characters are a lot more tolerable than the ones in the same genre movies (and I agree, Only one girl is wearing a skirt, though it's Halloween! Even that isn't a sexy costume. There is a nurse, but wearing a scrub. They are decent, y'all!!), there are moments the characters could keep an iron bar, razors, a big gardening fork and a gun to fight back, and they do use some of those tools, but they don't keep using them. They just toss them out once they use. However, this is a cliche move in horror movies, I don't ask characters to have the acumen, calculating the worst scenario and act accordingly so it didn't bother me so much. I think it's actually a compliment that quite a bit of viewers felt frustrated with the move because this movie was actually great, people expected more from it. If this was a typical horror flick which are full of those dumb characters with dumb decisions, you wouldn't really care, you would consider leaving weapons behind is such a minor mistake. But because characters in this movie were decent, some horror fans wanted more I assume. To me, if the characters outsmart killers, that's a great bonus, deserves one more star. That's why I really love YOU'RE NEXT. I felt the similar vibe from this film, especially in the last scene. If the ending was more like one of the killers show up in the hospital and the final girl screama, I would've given 5 or 6 stars. That's a real cliche, a bad one. I love seeing a character doesn't succumb his/her trauma and face it and beat it in the end.Someone complained that there's no explanation of why those clowns being like themselves and killing people. You don't get all the answers in horror movies, there are screwed up people out there and these kids happen to be lured into their webs PERIOD. There are movies which needs explanations and answers to character's motives, but this is not it. Some horror movies are meant to be enjoyed without overthinking like riding a roller coaster. If you want to get an answer on everything, you should just stick to Sherlock Holmes. I think if I get a reasonable background to the story in horror films, that's another bonus. Nonetheless, sometimes it works, sometimes it's just superfluous (I don't know if Jigsaw's motive really give a depth to its franchise).I am very grateful that I stumbled upon this great horror flick.

This movie is a pretty fun movie for horror fans such as myself. This review is not as a good since I didnt really catch most of the characters name so work with me hereProsPhones - The phones are taken away so they cant call for help. It's better than the same old stupid boring excuse NO SIGNAL. Not only that but it was my first time seeing a phone get broken by microwaveSaw Vibes - This movie actually gave me saw vibes. The characters had to try to escape and had to be aware of traps that could lead to their demise. Such as the shotgun trap after the main character managed to get out the escape roomCharacter Deaths - Well I thought some of the character's deaths were brutal and pretty cool. My favorite being Sam's Death: Death by sledgehammer because he shot in the throat by a dark, hand crushed by a cinderblock, then a hard slam to the headKillers - The masked killers are a real threat. They dont reach the same level as terrifier because Art the clown scares me so much. But they still actually give me the spooks and the scares.Ending - Literally, I was like Okay, So the clown is still alive and is going to find the main character to kill her. Well he did find her and stormed right into her house, but holy crap, she was waiting for him. She freaking turned the tables and killed him! That surprised me! Cons:Predictable Deaths - I know I shouldn't really hold a film to this since most movies can have predictable deaths. But honestly, I knew each death that was coming so it wasn't surprising to me when they diedTrusting an Enemy - The characters met an somebody that was on the side of the serial killers. They were hesitant at first but they soon just trust him. It was too early to be trusting somebody like that. And Yes, Since they trusted him, one of the characters got a hammer to the face.Stupid Decisions sometimes - Maybe some of the characters could still be alive if they actually think about what they were doing before they did so. Like in the previous con They trusted somebody they barely knew and was clearly on the killer's side"}, {"id": 145, "text": "I thought it was fun, kinda cliche, Would give it a 9 if there was more blood and gore.

Even though my expectations were not completely subverted, I think one this one is okay, if a bit flawed. Putting a group of college student stereotypes through an extreme house of death traps run by an insane clown posse (sorry) with little insight as to either group's motivations or background is necessarily going to be, uh, haunted by classic horror movie tropes. Haunt manages to pull this off, but only barely. Naturally, it needs a heavy dose of suspension of disbelief, as well.Ultimately, cliches are still cliches even if it is done deliberately and even if the plot manages to subvert some tropes and to conjure some creepy enough imagery. It's certainly far from being completely boring, which is a sin many pictures of this sort are guilty of. However, I would have rated it better if it were more subtle instead of dishing out jump scares by the dozen. Also, putting the protagonists into the house of horrors right off the bat without much of a setup or backstiry is a formula that works here, so I have no idea why they suddenly decided to bring up the main character's wholly unnecessary backstory later on and make callbacks to it."}, {"id": 148, "text": "The movie was like I expected from the trailer, a group of friends going into a haunted attraction in nowhere, it turns out to be more then a haunted house leading to more drama.

The basic story is cruel, simple, and works out to the end. In a modest way the movie would be worth to be called better. Still it is only better among the worst mainstream horror dished these days.One failure is that Haunt gives the audience zero explanations, why demons, or psycho-killer ghosts, exist. Another is we have no knowledge, nor any vague estimation, of what powers they have, or why they can connect to childhood traumatic experiences of young adults.At the end Harper is a tough lady fighting back, but at the price of having her boyfriend, her only friends, and her civilized life taken away from her.If you just want to see some young adults get trapped, tormented, and killed, then this is OK. If you hoped that it makes sense, deserves a sequel, and actually aims to entertain the audience, then it is not among the best.Promising, if it was a starter work, but in an age, where research is just one WIKI away, one could avoid a minimalism of background definition &amp; storytelling.Plus: Them bad guys murdered hot chics!

Going to halloween haunted houses are alot of fun, except for the ones where the people running the place are extremely psychotic.

Some of these killers faces were downright disturbing and nasty and slightly deformed. The film also had some great and gory kills in it as well. So the plot has been used before, a group of college friends seek out a haunted attraction on Halloween and come across a very secluded and unheard of Halloween spook house. You pretty much know they are in trouble since another group went in before them and never made it out and they witness a girl being killed, but believe it's all part of the show. They then become trapped inside and are being hunted down by a group of masked maniacs who have rigged some deadly traps throughout the property. The final girl (Katie Stevens of Polaroid) does a good job at fighting the masked killers to survive while all of her friends are being savagely murdered.

He makes it all the way to the location of his girlfriend and dies right away?? Would have been dope to see him find Harper, have her realize he cares for her And actually IS NOT involved in this haunt (which I thought he was) , prove to her he's not just a drunk, they try to escape and then he dies.

No sex or nudity."}, {"id": 236, "text": "One of the best slasher films in decades.30 years ago characters this dumb would have been labeled as too airhead hence unrealistic. But in this idiocratic age, the movie gets it about right. Millennials would indeed act this foolishly; they'd make wrong decisions on every corner, and they would actually TRUST a masked killer who pretends to be their friend. They would. Because they'd been taught at their schools and Mickey-Mouse-colleges by their Cultural Marxist teachers that truly evil people don't exist and everyone deserves a chance and... kumbaya... Disneyland.Speaking of which (the masked friend, not Disneyland), when the millennials ask for him to take off his mask (which it takes them way too long to do), he doesn't. Nor does he offer an excuse why he doesn't. He simply doesn't take it off, and the kids forget about it. Just like that. But hey... millennials. Not just any kids.Then the teens actually manage to scatter completely, each on their own, making their murders so much easier i.e. despite this being a death sentence for them, they actually choose to go their separate ways. But hey... millennials, right? Wouldn't millennials act this way? Sure they would. It's the Obama generation: they're not exactly bred to survive, or to think for themselves, but only to have empathy for the feelings of others. Even the feelings of demented serial-killing sadists. (It's just a matter of time before America's Mickey Mouse universities introduce courses about empathizing with psychopaths. Trust me, we're not far from that at all...)There is though ONE thing that isn't in millennial character at all: their readiness to give up their mobile phones at the entrance of the Torture House! The girls especially make very little fuss, which is absurd. Millennials are born at the hip with mobile phones, these gadgets are their Siamese Twins practically. A life without their precious toys is like Dante's Hell to them. Now, I am not disputing that these kids would never QUESTION the bizarre logic regarding not being allowed to bring their phones along; they'd never notice this illogicality, because they'd been brainwashed not to analyze, never to question, never to doubt, they were/are bred to be extremely gullible and trusting (of their devious government, for example, and its media-propaganda outlets such as CNN - which they were/are instructed to trust implicitly, to obey without question). Nevertheless... selfies? Making snippets of the Torture House to post on Instagram and Facebook? I mean, that's half the reason why they went in, right? As I said, millennials would never question the highly suspicious logic behind being deprived of their favourite toys, but what they would certainly do is protest vehemently about requiring to hand over their mechanical twins to a complete stranger. In reality, they'd flat-out refuse to hand them over, and would turn around and leave.Nor would a teenager - millennial or caveman-era - stop screaming after they get that thick 5-inch metal nail out of their foot. Because, somehow, according to the scriptwriters, a huge metal nail only hurts until it is pulled out. After that, the pain pretty much quickly subsides. (I am half-surprised that there are no pressure groups protesting on Twitter and Facebook how negatively metal nails have been portrayed here... And while we're at it, it is shocking that no compassionate kumbaya activist groups haven't yet protested about the negative portrayal of serial-killers, because they are people too. So serial killers are people too - yet Trump is the devil incarnate?... Peaceniks are too funny...)Soon after her briefly painful foot-impaling incident, she gets the palms of both hands mutilated by super-glue. Mutilated and with a huge hole in her foot, she proceeds to move about with ease, not even screaming or moaning... Later on, she gets shot in the chest, as well, but bravely/absurdly she plows on... I was half-expecting her to get run over by an airplane and then get up and walk... Or even run. A slasher film with originality: a first? I.e. perhaps the first ever slasher in which the main protagonists are physically even more resilient - hence impervious to pain and wounds - than the killers. The most hilarious aspect of this is that once the cops and ambulance arrive to help the (predictably) surviving couple, just the guy is taken in for emergency surgery - and not the girl who was also shot! (And stabbed by a nail, and had her palms mutilated, and... yet moving better than an NBA pro.)But this is a slasher flick, so obviously plot-devices take precedence over logic or characterization. And that's mildly put.Besides, all this is nit-picking. The filmmakers got it right most of the time. Like for example when this millennial protagonist couldn't figure out reverse-written messages made up of short words only, but actually needed a mirror to read them! That was a nice touch; almost as if the movie were telling us: these kids are so stupid, you can't possibly root for their survival, just think of all the bad genes they are bound to spread. Darwinism all the way, can't argue with that...What I CAN argue with is wasting our time with the girl's violent boyfriend; that whole sub-plot of him looking for her, then getting killed within seconds of finding the Torture House. How pointless is that... Nor do I find it necessary for the story to focus on the girl's traumatic past: it's a SLASHER flick, frcrhssakes, not a psychological study!Still, Obama/Pelosi/Bernie wouldn't be too disappointed in the movie. After all, in both instances when the girl wounds killers, she decides not to finish them off - while she still has a chance. Why? Firstly, it's protracts the plot. Secondly, even serial killers have feelings, they are people too so why not give them a second chance? Maybe they recognize their wicked ways and start helping her come out of the Torture House alive? Sort of the way peaceniks just hope that terrorism goes away by itself, miraculously. But yeah, kumbaya is a serious affliction.Anyway, the movie ultimately succeeds because it isn't boring and it does have some tiny measure of originality. Haunt starts off unpromisingly, with a bunch of quasi-teens saying inane things and being unfunny, so it was a bit of a surprise to see the film improve more and more.But Rob Zombie and other psychopaths beware: there's an unhappy ending. The girl wins, all the killers are murdered. Speaking of Robbie, there is a very silly ballad version of Rob's Dragula, played during the end-credits. It may have been a good idea for a comedy to do this, just not so sure about slashers...In the grand post-finale, the girl kills the ring-leader, in what is a fun but rather far-fetched revenge plan. The girl must have first evacuated the house, telling her parents that I need you guys to leave for a few days while I set several murderous booby-traps all by my own without anyone's help, because clearly, having gone through and survived a booby-trapped house of boobies I am now automatically an expert in setting boobies myself, and why alert the cops when they'll just arrest him and he'll only get 5 years probation which will lead to a quick sequel?Furthermore, we aren't told how she managed to get all the logistics worked out. We aren't told what time-frame she had to set it all up: after all, victims very rarely have an arranged attack date with their potential killer. Nor is it explained how long she had to wait for Mr Clown to show up: because he didn't really tell her - or anybody else - exactly WHEN he was going to barge in with his hammer to slaughter everyone. (Serial-killers are self-centered that way, not ever taking other people's schedule into consideration.) Also, we aren't told what she did while she was patiently waiting for him. Perhaps she watched slasher films to kill time? Nor are we quite clear about how she managed to heal so quickly after her terrible ordeal at the Torture House.But how foolish of me: her extreme wounds had already healed perfectly on the day of the massacre! Wasn't she moving fairly well just minutes after having her foot impaled and being shot in the chest? She sure was.Which brings me to a little correction of what I assumed earlier: Obama/Pelosi/Bernie would NOT be very happy with the movie, after all. For one thing, it has a happy ending. And secondly, the movie sends the WRONG message to kids that revenge and self-defense is OK. All 6 psychos are killed and that is simply unforgivable. Retaliation is WRONG. Violence is wrong. What if there was a chance to reform these six loons? An opportunity might have been missed to turn their lives around. Instead of reform school, the 6 killers got bullets and hammers! Is that fair, Obama/Pelosi/Bernie?Obama/Pelosi/Bernie: No!And I apologize for calling them loons. (I mean the killers, not Obama/Pelosi/Bernie.) I hope SSJWs who protest for the human rights of murderers can forgive me. Being a serial-killing lunat... There I go again... Sorry! Being a serial-killing misunderstood person is not an easy burden to bear, and we as a caring and empathetic society MUST do all in our power to give them another chance. And another... And another... Even at the risk of losing thousands of innocent people while we attempt to reform them. Because murderers are people too.Kumbaya."}, {"id": 237, "text": "I enjoyed this storyline but it got a little unbelievable towards the end with some of the bad guys getting up more than it seems they would in real life.

Decision-making can be slightly skewed when being pursued by masked killers, but when the downers keep piling up, one can't help but shrug at the laziness displayed in the writing department.

The bad guys truly sucked at fighting.If I think too deeply about it, I could see why it gets a lower rating from many but I know better than to take a serial killer haunted house themed movie too seriously.I jumped once towards the end and was in suspense the rest of the time.

A bunch of teens, with a (one way or another) troubled girl as the main character wind up in a hanted house attraction in the middle of nowhere. It's heard of, innit? This is where the better part of the movie starts, directors Beck and Woods manage to entertain us without cheese or unnecessary humor, instead giving us atmospheric enough trip through a what feels like an improvised but effective haunted house. Cool masks, many killers, fun times. With time it gets more gruesome, but also starts to suffer slightly from pacing issues &amp; the characters start doing (or not doing) questionable things/choices/actions. Let's just say that a some amount of general horror movie dumbness can be found in here as well. I found the ending to be a bit underwhelming, it felt like something either more original or more crazy could've been done there. From an aesthethic standpoint, Haunt is just fine, not a Hollywood production, but not sloppy either &amp; the gore is great.After the first 50 minutes or so I was sure it's gonna be a 7/10, I can always appreciate and get a kick out of halloween-themed horror movies, but, sadly, Haunt ended not as a great movie, but as a good (or decent) one.

They pick up some guys and drive around, wondering what to do next. They encounter a quaint haunted house attraction deep in the woods and decide that this should be how they spend their Halloween night. Since this this is a horror film, you can already guess that the performers inside might have more sinister and deadly motives than just supplying a good scare or two.Haunt is a fairly simplistic movie, but the performances are mostly above average for a film of this sort and it's refreshing to see horror film characters do the right thing on multiple occasions. I can't say it's a tremendous, original take on the slasher genre, but it gets the job done and supplies a few jolts here and there.The effects work is great and, when the villains' masks come off, it's a pretty horrifying sight. I do wish that, perhaps, there was a bit more backstory about this haunted house and the performers who inhabit it. How long has this been up? Have they done this in other locations?

I found myself bored to death and unable to connect with any of the characters or the movie itself. In fact, I would have felt less cheated if they ended the movie at the 30 minute mark by simply throwing all these kids into a giant blender and killed them off at once. BTW, the backstory the girl added absolutely nothing to this movie. I find it hard to believe that the positive reviewers are all connected with the movie, but I cannot think of any other explanation. The best horror movie of 2019 - really? Every time they did something that made me say 'wow' they did something else to top it - NOT even close. This movie was boring, predictable, and slow!!!To be totally truthful, it should rate about two or three stars, but since it was obviously so heavily biased by what I see at false positive reviews, I'm giving it one star.

I'm of the belief that things are often better suggested, less is more. As such I'm not really a fan of movies which have had the involvement of Eli Roth, who produced this film.Haunt does feature a few stomach turning moments of ultra violence but thankfully not too many with the focus being more on atmosphere, tension and suspense. The set-pieces in the 'Haunted house' are gleefully disturbing as well as quite ingenious along with freakish masks kind of resembling a new look and somewhat more trippy Slipknot (metal band).I was surprised to read some reviews criticising certain decisions by the characters at various points in the film and feel that's just nit-picking. In almost every horror movie I watch I end up questioning a character's (often dumb!) actions! In Haunt I found the characters to be relatively well developed (for this kind of movie), the film also surprised me with several twists it took and the unnerving mood throughout with some sleek editing too adding to this.It's ot a masterpiece for me as I doubt I'd really seek it out to watch again but it's a decent and menacing horror thriller.

Imagine this over and over again for 90 minutes and you have yourself an insanely good movie.Very rarely any more do horror films impact me in any way. Mostly I'm just bored by them because either I've seen it all before, can predict what is going to happen next, or simply don't care about any of the characters. More often than not it's all three. In 'Haunt' however I found none of those things. There were countless occurrences I hadn't seen before, I had no idea what was going to happen next, and I literally wanted every character (on the good side of course) to be alright.I had a really uncomfortable feel in my stomach watching this movie and that is what I dream of when I go into a horror movie. That means it works. There was so much to love about this movie. The set-design, the acting, the fact that it didn't rely on false jump-scares or dream sequences, the look of the bad guys (blew my mind), the unpredictability and the non-stop pacing just to name a few.

The writing is bad, but some dialogue is actually unintentionally hilarious (for how bad it is). It is also confusing to see an anti-domestic violence message in a bloody Halloween slasher.After the first couple of scenes I almost gave up on this, but what kept me watching was the look and style of the film. It was just little lacking to be called a guilty pleasure.

I went in not expecting much, thinking the story would be a very straightforward typical modern teen horror movie, but I was wrong there. Haunt throws some surprises at your face that are very unexpected.It's an 'extreme' Halloween haunted house gone way wrong. It's that thought in the back of your mind while on those Halloween hayrides of, what if this is all real? After breaking up with her abusive boyfriend, the main character Harper (Katie Stevens) and her group of friends decide to go to a roadside haunted house after a Halloween bar-night. Slowly the characters learn this place is not what it seems and the haunted house is way more extreme and dangerous than ever imagined."}, {"id": 290, "text": "Haunt is a new horror film directed and written by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, who have also directed and written the Nightlight film.In the film, Harper (Katie Stevens), after ending her relationship, decides to go to a haunted house with friends during Halloween to forget about her relationship break. In this haunted house, people are scared to death by masked people from whom the visitors have to escape, while they have to solve mazes and puzzles in the haunted house. The friends see how other visitors are brutally dealt with by the masked staff, but when they see how someone is subsequently killed, they start to doubt whether that is still part of the show. When they then lose each other in the mazes and hear how some are caught and killed, they realize they have to get out of this haunted house before it's too late.This film starts a bit slow, but as soon as the friends are in the mysterious haunted house, the pace adjusts and as a viewer you also try to solve the puzzles with the characters or to remember the correct paths through the mazes. This way you are also included in the film as a viewer. When the killings begin, the film turns more into an exciting thriller. Unfortunately, the film is never really scary as well as exciting, because the horror aspects are somewhat predictable or are just simple jump scares. The biggest problem is the hurried, poorly worked out end in which too much has happened to keep following the good. This way, the film appears poorly rounded.The budget of the film was not too large, but they were able to place the film sets in the film in a beautiful and creative way with different spaces for the puzzle rooms and mazes.The cast consists of a group of starting actors, most of whom are still unknown or have acted more in TV series. Yet they look good as teenagers trying to have fun in a haunted house during Halloween. Unfortunately, they make many stupid decisions in the film, making it easier for them to fall into the hands of the killers."}, {"id": 291, "text": "To be truthful, most of the time this film is a yawnfest. The story has been done before. Quite a few times now... and a lot of them are better than this.The story starts well enough. The teens are bored on this Halloween night (where's Mikey when you need him?) so they decide to go to an extreme haunted house. The trouble is they can't find it. However, while driving down a deserted country road Harper (Katie Stevens) spots they are being followed. In an effort to lose their shadow they take a turn off. This section is the tensest part of the film. Shame it's for nothing as the truck doesn't follow them... it was just a way to get the lost teens to an extreme haunted house, which may or may not be the one they were trying to get to. This scene is one of the better sequences in the film and wasn't even needed - why couldn't they just go to the haunted house? Why did the story need this nonsense? This is when the story started to slip for me.I have to say that the haunted house and its inhabitants aren't too bad. Though more extremity in the scares would not have gone amiss. At the beginning, they have a silent creepy clown - nice. Inside and sans mobile phones they have a cheap plastic skeleton, a witch who supposedly tortures people (though, you never see much), a tacky maze made of pallets, a tunnel to crawl through, and a few holes to push your arms through. There's a couple of sections where spiders are involved but apart from that, there's very little to scare you here. Now don't get me wrong, the directors do an okay job of creating a little atmosphere and tension at some of these points to make you feel a little uneasy. However, should you have been in there, without the spooky music and ambience, then you'd, more than likely, just be bored. The story started to slip a little more. There had been plenty of opportunities to scare the bejesus out of the audience as well as the cast and the writers threw it away.But we can't put it all down to the writers. The actors can share some of the blame for the weakness of scares. Especially the holes in the wall scene. Here was the perfect moment to show off your well-honed acting talent... okay, maybe not. To be honest, the cast is as average as it can get. The only one who brought some skill to the show was Andrew Caldwell who played Adam.Then we get to the last third of the film and now the crap hits the fan... in a good way. You begin to realise that something isn't quite right about this haunted house. Yep, it may be boring as... hell, but what's happening behind the scenes? Blood, guts, and gore... that's what. The special effects are well decent. I especially loved the hayfork through the head... but not because of the hayfork through the head... but for the eye. Watch the eye of the attacked woman; it's details like this that adds the cherry to the top of the cake.But all of this smacks as too little too late. Some of the viewers may have turned off or switched over to watch Downton Abbey well before now. What the writers and directors, Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, should have done was offer this excitement to the audience right from the off; or at least built up the story to this crescendo. Not put us through a dull two-thirds of the film and then dunk us into the mayhem all at once.Then when the reason for the carnage is revealed it's weak and, well, rather silly.Back in the fifties, it was the teenagers who were the evil ones. Dancing lasciviously to raunchy rock and roll and being wild and uncontrollable... with the latent desire to cause chaos and take drugs... In the seventies and eighties, it was the red-necks who could kill you and add you to the cooking pot. In the nineties and the noughties, the corporations were not to be trusted. They'd sell their souls and their families to be rich. For this film though, it's the body dysmorphic and the body modifiers who are evil... and for no other apparent reason but this. Come on guys, what did you do? Just pick a minority group - hey nobody's used these guys before, let's do it.The thing for me is, I know a few people who have had implants and other modifications to their bodies. To me, it's not shocking. It just feels that Beck and Woods chose these just to shock... so for me, it was just a trashy gimmick.In conclusion, I would only recommend this film to horror fans and only if you're all viewed out of the good stuff. You should enjoy the ending section though you'll have to wade through a lot of missed opportunities to get to it.

Haunt is straightforward horror with a very simplistic &amp; derivative plot, but also with a thoroughly creepy atmosphere, effectively spooky monsters/killers and a handful of genuinely tense moments. Bunch of bored kids are looking for excitement on Halloween night and end up in a pop-up haunted house. Naturally, the death traps and boogeymen quickly turn out all too real. The murderous freaks in Haunt wear uncanny masks, but the definite strongpoint of the film is that they are even more petrifying when their masks are removed. It's never made clear who or what they are, though. Do they form a dysfunctional family? Are they sickos that gathered together in an illegal internet chatroom? A real explanation is never given, but it's not bothersome. The haunted house is a terrific horror location, with narrow tunnels, fake emergency exits and nasty scenery. The acting performances are nothing special, but still decent especially considering the lead teens are quite stereotypical.

I miss some interactions like the nervous laughter bursts every one knows when going trough one of these things. You'll sit in pure gut wrenching terror right until the end.

Yes and no...The Halloween theme is especially present at the beginning and the pace of the movie is kinda slow at first, but only to let you apreciate the house itself, wich is not a bad thing.

This may be typical of horror movies but there is also VERY questionable decisions made by the characters at various point that will make you roll your eyes.

I apreciated the house, the atmosphere, the villains were very decent. Its not original by any means but its competent at its job if i can say.When rating movies i use the Angry Joe scale, with 5/10 being average, and i think this movie is definately more than slightly above average , i had a good time overall so i think a 7 out of 10 is deserved."}, {"id": 304, "text": "Haven't written a review in a while. My brother and I decided to sit down and watch this just this evening since we'd just gotten Shudder and had both gone on a bit of a spree adding to our combined watch list (we have very similar tastes in horror). I added this one because of how much I adore the first Houses that October Built film and this shares quite a few similarities. This, however, is not found footage, and has a far less ambiguous ending. It centers around a half dozen friends who get bored on Halloween night and leave a noisy club looking for some excitement. While attempting to ditch somebody following them (whom the main character suspects is her abusive boyfriend) they end up in a pretty shoddy looking extreme haunted house. At first it appears to be a series of cheaply built sets housing a few surprising and effective scares, but very quickly devolves into a fight for survival. The premise is pretty basic as horror movies go, but the movie does a good job not overplaying its hand so you're caught off guard as often as the characters. The group of villains is written very smartly and are absolutely fascinating as horror movies go, especially as there's a very subtle implication of cult ideals driving them, and their visual designs end up going from simple and effective to incredibly memorable. The over arching story contains a rather Scream-like take on character progression, but, as I stated, it doesn't overburden it with unnecessary backstory or too much personal drama. The one real knock against it is that the characters do occasionally suffer from that classic horror movie trope of anti-logic, but it's pretty infrequent and all the actors do such a solid job (particularly after they leave the club) that the moments are pretty easy to overlook. This makes me excited to look into Shudder's other original properties, and is an easy recommendation to my fellow horror fans."}, {"id": 305, "text": "I found myself enjoying Haunt way more than I thought I would. The art and set design are excellent without being over-the-top. The special effects (mostly practical) are impressive, and the murder set pieces are genuinely unnerving at times. The sound design, lighting, and production value are all top-notch. Not to mention, it has a great score by the always-fabulous Tomandandy.As the film opens, we meet college student Harper (Katie Stevens), who is getting over a break up with her alcoholic and menacing boyfriend whom she fears may be stalking her. To take her mind off things, her friends drag her out on the town for a night of Halloween merriment. Before long, a haunted house attraction with a very low-turnout appears seemingly out of thin air. A creepy mute clown greets them at the entrance before eventually escorting them in......and one more or less can predict what happens next, at least in terms of the story's general outline.If this sounds all-too-familiar, you may be pleasantly surprised at how the film elevates its worn premise to make it feel fresh. And it does so without ever being a carbon copy of its influences, even if it wears them proudly on its sleeves. The first 30 minutes or so, in particular, is gleeful in its creepy build-up. The film builds tension at a measured, un-rushed pace, and the film has a similar feel of the best of the old-school slashers. It also utilizes a similar approach of the old Hitchcockian less-is-more than on gore, and tacky jump scares. The characters are more likable and less annoying than those you find in similar recent (they actually could be people you may consider hanging out within the real world). Their choices and reactions to the horrific happenings are relatively realistic and logical.Unfortunately, but not fatally, the movie loses a little steam for a bit once it abruptly shifts from the slow-burn approach of the first act to all-out visceral horror in the second. I also am not sure that the film needed Harper's oral backstory about growing up in her own haunted house, as the film comes to a complete halt for this diversion. It almost distracts from the real-time tension that the film succeeded at sustaining up until this point. At the same time, it did give her character some plausible motivation for a particular moment when she overcomes meeting a deadly fate in a saw-like set-piece.These pet peeves aside, I highly recommend Haunt, at least to fans of old-school holiday slashers. While the film could have used another 15-20 minutes of employing the same suspense and atmosphere from its earlier scenes before getting into the real carnage and gore, it still delivers a lot of fun. Its makers put a lot of energy into it and demonstrate a strong affection for the films it recalls. And it contains one genuinely catch-you-off guard Gotcha! moment that I didn't see coming and made me jump out of my seat (and this is coming from someone who never falls for the jump scare)."}, {"id": 306, "text": "Quick review on this one - its a horror so don't be expecting much in the way of acting talent but hey who cares its a horror movie and we all know the setup by now.I was not expecting much until I saw the name Eli Roth on the credit list so this immediately raised my expectations and I was not disappointed. Rather interesting combo of Saw, Hellfest, Collector II movies among others and very well done for a low budget horror. Eli Roth created two of the most frightening movies of modern times in Hostel &amp; Hostel II which still give me the creeps;especially knowing that it is based on true events that actually are taking place at this very moment in places like Thailand, Mexico,many islamic countries as well as the original red house in Serbia and although many may not like old Eli, he does undeniably have an inkling into what scares us like the great James Wan and this film is no exception.It is not on the level of SAW or Hostel but it has some genuinely creepy moments and plays out rather effectively and I did like the ending. If you are a fan of the horror genre and are trying to find something decent amongst a lot of the dire celluloid guff that is coming out this year then give this a go - you may just like what you find!!!"}, {"id": 307, "text": "The writers of A Quiet Place are back, this time with the blessing of torture porn artiste Eli Roth. unlike their previous outing, they arent trying to reinvent any wheels, or push any boundaries. All theyre interested in doing is scaring the hell out of their audience. For the most part, they succeed.Harper and Bailey are roommates and friends. Harper is nursing a fresh bruise from her abusive boyfriend, so Bailey persuades her to avoid him, and join her for a Halloween night out. The friends all gather at a club but, soon enough, one obnoxious guy has decided it's lame and time to hit a haunted house up. You'd think young adults would know by now that when a silent clown requests your handheld device, something is not right (in their defense, they do sign disclaimers first: scam artists truly are upping their games everywhere). Soon enough, a descent into madness and torture begins as the group is stalked by a witch, Satan a ghost and a madman with a chainsaw.Haunt succeeds in the beginning and up until the final bloodletting, it doesn't let up. The biggest thrill here is the writers' ability to test your nerves, with moments of ambiguity, dangling hope at all times that none of this is Actually real. As the group move from situation to situation, with all sorts of horror scenarios playing out like the best sort of candy haul after a night of guising, you are right there with them as they panic, reassure themselves and try to outwit the monsters they may be trapped with.The film, unfortunately, loses momentum as it switches gears in the final reel but for the first two thirds, it manages to unsettle in a way Tobe Hooper or Rob Zombie would be proud of. The villains are all startling in their own rights, masked and unmasked, and their little traps and tricks are simultaneously horrific, dastardly and fun to watch. A subplot about domestic abuse and the wicked web it weaves is never developed far enough for the pay off, coming across more as a deus ex machina than a true character exploration. However, by splitting up the two heroines Early on, and giving equal time to both during the early stages, it's never certain just who the final girl will be, creating a source of tension whenever either finds themselves in peril.After a few years of directors taking horror, and themselves, too seriously, it's so nice to just see a horrific haunted house flick in the style of Hooper, Zombie or Wingard. It's fast, it's scary, it's brutal, it's satisfying."}, {"id": 308, "text": "Heading out for Halloween, a group of friends decides to check out a local haunted house nearby, and as they go through the attraction come to believe the masked hosts are trying to kill them which is eventually proven true forcing them to try to get away from the establishment alive.This one was a highly enjoyable effort. Among the film's best qualities is the initial setup and arrival at the main haunt which has a lot to like. The groups' journey to the haunt by being out among friends with their struggles before deciding to leave for the haunted attraction has a realistic bent to it and comes to their arrival in a fun manner just stumbling upon it by chance as a side-of-the-road attraction that feels quite realistic and appropriate. That leads into the general air of the attraction which feels s very much like a genuine local attraction. Filled with cheesy Halloween decor, skeletons are strewn all over and dark lights hiding masked costumers, the maze-like structure and rooms filled with tasks need to perform to move on gives this a fantastic setup and creepy atmosphere. That this gets carried out without them truly knowing if they're out to hurt them but believing they aren't adds some tension to the scenes as well, all making this more suspenseful than it should be. The other big factor here is the strong second half that features plenty of fun with their being stalked and hunted. Once it's obvious that the haunt was not going right and they're in danger, there's some great stalking through the various rooms and corridors in the building, even including the big brawls against them once there's enough weaponry on hand to fight back. Generating some fine brutality and gore on both sides, these are exceptionally fast-paced and fun making for quite a lot to like overall. The film does have some minor flaws. The biggest detriment here is the inability to make sense of how the attraction should work. There's no instructions or directions here as to how they're supposed to operate the event before they turned psychotic and started going after the group. As well, the entire subplot about the abused childhood doesn't need to be included here, merely pointing to a coda that's meaningless and serves no purpose based on what's written here that's barely worth mentioning. These here are the only flaws.Rated Unrated/R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."}, {"id": 309, "text": "Haunt is a great, fun, intense horror thriller, one similar to a lot of horror movies, even other haunted attraction themed horrors, but still manages to stir things up a bit.If it weren't for the real danger and harm, this haunted house would rule. It's got some great ideas for a haunted attraction as well as a movie. It takes some cliches and uses them, and takes other cliches, and twists them. It IS however slightly annoying how well-planned the antagonists are, and how well they're able to predict the main characters' decisions. And yes, there are the standard Cabin-in-the-Woods type characters, and yes they make dumb decisions, and yes they do not make decisions like a normal person would, but who would under such circumstances?It's a great horror movie, despite its flaws. And yes, I personally wish it was more graphic and bloody, because let's be honest, it was really tame for anything that has to do with Eli Roth. But it's still a wild, worthy ride. Modern horror is not all bad, and here's the proof."}, {"id": 310, "text": "This was a film that I really knew nothing about. A friend online shared in a group that he caught this and was recommending everyone supports this as he really enjoyed it. I saw my theater was playing it so I gave one of the last viewings a shot. Since I knew nothing aside from the title and a vague idea of the premise, I'll do the same here. The synopsis is on Halloween, a group of friends encounter an 'extreme' haunted house that promises to feed on their darkest fears. The night turns deadly as they come to the horrifying realization that some nightmares are real.Right before the film actually starts, we are given glimpses of the extreme haunt being set up. We see a wire threaded around some pipes and we get the opening credits. It then shifts to a pumpkin getting thrown at a door. Bailey (Lauryn Alisa McClain) checks to see what the noise was and watches a truck leaving. It then shifts to Harper (Katie Stevens). She is looking at text messages and we see her putting concealer on over her bruised eye. Bailey knocks and comes into her room, stating what her boyfriend did. Harper displays the typical abusive relationship response that he wouldn't do that. She is then invited out to join Angela (Shazi Raja) and Mallory (Schuyler Helford) for a Halloween party at a bar. She declines at first, but we see her send the text, breaking up with her boyfriend and agreeing to come out. It should also be pointed out that Bailey borrows a ring that belonged to Harper's mother.There we see Bailey go up to a guy, Nathan (Will Brittain). She is excited to see him, but she just leaves while he asks her a question. Following some mix-up, Harper also goes up to him, thinking he was waving her over. The two do end up hitting it off though, until his friend Evan (Andrew Caldwell) hits her with a drink. Harper wants to leave and we see her requesting an Uber to her mother's house. She cancels it and gets a weird text from her boyfriend. She then sees someone in a creepy costume staring at her. Nathan comes out and convinces Harper to stay out. As the group decides what to do, they find a flier for an extreme haunted house and start heading that way.Things take a turn when Harper thinks that Sam (Samuel Hunt), her boyfriend, is following them. She has Evan turn and then pull off to see if her fears are correct. What this does is lead them right to the extreme haunt. They decide to give it a try and meet a creepy Clown (Justin Marxen) at the door. Waivers are given and phones are put into a lockbox. They go in and at first it seems like just a normal haunted house, with some scary and sometimes cheesy things. That is until Mallory disappears and Bailey is hurt. That is when they realize, this nightmare could be more real than they thought and that what is underneath these creepy masks is scarier.Now for that recap, I didn't want to reveal too much of the story, but I thought I needed to fit in a lot of back-story that is pertinent to the story. The big thing here is that I love the setting. I don't go to a lot of haunted houses and I've never been to an extreme one. I think that using this setting is genius. It is somewhere that you are disarmed in the idea that this could all be staged. I like this idea, because murders could start happening without even realizing.This is also a modern slasher that I can get behind. We don't really get a lot of them and good number of those tends to go on the cheaper side. Not to say that this one is has a huge budget, but that really did make it work. It almost feels like taking a combination of slasher with a Saw or The Collector. Not to say we get a bunch of traps, but we do have the idea in here. This does have multiple people that are behind what is happening, so it does break that tradition slasher idea, especially we reveal what they look like.Harper also brings an interesting back-story. She drops early on that she hasn't been home in 4 years and it is revealed why. It makes so much sense why should still be with a guy like Sam despite what he is doing. Personally, I feel for her, but I also know the psychology behind it so it works. This is really her needing to be that 'final girl' where she has to find the strength within her before it is too late.I want to shift next to the pacing and editing. I would say that the latter is used well. The group splits in a two at one point as the maze offers a safe and not safe option. I think it strategically moves between the two. From there, we never really see the group back together as a whole and they even toss in showing us what the villains are doing behind the scenes. I think that works to build tension here. I like that they didn't over-explain it or give us some cope out reason this is happening. The ending I wasn't expecting, but I thought it definitely works for what the film is building.That moves me to the acting of the film. Stevens I thought was a solid lead here. We see that in the beginning she is broken. She doesn't even want to come to this haunted house, but I like that she has to build her broken strength to survive this. She is also quite attractive. Brittain is the solid male lead here. He is the one that is pushing Harper in a good way. Their dynamic I thought was good. McClain, Raja and Helford are all solid as well as attractive. Angela does have a bit of that 'know-it-all' attitude as someone in her family has done it. It was pretty funny. Caldwell brought some laughs as well. I like they didn't go overboard with it and that pretty much stopped when the tension ramped up. Humor is a way of coping with fear and it seems real even though everyone is hiding it. All of the masked people running the haunt are creepy and a lot of that is the masks and them not talking. It gets even more when they take them off. With that said, I think the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.Shifting next to the effects, as I kind of said this does have a bit of feel of those 'torture porn' films. Now I hate this term and this film doesn't fall in that 'movement'. We get some practical effects of things that happen that looked good. There is some CGI, but I will give credit that they give us a glimpse before cutting away. That's knowing how to use it so we can't dissect it by seeing it too much. The look of the killers is really good and quite creepy if I'm honest. I'd also say that the film is shot very well.Now with that said, this one I came in blind to and I'm so glad that I did. I think this has such a great premise of being an extreme haunt on Halloween. The setting is great and making a modern slasher inside of it works. I think there's some good heart and back-story here that makes sense. It has a good running time, builds tension and never gets boring. It has an intriguing ending as well. The acting I thought was fitting for what was needed. I would have liked to see the effects go more practical, but I think they did work. The masks and the killers themselves look good. The soundtrack didn't really stand out to me, but it fit for what is needed. With that said, I had a lot of fun with this film and I would venture to say, this could become a staple of my Halloween viewing going forward. I think this is a good movie overall."}, {"id": 311, "text": "It started off on a pretty promising note, with some great cinematography and ambience feel to it. But right after the midway it caught up with disjointed writing and the mediocre performances couldn't help it either! Apart from the technicalities; this film failed on too many aspects. First of all there is a slowness in the screenplay. I understand, horror films naturally takes a bit more time than others to build up the story, characters and all but being a 'Slasher Horror' it needed to be fast paced. Also the dialogues, mediocre to below average characterisations made it further bad. Simply I couldn't care less for any of the characters in the film and that to be honest depicts how bad the writings were on Those characters especially! However makers have successfully delivered on 'Gory details'. Specific fan groups would love those for sure. But on the other hand as there are too many cliches, loopholes barged into it. It never came to that point; where I could say it was a great experience. The promising factor kind of faded away. And towards the end, scene by scene It gotten worse. Another example of decent enough premise turned into Garbage execution."}, {"id": 312, "text": "I am not sure If I should rate this as a slasher movie, or a typical Horror movie, either way I am having issues with this movie.I would score it lower as a Horror movie, but lets start at the beginning. A group of students decide to visit a haunted house. The fun derails once it becomes obvious that this far from a tame joyride. The Setup seems a bit cheesy, but fun and campy. The characters bring a personality, even If they arent deep and interesting, they at least keep you on board. For me the tension fell completely flat after the first death, at that point I knew where it was going and thus it lost me. Horror doesnt work If you know whats going to happen and the Story itself wasnt creative enough to keep my Attention gripped. Illogical decisions and a unclear motivation from villains and weird reactions from Protagonist kept me further disconnected from what was going on. At that point it still could have been a fun slasher movie, which would fit the Halloween theme well, If it we're successfull at being that. But the kills arent interesting either, they seem uninspired, just like the villains, the effects of the gore are well executed, but arent big enough to satisfy any gore fans either.In short, the movie doesnt completely fail in any part, but cant succeed either.

And dont get me started on that unsatisfying end..."}, {"id": 313, "text": "Review: 'Haunt' is an American horror film, written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. I went into this movie expecting your typical jump scare haunted house crap that has been done multiple times before. So, it may be just me going in with low expectations, but this movie is great. The movie starts out with introducing us to its main cast, which are out on the town on Halloween night looking for something to do. When one finds a poster for an 'extreme' haunted house he enlists everybody to go. Upon entering the house, things seem normal at first, but it soon turns into a deadly game of cat and mouse, and we wonder who will make it out alive. When it comes to any movie, the most important part to me is the ending, but a close second is the acting and whether we can care about these characters. Everybody in this movie sold you on the fact that they are in danger and it makes you feel uncomfortable from the get-go. Not only do all the actors do a great job at portraying the characters they're playing, but the writers made the characters in this movie smart! The main girl, Harper (Katie Stevens) has a dark past that makes her have some PTSD when some things happen in the house, and she plays it so well. I love that both the predator and prey in this movie are smart. I don't mean because they're college students, but when they realise, they're in danger, they stop and think about what to do next and take in their surroundings. You don't see that in horror films, ever. Also, the killers in this movie make smart choices, and you can tell that they thought about doing this house for a while and knew how to cover their tracks. The only downside I can think of with this movie, is we never really get a good explanation as to why the killers are doing what their doing. One could just say that they're crazy and like the thrill of it, but the way the movie was, it just felt like it was supposed to be more than that, and I thought it could have been fleshed out more. Overall, this movie is still a great time to watch in the dark, with good characters and makes a very unoriginal plot and brings new life into it. Also, side note: I can honestly say that I have never seen a horror film where I cared about what happened to the characters until I seen this movie. 4/5"}, {"id": 314, "text": "After reading some decent reviews on Shudder and IMDB, we decided to give this a shot. Reading the movie was directed by the writers of Quiet Place, I was expecting more than it delivered.It starts very slowly with unlikable characters who make nonsensical decisions but once they arrive at the 'Haunt, it steps up a couple of notches.The design, costumes and make up on the bad guys provide the major highs of the movie, and should be praised.However the film never really rises above mediocrity, and takes a silly final turn that could have been more powerful had it been explored sooner.I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the haunt characters turn up again, but they'd need to be in a better vehicle to gain more credence.In summary, it's quite gory, doesn't make a lot of sense, but enjoyable to a degree if you like Halloween haunted houses."}, {"id": 315, "text": "Okay, I am always a little skeptical when it comes to Eli Roth-involved films because they always seem to involve more gore than I care for. That's not my thing. Let me say from the start, there is gore here, but it is minimal and you kinda sense it's coming anyway and have time to look away.That being said, I was surprised by how much I liked this. It's not a new story, per se-this def feels like a mash-up of things that are tried and true in the genre-but the costumes and masks are creep-tastic. And those who downplay the character development must have misheard that this was a Meryl Streep vehicle. Bish, this is low budget horror. Lower your expectations. That being said, too, I had no issue with the characters and thought the female protagonist was great-especially the last time we see her. The rest are perfectly serviceable and did not disappoint.I recommend this movie because, while the story is familiar, it is well done all around."}], "reviews_amount": 316}
