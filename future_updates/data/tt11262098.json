The various causes of the mall's decline emerge throughout the documentary."}, {"id": 2, "text": "A very sad but poignant documentary about a dying mall in Alabama. It captures the struggle of everyday life brilliantly and without narration, but there is always hope tucked away if you look."}, {"id": 3, "text": "My son and I fell like we were watching a car wreck in slow motion. A group of lovely people caught up in an inevitable economic tragedy that is coming their way. The cinematography and editing is very well done. Admittedly, this is a minor film, but worth every one of the 86 minutes you'll spend watching."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This shows the lives of some everyday people going about their everyday lives and I found that surprisingly interesting. It also shows the dying mall era and brings back nostalgia at the same time. Good documentary."}, {"id": 5, "text": "This was thoughtful and kind to us all. Sweet good people affected by change."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I remember when I was young always being at the mall. Whether it was just hanging out or hitting the food court, it was the place to go in a small town. The traditional mall is a dying world and this documentary captures one example of this. Great film, it's a must watch."}, {"id": 7, "text": "The movie was so unexpected to me. I kept rooting for the store managers that have put their lives into their business. A few key retail places moved so the whole mall is dying. It is a touching story of the mall manager, who used to keep wildlife in Australia, to the older white men who like to play dominoes at the mall. It is a clip, a small view into what makes our communities work. It is worth watching..make some popcorn and watch the Jasper Mall."}, {"id": 8, "text": "A very nice and integer documentary about a dying mall and the people to whom this mall means something in their lives, in one way or another. Filmed at a slow pace and completed with mall music and sounds, it makes you feel you are actually there.I loved it."}, {"id": 9, "text": "A beautifully structured observational documentary. Each vignette is a little gem. You really feel as if you know these people. And like the best documentaries, it doesn't make any judgement calls about the people whose lives you're witnessing. It certainly made me wistful for the shopping malls of my youth. Love that Santa! I really appreciated the thoughtful, evocative soundtrack as well."}, {"id": 10, "text": "I story about a mall, yes, the everyday people that reside in it, yes. But, the strength and beauty of this film lies in it's rich metaphors on life, transformation and constant change. I've seen people online who find a melancholy in it's ability to bring a strong sense of nostalgia. That in itself shows how that particular viewer has a strong feeling towards holding on to the past. Every vignette's personal story acts as a metaphor of the life of the mall itself. Nicely composed hots to carry you through."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I think it's a documentary but it looks like a movie. It's quite unusual for this production and kinda warm feeling for people inside the mall."}, {"id": 12, "text": "All in all I enjoyed this documentary about a dying mall in Jasper Alabama. The film offers a cross section of people who work there and shop there as well as efforts (generally not successful) to increase foot traffic. I just wished occasionally the film makers had pulled away from the mall setting to give us some context about the larger community where the mall is set. Sure, internet commerce has hurt malls across the country, but are there shopping areas in Jasper that are prospering, such as downtown or the area where the jewelry repair shop moved to? Or is Jasper overall an economically depressed area that has gone severely down hill since the hey day of Jasper Mall in the 80s and 90s? The film would have been a much more rewarding experience for me if such contextual interludes had been provided."}, {"id": 13, "text": "I feel like this mall and town are all over the rural south.. This film I anticipate that it will age quite well considering how things continue to change."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Unlike the semi popular 'Dead Mall' series from the likes of Bright Sun Films and others YouTube Channels that goes into great detail the history of the titular shopping centers from its humble beginnings to its painful demise. This documentary directed by Bradford Thomason and Brett Whitcomb didn't really give much of any educational, scientific or historical value for the audience to look over. The documentary doesn't show much of any of the staff talking about the negative impact that online shopping has done to the mall nor was there any information about why their two anchors stores K-Mart and JC Penney left before the movie started. The filmmakers don't even give key data like where this mall is even located. It would had been nice to know that one of the reasons why the mall in Jasper, Alabama is having trouble keeping afloat is the fact that it's located on US 78 North, far away enough from big cities like Birmingham and even further east from its prime city. Furthermore, one of the main causes that the shopping center get overlooked is because after the completion of interstate 1-22. It moves much of the major traffic away from the mall. To add onto the mess, the shopping center itself sits in a predominately rural mountainous forest area with barely any locals due to the location's violent tornado patterns and borderline economic poverty problems. Another thing that the film doesn't point out is how many times, the mall went through foreclosure and who currently owns it. I assuming that Kohan Retail Investment Group still own the property, but who knows. None of these questions were answer or explained in this documentary. Truth be hold; the filmmakers only gave the viewer a few glimpses that something was a bit off about the Jasper mall. Such examples are the amazing analogically-like footage where mostly elderly customers order funeral flowers, play dominos in an empty food court, sing contradicting gospel music and unable to connect with modern technology. It really does symbolic representative, this dying mall's detachment with the more common younger online driven patrons. The absence of youth culture throughout the film is really alarming; seeing how in the 1980s &amp; 1990s, malls would be the ultimate hangout spot for children, while older people were more interested in local ma &amp; pa's downtown stores. The roles had changed here and it's somewhat surreal. Instead of expanding those key moments a little more to fit the overall narrative of the shopping center creeping closer to its own demise. The movie took a sharp right turn into focusing on nearly unrelated issues. One such example is the filmmaker's request in telling a teen couple's story about the struggles of starting an interracial relationship in the deep south. While their tale was somewhat interesting. Race relations doesn't really connect with the overall mall narrative at all. There weren't any signs of the shopping center being chauvinistic. If there were some underlying racism, the film didn't show it. After all the mall was alright with having children of minorities sit on Santa Claus' lap. Added to that, the couple are not really employees nor persistent shoppers at the mall. They really looked out of place. A good example of this was their appearance in the food court toward the end of the film. That moment felt awkwardly staged reenactment as they look like they secretly have no clue why they agreed to meet there rather than at home texting. It's seemed out of character for them to interact at that location. To tell you the truth, the movie would have work better if the filmmakers focus more on the life of the teenager custodian. As his story relates to what's going on with the mall. Sadly, that subplot was abandoned. Another story that seems to go nowhere was the nail saloon lady. We never did find out if she left her job and travel the world. Maybe the movie should have focus on that, rather than wasting film footage on the manager/security guard's Mike McClelland romanticizing his past job as a Tiger King type zookeeper. While this was never uttered in the film. The mall does love to host Jungle Safaris events even after they been cited numerous times by the USDA. The reasons why are because it didn't meet minimum federal standards for the care of animals in captivity that was established by the Animal Welfare Act. Because of that and other controversial events like selling hand held weapons in order to increase foot traffic. The mall is viewed as being notorious passe than modern. You can tell by the look of the shopping center. The mall had not been remodeled since it opened in 1981. The lack of people around with the incandescent lighting makes the antique layout of the location look really haunting. There are long shots where the camera lingers on shots of the empty location with nothing really going on. While some people might think of that as boring. I kinda like the petrifying nostalgia feel, those visuals give. It's surprising more riveting than watching highly staged moments where people ruin shots by staring straight at the camera as they talk to other people. That was annoying because it ruins the illusion of observation that the movie was trying to build. Nevertheless, the music that went along with the film was well used. The collection of songs by the musicians HAHA Mart, Chayse Porter and Baker Knight were easy on the ears. Overall: to close shop. This documentary is not quite good enough to be putting on your shopping list. It's only good for a quick browse."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Such a well done docu on a part of American life that so many of us experience. The death of retail brick and mortar has huge impact on our lives."}, {"id": 16, "text": "A long, hard, and sad look into small town malls. Once popular in the 1980's they no longer have viable businesses inside the buildings. Jasper Mall is the stereotypical profile. The regular groups are featured in this documentary. From the morning walking seniors that don't spend money in the mall to the struggling businesses and employees. It's tough to watch but is a good social study about small town folks and captures the feeling of people that just want to get out Grim and sad but done well as a film."}, {"id": 17, "text": "An intimate glimpse into the waning days of a dying mall and the souls whose lives are touched and in many ways dependent on it. On a macro level the Jasper Mall is a metaphor for the dying middle class and the state of quiet desperation that is America today. Beautifully photographed and lovely interviews."}, {"id": 18, "text": "I really thought I would watch this show for 10m and switch to something else. But the characters lure you in and their perspectives and insights hook you. And the mall is the character tying them all together. Well edited, great selection of subjects and just all around solid, thought provoking film making.Sad that this same situation was playing out nationwide even pre-Covid."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This is a well-done documenting of the disappearance of the enclosed mall. i've seen videos on youtube about the future of these huge, expensive-to-maintain places, about them becoming office space, hospitals, even low-cost housing.having worked in a mall in several businesses during the heyday of mall popularity (80s-90s), it is sad to see its decline and eventual disappearance from our culture. but, we've moved on to something else and apparently don't need this group societal experience any longer. well, unless you're a mall walker i guess."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I enjoyed this doc and its showcase on a dying mall, many of which are in the same sad state across the country. The cinematography was perhaps the best aspect of the film, and they use it in the place of narration often and brilliantly.I would've appreciated a more linear perspective that also showcased clips and videos of the mall in its prime, instead of the brief scene of one of the tenants flipping through a photo album of news clippings that are hard for the audience to even see.Accordingly, I felt the overall story didn't serve those we see on screen in present day. Someone who is young and never experienced mall culture when it was at it's height in the 80s and early 90s would be completely bored by this film since it lacks all context from the past."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Cinematography, editing and musical score were on point. I found myself wanting to know a little more about things. Kudos to the filmmakers."}, {"id": 22, "text": "This is such a joke. The movie is really about a bunch of people with no lives who are wondering what will happen to them when the shopping mall closes down. There's some misplaced sentimentality and obvious rehearsals and cam-cards readings by supposedly regular people. It's just a strange mess. Pass on this."}, {"id": 23, "text": "I'm originally from Jasper which makes it all that much harder to that this was a lazy attempt. It's BORING! Why were none of the people being interviewed not asked their names? Why were only their first names given in the credits? Don't waste your time because you won't find out anything about the Jasper Mall's history (that and the utter boredom)"}, {"id": 24, "text": "Jasper Mall was an entertaining look into the life of a mall. It's both heartwarming and tragic. As a child of the 80s, I spent much of my adolescence in malls like Jasper Mall making friends, hanging out in the food courts and the arcades, and just spending time there. So when I began watching this documentary, it brought me back to a time and place in my youth who's memory put a big smile on my face. At the same time, I was saddened and heartbroken by the fact that these places are disappearing. They weren't just places for shopping. Malls were where you met your first love, where you went on your first date, where you met your best friends, where you made so many memories, and they're going away because American culture has changed. Jasper Mall is a time capsule for the future, where one day we will look back and say remember when we used to go to the mall? It's a both a story of a mall as a physical entity but also as a reference point in the lives of all these invdividuals and their personal stories, from the Zookeeper turnded security and custodian, to Robin the retiring florist, and young starry-eyed interracial couple, the old men playing dominos, the tattooed hair stylist who wants to escape Jasper to do great things in her life. They all have personal stories and they're all part of the life and times of Jasper Mall."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Documentary was well made but not much content to be had in the Jasper Mall. They highlighted that the most action they get are from homeless (druggies) looking for shelter, old people looking for a place to walk, and old men playing dominos in the food court. When the security/maintenance/sales rep called for more food businesses, he said he needed it because the tenants wanted a place to eat. The tenants, not the mall shoppers, or mall walkers, or mall dominoes. That makes no sense as a business. They need stores that can't be replaced with online sales, like clothing stores (for the ladies) or appliance and technology stores (for the guys). And it has to be high end, because people who have money spend it all the time. People who shop at JCPenney aren't buying new clothes all the time, it's once or twice a year. People who are buying Gucci are buying constantly to keep up with the trends. But people in Jasper, or within 300 miles of Jasper, aren't buying from Gucci. So the malls will fail, and the mom &amp; pops will make a resurgence as stand alone establishment's. Leave Gucci and mall settings for the big city's, because there is no middle class anymore to buy at the suburban malls. The only thing they're good for is pooping on the floor on video and posting it to Tik-Tok."}, {"id": 26, "text": "Documentaries like Jasper Mall are why I initially started getting into watching docs. No voiceovers, no thematic soundtrack, just pure cinematography and story telling. This doc creates heroes and people you want to root for just by showing their day to day lives. For someone who grew up with their local mall being their go to place as a youth, this brought back both memories and sad realizations. The Jasper Mall has its glory days in the 90s and early 2000s, and many of the people who work there now were around for those days. There is held out hope that somehow with the right store, department, or entertainment, the glory days will come back. This doc is admirable, sad, and hopeful. The director did a great job in letting the story play out, accompanied by savvy camera work. Half way through I found my self wanting to take a road trip down to this mall just to purchase things from the people showcased. There is something simple and poetic about the plight of middle class America, and this puts it into portrait form. I know that several malls across America are experiencing their own Jasper reality, but the key to a great doc is getting the audience to care about the subjects. That being said, goal achieved. Anyone wanting a stirring and nostalgic trip down memory lane that becomes a real slightly sad real world story, this is a perfect doc. Don't waste your time on Tiger King, this is real America."}, {"id": 27, "text": "This was similar to so many documentaries made about dying downtown businesses. The Wal Mart effect which also hurts malls. Malls grew huge in the 1970s and 1980s and some still thrive. But towns like Jasper, or Cookeville, TN or Tupelo, MS struggle with their mallsBut as was clear there are other non downtown areas of Jasper that do better. Still a closing of an era and melancholy for sure but outdoor galleria style centers are much more popular now including in NW AlabamaLoved the checker players and the morning walkers. And the symbiotic relationships that are so important for malls was evident. Always nice when there is action, but Netflix hurt the theaters, Walmart hurt the smaller stores and Subways on every block hurt the food courtsWant malls? Try bigger cities where more still do well. But even big cities see many malls fail."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Many of us see it in our own towns and cities it's clear our local malls are becoming less and less, and this doc Jasper Mall hits on those things. For one year it follows the local mall in Jasper, Alabama and how it declines and grows less and less with stores closing and chains going out of business. Plus as people get older they shop less and young kids use the mall as a dating and gathering hangout. Many younger people leave their local towns for better lives as the decrease in population hurts mall sales. And many local and independent shops have better selection of items than mall stores. Plus shown are the lack of choices in the mall as it's just a food court and the only entertainment has come down to local gospel music or military recruitment! Where the hell is a FYE or Victoria Secret's store now those chains are something everyone can relate to. Something not mentioned is the rise of online and internet shopping sales as those things have hurt many malls. Overall the doc is really blunt and grim as it looks at a dying landscape something that many see in real life as the decline of the American mall is another change that all of us are dealing with."}, {"id": 29, "text": "As a hardcore liberal bordering on Socialist, I couldn't give much of a rat's butt that a mall may close down (I do have some nostalgia for a couple of the malls of my youth, but it's for malls that don't exist anymore - it's just not been the same since Suncoast and Sam Goody closed, you know, don't even got a goddamn FYE store, but anyway), yet I do feel for the people in it who get affected due to the lack of employment (albeit short term and usually crappy, for some more literal than others).And I think what sticks out the most is that these fimmmakers are interested thoroughly in the people more than the stuff - though close ups of withering flowers in the one woman's shop and the jewelry that guy is working on stand out as neat compositions, and passages like the interracial couple at the carnival are quite touching. And of course there's the mall Santa, which is just great to see his process of combing his bead and putting on the coat and so on - and that one fleeting image of What Christmas Smells Like. But above all else is the security guard cum mall manager who is like the actual decent version of a Tiger King (we learn he used to run a zoo with big cats, and there's a history there in how he moves and looks at things).Late era Capitalism and the decline of an empire never seemed so... What it is. As Vonnegut would say, so it goes."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I'll be the first to admit that, in some sense, you're not going to learn anything from this that you didn't already know. Even so, I think it's worth watching to be reminded of how the other America, flyover America, may not be exactly what you think it is.A cruel or stupid person can find a lot to mock here, but what I saw was whole lot of people trying to be decent under difficult circumstances. In particular the combination janitor/security guard comes across as a real hero, battling on so many fronts to keep the place viable, doing a job that seems way above his pay grade.It's inevitable that anyone seeing this is going to veer off into their own analysis: why's it happening (my theory of economics), what should be done (my theory of politics), why are people responding as they are (my theory of culture). But there's value, at least occasionally, in switching off your theory of the world and just observing the situation, acquiring some new raw data and perhaps even, god forbid, modifying your theories of economics/politics/culture in response to that data."}], "reviews_amount": 31}
