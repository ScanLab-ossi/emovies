There is so much wrong in this movie that I wish I haven't seen this. What's worse is that Jackie Chan is selling his soul to the China movie factory. It really hurts his amazing legacy. So many awesome HK movies and even some decent Hollywood movies. When judging a movie I rather want to keep politics aside but its very hilarious when all those new China movies try to sell how great China is. Like when they tell a story about an activist and portrait western people as wildlife hunters but don't say anything about a lot of Chinese people buying that stuff for health issues. 3 stars only because there is worse. China is so desperate to show the pretty Chinese people in their movies that acting becomes 2nd importance."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Most of the fighting scenes are just boring to watch and the actions in the movies are mostly absurd. The good guys never die and barely even get shot despite being outnumbered and under heavy fire. In many instances they could have killed the bad guys but somehow choose to just knock them out, and the bad guys soon come back chasing them again. The young female character playing the daughter cannot act! Her emotional scene with her dad seems so fake and the chemistry between her and the male lead is so forced it makes you want to stop watching the movie. And JC too many times trying to subtly show his praise to China, those moments just makes you cringe."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This is what I call a globetrotter. It's your generic action team going all around the world on a mission. And even if the stunts are good and the look of the movie is fine, there is simply nothing to it. Nothing stands out or is memorable, or would prompt a second watching. You can't even make fun of it (like the newest Charlie's Angels). At times, there's too many people shooting and you don't know who is who..And for such a serious movie, Jackie stands out like a sore thumb... and not in a good way. Don't recommend it, it's too boring and simplistic."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The CGI sucks big time. Lion look so fake. Even the car drift scene also fake like fark. Seriously what kind of attire Jackie Chan wearing in Africa. Lol maximum fail."}, {"id": 4, "text": "If you expect to see a movie in the style of those in which Jackie Chan is casual, and also a good fighter and acrobat, and the movie is engaging and funny, you are wrong. The positive characters are exaggeratedly devoted to the employing company, Vanguard, being such an exemplary discipline and obsessed with fulfilling their mission at all costs, like soldiers in the Chinese army. They are, at the same time, like a family whose guiding parent is Jackie Chan, thus becoming unbelievable and downright annoying. Many of the fight and action scenes curl up the absurd. The scenes that were supposed to have an emotional charge are so misinterpreted that they have become hilarious. And with the technique presented, it was exaggerated, being more than phantasmagoric. I didn't expect Jackie Chan to agree to star in such a poor quality film, although I'm convinced it wasn't a low-budget one, but he's not the only one doing it. I couldn't give the movie more than 3 stars."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Worst movie I've ever seen. I looked like it's made by some students with Microsoft Powerpoint. This earns an exclusive genre."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Terribly fake CGI all the scenes! Insult other nationalities and exaggerate Chinese people. He forgot that China destroyed world health and economy by COVID-19. I was in love with Jacky! I hate him now due to he showed us his real personality!!!"}, {"id": 7, "text": "From the first time I saw the trailer I know it would be a disappointment. Computer effect is too much and so unrealistic. The drifting Ferraris, the lion chase, limousine , explosion, water rapids even the fight scene.

Never expected"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Although I am big fan of Jackie Chan since I was a kid and I think he is one of the most talaneted action actor ... but this movie is super shallow and an insult for movies junkies like me .. CGI is very bad .. no acting ... plot is shallow yet badly made .. in my humble opinion, this movie have should better been made as an animated film ... I would rated 3 if it was !"}, {"id": 10, "text": "I just don't understand how Jackie Chan accept to do this movie. it's like a movie for kinder garden children"}, {"id": 11, "text": "This is what a true 1 star movie looks like.

For one of the greatest martial artists out there, and for someone I have enjoyed watching in the past, to now wanting to enter a room full of people who are infected with covid 19, this says and shows you how crap this movie was and again I only manages 10mins of this. 10mins I will never get back. If this is what Jackie Chan has ended up doing B movies (and I'm being kind) well hang up your acting robe, enjoy the millions you have made over the years and STOP please STOP making crap movies like this. What a waste of time, just as well you can't give a zero star rating. Don't watse your time watching this crap, watching paint dry is more interesting than what this can only be called PURE CRAP..........."}, {"id": 13, "text": "One of the worse action movie I've ever watched. waste of time. even worse than Indian actions. CGI sucks!!! actors and action parts looks like childish cartoons."}, {"id": 14, "text": "There are a few good moments here and there in an otherwise terrible movie which also benefits from its visual aesthetic. For the first, Jackie in a secondary role doesn't work for his role isn't given prominence. Highlights include: The cool way Jackie gets into a car while it's in motion. A scene where Jackie talks to guy about getting into a fortress while wearing traditional middle Eastern garb. Jackie liquidating foes with a machine gun. Jackie knocking a guy into a tank of water and acting like he didn't do it The stairs gag.Those are the highlights. The main problem is that the movie is completely unfulfilling. Jackie in a secondary part, surrounded by dull, uncharismatic actors doesn't interest me or even work. The gold plated cats were admittedly flashy but the supposed fast and furious car chase left a lot to be desired. A Little better than Kung Fu Yoga, but that means very little."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Why Jackie Chan did what he did IDK. There can be many reasons, why such actor take part in this project. But my eyes... they hurts while watching this movie. Totally not worth the time was spent."}, {"id": 16, "text": "This movie is terrible. The dialogue is absolutely horrendous. They tried to make it funny but the acting was so robotic it was not believeable whatsoever. The storyline was ridiculous. Why do they always typecast the 'thugs' as big mean looking dudes who have no charisma? The fight scenes were good, but nothing you haven't seen before in all the other Jackie Chan movies. I gave it one star for that. I gave another star for Miya Muqi because she is hot. The problem with all international movies funded by China is that they always go over the top with the set because they have lots of money to throw around. Unfortunately, they also try to push the agenda that Chinese are good and 'ethical' which is far from the case. And what is with CGI made in china? Why is it so bad??"}, {"id": 17, "text": "Honestly I'm gonna give it 10 stars because it was so funny. I don't think it was meant to be a comedy but it was so unrealistic that I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. The cgi is pretty bad which is hilarious and it's so funny when movie production companies just hire Indians to play the role of an Arab, it's so freaking obvious that they're not arab and they don't even speak Arabic lmao. But honestly it's so refreshing watching a movie where Americans aren't the hero's. Also, the Chinese guy is so handsome. When I saw it in the cinema it was dubbed so that was HORRIBLE I hate when movies are dubbed, might have to watch it again with subtitles cuz i really can't stand when movies are dubbed."}, {"id": 18, "text": "This movie, in my opinion, was a lot better than his previous collaboration with Stanley. Kung Fu Yoga was okay. If you enjoyed that, you'll definitely have a romp with this film. It's the same kind of action heavy but also goofy comedy that you can expect from some of Jackie's movies. His role here is a little more subdued, however, as he lets the other actors take bigger roles. Although he's the highest billed actor here, he plays more of a secondary role as the leader of this agency. That being said, there's enough Jackie in this movie where I don't feel misled. He definitely has more screen time than The Foreigner, another movie where he received top billing but, imo didnt appear enough in the film.The action is great and it's definitely a good popcorn flick that'll distract you from the ongoing pandemic. It's what the world needs, really!"}, {"id": 19, "text": "Vanguard has some good comedy and adequate fight scenes!"}, {"id": 20, "text": "Nice Movie Best Action By Jackie Chan Best Action Movie"}, {"id": 21, "text": "Another epic action adventure created by Jackie Chan, that's why he's the living legend. Not as dangerous as his old time, but still well designed action scene.The scene in the rapid is stunning, you can see in the behind-the-scenes footage that this is not simply shoot behind the green screen (which everyone else will do so nowadays).Car chase scene is common, but you can see a new perspective in Vanguard.I'm not a Jackie Chan fanboy, but I would say you should not miss this."}, {"id": 22, "text": "This movie is disaster. Terrible CGI, woeful transitions in between scenes and cringeworthy dialogues. What is more worrying than the cheesy villain in the movie is the fact that the reviewers giving 8-10 stars are most likely paid to do so. Just take a look at their review history and you will know.

Very good movie:) Jackie best movie, that young actor Yang Yang is so handsome, OMG!!!!!!!!"}, {"id": 27, "text": "At first, i would like to say that Jackie he never disappoints us. A good thing is he takes care the young actors and actresses. I saw some BTS he teaches personally in every detail(y). Those young actors' action scenes are ok especially the handsome one made me search who he is. His name is Yang Yang,a traffic star in china. I am looking forward to his new project."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Watch this movie few times because of the handsome guy Yang Yang. His kungfu fighting and stunt action was great.

Unbelievable! How many action stars can still do that?!The film is shot in multiple locations and is beautifully shot.

Another great action movie by Jackie Chan. Can't believe he is in his 60s and still does his own stunts. Unbelievable! The story is straightforward and entertaining. Exciting action every 10 minutes. Probably one of the best action movies during the time of the pandemic."}, {"id": 33, "text": "I have read a bunch of negative reviews, which I think it is really meant to brush down the movie and its casts. Personally, it is really not that bad considering there is a story line and JC's action as always, humour us :) To all those negative reviewers, it is just a movie.

The casts are charismatic &amp; likable but that's all to it. I feel like this movie is a sequel to a movie that doesn't exist. The world set-up is intriguing but the execution is generic. The characters are actually interesting but their time of interaction were consumed by the action. Wished we got some backstory behind these characters motivation but sadly the duration is short.Jackie Chan was great &amp; he doesn't overshadowed the rest of the characters which I'm glad. The plot &amp; the villain motivation were so generic &amp; stupid hence they stop me from loving this movie. I don't get how everyone saying the CG is terrible, imo its really good.

V is a full action movie with actors looks coming out of a wax museum or statue maker. Everything is so clean and beautiful. Not a drop of blood despite all this shooting.

I guess it depends on whether or not you are a Jackie Chan fan-I am-but if you are, you should enjoy this movie. It does have a little less Jackie-he is getting just a tad bit older, being 66-but the stunts and fights are pretty amazing. Jackie plays the head of a security and VIP protection service called Vanguard-that is one of the excuses for less Jackie, being behind a desk. An accountant has been kidnapped and Vanguard are called in to save the day. Vanguard saves the book keeper but his daughter Ruohan, is taken as a hostage/leverage to get what the bad guys want. Jackie does participate in some action/fight scenes but leaves the majority of it to his younger and highly trained agents, such as Miya. Brahim is the kidnapper that has to face Jackie's elite squad, but Brahim has his own mercenary soldiers that really love to get into scraps. There are lots of cool stunts-I really liked the flying skateboard-and fights, as well as car chases and gun battles. Oh yeah, the screening I was attending had sub_titles and there are the usual bloopers and out takes during the end credits that accompany a Jackie Chan movie. I didn't notice a rating but it had violence-not too bloody-and had a running time of 1 hour &amp; 48 minutes.

Although the action scenes were fun to watch at times, they were full of terrible CGI - worse than a low budget made for TV movie.

I question even whether this was shot on location or just stock footage used to give context.

Chinese movies nowadays have gone off the rails. The bad stuff: The plot is janky. There is no backstory, nothing, the characters are plain, the setting is nonsentical. The filming locations, obviously, very limited. CGI is awful. I don't know if they didn't have any money, or the production was rushed, but the quality of the CGI is lower than what most videogames have nowadays. The overall cheesiness. In general, a certain degree of cheesiness in Jackie Chan's movies is a given and is, actually, welcome. But here because of the lack of character development, it looks like a fondue of a movie. The good stuff: The story doesn't break continuity, as it happens with many modern Chinese movies. The choreography and the stuntwork. It is actually good, the fighting scenes are well-set and look pretty decent. Jackie Chan. Well, what can I say, the name says it all. Overall, it's very similar to Armor of God III: Chinese Zodiac. I'd say it's an improved version of it. Were this movie made by an indie studio, I'd say it's a solid action movie.

As well as expensive (though why so many of the CGI effects are so bad given what this movie must have cost, I have no idea). But it is senseless and ridiculous, even by the most lightweight fantasy-action-movie standards. It really feels like they said OK, we have about a dozen ideas here for generic ripoffs of other movies...hey, let's cram them all into ONE movie, and stick Jackie Chan on top! From one scene to the next, this film has no idea what it wants to be--so it tries everything, badly. I laughed out loud at some things that were meant to be taken seriously.I'm not sure bloodthirsty terrorists need to be heavily featured in a movie geared towards 10-year-olds, but that seems the approximate age group targeted here. Yet at the same time Vanguard isn't exactly a family film--or anything else, for more than a few minutes at a time. What it is, is a mess. A loud, expensive, busy mess that does Jackie no favors, or any of the younger cast members either.Please note that if you click on their names, every single user here who gave Vanguard ten stars has mysteriously never reviewed another film, and only been on IMBD for a month.

It really feels like a bollywood movie with Chinese and some white actors.The plot is of course dumb and simple. The dialogues seem to have been written by a child a decade ago. CGI is atrocious, especially car physics, oh boy this must be the most unrealistic way cars jump and roll that I've seen, not sure which was the funniest (as in most idiotic) - limo drifting in superspeed or golden suv crashing everything.You probably can't find a movie made this century with more cliches than this one.The editing is just the WORST. They must've outsourced it to a student or somebody's toddler made it. Haven't seen this many fade-to-blacks anywhere. There's no excuse unless they edited in in a single day. Editing is so bad that the whole movie doesn't even feel like a movie. It's more of a set of different scenes that were lazily stitched together. Not sure if the script was this bad or the editor is to blame but it often feels like a videogame, in one scene they finish planting a mine at night and it fades to black, just a second later a new scene appears when it's morning and an energetic music pumping. Like in those open world game where you come to the location at the wrong time so the world shifts to whatever proper time it has to be and then the cutscene begins. Pain to watch.Score is laughable. They literally put on funny music when something is meant to be funny, like it's a sitcom or something. Music is all over the place, not consistency, a complete mess.Gunshots though sound pretty cool and punchy at times.There was one genuinely excellent Jackie-style trick when he entered the car while it was moving, reminiscent of his old ladder tricks and window jumps.Conclusion: if you haven't seen an action movie (and any movie for that matter) in 20 years, or if you're a fan of Bollywood, or maybe if you're 10 years old, then Vanguard should please you. Otherwise, you better avoid it, even if you're a Jackie fan.P.s. unwatchable. Can't unroll my eyes back."}, {"id": 89, "text": "Vanguard was supposed to be released on 25th January, 2020 but due to global COVID-19 pandemic this movie has been delayed, and now it has finally arrived.After a long time Jackie Chan has returned to his form even though it's a multicast movie. Other younger actors couldn't bypass his role in Vanguard. He is growing old but his performances won't allow to reflect it. His accurate timing in both comic scenes and actions are really entertaining.The story is written in such a way with visually super VFX and CGI action stunts that you will be amazed to see it on the theatre. Stanley Tong is always at his best with a mixture of actions and hilarious comedy scenes. Locations are selected very wisely for high octane chasing scenes with combinations of captivating fights.Don't miss this movie if you want to enjoy an on-the-edge thrilling ride in time of pandemic.Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb"}, {"id": 90, "text": "______________________________________________________Protection Beyond Frontiers {Vanguard Tagline}. ______________________________________________________ A ~{ Mini }~ Review .

And that's OK. This film is pretty bad for several other reasons.First, it's obvious that China and the UAE funded this film. It smacks of propaganda from start to finish.Overacting/bad acting. Maybe it's because none of the actors are native English speakers but everyone seems to be shouting their lines even when the scenes don't call for it and they also exaggerate their facial expressions. It's almost how the silent film actors used their expressions to make up for no sound.Post production. From the CGI lions to the scenes where they speed up the film to make the cars go faster, it makes the whole production look amateurish. The sound was pretty bad, too. Not sure if dialogue was redubbed in the studio but it sure seemed like it.Bottom line, the movie is a major disappointment."}, {"id": 92, "text": "As a Jackie Chan fan I enjoy watching his movies for his onscreen actions and funny set piece fight sequences. Having said that Jackie Chan is taking a senior role in this movie, leaving most of the actions to the younger teen idols and rising chic stars.I enjoy the exotic locations here - outside of western metropolises. The story/plot is very fast pace as this is an action film - and it makes heavily use of CGI. However, the physics of the CGI is a let down - they may be good in older computer games and the teens/younger generations may find it easy to believe, but for an older person like me... I caught myself saying Aw that's not possible. (physics wise) a few times - and I still play computer games! The astute movie viewer can also spot a few pieces of Chinese propaganda thrown in to make the Chinese look good. However, that is obvious and expected of a Chinese state funded/sponsored film. e.g. Chinese taking an interest in shutting down African elephant poaching vs. ivory in black market demand, etc. It's also disappointing to not see anyone coming close to replacing Jackie Chan's action fight sequence, with his funny and smart use of the environment to his advantage.The film makes up with beautiful exotic locations and costumes/customs, fast paced set-piece action (reminds me of the Kingsman series) fight/shoot scenes.Overall Vanguard is good to burn time and generate a good amount of talk amongst youngsters and showcase what the mainland Chinese in partnership with the Arabs/Dubai are capable of. It is not for movie goers who expect deep meaningful plot with twists and turns and mysteries/romance. One thing is for sure... the Chinese may have some of the world's fastest supercomputers, but their CGI/special FX rendering in movies is still lagging way behind the other world famous VFX houses such as ILM/Weta Digital, in terms of physics and realism."}, {"id": 93, "text": "A big improvement on the previous Stanley (Tong) and Jackie (Chan) film, Kung Fu Yoga. The younger actors/actresses get slightly more screen time (but not too much) than Jackie in this crazy action outing; it is probably in his long term movie plans to wind down his previous fast paced wild action now that he is growing older (I watch a lot of Chinese films but I honestly have no clue about who could step into Jackie's role for the next 20-30 years).There are lots of little details (i.e. CGI special FX are not too good) etc that are not up to the usual high grade of his films but, they are not so bad as to ruin the enjoyment; I could not stop laughing at the funny scenes throughout the film yet I am sure it wasn't meant to be a comedy!Its going to be interesting to see how his future films unfurl as regards to his action acting. Having said that however, if he makes films in the future that are lesser in action such as The Foreigner (2017) then it will be fine by me. Watch or don't watch is always your choice to make but I think its worth a watch!Silicone Tourist signing off till next time."}, {"id": 94, "text": "Vanguard is probably one of the corniest action flicks I've seen this year but it has enough non stop action, to pull it off.From start to end there's lot of martial arts and weapons play to keep the viewer happy. Jackie Chan's trade mark is everywhere to be seen with a large doses of the kind of semi comical, choreographed fight scenes, that made him famous.On top of this is are large dollops of sugary, overly sentimental family and very tame romance scenes. I know from my time in China audiences there love this stuff. That said, it doesn't travel well and many Western viewers, like myself, will see it as downright corny.If you can look past this and I think you should, there's enough excitement, fun and pure entertainment on offer here, to keep the majority of action fans more than satisfied.6/10 from me."}, {"id": 95, "text": "Considering how little movie offers Hollywood industry is showing to cinemas; it is really a miracle somebody is still going like me. Weeks pass with shallow romances, un funny little comedies and so so horror movies. No serious movies, no blockbusters or anything else to motivate people but cinemas. But happily with little publicity came a Jackie Chan movie; which guarantees high production values, lots of action and healthy fun. VANGUARD does not disappoint in any of these aspect. Sadly Jackie has grown old but he is able to get a few younger actors doing the best they can to keep up with the legend; they did not succeed but still on the good path. VANGUARD is Mission Impossible / James Bond type of movie; with very sophisticated gadgets, lots of action. exotic places and mostly fun. Jackie does some stunts and fights but not too much while the rest try to compensate. There are very good fights and some very good action scenes in different exotic places and even a Fast and the Furious car chase in Dubai. On the pros side, the gadgets are far more believable than in MI movies; the fights are spectacular and the stunt work is unbelievable. Many people hated the attack of the U.S. ship; but it is basically a failed attack and besides U.S moves destroy most the work well known areas so this is just a very little retribution. On the cons; the car chase could have been better and some scenes could had benefit for more development.In any case; is the best action movie showing and you can take your kids too and enjoy with them. Basically a win win"}, {"id": 96, "text": "Vanguard is a quirky action movie that convinces with exotic locations in Europe, Asia and Africa, excellent fight scenes featuring martial arts elements as well as vibrant shootings and great action sequences including fast-paced car chases as well as dangerous watercraft races. The movie has been created with expensive accessories, excellent special effects and a collective of popular actors and actresses who always manage to look sharp and beautiful even in the most eventful situations. The film also includes a few amusing moments and a slightly romantic side story which make it an entertainment for the whole family. It's also noteworthy that Jackie Chan confronts once again a CGI lion as in Kung Fu Yoga which can either be interpreted as a clever running gag or an incredibly stupid coincidence.Some people might claim that this kind of movie is shallow and they wouldn't be wrong. The characters are so thin that they are almost inexistent. The plot is so weak that it can barely be called that way. The actresses and actors look great but don't showcase any talent beyond some stunts and stylish looks. The fact that Chinese security guards in this film can freely roam the entire world, intervene anyplace without any restrictions and shoot up dozens of foreigners to save a greedy businessman who backstabbed his own dangerous partner should tell you everything you need about the questionable self-perception of the filmmakers. The fact that this film has many top-rated reviews from critics who have only ever contributed one single review to this website should tell you the rest.However, what is to expected from a movie like Vanguard isn't a profound story, social criticism or brilliant acting. This movie delivers action, entertainment and eye candy from start to finish. That won't win this film any significant awards but it's refreshingly carefree in a time when many people are worried about many things. This movie gives a welcome occasion to switch your brain off and have some fun for almost two hours. In times like these, one should be thankful for this. If you like action films, my recommendation for you is to watch this movie on the big screen with some drinks and snacks before the next lockdown comes."}, {"id": 97, "text": "Liked because of the Action sequences at Nations I have lived at, been to.Liked because the Actors, Actresses do their own action sequences including Jackie Chan as to why they get injured. Makes everything look real.Liked because unlike Hollywood's extensive Use of CGI, this movie you cannot see that much CGI. Was that Real or CGI?Disliked because they need to add the category Fiction not only Action.Facts not FictionDisliked because after the Vietnam war Stationed at Federal Republic of West Germany to U.S. Embassy London England, from U.S. Embassy to British Ministry Of Defense to British SAS School to Update their Training to reintroduce Strategic Special Reconnaissance and Strategic Special Surveillance back into the British SAS that they were originally created to do during World War 2, the British were at that time more concerned with Counter Insurgency Warfare and Counter Terrorist Operations as having to do something about the Bombings of London England. After graduating from the School, and reintroducing what I knew from Surviving the Vietnam War as a U.S. Army Special Forces Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol Platoon Sergeant, was assigned to the British Ministry of Intelligence 5/6, from there to the Queen's Own British SAS Detachment. The British are very strict as to who can Operate as Para Military, Security Forces or anybody that is Trained and Armed, ESPECIALLY FROM OTHER NATIONS.Disliked as a U.S. Military Officer because after the President Obama Budget Cuts 2009 to 2016, U.S. Laws, National Defense Authorization Acts, because of money Obama had to choose either fund Democrat President Clinton's Declared War, Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 or Afghanistan, Obama lost U.S. Ally Iraq's Centuries of Oil to Iran and the Russian Federation, Iran made Deals to buy 21st Century Technology the Deals were made at Dubai, New Nuclear Centrifuges, Russian Intergrated Anti Ballistic Missile Systems including the S-400 capable of Deteching 5th Generation Stealth and shooting down Ballistic Missiles and Russian Military Maintenace Crews, from the Chinese also thru Dubai the Iranians bought Chinese Rocket Assisted Self Rising Mines to implace at the Strait of Hormuz, Chinese Long Range (Over the Horizon) Anti Ship Ballistic Hypersonic Missiles that were designed to kill U.S. CVNs (like I was trained on as a U.S. Military Officer) and just about any U.S. Navy Ships and some U.S. Navy Boats (Submarines),Obama still did not have enough money for U.S. Ally Afghanistan, so the Afghans made deals with the Chinese to buy Afghanistan's High Tech Mineral Wealth, the Chinese being smart then refused to sell the High Tech Mineral Wealth to the U.S. to force U.S. Businesses like Apple Corporation to Manufacturer at China. The Chinese were within my Area of Responsibility and Area of Operations at Afghanistan doing extensive Mining Operations, they first put up fences with sensors, guard towers with heavy machineguns similar to the U.S. M134 Minigun equipped with Thermal Imaging, Electro Optics, Night Vision, Telescopes, a gunner and assistant gunner and a sniper. They wore no insignias on their Uniforms even though we knew they were just like Us as Special Warfare just below the CIA's SAD and SOG, that we routinely work with, they get the best of the entire Nation of China, and are of a lot large Force than we are. Regardless of who's Special Forces of whatever Nation we all do non lethal things to each other, so their shooting near Us is similar just to make Us react or if we don't react they know we are just like them...didn't flinch. The Chinese then expanded the Old Silk Road above Northern Afghanistan to haul all the High Tech Minerals back to China from Afghanistan, meaning they destroyed the Villages, Towns at the Old Silk Road.$800 Million compared to the Iraqis Oil negotiated at Dubai and the Russian Federation estimated to be nearly multiple $Trillions. 2011 Obama lost the Decades of Libyan Oil as negotiated by Qatar and Iran, estimated to be Hundreds of $Billions, that per 2006 U.S. Alliance Agreement with Libyan President Gaddaffi was to be Exclusively sold only to U.S. Allies, with this Obama Loss (Obama Overthrow of U.S. Ally Libya), Iran sells to The Russian Federation, the Russian Federation sells to U.S. Allies making U.S. Allies Indebted Financially and Politically to The Russian Federation.$800 Million is nothing compared to the amounts going thru Dubai's Hawala Secret Banking System. 2010 another Nation sent their Agents to kill Hamas Leader Mahmoud al-Mabhouh at Dubai, living quite well on the money ($900 Million) that President Obama and Vice President Biden gave Hamas 2009, and the money ($Millions) Secretary of State Clinton gave to Hamas."}], "reviews_amount": 98}
