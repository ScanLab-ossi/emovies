But if you want to watch an actual scary movie I would skip this one.The story was odd, to say the least. Why was it set in the 80's?!? That added nothing to it, but bad fashion choices. The whole storyline was pointless, as you found out in the end.The main character kills her own sister, blames an old lady, and gets away with it. Somehow this ruins the old lady's life and makes her evil and a witch? What bad police work! She literally kills her sister and dumps her and her bike in a creek with a path and no one ever finds her?What was the point of the Carnival? On going theme in the movie that is never explained. I thought it was going to be that her sister was killed there or something. But no!Also, parts of the movie were super blurry and dark. It was also super loud but that could had been the theatre's fault. Tons of pointless screaming. So I would skip this movie, but that is just my opinion."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Had to write a review for this, plz dont waste your time on this, yes the dude from Saw as is the creepy old lady from Insidious but thats just about it.

When he made the initial phone call to the teenager I thought I had slipped into Saw for a moment. Might have been a better idea to try and do a different voice as opposed to remind me of what a fun horror film is actually about.Not entirely sure why this needed to be set in the 80s but, there you go. The cinematography was okay until it got to the part in the dream world (when they get stuck in the call). From here it got very red and dark with the same music going over and over. Clearly the director / writer / whatever is a fan of Nightmare On Elm Street (but without the talent of Wes Craven or subsequent people who got onboard to write / direct and produce those films... even the poor ones).Each teenager has a secret / nightmare to hide, each has their turn to face it. From here on in it gets confusing and just downright ridiculous with one of the worst endings I have seen for a long time.The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for Lin who, I guess, needed the money or owed the team behind this rubbish a favour.

I never saw any of the Saw movies, but I recognized him from the movies as I did the old woman who played in the Insidious movies...huh. Two great horror actors playing in the same movie. How bad could it be? Dear god. The only thing that made me watch this garbage was that it was set back in the 80's...my teen years. The acting was okay and the kids really did deserve what they got and I know that horror movies rarely end happily, but this movie actually had me hoping for a rescue...a point where I face my past and I get to live.

The plot was simple, but it took half an hour to get to the call. The carnival at the beginning, which later also plays a model role in the house, was completely out of place. It was not needed and only dragged the whole thing out. I guess after IT and similar movies carnivals are considered scary. The equipment of the house was confusing. Why the hell did this old couple have so many skulls, demon sculptures and the like standing around? If I understood the time of action correctly, maybe three years have passed since the girl's death and the present time. Before that it was a daycare for small children. Where did all these sinister things come from in such a short time? Of course it underlined the claim that the old woman was a witch, but it was meaningless. The sequences in the in-between world were mediocre and not really scary. A little blood in the face and some scars with make-up on them didn't really make it scary. The end of the movie was outrageous and crowned it all. The question still remains why the old lady felt so much hate for the newcomer. He was the only one who didn't throw any stones. So why call him twice to tie him up after he escaped the first time? I like Lin Shaye, she did a good acting job here too.

The ones who truly enjoy horror films are the ones that make the best conclusions about whether this is enjoyable to see and if it will scare you. I am one of those people (I'm not a critic) who enjoyed the film completely. It scared me and I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent watching the entire story play itself in front of me.

Unfortunately this movie seemed less concern with plot and more with scoring maximum points on Horror Movie Bingo -well known horror actors -said actors doing something obviously reminiscent of their famous role -haunted lady doing crab walk -house using candles instead of electricity -characters making dumb choices -magically opening, closing, and sealing doors. The most impressive one was the front door boarded up - the characters were within earshot of it the entire time -screaming ghost lady in veil -creepy child saying, I kid you not, come play with me -carnivals (strangely, no obligatory clown) -monsters under the bed -you get out of the nightmare the same way you came in -bully (who is the softest bully in movie history) is that way because he was abused by his dadBeyond the heavy reliance on cliches, some of the plot was poorly edited (we are told the same story about who mrs. Cranston is, twice) or pointless (a fortune teller is introduced and never mentioned again). I also thought the acting was lame.

They believe Edith Cranston (Lin Shaye) was responsible for the death of Tonya's sister a few years ago. They decide to throw stones at her house, again. Chris goes with but does not play. Lin Shaye kills herself and leaves the four kids money. All they have to do is stay on the phone for a minute, a phone at the end of a dimly lit hall.The film takes place in 1987 because cell phones have screwed up the genre.

Sadly it's not one of her best.Set in the 80s (presumably so they could centre the entire story around calls on a telephone with actual wires) this is simply a 'teens get into trouble after tormenting local old lady' movie. There's nothing new at all. The four teen (yeah right) leads are totally unlikeable, their acting is as wooden as it comes and not even Lin and Tobin Bell can save us from the sheer awfulness.In a nutshell: Three teens befriend a new teen who moves into their town. They are the typical cliche group of horror movie teens. The new weird guy (who seems to have the strangest skin on his face), the flirty girl, the tough guy and his little brother. You don't care about any of them, they're literally awful people. They visit a fair then decide to go and torment an old lady who flirty teen claims killed her little sister in her daycare business (if you don't see the obvious twist then you need better glasses) years earlier. They break the old lady's window, she confronts them and tells them she'll save them a seat in Hell. The old lady then commits suicide after telling her husband that she can no longer stand being blamed for the murder of the child. In the following weeks (could be months, the movie was that boring I was playing a game on my phone) the brats are invited back to the house, hearing that if they manage to endure a one minute phone call they will inherit a share of a small fortune, as instructed in old lady's will.The film then descends into utter stupidity, predictable storyline, typical horror cliches, dreadful dul acting from the teens and 'reveal' that a toddler could have worked out. It's awful. Not worth wasting an hour and a half of your life on. No redeeming features except Shaye's always great acting.

I did love the homage to the 80's with the old style John Carpenter'esque analogue synths in keeping with when the movie was supposed to be set and I didnt see a smartphone or tablet anywhere so they got the setting right and the premise had promise, so where did it all go wrong?Well, for a start there is no real horror, zero scares and crucially the idea behind the call was....well just a telephone call to the dead woman that really did not give us an oooh or an ahhh like movies like Saw or Final Destination did and so just followed the sad old tropes of budget bin horror basket movies of yesteryear and so it fails execrably in every way almost.I am not so harsh as to give it a 1/10 as many of the reviewers have as this means it is the worst movie you have ever seen and we have movies like the Bad Batch with Keanu Reeves for that and many others; the acting is good, it is well filmed and professionally made unlike a lot of the shaky cam, dreadful acting Netflix ordure pouring out of film schools these days, so I give this one a harsh but fair, harsh but fair...4/10 hatchets!"}, {"id": 58, "text": "Initially when I sat down to watch the 2020 movie titled The Call, I must admit that I was sort of having some hopes for the movie, as it had two horror icons on the cast list.Well, as it turned out then the storyline in The Call was definitely interesting enough, if it wasn't actually being original. However, the movie's writer, Patrick Stibbs, just didn't really manage to deliver where it mattered for a horror movie. Sure, I mean, the movie was watchable and sort of entertaining enough, but it just was way too bland and generic for my liking.And yeah, it was because of Tobin Bell and Lin Shaye, two iconic names, faces and voices in the horror genre, that I initially sat down to watch it. And I will say that they both definitely did spruce up the overall enjoyment of the movie.The acting was good for a movie such as this. It wasn't outstanding, but it was adequate enough. Perhaps it was because of the limitations of the script and the directorial hand of Timothy Woodward Jr. that sort of restrained the performers to fully give what they had.Visually, for a horror movie, then The Call just didn't deliver. I mean, the atmosphere in the house was interesting and lots of nice details to the house, but the otherworldly sequences were just too flaccid, and didn't really feel like being scenes of personal hell and anguish enough.The Call is the type of horror movie that came and went without as much as leaving a dent in the horror genre. I mean, I didn't even know about the movie before I had the chance to actually sit down and watch it. And having watched it now, I can honestly say that I highly doubt that I will ever be sitting down to watch The Call a second time.Perhaps if you are a newcomer to the horror genre, then you will find some proper entertainment in The Call, or even some spooky stuff and scenes.

Creep factor was there and present in every location set. Some of the acting is decent. Story is good enough to keep you entertained for an afternoon.Cons: Some of the actors just need to go back to acting school, makeup of the ghosts sometimes was a bit basic and amateurish.
