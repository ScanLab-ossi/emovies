His name is the only selling point of this ultra-low budget action flick. Not that his presence saves the movie. Everything about it is cheap and ridiculously bad: the fight coreography, the script, the acting and the clich\u00e9 characters. It's just sad to see Jean Reno ruining his legacy for a few coins.

I have enjoyed most of his films, Midnight Meat Train, Downrange, No One Lives, Versus n even the segment from Nightmare Cinema. Most of his films r very violent but this one is lame without any noteworthy action sequence. Ruby Rose aint convincing as the bad ass fighter. Jean Reno looked puffy n tired. The fight choreography aint done well n the film lacked the thrill factor. The screenplay is very similar to the recent Mel Gibson disaster Force of Nature."}, {"id": 2, "text": "What is up with Hollywood and The use of this terrible actor. She has 1 emotion. Thats it.

Another B movie I wouldnt recommend."}, {"id": 4, "text": "People could call this a cheap movie (by hollywood standards).. I'd say it has more of an indie-feel.. With sloppy camera work that makes a mess of action scenes, and boring interactions and dialogue. This is one of those that isn't worth watching for any reason. You won't learn anything, isn't fun to criticize, and will be forgotten the next day. The plot is as simple as it could be summarized in one line of text, and none of the characters are decent or memorable (not even the little girl who you are supposed to like).. with the exception of Jean Reno, maybe, who poses as a smart and calculating villain. He does a fine job, but for his resume, it is rather lacking.I wouldn't recommend it, not even for the action. It's too average in every department."}, {"id": 5, "text": "The Doorman starring Ruby Rose as Ali in the titular role is about an ex-marine who faces off against a bunch of criminals lead by Victor Dubois (Jean Reno) attempting an art heist in an almost empty apartment building which is undergoing renovations during the easter holidays. What they didn't count on was a family being in the apartment and an ex-marine with PTSD who is related to them.The problem is that this is just another in a long line of pale Die Hard imitations where a hero faces of against criminals while trying to save people before the criminals break into a safe and do not need hostages any longer. In fact this movie has a scene where Ali kills a criminal on one of the floors undergoing renovations just like John Mclane did in Die Hard. She also tries to signal for help by setting off the fire alarms just like John Mclane did. Even when the criminals are seen disabling the alarm system one is shown as trying to do it carefully whilst the other takes a hammer and breaks everything up. In Die Hard one robber tries to be careful and the other uses a circular saw to cut the wires.There are also way too many convenient things that happen in order for the hero to be successful. There are hidden passages all over the building and her nephew knows them all for example. There is apparently an old speak easy where they hide. The teenager shouts and the 2 robbers chasing them hear him. Which makes you wonder what kind of hidden room this was if everyone could hear the noise coming from it. The robbers also make many illogical decisions. This and other inconsistencies and plot holes make this a less then stellar attempt. The acting was nothing special although the movie has good actors in it so at best it is ok for what the movie is.

Jean Reno does not do a lot of bad movies so this was really dissapointing. sure hope he does not end up like Bruce Willis. It is very clear that neither the actors or writers have ever used a drill that needs water to cool. Here a big part of the story is to get water for the drill.

Production values are better than average for similar films. The actors do as well as can be expected with the material they're provided. But the screenplay is uninspired, with far too many coincidences, contrivances, and familiar tropes. The movie seems very similar to Force of Nature (2020), starring Mel Gibson, which also suffered from far too many coincidences.Ruby Rose handles her fight scenes fairly well, but could have been replaced by a department store mannequin in some of the other scenes. Jean Reno delivers an effortless performance as the villain, which is nevertheless interesting to watch. Aksel Hennie, Rupert Evans, and Philip Whitchurch deliver credible performances. Some scenes drag; many are predictable.

I mean Ruby Rose as a lead action heroine is not a bad choice when she can pull out some believable action scenes but beside her everyone from Dan Southworth, Louis Mandylor, and Jean Reno they all acting like they don't even want to be in this movie, to be honest. There not a glimpse of Ryuhei's over the top filming style up until the final act and even it can't even save the whole goddamn movie from itself.

This is a low budget-but entertaining-female version of Die Hard. It was filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Ruby plays a Marine veteran serving on a protection detail overseas that goes badly. After being discharged, she returns to New York looking for a job. Her uncle gets her one as a doorman-actually, she should be called a doorwoman-at the hotel he works at. Rupert plays her brother in law that just happens to live in the same hotel-what a coincidence! His wife-Ruby's sister-was killed in a car accident, so Rupert is a single father to 2 kids. The hotel is being renovated so it is mostly empty-only a few couples are still in the building, including Rupert and his kids-and Jean comes looking for something that just happens to be hidden in one of the hotel's rooms. Jean brings henchmen along to help with the hunt and Aksel is in charge of them. Ruby has to take the thieves out one by one and protect her relatives in the hotel, all while looking capable of fighting men twice her size and beating them.

Immature plot and story line. Sometimes the acting is just lame. Luckily the antagonist character played by Jean Reno and Aksel Hennie save the movie from crap to mediocre. 3 types of movie for me.

Except, instead of an off duty male cop (Bruce Willis) as the main character, it is a woman as a retired marine (Ruby Rose as Ali). It is passable as an action movie, but nothing special.*** spoiler alert ***There are quite a few gratuitous politically correctness moments. For example, at the start of the movie, only Ali saw the terrorists, and her male superior quickly dismissed her concerns. All the male guards got shot fairly quickly, and she single handedly took out close to 6-7 bad guys, and was only stopped by an RPG blast. Then when the teenage boy max had a gun to the bad cop's head, and he couldn't pull the trigger (which put everyone in more danger), but Ali was proud of him.Some scenes are not logical, for example, Ali kicked 3 bad guys to the ground in the lobby, and Max grabbed their guns. But instead of just shooting the bad guys right there on the ground, Ali decided to run away, which led to hand-to-hand combat with multiple guys stronger than her later, and they almost killed her.

And I don't remember any DH rip-off with a female against the evil ones. And Jean Reno as the heavy, I had not seen this since ARMORED, back in 2010. Sorry I forgot last Spike Lee's movie, about Nam Black vets. Frenchmen are often the bad guys in American movies. DOORMAN is not a bad movie at all for this kind of cute and agreeable crap. In UNDER SIEGE, another DH rip-off, Steven Seagal was an ex Special Forces member who was a cook, here the former decorated Marines female lead character is a doorman. Very smart indeed !!! In another rip-off, the hero will be a gardener or a garbage truck driver. ha ha ha.

The fighting scenes were not bad, the plot was so so. As for the acting well let just say it wasn't Jean Renos best performance. For once he's the bad guy, but his character was rather annoying than enjoyable to watch. As for Ruby Rose I guess she can do fight scenes. I wonder what people find attractive about her though, I wouldn't touch her with a ten foot barge pool, but that's only my opinion.

The background music and sound effects are awesome. I liked the acting crew. I enjoyed watching the legend Jean Reno. He is one of the few actors who can play incredibly in different genres. For example, he was the star of the action movie 'Leon: The Professional 1994'. Also, he was the star of the comedy movie 'The Visitors 1993'. In summary, I recommend this movie to action genre fans and Jean Reno fans."}, {"id": 48, "text": "The message in Versus director Ry\u00fbhei Kitamura's contemporary crime thriller The Doorman is never judge a heroine by her looks or allure. The homicidal henchmen in this derivative rehash of the vintage Bruce Willis actioneer Die Hard (1988) learn this lethal lesson about stereotyping the hard way. When they tangle with our heroine, they're surprised she can counter their every move with guns, knives, fists, wits, and improvised explosive devices. Australian actress Ruby Rose makes you believe she could wield all these weapons, too. This multi-talented starlet has been turning heads for some time in Hollywood. Recently, she toplined the first season of the WB cable series Batwoman (2019-2020). Rose made her career debut in the short film Boys Like You (2011) and hasn't looked back. Since then, she has co-starred in the Netflix TV series about prison women Orange Is the New Black (2015) and then fielded roles opposite Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016), Keanu Reeves in John Wick, Chapter Two (2017), Vin Diesel in xXx: Return of Xander Cage (2017), and Jason Statham in The Meg (2018). Rose can play good girls as well as bad girls, and she is carving herself out a promising career.In The Doorman, Rose plays a gatekeeper at a towering, luxurious, ten-story, Manhattan apartment building. Some residents are surprised to see her negotiate the gender gap as a doorman in her long uniform coat and visored cap. Eventually, she tangles with villainous French criminal mastermind Victor Dubois (Jean Reno of La Femme Nikita) and his equally ruthless second-in-command Borz Blasick (Aksel Hennie of Last Knights), who has some surprises for both her heroine as well as Dubois' villain. Director Kitamura and his two Sky Raiders scenarists Lior Chefetz and Joe Swanson, adapting a Greg Williams and Matt McAllester story, prefer to foreshadow various events with random expository dialogue which only vigilant spectators will file away for future reference. Meantime, The Doorman shares a plot similar to the Mel Gibson melodrama Force of Nature (2020) about a murderous search for stolen Old World masterpiece paintings that vanished without a trace during World War II. The Doorman opens with a slam-bang start at the American Embassy in Bucharest, Romania. The U.S. Ambassador (Andreea Vasile of Why Me?) and her daughter Nira (newcomer Andreea Androne) leave her office and travel in an armed convoy of dark sedans to a rendezvous. The Ambassador invites U.S. Marine Gunnery Sergeant Ali Gorsky (Ruby Rose) to accompany her daughter in a separate car. As the motorcade enters a stretch of two-lane highway through a deeply wooded forest, the gimlet-eyed Gorsky spots black-clad figures scrambling stealthily alongside the road through the dappled shadows of foliage. Gorsky reports her sighting. The security escort chief doesn't spot these dastards and clears the convoy to maintain its course. Suddenly, out of nowhere, one of those phantom assailants materializes on the road with a bazooka. He sends a projectile streaking into the lead car. No sooner do the occupants see the deadly rocket soaring their way than a fireball explosion engulfs their vehicle. Chaos reigns as drivers and bodyguards alike take evasive action. More black-clad warriors emerge from the forest. Armed with assault rifles, these gunmen riddle the bodyguards with fusillades of gunfire.The camo clad Gorsky advises Nira to stay low. Gorsky exits the car, brandishes her automatic pistol like Wild Bill Hickok and takes down several assailants in their tracks with unerring accuracy. Methodically, to conserve ammo, Gorsky eliminates each terrorist with one bullet per man. She wounds another when she shoots under a car. Her slug shatters the gunman's ankles, and he crumples in pain. Meanwhile, the Ambassador dashes through a barrage of gunfire to join Nira in the rear car. No sooner has she cradled her daughter in the safety of her arms than another terrorist launches a bazooka shell. Sergeant Gorsky doesn't see this projectile as it screams overhead and obliterates the car, atomizing both the ambassador and her daughter. The impact of the explosion catapults Gorsky backward, hurling her into the woods. As soon as she slams into the dirt, Gorsky awakens from this flashback in her peaceful New York City apartment. Apparently, the sole survivor of this tragic skirmish, Gorsky has returned to America and hung up her dog tags. Mind you, she hasn't forgotten any of her ingrained gunnery sergeant skills, but she contends with PTSD as a result of this violent opening episode.Happily, Kitamura stages an exciting, slam-bang, high-octane, shoot'em up prologue which establishes Gorsky's lethal proficiency with firearms. Gorsky lands a job at The Carrington after a kind relative, Uncle Pat (Philip Whitchurch of Blue Ice), notifies her about an opening. He advises her not to mention that they are related. The Carrington's chief caretaker, snobbish Borz Blasevic, hires her on the spot while harassing her in a unisex locker room scene. He warns her the building will be closed during the Easter Holiday, so she'll have some time off. Little does Gorsky know her late sister's husband, author Jon Stanton (Rupert Evans of Tank 432) and his two children, Max (newcomer Julian Feder) and Lily (newcomer Lord Cassidy), reside on the tenth floor. Later, the Stantons invite Ali to their Easter lunch. Reluctantly, Gorsky promises to attend. While Ali is socializing with them, the evil Dubois with his gang of ruffians invades The Carrington. Dubois has come to liberate some priceless paintings one of his former colleagues had hidden within the walls. Meantime, Gorsky torpedoes Dubois' best-laid plans when they occupy the Stantons' apartment. Borz and she wade into each other kicking and screaming. Ruby Rose acquits herself athletically as a butt-kicking heroine who can take it and dish it out. Kitamura and his writers never let the pace slacken in this robust, R-rated actioneer. Altogether, The Doorman qualifies as a sizzling saga."}, {"id": 49, "text": "The doorman share the same basic elements of those old action movies.There are some fantastic fights scenes and action scenes Ruby Rose is great.The original The doorman movie are all those famous old action movies when bad becomes good all fun action movies to intertain people.Jean Reno is also great in the movie as Victor Dubois is a fun bad guy as Krieger in mission impossible and Petrovich in rollerball the audience is introduced to the hero and bad guy character with the absolute minimum on their background so it,s cool.

Terrible plot, bad fighting choreography and most likely a bad screenplay combined with what can only be awful directing.

Simply watch some UFC fights, and you will see. There is a reason they have weight classes and a 130 lb man will not take out a 180 lb man.... so how can she???Also, she is a pretty girl, but she really screwed up with all those stupid tattoos.

Sure maybe it's like Die Hard. But if you're into this genre, don't expect anything extravagantly new... just sit back and enjoy the ride.Directing by Ryuhei Kitamura was spot on, although the choreography needed more work and less choppiness. Now the writing... 4 writers - 2 nebs and 2 amateurs, and we got nothing spectacular but a bunch of cliches and a predictable story. BUT, it was still an enjoyable watch, especially with the slim-pickings available these days. The cinematography was good. The score was very fitting, and not obnoxious which is typical in B-grade films. The acting was actually good, even for the Kristen Stewart expressionless Ruby Rose. Compared to Megan Fox in Rogue, Rose actually worked for it. It was also refreshing to see the always smiling Louis Mandylor and his hilarious demeanor.I feel the critics went too hard on this one. And to those that gave it a 1/10 on here, give your heads a shake and learn how to properly rate a film (read my bio). It's not just a 1 or 10 rating, there's many numbers in between, and the production value and directing alone starts at a 4 for this one. It's a well deserving 7/10 from me."}, {"id": 82, "text": "I think Ruby Rose is a beautiful lady and I really want her to succeed in the world of movies and tv. Okay, she is no Meryl Streep but she at least has great presence. Her first project after her leaving Batwoman is this Die Hard-like action movie The Doorman. Ruby can do action flicks - that's clear. Her fighting skills are convincing. But for the rest The Doorman is a film that runs out of fresh ideas fast and suffers from a bad script.The problem with The Doorman is that it starts out rather well. Ali (Rose) is a soldier who has to protect an important ambassador's family in a foreign country and can get along fine with the young daughter. But tragedy strikes: during a routine trip the convoy with the family is attacked and everybody dies except Ali. Desillusioned and bitter she quits the army and goes back to New York where she accepts an easy job as a doorman. Too bad she picked the wrong weekend to start, because a group of thugs take control of the almost empty building. She's the only one that can take them down. That's where it all goes downhill, though. When the film is over you realize that you again were tricked into watching a bad and forgettable movie.Having seen many Die Hard inspired action films it's a good thing that we finally see a woman battling against the bad guys. Too bad the story is filled with so many illogical behaviours that as a viewer you can't take the film seriously. For instance there is a scene where Ali manages to stunn her opponents by using a fire extinguisher. She even succeeds in grabbing one of their rifles. But what happens next? Instead of taking this opportunity to shoot them to bits she just runs away.Most of the fight scenes look like Streetfighter or Tekken-like videogames: although you punch the hell out of your opponent they won't go down. That's pretty irritating. The end result of The Doorman is never in doubt. The Doorman also hasn't got the best dialogues either. There's a strange subplot as well where it is explained that Ali once had an affair with the husband of her deceased sister. Ruby Rose is so openly gay though, that for us viewers that dramatic element is hard to believe.The Doorman proves that Ruby Rose can handle action movies and can certainly handle being the lead in a film. But for her and her many fans I hope her next project will have a much better script and a much better director. Because if she's given a good script and a great director Ruby Rose can turn into a big moviestar.5/10"}, {"id": 83, "text": "Where Die Hard was funny, The Doorman is cringeworthy. Where Die Hard was visceral, The Doorman is pathetic. Where Die Hard has action, The Doorman has quick viewpoint change scenes to hide how ridiculous they are. Where Die Hard had an intelligent, pompous and scary villain, The Doorman has a stupid old Frenchman. Die Hard had a budget, The Doorman had an unused building. The acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous, the characters are cardboard and still they couldn't get them right. How can anyone fail this much?For crying out loud, there are five Die Hard movies there and the one you are trying to copy from was made in '88. You had 32 years to do it right! Ruby Rose was two years old when that movie came out! What more do you need?!Bottom line: If at least they would have gender swapped it and copied the rest this would have been a good movie. No, they had to completely mess it up. Avoid this boring unsuccessful attempt at a movie."}, {"id": 84, "text": "This action drama is a solid bet for fans of the Die Hard series, and its numerous imitators. Ruby Rose is perfectly cast as Ali - an ex-special forces soldier with PTSD that limits her career options and ability to relate to others. She settles for the best job she can find - a doorman for a high-rise New York condo. The gig quickly becomes far more complicated than most doormen will ever encounter, as it must for there to be a movie for us to savor.During a weekend when almost all the residents are out of the building for repairs and renovations, a crew of well-armed, highly-trained evildoers takes over. They're looking for something highly valuable that one of the owners is supposed to have stashed there. When the objects of their quest prove elusive, the violence begins. Ruby's Ali becomes the wild card factor, ala Bruce Willis' John McClane and a slew of others, pitted against superior forces and heavy odds. Jean Reno plays the stone-cold head of the thieves with a chilling calm worthy of any James Bond villain.The action is intense and well-paced by director Ryuhei Kitamura, who has a long resume of action flicks - particularly in sci-fi and horror. The bodies pile up in a satisfying variety of methods, including some cleverly fresh tactics. The R rating is solely for violence - and well-deserved. Rose is as attractive as other women who have taken such roles, and also looks more like she might actually have the protagonist's lethal skill set than others. Without naming names, many of those choices were made for box-office appeal rather than for appearing to have the character's toughness. Rose's cat-and-mouse course of attacks, chipping away at the enemy forces, will keep viewers' adrenaline pumping on the how of things, even though everyone knows where the story will take them."}, {"id": 85, "text": "IN A NUTSHELL: Doorman (2020) is an action thriller starring the gorgeous Ruby Rose, not to be confused with the 2018 film The Doorman. It's currently in theaters in a limited release, but is ALSO already on video-on-demand! Yay! No waiting! If you're looking for something new to watch and are interested in action, you just might like this one, although it's not really that great. It's not necessarily anything we haven't already seen before, but it'll give you some of the same vibes you get from a Bruce Willis Die Hard movie, peppered with female empowerment.TIPS FOR PARENTS: A little girl swears a couple of times, including an F-bomb.

Long before I ever knew about her, I created a video game character to look just like her! ha ha True story! Did you know she can sing too? I think I first saw her in the movie Pitch Perfect 3 where she was the sexy leader of a girl band. In this movie, she's not dolled up and looks more boyed up, like a the soldier she is. There were rumors that Katie Holmes was going to be the leading lady in The Doorman, but I've never seen her do the heavy action that this role demanded. Ruby Rose, on the other hand, was believable. I never saw her in the CW's Batwoman: The Complete First Season (DVD), although she announced she's not returning for Season 2. Batwoman made TV history as the first scripted live-action series to feature a lesbian superhero. Jean Reno plays the villain, something he's great at in many movies he does. The movie starts off with a big action scene. No sense waiting around! The movie has almost non-stop action. Some cool scene transitions. There's an interesting moment when Morse Code is used. So few people know how to communicate that way nowadays. I started learning Morse Code when I got my Ham Radio Technician's license. I found a YouTube video that teaches ham operators how to learn Morse code that you might want to check out. It's designed like a course with short lessons in each video. I'm still working on it!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Some of the acting isn't that great. The dialogue needed a lot more work. It's all super cliched and predictable, so just relax and enjoy the ride.You can watch my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.

I did enjoy your acting though, warm and sincere when needed and tough enough when required, to be almost believable... I said almost. Mr. Aksel walked a tight line between the acting and the action, and as always Mr. Reno doesn't disappoint. It's almost a shame Jean Reno did Leon: The Professional, because ever since it's all anyone can compare his performances to... It's as if we forget that his most animated scene in that movie was an awful impersonation of John Wayne. The rest of the cast pulled their weight and I was happy not to suffer through blubbering/hysterical hostages... Yes this movie has been done before, but haven't they all? This movie will pass the time without hurting your head, and if you look carefully, you might catch an homage to Reno's earlier masterclass.Watch this with your feminist significant other, and root for the good guy (er... girl... woman... female)"}, {"id": 88, "text": "The Doorman is exactly what it looks like. It's your basic cliche ex-cop/military with a troubled past in the wrong place during the wrong time redeeming herself. From the beginning to the end the film is 99% predicable, the 1% only happens when writers take a really weird step or jump over a big stretch. This happens sometimes because the elite mercs in this film are all Marv and Harry from Home Alone, and their actions rarely make any sense. They are extremely incompetent but they seem to enjoy themselves, so I guess it's fine. The film has a couple of ok action scenes and lots of bad ones. It looks like the film was salvaged from different parts and shots since some of the scenes feel very disconnected, there are some clear post-production CGI inserts and more. Since the script is all over the place, nobody besides probably Aksel Hennie is trying to act at all. I kinda felt bad seeing Jean Reno so tired and uninvested, I mean, why even bother trying to play Die Hard Alan Rickman if nobody cares. Ruby Rose looks and acts like a robot, with no real investment or emotions. So it goes. The only thing that could've saved this film was funny inventive trashy death scenes, but there's only like 1 or 2 of those, so, bad luck on this one as well. Overall, it's not interesting, funny, inventive, or intense, but it is quite harmless. If it was a bit more good bad, it would've been much more enjoyable, but in its current state - it's just 'meh'."}], "reviews_amount": 89}
