Poor casting is mostly to blame, but the script and direction are appalling. Casper Van Dien has a vague star quality about him, but is poorly cast as the baddie. The 'climatic' fight sequence is absolutely laughable. The whole film isn't quite 'so bad it's entertaining', as 'so bad it's actually verging on very bad'. Luckily for our damsel in distress, there happens to be a teenager out to rescue her who can defeat a whole squad of ex-special forces soldiers with a few punches. The funniest part of the film is where he teleports out of a building to save Erin at the last moment. Another couple of things worth mentioning is that the Director of the CIA appears to live in a tiny flat like the cheap, scummy flat I lived in when I was out of work and Ryan Phillippe seems to be about ten years older than Jack Griffo who plays his son.

Ryan Phillips does a fairly decent job despite what he was given. But the story writing was horrendous and no amount of good acting could make this movie good.Cheesy action scenes, one where they're fighting and the guy stops and to say a cheesy line and leaves by vanishing behind the doorway. He eventually comes back. It's dumb... and really bad writing.Worse is the ending, because there isn't one. Not for the judgement on the 2nd amendment and not for Ryan Phillips' character. In the end we're left with who are these guy that just showed up out of no where?There's 2nd amendment under tones in here. It was as if the writers and producers were confused with issues on gun laws. They're bad but in order to make a good movie we need guns and violence.

The 93 min runtime felt way too long with the unnecessary long dragged out and ridiculous scenes. Was this film even edited?

I couldn't help but view the main antagonist referred as the Bad Guy in the credits (Philip Nathanael) as a human version of the terminator. He makes Arnold Schwarzenegger seems like he got the acting range of De Niro by comparison. It is unintentionally humorous. It caters for the teen demographic with it having a side story of 2 teenagers that have feelings for each other but scared to make the first approach.The villains are laughable and are clich\u00e9d from the muscle, the brains of the operation, the Russian that has the most ott accent, evil British woman etc... The lead character Vic Davis (Ryan Philippe) is supposed to the commander of a delta force but he doesn't have the physique to make that believable.

Ryan, you should fire your agent."}, {"id": 25, "text": "The 2nd is a bad movie from start to finish. It's supposed to be about the 2nd amendment and the right to bear arms but this is lost in the dumb dialogue, dumber action and the fact that the motivations of most of the characters make no sense.The head of the CIA decides to kidnap the college going daughter of a supreme court judge in order to make him vote in a certain way. This is because the daughter of the CIA chief was killed by a psychotic gunman in a school shooting and this shouldn't happen again. So he has mercenaries besiege a college on the last day of term. They are led by a man called Driver played by Caper Van Dien and they have no problem killing security guards, or college students or anyone else in their way which makes no sense given their end goal. Their plot is foiled by green beret/delta force captain Vic Davies played by Ryan Phillipe who is at the college to pick up his son. There are gun fights and fist fights and explosions and the action moves to the L.A. port. The bad guys are beaten unrealistically but the CIA chief escapes and Driver ends up killing him because their benefactor wasn't happy and because three can keep a secret if the other two are dead...so does this mean that Driver is going to whack their benefactor as well or maybe himself. Also who is this benefactor mentioned in the 83rd minute of the film. The movie ends with Vic Davies being surrounded by another group of mercenaries and starting to fight them.This is a cheap action film most of which was badly acted. The plot was convoluted and unclear and the story was just plain bad and borrowed from many better movies. The actions of the characters make little sense like the college students repeatedly doing the opposite when they are told to stay somewhere and hide. The bad guys are inept and the reasoning behind everything is unclear. Definitely not recommended...watch something coherent instead."}, {"id": 26, "text": "This movie is awesome if you're looking to see how terrible a movie can be. I just couldn't stop watching.

The dialogue is weak, the story is full of holes, and the VFX is terrible. Most of the film has the worst sound design I've seen for a while. Every footstep has been added in post and it's horrible. Even the costume design is something out of a 1990 episode of Macgyver. All the bad guys (and girls), there is no continuity for who they are either dressed like a undercover secret agent (flannel shirt, cap, and glasses), or a South central crip. Casper Van Dien is dressed as the best man of a wedding, refuses to get involved until the last minute, and all the bad guys end up drinking large amounts of alcohol prior to any fight (keeping them alert).

It may sound like nitpicking, but for someone who has military experience and has seen this stuff first hand...they should at least make an effort to make it somewhat realistic.The screenplay plays out like something out of an angry ten-year old's imagination. Lots of blasting and running from the bad guys without much of a story. I can only imagine what the script actually looked like...The acting would be on par...if it had been done on purpose. But the dialog and individual acting is cringe-worthy at best. I expected a lot more out of Ryan Philippe. It's no gem, but The Shooter was a decent series in which he acted the part...believably.Lighting and sound are way off the mark.

Ryan Phillippe is using some kind of deep voice, trying to sound like Sylvester Stallone or someone like that, and that voice, coming out of a guy who is so short is extremely weird. Casting Jack Griffo in the role as the son was a huge mistake- this guy cannot act at all. Lexi Simonsen gets a pass because she hasn't acted much and probably needed the money. So we have a bunch of highly trained operatives who cannot handle a teenage drama major and a young lady, much less a former Green Beret. Again, the casting is very weak here- the highly trained enemies look like a bunch of meth heads, meat heads, and beauty queens. We see plenty of hand fighting, machine gun fire, bombs, and yes, a sword fight with a teenage girl who is actually talking trash to her adversary. The dialogue is silly- at times I could actually say the next line seconds before an actor would utter it. Anyway, I can't get this part of my life back but I hope to save others.

They didn't do the JOHN WICK realism with the gun fights (all firearms in this film have unlimited ammo!), but that can also be said in regard to 99.5% of EVERY action movie that has EVER been made. But the VAST majority (99%) of gunfire and explosions were practical / on-set, not CGI, which is super legit for a low(er) budget indy film. There's good action, good acting and a damsel in distress who is easy on the eyes. I wish that they would have addressed the back-story a bit more; maybe a flashback scene of what happened to the CIA Director's daughter being shot, which was the impetus for the entire arc of the story. And maybe a retro-montage of Phillippe's character, featuring a child-aged version of his son and the wife/mother who got murdered. The ending threw me off a bit; I'm not gonna lie. The whole story wraps up and then all of a sudden, the protagonist is inserted into a dire, life and death, situation. I realize that it leaves it open for a sequel, but it just didn't seem as cogent as it could have been. Maybe a DIRECTOR'S CUT will see the light of day that can address some of these issues?

For instance, two young people are told to STAY PUT until further notice. After all, their are killers lurking in the building, prowling the hallway. So what happens? Why, the girl notices the boy is bleeding. It's not particularly bad, but she says, nope, we have to do something right now about this. So do they stay put? Why, OF COURSE NOT! That wouldn't give the bad guys a chance to endanger or entrap them! And so this foolish boy and girl go prancing off down the hallway to get a band-aid (or some such).The fight scenes are not convincing at all.Why go on? I kept skipping ahead, trying to avoid the cringe-worthy parts, but all the parts were cringe-worthy.Again, I hate to see Ryan in this stinker, but, well, what do you do?"}, {"id": 361, "text": "I saw the cast and thought it had potential to be good. Boy was I wrong. Cringy acting, predictable plot, nonsensical scenes, no attention to detail. I was literally laughing to myself at the end of this movie.Maybe I'm a stickler, but when you make a movie and have sloppy scenes where the details dont add up you lose major points. There was a scene where Ryan Phillippe shot about 40 bullets with a hand gun in a stairway and never reloaded. One scene the son is being chased by a van while on his motorcycle. The camera shows the van doing almost 60mph and then it shows him doing only 45 mph on the bike and the van couldnt catch up. Nevermind the dead guy in the driver seat for about 2 minutes staying right on his tail on a twisting road. And there were many more like that. Just completely lazy.I dont blame the actors, I've scene a few in other stuff that was pretty good especially RP. But this was just awful for their resumes."}, {"id": 362, "text": "I only gave it two in case they toss the high and low scores out. Without a doubt one of the top five worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands..!The only non wooden character was Philippe, the rest must have been reading from cue cards.. Obviously the budget all went to the actors bank accounts and special effects, because none of it went to writing, directing or producing.. The editing was done by someone who doesn't speak English, has never seen a movie before and probably can't control their crack habit.. This is an epic fail in every facet..There are no spoilers because this whole so called movie is spoiled..This is the first review I've ever done.. That's how bad this movie is..In any facet I would be ashamed to have my name attached to this movie it is that bad.. It's so bad in every way possible I can't even offer any intelligent critique.. I'm actually in shock after that experience..If you want a real movie go watch Midnight in Paris.. You won't be sorry.. I only use that because it was the one I watched before this drivel.. I had an inkling when I saw Casper Van Dien attached to this it might be bad, but this is a whole new level of time wasted.. I always sit thru to the end of these movies to find some positive from the experience, but in this case I can positively say don't bother.. All I get is an image of everyone involved in this mess laughing when they see where the check is from.. Clearly this is the bottom of the barrel.."}, {"id": 363, "text": "Earlier this year, Netflix hit pay dirt with 'Extraction,' one of the best pure action movies to come out in 2020. Fast paced, adrenaline pumping chaos, it was a shot in the arm of high body count violence and proved the streaming giant could do homegrown action as well as the big studios.At the opposite end of the spectrum is 'The 2nd.' This one is cheap, bland and worst of all, boring. It's a badly acted rip off of 'Die Hard' that sees Ryan Phillippe playing an elite soldier who gets caught up in a plot to kidnap the daughter of a Judge. It's poorly edited, largely takes place in non-descript corridors and half the cast sound like they're reading their lines for the first time. And it features a scene where a teenager with a gunshot wound manages to take down a mercenary in close quarters combat.Phillippe does his best but this is not a good movie. His relationship with his son is entirely unconvincing and the only other person he has any chemistry with gets killed in the first five minutes. Worst of all, the fight scenes are awful. The climactic warehouse shoot out is passable, but the rest are shockingly subpar. One scene with Phillippe taking on two henchmen at once looks like it was filmed in a large dumpster and another features him magically teleporting across a college campus to take on a sniper. Then there's the van-riding car chase, which manages to make getting shot in the head look painless and seems to be taking place at about 18mph.Not even Casper Van Dien playing against type as his indestructible nemesis can save this unbelievably mediocre film. 'The 2nd' is uninvolving and commits the cardinal sin of action films; it's boring.And that's without getting into the morally dubious side. It's called 'The 2nd' because it revolves around The 2nd Amendment and while it doesn't explicitly state which side of the debate it falls upon, it does hint pretty heavily that the lead-villain has masterminded his scheme because his daughter was killed in a school shooting. And if that was what motivated Hans Gruber, even John McClane would have to admit he kinda had a point.Skip this, watch 'Extraction' again."}, {"id": 364, "text": "I am deeply disappointed. This movie is a perfect example of how to ruin the reputation of otherwise good actors. Sorry guys.Did this movie have a director at all? Did they get paid?The script or lack thereof..I what reality does the hand guns have unlimited amounts of bullets?A highly trained operative discharges his weapon into a wall multiple times? When I did weapons training in the military we were told to save on the ammo and only fire on actual targets, which I have never seen in any TV show or movie - ever.Don't get me started on the fights - in what reality can a single person receive that amount of injuries, and still manage to walk away from it?My best guess is that the writers got their ideas from watching low quality action movies. How anyone can pay good money for this piece of cut and paste script is beyond me.I sincerely hope that the executive producers got at least some of their money back.Sorry - even one star is to much."}, {"id": 365, "text": "Please don't bother with this movie.There is so much ham (acting) you could feed a town lovely sandwiches for a week.Ryan Phillippe has been in some good stuff but as exec producer and lead in this... it just doesn't work.Bad edits throughout... daytime to nighttime happens in seconds... driver wearing a green tee shirt when shot from the back but a black one when shot from the front... loads of bad continuity.Casper Van Dien is responsible for a lot of the ham along with Richard Burgi in his (very) ill fitting suit as the Director of the CIA.Don't waste the 1 hour 33 minutes that this movie takes up. Go and do something interesting instead. Seriously."}, {"id": 366, "text": "What's the worst part of this? Oh so many choices! Acting, casting, writing, directing, production values, sound effects, sound track, stand-ins, dialogue. Too many choices! They're all so bad it hurts.From the over-botoxed steroid-popping 40yo Supreme Court judge and his 60yo boob job whisky chugging wife to the CIA agent in a mandarin collar and vest lol to the carpeted university gym the size of a small accountant's office to the Ritz Carlton hotel room with polyester curtains that don't reach the floor to the dopey college son Shawn who's about 28. Astonishing.But we had a good laugh watching it, excruciating as it was.If you're looking for a movie to rip apart on every conceivable level this is it.Ryan Phillippe deserves better."}, {"id": 367, "text": "I am giving this 2 stars only because I can't give anything Ryan Phillipe is in less than that... but really there is so many awful things in this film that it slides between barely watchable to totally unwatchable most of the way through.Here is what i think happened. Hollywood producers who more often then not are terribly shallow, and unoriginal see that John Wick is a huge success. John Wick's 'formula' in these Hollywood producers's eyes being....* bank-able star, able to pull off action movies * a script that is really 90% about the action, and bad a--ery of the main character * mix in a great 2nd camera/stunt coordinator action director - make him the director to focus on action for 90% of the film. * add in a reason to kill many tough bad-guys - killed his dogThe issue is that the didn't pay Ryan Phillipe to train to be an extreme bad --- for months ahead of time. They clearly don't get that not all stunt coordinates/2nd camera guys are capable of directing. They don't have any idea why John Wick is a good script and this one is completely unoriginal. Ryan Phillpe's can't turn bad dialogue into gold, perhaps if one scene is not great in an otherwise brilliantly written film then a good actor can carry that one scene, or two, but when the entire film is garbage, garbage in and garbage out even with the best actors.Finally the cinematography is like it was shot on an iphone 3. What the heck is with the soap opera effect doubled down.Clearly this is what happens when people with no talent, and no ability to understand the different between good dialogue and terrible dialogue, between good cinematography and one of the worst films for cinematography i have seen in a very long time, and as any good film making knows, your good guy is only as great as his enemy. If the enemy is a wimp it makes the hero seem weak as well. If the antagonist is the most bad --- opponent ever, and the hero beats him up, it is now interesting.Could go on for a long time all the faults in this movie, but clearly i have already wasted to much time on it already. Only watch this movie if you are interested in film studies and are looking at films that are big time failures..."}, {"id": 368, "text": "Firstly reading the negative reviewers here I noticed a lot of repeat language and phrasing. Many at least 75% of the hyper negative reviewers are single use accounts meaning someone has an obsession with negatively reviewing and has created a lot of shill accounts. So let's get to this film. People need to understand it is part of a genre: fight-action film. It is better than average within that genre, which tends to have stretched even outlandish plot, middling quality dialogue, lower end effects, and average at best acting. To whine and cry about that is no different than whining about realism in a marvel comic based film. We ALL suspend disbelief and accept flaws in genres we like. Shakespeare is chock full of anachronisms and unbelievable characters as well. For what people look in that genre, good fighting, ground fighting, etc., this actually above average. If you look around social media on the net there are MMA fighters who rate this film very well and that speaks to the audience this is aimed at. So I suppose people who expected a reprise of Ryan Phillippe's roles in Cruel Intentions or Gosford Park (I enjoyed the later myself) are disappointed. That seems to be the bulk of the bad reviews. Otherwise -- for this genre, a fight vehicle film -- this film is not bad at all, well above average."}, {"id": 369, "text": "DIE HARD was made over 32 years ago and still is one of the best action thrillers ever made. However if you look closely it was a reasonable budget movie; no top stars (Bruce Willis was just starting his movie career) Godunov was famous as a dancer but not as an actor and Rickman was virtually unknown in USA. The secret of the movie was great casting, great writing, outstanding direction and edition. Sadly aside from a decent casting and a couple of interesting ideas, nothing else is present in The 2nd. A DIE HARD wannabe as many others that fails miserably (as many others). Ryan Phillips is good as DELTA FORCE Major Davis trying to save his son and a Supreme Court daughter of a group of killer / kidnappers. He moves very well in his action scenes; but sadly most of the action is so bad filmed and worse edited that his efforts are for nothing. Casper Van Dien does mostly that he always does but he is the bad guy now. He is good but his character's writing does not give him any time to show his charisma and skills. Jack Griffo is surprisingly good as the, not defenseless, Davis 's son. He does a few fights quite good and his comedy skills and sympathy keeps the mood up even when his characters is full of cliches. In terms of action scenes, only some fights are worth. Shooting , car chases and explosions are too cheap made and poorly edited. The few interested ideas are never exploited (young boys romance, political issues, Constitution changing, comedy ); plus an unexpected ending. It is a pity because the movie could have been far far better with a more skilled director."}, {"id": 370, "text": "Sean Davis (Jack Griffo) has a crush on his classmate Erin Walton (Lexi Simonsen). It's the Christmas holidays and everybody is clearing out of the campus. Sean and Erin are the last two students. He is getting picked up by his father Vic Davis (Ryan Phillippe) who is secretly a Delta Force leader. She is the daughter of a Supreme Court Judge and is waiting for her Secret Service driver. Instead, she is met by a replacement driver (Casper Van Dien) who turns out to be a leader of a CIA hit team sent to kidnap her and coerce her father on a 2nd Amendment ruling.The Judge and the CIA chief can be all cut out. I don't know anything about the actor who plays the Judge. He seems to be a producer in his day job. He needs to stick to that because he's a really bad actor. Neither character is truly necessary. The premise is the kidnapping. The minutia of the reasoning is besides the point. As for the other actors, most of them are fine. Phillippe and Van Dien are doing solid work. The girl is a little better than the boy. The crew of bad guys is filled with some less than threatening actors. There are multiple issues with the writing. While I like the general premise, this movie is held back by a countless list of little issues. My best guess about this movie is that they have a halfway decent fight coordinator but not much else. The gun action is functional and the car action is inferior. This thing is a B-movie at best."}], "reviews_amount": 371}
