A really fresh movie without a vanilla ending. There are only a few who get to achieve their dreams, rest make compromises with their situations.This movie is not about those role-models successful people who seldom exist in societies, this movie is about those uncountable number of people who see dreams and but couldn't realize their dreams. Someday somewhere they make a pact with their fate and let themselves flow with the current."}, {"id": 3, "text": "One of the best and well written movie i have watched..a pure cinema where content is the actual driving force and you laugh at the situation and you feel for the characters , smart use of music in the situation and music is like the cherry on the cake for some of the situations"}, {"id": 4, "text": "DON'T MISS IT! 'Kanpuriye' which revolves around the lives of people who struggle to come in town and make a living. The movie is about that bittersweet moment in our collective lives that define who we become. Perfect light hearted comedy which definitely should have been released on big screen. Definitely deserves 2 hrs of your lives. Munna bhai did it again flawlessly. Vijay and Aparshakti both did seamlessly. Acting, direction, plot were 9/10. This movie is for all. Made under the charm of Kanpur."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Well finally I watched this movie and I must say amazing job done by all the actors.
