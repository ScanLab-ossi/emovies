But the plot felt forced by the end and it veered into an average movie. It lacked effective scares and a sense of dread that I like in a witch movie and the antagonist was not as frightening as I would have liked.I don't regret watching it, but I was hoping for more."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Obviously a lower/ smaller budget, but unlike others, it both looks &amp; sounds excellent; there's obviously very competent production in all departments here.Lovely opening &amp; the story skips right along, no annoying teen heavy story here, even though they are present &amp; in lead roles, noticing what the 'stupid' old people aren't.With competent &amp; engaging performances all around from what seems like mostly 'newbies', successful &amp; unusual monster effects, creepy moments &amp; no unnecessary jump scares, you'll find very little to complain about. There is a back story, with the lead discovering our particular witch online, however this could have been expanded, to make a more engaging story. A further improvement would have been to spend a few more dollars on the soundtrack, but it's mostly unobtrusive &amp; effective, if a little generic.The denouement was twist-less but a nice little automotive surprise &amp; the final floral question mark was delicious.Serious gore/ horror fans may find this too light, but it was certainly enough for this devotee of the supernatural."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This movie is actually pretty good, unlike some of the other no-name horror movies popping up around the same time (1BR, The Lodge, The other lamb). This one is hardly original, but it's got a lot of throwbacks - 80's vibe, and is Well shot with above par FX, And convincing no-name actors). It's got it's own, not always welcoming, twist ending, which worked in this case for the better. It's really a pretty decent horror/comedy flick that doesn't take itself too seriously, looks good on screen, and keeps your attention throughout. I enjoyed it."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I really enjoyed this one, the plot is quite simple but intriguing and thoroughly engaging. The visual and sound effects were perfect and the acting was good.

It's your classic I think my neighbor is a ____ with the mix of teen romance and family drama. It isn't an intellectual horror as this is a saturated genre, but it was fun to watch an updated version of the genre movies I love (fright night, the lost boys, etc). Like those films, they aren't perfect but they have there strengths as well as weaknesses. The creepiness was decent, but it was never very scary. It did a good job of slowly introducing the monster and building suspense. One thing I disliked was that the subplots failed to go below surface level so looking back they felt like a waste of energy - should have focused on only one along with the main story. However, the production was fantastic and you could tell they knew what they were doing. Actors were fine, but nothing to write home about.Real rating: 6.3 (given a 7 because I feel the current score of 5.8 is bit too low)"}, {"id": 12, "text": "Didn't expect a lot but this was a solid low budget film with a good twist."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Some creepy moments, a decent enough &amp; intriguing story idea, and likable (albeit standard) characters keep you watching, but too many horror movie cliches, insufficient background on the nature of the creature/ demon/ whatever-it-is, and an uninspired ending knock the wind out of this one.

I am not certain what to think of this film to be honest. Overall, yes, it is a horror film and a unique story. But I have a thing against what they call a teenage horror film. Somehow these films don't do it for me.Overall, the acting was mediocre as well. The make up person of the monster, you are the reason I don't hate this film. Hats off to you.Would I watch it again? No. Would I make my friends watch it? No."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Wouldn't be fair to score this film as I only gave it 20 min to see if it was worth my time. It wasn't.

I'll just look at the stack of bills piled up beside me, far more terrifying than this dud."}, {"id": 18, "text": "The Wretched is a very well made horror movie. It's about a teenager called Ben who upon visiting his father during the summer becomes convinced that his next door neighbour has been replaced by a powerful witch who eats children. Getting anyone to believe him is not easy as she has the power to make people do her bidding and also to make them forget their loved ones who have disappeared.Overall the acting is good although some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more. Ben as the main character comes across as relatively unlikable in the beginning but then again he is a 17 year old teenage guy so maybe that was on purpose. He does experience character growth though which I feel was best exemplified when he tries to save a little girl that he sees being taken by the witch. There is some blood and gore in certain scenes but it doesn't go overboard like some horrors tend to. Overall The Wretched is a well made suspensful horror with a plot twist that wasn't obvious until the end. It deserves a 6.5-7 out of 10."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Fun ride a couple good scares. Mostly I loved the script. Good Writing. Good story. Couple twist and turns I didn't see coming and I watch a lot of horror. Definitely one to check out."}, {"id": 20, "text": "This movie had potential. It's quite well made with beautiful shots and the special effects are good. Just a little too much teenage drama for my taste. Ditching a family dinner for a party, getting drunk, late night swimming in the pool, bullies pranking the new guy... For a moment there I thought I was watching The O.C. But if you are willing to ignore all the stupid teenageers doing teenagers stuff - it's an alright movie.With that said - I can not get over the fact that the husband next door was so CLUELESS. His wife was a beer-drinking, boots-wearing rocker girl. He comes home one night after work to find his wife standing outside the neighbours house. She is wearing a long summer-dress, perfect make up and high heels with her hair perfectly flowing around her shoulders. His son is hiding in the neighbours house and he is clearly terrified for some (not so) mysterious reason. And what does this clueless man do? He takes his son home and tucks him in bed. A normal person would at least think hey, this is a bit odd. Wifey is acting stranger than usual.And that dog scene at the lake was just uncalled for."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Film was ok but reminded me so much of fright night back in the day"}, {"id": 22, "text": "THE WRETCHED is another example of a low budget digital horror flick with a supernatural plotline. It's similar to many other stories with rural settings, focusing on small scale family drama for much of the running time and as such not being very interesting when it comes to holding the viewer's attention. The film is a little better shot than most and the supernatural elements of the plot, when they do finally emerge, bring to mind the likes of THE EVIL DEAD with a demon hiding inside the skin of a human. In the end, the lack of characters to truly care about sinks this one as it does so many others."}, {"id": 23, "text": "You would never think this movie was a low budget project because the settings and location was perfect. .Just wish the writers would've added more dramatics and suspense besides relying on the edited music to keep viewers awake."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Bad movie. This movie is cursed by bland, wooden mediocrity. Actors are dressed and behave like stolen Old Navy mannequins.

Soundtrack sounds like a completely royalty-free album called Orchestral Fear and Fright Shiver Tingle #100 The actors should return to their original jobs, which was presumably doing adverts for JC Penney's or camping gear magazines.

So when I finally saw this film pop up on VOD, my mom and I decided to rent it! It was an ok movie the first half but nothing special, other than 1 or 2 short scary moments. Then the last 20 minutes or so it definitely amped up the horror aspect! I loved the twist that came towards the end with the main character, I didn't see it coming which I really liked. I also thought the witch character got a lot scarier at the end. I'd wished the first half had been less of a free form/abc family teen show and more horror like the last half! If it had followed the scarier tone through the entire movie , like the the last half of the movie, it could have been so amazing and a new horror classic. Overall, still decent horror/thriller."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Slow, I had to fast forward several times .F ound the acting wooden and didnt engage with anyone.The creature effects total maybe 30 seconds divded into 5 second moments through out the over long run time .Nothig new here,and as usual with so many horror today the ending is a scapegoat ."}, {"id": 28, "text": "And then the opening credits start to roll and it's down hill from there.

Anyway, this film was horrific. It was 95 minutes of nothing. There was no plot. Scenes did not last over a minute and did not set the next seen up, so you had no clue of how things happen or where new people came from.. The acting was stale. There was no build up because there was nothing to build up to. I have seen many wretched horror films in my lifetime and this ranks high up there with them. The Pierce brothers should quit before they get further behind. So in conclusion, watched it or don't watch it. I don't care. You can agree with my review or not. I don't care about that either. It's just my opinion."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I had high hopes for this film because it started off well. It wasn't too long though before I was asking myself, did a 12 year old write this ? Why is there minor nudity and some curse words in a movie aimed at children ? It is aimed at children , I assume ? Was this made in Canada because they are known for their mediocre film making ? It could have been a good movie if it just weren't all over the place, with too many characters, too many unexplained and never explained happenings , shots that didn't make sense, entire scenes that were nothing more then filler. I can understand character development and John-Paul Howard is excellent in the lead, but he's given so many nonsense and non-essential scenes to work with that it just kills what's suppose to be a horror movie. On so many levels this movie just does not work. Everything about it is generic horror movie in the worst possible way. It's 2020 and this movie plays like made for TV horror from 1972."}, {"id": 31, "text": "What a snooze. Everything in this movie felt borrowed. No originality to be found, just the same of witch story. I think we've had enough of the twitchy evil girl thing. Characters were dull, and often seemed to have no motivation, even the witch. Story development was terrible. Nothing was explained, just horror trope after horror trope. So many questions left, yet by the end you won't even care. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and this one had little value and was just barely entertaining. I really liked the creature design but was left wanting for more. Camera work was dull, relying constantly on the old out of focus background. Cliche...dull... skip it."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Don't waste your time, watch anything but this garbage. I can relate to any genre, even look past a little bad acting but the story is god awful. A good thriller or horror movie must have some small semblance of reality in it, not a bunch of 30-40 year old tropes! This isn't a horror or a thriller, it's a bad joke. I can't believe anyone rated this above a 1."}, {"id": 33, "text": "This would be a solid horror film of which every part of you have seen already several times, there is nothing unique to be found here, that is marred by a terrible case of characters stopping their conversations immediately, so the plot can continue as it does. It is cheap and completely unrealistic, where obvious and blatant followups should be happening for characters saying statements, followups which would halt the movie's story. But instead, we have abrupt, nonsensical ends to people talking and onto the next scene, which should be a different outcome scene, if they had logically said anything. Otherwise, the cast is great, they have charisma and screen presence, it's a fun horror that will leave you disappointed because it feels and looks good, but it's very half baked, it's the curse of the same people writing AND directing, no different set of eyes on the project. The music is mostly distracting, as it's mildly off and too present in scenes, as if someone suddenly turned a CD on in the scene. It's worth a watch, but frustrating in the end for the missed marks."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Another pseudo horror movie with annoying teen actors. Only a waste of time, a movie that only worsened my depression during these pandemic times."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Many may find this film seen it all before, What sets it apart is quality camera cinematography. The sound was good as well. This is not the norm for low budget movie. The main young male actor was very good, Has a bright future ahead of him if continues as actor.

No aliens this time though. To be more precise, first the movie is dull, then it gets stupid. Though that would probably sum up just about half of all horror movies.I always moan that there aren't enough horrors about witches, and this has a witch in it. Sort of. Problem is, this witch is just another boring changeling, so not really a witch. So instead of an interesting witch movie we have a standard monster flick. With teens. Annoying teens.The plot is too drawn out, and fairly predictable. I have no issue with slow plots, as long as the movie is stylish. This is nothing of the like; it's a bland, commercial film, completely formulaic. It can't afford to drag. Arty films can drag. (And often not even they.) This is anti-arty. It's piffle. The pace picks up only after the half-way mark by which time I am so bored I have zero interest in any of this.One review says that the protagonist is likable. And that's why you just can't trust reviews that aren't mine. The main character is a thief and fairly thick. But I guess that's who kids identify with nowadays. The Kanye Generation likes their thieves and buffoons.The flick takes plenty of liberties with logic, especially in how it makes things way too convenient and easy for the witch. Like that amazing witch-friendly timing when the protagonist attacks the black woman in the kitchen, then gets interrupted just as she hides her identity. Really dumb. Or the main teen character getting attacked by the generic alpha teen thug just as he is about to try to save a young girl.Essentially, this must be the luckiest witch in the world. With that kind of luck she doesn't even need to be smart; she could literally be Miley Cyrus and still win every battle. Suffice it to say, the last half-hour is just one cheap plot-device after another. The movie actually even lies to us about the teen not having a brother, just to use this as a far-fetched plot-twist later on. One would assume that if the witch had the teen hypnotized all along to forget his own brother that then she'd have also thrown in a slave spell in that empty head of his too, so he doesn't go on a witch hunt, so he doesn't become a nuisance to her. The movie treats the audience like a crab biomass, which is of course logical, now that the horror film audiences consist mostly the Kanye Generation.With the kind of power - and luck - this witch has, how come she didn't become the next Hitler or Stalin or Obama by now?The less said about the teen's love-interest the better. I mean, come on. She could pass off as Pauly Shore's girlfriend, but anything higher than that is really stretching it. Still, how ironic that she utters the legendary line: it seems nepotism is alive and kicking. Yeah, Disney Channel girl: you and your 4 siblings know all about nepotism. You're all in movies."}, {"id": 37, "text": "Don't believe the reviews above 4. This movie is terrible and makes absolutely no sense.

Yup, we should bear in mind that making any film is surprisingly hard work. But all the same, this film really isn't worth your time and yet has been wildly overrated by some.You can easily find a better one to waste 90 minutes on. If you insist on seeing it, though, get ready for a tedious set up, a token introduction to the supernatural thing and workaday bloodletting at best. In short, it should have been a lot better."}, {"id": 50, "text": "The Wretched is the kind of horror movie you're hoping to find when you browse through the indie titles on your streaming service. It's well directed, well acted, with great creep factor and some effective scares. We get a cold open set in the mid '80s to give the viewer a solid sense of what kind of monster we're in for, then a fast forward to the present time. There is a clue in this first present day scene that lets you know that (spoiler!) you are watching a rewind. The reason for that is stated fairly early on when Ben, the protagonist, starts investigating the weird neighbor lady next door. It's not until late in the film that you get that picture again and realize why Ben is going through a rewind, and boy was it a good twist. If you're going to try a twist after The Sixth Sense, it should be this good. All of the sudden some eccentric moments earlier in the film make sense. Overall this is a very effective horror movie about a child-eating forest demon thingy. The movie summary calls it a witch, but this creature doesn't seem to have ever been human. It just likes wearing humans when it needs to blend in, which makes for some unsettling moments when you don't know if who you're looking at is really who you're looking at. The characterizations are all frustrating because you like the characters, but they're up against something outside of human ken. For instance, Ben is smart but vulnerable to peer pressure. Mallory is bold but doesn't always think through her actions before committing them. The movie has great pacing and some clever visuals. If anything, it could have used a bit more of a wrap up. We never found out for sure what happened to a few characters. It's implied but not stated. I guess they left a few things open for a sequel."}, {"id": 51, "text": "Well I won't go so far as to say the name of the film is an accurate description for it, but for horror fans, the story is entirely lacking. It certainly wasn't nearly as terrifying or demonic as the title or DVD cover suggests. It borrows elements from a lot of other horror movies like It and Evil Dead, so in that respect, originality and creativity are missing. There was only one semi-jump scare which didn't budge this viewer, and it had a by the numbers feel for getting from start to finish. It was hard to gain any sympathy for the principal characters as well, which when you add up all the negatives, the picture isn't readily recommended unless you're a true completist for this kind of stuff. That ending scene was somewhat ambiguous with Mallory (Piper Curda) vacantly gazing off into the distance while Ben (John-Paul Howard) contemplates the fake flower just prior.

It has a good set up for a horror film.In the first scene a teenage girl goes to a house to babysit. She hears some ruckus down in the basement &amp; walks down to investigate. She sees what appears to be a woman cradling a young child. Upon further examination, she discovered that the woman had murdered the child. The teenager runs &amp; attempts to escape but as expected the door is shut just before she can reach it &amp; blood curdling screams ensue.We follow a socially awkward teenager called Ben who works for his dad. He suspects that his neighbour's wife is possessed by some ancient witch. She befriends a girl called, Mallory, who secretly has a crush on him &amp; obviously to which is obvious... The witch has the power to make people forgot their child after they are taken...The film borrows elements from classic horror films like Disturbia, the Vvitch, IT, the Grudge, the Faculty. It has the potential to be classic horror film but like assembling a jigsaw puzzle it ends up with a few missing pieces &amp; in other words it is never truly realised.I would say it is enjoyable and I like the chemistry between the two leads. The film is more of a teenage horror element. The problem with this film is that you see the witch far too early on in this movie rather than showing glimpses of her &amp; have the big reveal at the end. I can honestly say that I did not find it scary at all. It follows the Hollywood Horror formula of the over reliant of jump scares."}, {"id": 62, "text": "This is a typical horror. Once again we are faced with a monster that never dies. Following same storyline in every single horror movie ever, a teenage boy who no one believes is telling the truth until the last 30 minutes of the movie. This film is full of cliche jump scares and a not so scary witch making it all abit dull. Wouldn't really recommend unless your into watching the same thing over again."}, {"id": 63, "text": "This was a bit of Fright Night mixed in with Don't Look Now. I'm surprised, in fact, to see it's current IMDB rating is only 5.8. This deserves nothing less than 7, and perhaps more if you're a fan of 80s Horror.The plot was solid, the acting great and everything made sense. I disagree with a previous reviewer who said the ending was rushed. It was meticulously crafted and all the plot threads came together culminating in a deliciously wicked twist. I highly recommend this to all horror aficionados."}, {"id": 64, "text": "One of the few films to actually play on the big screen in the last few months makes its way to disc this week. Not so much indoor big screens but the drive-ins across the country that have opened allowing people to get out and enjoy a movie while at the same time practicing social distancing. It's only natural that the movie is a horror flick since those have been a staple of drive-ins since they began. Hopefully those screens allowed it to get completely dark before they began running THE WRETCHED.After a short and incredibly creepy set up taking place 35 years ago we fast forward to the present. Teenager Ben (John-Paul Howard) is coming to spend the summer with his father Liam (Jamison Jones). With issues not discussed yet and his parents in the midst of a divorce he ends up working for his father at the marina he manages. There he meets Mallory (Piper Curda) and they become friends. He also notices Sara (Azie Tesfai) getting close with his father.At their house Ben sees the family next door, a young couple with a baby and a young son named Dillon (Blane Crockarell). Dillon and his mother Abbie (Zarah Mahler) hit a deer on the way home and she decides to keep it for the meat, taking care of dressing down the deer. But something isn't quite right about the animal. During the night the deer opens from the incision she made and a pair of slimy strange shaped fingers work their way out from the insides of the deer.As viewers we're aware of what's happening. The creature is the same one seen in the opening segment of the film and Ben later discovers that this is a 1,000 year old witch who comes from beneath a tree. She somehow has the ability to remove all memory of those she takes to her lair to eat leaving those left behind without a clue that their loved ones are even missing.Ben tries to help Dillon but runs afoul of Abbie, now taken over but the witch. After Dillon disappears he can find no one who will believe him that he even existed, including Dillon's own father. With a past history of making poor choices, the reason he is there with his father for the summer as well as wearing a cast, even Liam refuses to listen to him.As his life is placed in danger as well as those he loves around him Ben must do something to solve this problem. With no one believing him, with the witch having he ability to simply whisper in the ear of someone and to control them, this is no easy task. Worse yet is a secret that Ben doesn't even realize until near the end of the film, one that will catch the viewer by surprise as well.The movie is a nice combination of teen film and horror that works on all cylinders. The scares are there and made effectively so by the special effects department that brings this creation to life in the most spine chilling way possible. For me this creation was one of the best creatures I've seen in some time, one that made my skin crawl as well as hoping I never confronted such a thing. Kudos to the effects team behind this.But that's not the only thing that makes the movie work. To find actors, especially young actors, that can make their characters believable is rare. All of them on hand here do an amazing job. They are the focus here rather than the adults with the exception of Mahler. That combination of teen angst, anger at parents in the midst of a divorce and a youthful inquisitiveness makes for perfect performances.Credit also has to go to the directors of this film, brothers Brett and Drew Pierce. Also responsible for the story they've brought out a new nightmare inducing story and creature that ranks up there with the best. One can only wonder what this film would have done business wise in regular theaters with a decent ad campaign. As it is word of mouth from those who watch it should make it a healthy amount back on disc.The movie was one that I rented but after watching it I think I might have to add it to my shelves. I know I could watch it again, in the dark, and still find plenty of moments to enjoy. Better yet have over the niece and nephews that need a good scare and this one might do the trick."}, {"id": 65, "text": "A Well executed classic type horror.

I was pleased to see some good horror without crossing the gore porn or Torture Porn lines that so many needlessly do these days. A REAL GOOD QUALITY slasher or horror movie doesn't need those things.The ending act of the film threw me in a good way.

The main story was quite good, with a fine amount of decent scares and great special effects; especially seeing the witch crawling out-off some-one's body was awesome. The acting was overall surprisingly good, with John-Paul Howard convincingly playing the endearingly cute but also brave central character Ben.I did have a few reservations though. The pace was a bit uneven: a few very exciting and high-paced scenes were alternated with others where nothing much happened, which brought the movie several times to a bit of a standstill, it even occurred in the middle of the climactic scene in the witches tree-lair.Another of my reservations concerns some of the storylines. The broken arm didn't seem to have any relevance to the story whatsoever, I couldn't help thinking that actor Howard surprised everyone of the crew on the first day of shooting with his plaster cast and they had no choice but to write it into the story. The strange innuendo early in the movie, when dad asks Ben if they maybe can talk about the cause of the broken arm and Ben says: I rather not, didn't really help. The same thing goes for the lame prank that some kids play on Ben, ending up with him naked in the pool - it came a bit out of no-where and didn't lead up to anything.The plot-shift however, pivotal and decisive to the story, was nicely done and a real surprise (anyway, to me), in spite of the - in hindsight - clever foreboding of it in a casual remark of Ben's mother through the telephone.

Visual quality as a film is good, leaps and bounds above some other ones out there, but there is nothing that made it stand out as a good or even above average movie.

The lead character was one of the least interesting, There just needed to be a scene or two with his background and motivations developed a little more. Other than that, the creature was the real thing! This really felt like a fairy tale come to life. It didn't need to wrap everything up in a tidy bow and explain everything.

Overall I would recommend watching this. Easy to follow and easy to get into."}, {"id": 152, "text": "The opening scene skips five days into the future from the chronological start of the film. So, after this scene, the film jumps back to five days earlier, and progresses the plot with a linear timeline. If this scene was shown in the correct order of events, it would have been more horrific and effective. The audience would have known the stakes involved, making the scene more shocking and emotional. By showing this scene out of order, the audience now knows how most of the plot will progress. This diminishes the stakes and tension from most of the film, and drastically reduces any possible suspense.One scene. Adding that one scene at the beginning of the film really doesn't help the narrative. Was it the directors or editors choice? I suspect it was a producer who wanted to shock the audience right from the first scene. It was a bad choice. Worse than that, it's an obvious bad choice that's been done in film and television for decades. Showing the big bad in the first scene of a horror film is a narrative choice that rarely works out. It's tragic how such a destructive editing choice is in the final cut.For instance, there's a short scene with Abbie, the mother walking down the stairs and standing behind her son, Dillon while he watches TV and eats cereal. It's a tense scene with clever cinematography. It's followed by a cut, and scene transition to a bucket of blood being thrown out at the docks in the following scene. The blood would have been effective foreshadowing, but because of the first scene, it now feels heavy handed. We already know what the mother is, and have a strong suspicion what will happen to Dillon too. So that tense scene with Abbie and Dillon, isn't really that terrifying now. This is just one example of how the opening scene damages most of the film.It's a shame about that opening scene, because the rest of the film is above average in everything else it does. Lots of creative, attention to detail writing and directing techniques are used. It does a good job of show, don't tell. With lots of subtle, but very poignant touches that really flush out the characters, motivations, and plot. Some great examples are the first shot after the credits, the Nathan twist, and the final three scenes including the final shot. The film is really efficient at utilizing visual clues to tell it's story. I also appreciate how serious the film takes itself within it's own universe.Characters act and react in believable ways, adding to the audiences immersion. A few examples of Ben's behaviour just to illustrate the point. When Ben tells Dillon to stay away from the hole in the decks under-skirting. Or how Ben gives Dillon a Popsicle if he promises to tell him if he sees anything weird. And finally, how Ben takes off his shoes to sneak through his house quietly, only to find Dillon hiding in his room. There are dozens of such examples in this film, and having characters take their situation seriously gets the audience to do the same thing too. This is important in any film, but mandatory for a horror film to be effective. Little things matter. I really wish the opening scene wasn't included, because this film does so many other things right."}, {"id": 153, "text": "The Wretched is a Horror movie in which we watch a teenager going to stay at his dad house for a while and he soon finds out that something is wrong with the behavior of his dad neighbor.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot, it was creepy and it was consisted of plenty of suspense.

I then saw it was also receiving some great reviews from people that were at fall festivals it was shown at. I have always been looking for a witch themed film like this but had always been let down by blown potential of past films which I'm sure everyone can guess what those obvious titles were...Honestly this film finally scratched the itch i had for a vicious witch tale with excellent makeup/practical effects and an extremely creepy atmosphere. It also isn't afraid to show viewers actual visuals of the main terrifying entities we've read or heard about for ages. The story also has a relative coming of age kind of feel to it with the main character that reminded me of many horror films of the 80's and made it more charming and fun. There were even some well placed sprinkles of comedy throughout that showed the film didn't have to take itself as serious or pretentious as some other films with same subject matter have.Direction wise the camerawork is also very crisp and very well done, and the SFX add a lot to the experience. What really shines as i already mentioned, is the extreme attention to detail in the makeup/practical effects realm. To make a great creature/feature horror film, these are integral. To see a film in 2020 utilize that good old fashioned practical craft over CGI effects is very commendable and refreshing.There are some moments that many will find cliche, and a few twists that may seem a bit unnecessary, but few and far between when considering how well done this lower budget film ends up finishing. Overall it's a fun throwback and a very straightforward horror film that gives the visual goods and the ominous feel that should come with its subject matter."}, {"id": 168, "text": "I'm not sure was it the buzz going around before the release or what, but right off the bat I can say that, among other emotions, I'm also pretty disappointed. The Wretched is a reasonably well made horror movie, has all the typical makings of one - including a story that's pretty much put together of multiple familiarities, portions of Fright Night, The Witch, Rear Window (or Disturbia, if You will), plus some body horror, and a kind of 80's feeling that seems to have stayed more of a goal than an achievement. Overall, The Wretched comes across as... fundamentally basic.There's a story, and it flows evenly, it entertains, accompanied by a romp of characters, decent gore and cinematography. The problem is, it does so on a surface kind of level. The Pierce brothers utilize a wide selection of familiar tropes, ordinary devices and old tricks, perhaps trying to weave together something new, but ending up just uninspired. The plot follows a teenage boy who's struggling with his parents divorce, and has come to spend some time with the father, but life gets complicated when he notices something weird going on in the neighbor's house. An old, evil witch has come out the forest to mess around. Everything that can happen, will happen, love interest, conflicts with town bullies, conflicts with father and his new girlfriend, and other plotlines go where one would expect to as well. The characters are not the best ones to get behind for, and the evil presented lacks real dread and character Overall there's just no real delving in the psychology of what's happening, fear or mystery. However, everything works, but on a basic level, a kind of a flat line. Performances were okay all around, but some of the characters were given very little to work with. John-Paul Howard as the central hero Ben makes for an okay protagonist, though Ben's got nothing on Charley Brewster. Cinematography and editing can prompt as much critique, though on the background of all that's aforementioned, the visual side of things provided some comfort. Always extra appreciation for good practical effects, gore and such. Lastly, the original score, was, guess what, mostly as uninspiring as the rest.I believe The Wretched is perhaps a better horror movie than I've described, but, personally, I find the best words for it are fundamentally basic, which is why I'm recommending this to those less familiar or accustomed to the horror genre. My rating: 5/10."}, {"id": 169, "text": "This is a fairly run-of-the-mill Goosebumps-style story. A fair assessment would be Fright Night mixed with Friedkin's The Guardian and a bit of Rear Window.

So it does have some production values like proper cinematography, music and effects. The experienced cast is good for what the film is.There is an attempted extended metaphor involving how divorce can affect children. I am not sure it is too clear or even works.

Paranoia sets in for Ben when neighbours are acting strangely ...It's a well-edited mainstream pleaser but hanging off a story which doesn't add up very well. Some elements are great but it feels like another short that has prematurely evolved into a lacking feature, devoid of tension and scares.It was well-received at FrightFest; I felt I was in the minority who didn't quite get it.

I didn't dislike it but nor did I take much away from it."}, {"id": 171, "text": "Two brothers to team up to write/direct a new horror film. While the lore is rich and designs are great to look at, the story is cliched and matches the tone of trying to be a cool 80's/90's film. While it is trying so hard to do this, it fails spectacularly. The characters are flat and one dimensional with dialogue to match. What is a really great concept fails under the creative hands at play here resulting in a movie to definitely miss.The main story follows Ben (John-Paul Howard) a recent child of divorce who is sent to live with is dad for the summer holiday. Liam (Jamison Jones) owns the marina and puts Ben to work where he meets his summer romance Mallory (Piper Curda). Things seem to be normal in this beachside town when one night Ben hears a noise on the roof. His next door neighbours seem to be acting weird and after the disappearance of their kid (and memory of the incident!) he explores the lore of a witch who emerges to eat children and then make their family forget about them. As Ben gets closer to revealing the witch, the more that things just go off the rails story wise before whipping into a semi-origin tale for the witch and it just ends on a weird note that sets up a sequel.While the film struggles with the story, the visuals are incredible. the design of the witch and the forest she inhabits utilises practical effects and is the best part of the movie by far. There is a creepy skull device that a lot of characters use as they get possessed by the creature. It is definitely effective and works well with the Witch's look. The tone of the film is trying to be a movie of the week horror film from the late 80's/early 90's and while it is trying to pay a homage to this, it just comes off as cheesy and outdated.The performances from the cast can easily be forgiven due to the material they have to work with. It's unfortunate that a diverse cast get lumped with one dimensional characters and throwaway lines. It's a shame that a great concept went to waste, the film probably would have succeeded under a different director and a hefty re-write."}, {"id": 172, "text": "I recently had the choice between going to The Wretched or We Summon The Darkness, so I chose the former because the latter's trailer already seemed to summerize the entire movie, including the dark twist (great job, marketing department!). Since I had heard very little about The Wretched and never saw the trailer, the choice was a no-brainer. Unfortunately, so was the movie.Judging by their IMDb resume, the Pierce brothers got into the trade as story board artists and production assistants. Now some studios make the mistake of immediately putting such novices on a mega-budget blockbuster (Mortal Engines comes to mind) because inexperienced directors can be easily bullied and can't demand final cut. Thankfully, The Wretched is still a small movie, so the fall-out is minimal. I haven't seen their first film, but in their second full theatrical feature, the brothers show little promise.Apparently, we still haven't run out of stories about witches or strange entities that abduct or possess children, but we are arguably running out of talent to do such stories justice. This movie looks, feels and sounds so cheap that it almost seems to have been made directly for television (and I don't mean HBO). The script is badly constructed, full of corny dialogue and horror tropes, and teeming with plot holes. Take the opening scene as an example: it is supposed to set the stage and connect with later events, but it is not even slightly referred to in the rest of the story. Lots of events critical for a coherent story aren't shown, either because of bad plotting or poor editing choices. We are denied a heart-pounding finale because of a few mandatory surprise twists. However, if you think them through, these are mostly twists for the sake of twists: they come out of nowhere (save for some inconsequential foreshadowing), make no sense with what was previously shown, and only reveal a serious lack of internal logic, poor plotting and/or bad editing.However, the Pierce brothers are apparently even worse directors than writers, judging by the absolute inability of this movie to get even remotely scary. The ingredients are all there: creepy monster, nighttime scenes, dark areas, but when the cooks lack talent, all you get are missed opportunities. It's so predictable that I could even see most jumpscares coming from miles away. The problem is that the directors cannot build suspense; because they immediately proceed to the scary part of the scene without any meaningful build-up, it doesn't get scary. Horror doesn't work that way.It doesn't help that the photography is mostly mediocre and unimaginative. Some location shots looking terribly grainy while others do not. Camera angles and motions are often instrumental in building tension, but the director of photography (DP) has clearly never seen a horror movie, judging by the mundane and static shots that look like a holiday home video at best. And when there is finally some excitement near the end, we are treated with nauseating shaky-cam. The only movie sin that isn't made is underexposure, because whenever there is something scary on screen, it is at least well lit.The only person doing a worse job than the writers/directors and the DP is the person responsible for the score. If the photography is uncreative and unable to set the right mood, the music and songs are downright terrible in setting a creepy atmosphere, especially in the first half (it did get better in the second, but I no longer cared by then). The only ones doing somewhat decent work are the actors, especially given what they have to work with. The special effects team also did a hell of a job in creating a convincingly gory monster that has a creative way of assuming identities.This should probably have been Direct-to-VOD here, but lack of competition from big movies was probably the reason it was given a shot in European cinemas. I see this movie even racking up some decent reviews here and there. Now that is the true horror, and perhaps inspiration for a future horror movie: how a disease outbreak creates zombies so starved for entertainment that bad attempts at moviemaking become the standard. Might be a nice companion piece to Idiocracy."}, {"id": 173, "text": "This was a strange movie (not in a good way) that left me empty.

I mean, the ending isn't original or unexpected, just poorly executed.Overall, the movie just wasn't engaging. The characters weren't developed at all, just superficial, with too little information given about them to make us care about them.In the end, the movie is entirely forgettable.

Cinematography makes good use of light, the make-up (by Eric Porn?) and effects are stylish, and the experience up to about 40 mins is unsettling, with some well timed jump scares and a creeping fear that made the hair on my arms stand up. Music is elaborate, with plenty of minor keys ever present. The performances are pretty good too, although the bully-boy scenes don't help the story.Overall, though, the experience was middling. There's a phase switch, when the plot self-consciously moves to Rear Window (that's why he's wearing a cast!) with a Body Snatchers vibe, and from there on the fear subsides as I realise everything's gonna be alright. The problem, I think, is the story - a basic quest to slay a monster and rescue the damsel in distress. I think there's a couple of shooting stars in a nod to Spielberg, and he would feel right at home in this world, where a disturbance in the surface of suburban life must be put right even as the uncomprehending adults frustrate the instincts of the insightful hero.There is a strange attempt to enter reverse-domino mode, where a montage reveals a deception in the story telling, so we're forced to re-evaluate everything we've understood so far. But it's so rushed and feels like they're trying to wrench more significance from the story when it isn't there, especially with such simple characters. So, this has lots of resources, but can't get over the fact the premise doesn't have the depth of myth to keep our nightmares alive.In the end, the pointless title sums this up in a way the creators didn't intend.

Everyone is a cliche, from a defiant kid who's had a bad family life, to a generic love interest, and the father who just doesn't understand his kid. I found them very boring and uninteresting. The script was also very conventional at many points in the film. For example the main character does a Google search and now knows nearly everything about the witch. We also have the kid get bullied for no reason, I'm so sick of this trope in these kind of movies.My best advice for the Pierce Brothers is to get a better screenwriter.

I think it will please the casual suspense/horror fan because there are twists and when there are twists i always see people overhyping a movie cause they remember the gotcha! moment.But 90% of the movie is very basic stuff, acting was alright, some scenes went absolutely nowhere (Party scene why so long with the pointless pool scene) brings nothing to the story more than a few lines of exposition.

At times it feels like you are watching a teen-romance, and then it will cut back to a horror scene and you are reminded of what the movie is actually meant to be about. I feel like that is the thing most holding this film back from being great. The best horror films are relentless. They never let their foot off the pedal. Even when nothing is happening the tone should be ominous and tense. I still liked 'The Wretched', but I feel it could've been a lot better in that respect.The film has a decent opening scene which sets the tone for the movie. It lets us know that no one, no matter their age or gender, is safe and that this witch has no boundaries. All the scenes involving the witch throughout the film are very well done actually. She's genuinely menacing and it feels like no character is safe and no ending is off the cards.The scene near the end that should have been the big finale and packed the biggest punch of the film fell a little short. It was too brief and didn't build up enough to have the impact it should've. There is a scene after that however, the final one in the film, that I really liked.

Due to this behavior, it can be challenging to sympathize with his character.For context, Ben returns to his father's (Jamison Jones) home - presumably for the summer holidays - in the midst of his parent's divorce, which he is, understandably, none too pleased about. His father runs a boating dock, which Ben begins to work at, where he demonstrates little appreciation or effort, before bumping into fellow employee Mallory (Piper Curda), one of the film's most entertaining characters, being both plucky and witty. Upset that his father is already moving on with Sara (Azie Tesfai), Ben distracts himself by becoming obsessed with his neighbor, Abbie (Zarah Mahler); or, more appropriately, her peculiar behavior, as he comes to suspect that she has been possessed by a witch.Though the witch in question has powers that have been largely unexplored in previous films, it's never fully explained what the full extent of her abilities are. 'How' and 'why' are never allured to either; even Wizards of Waverly Place explained their magic was derived from dragons. Other than being 'evil', obviously, the witch is not particularly sinister in the way she hunts or tries to shield her true identity, say for a couple of moments on screen. Fright Night this is not. Further contrivances arise when Ben conducts research into the witch and immediately finds lore tailored to his dilemma. Even Twilight had more convincing research done by its protagonist.A subplot, involving bullies, who are in the film for all of four minutes, appears to be shoed in as a mere narrative progression tool, while other characters receive about as much depth as a piece of string, most of whom are characterized by some 'thing'; Ben has a broken arm; Sara is a vegetarian; Abbie's husband (Kevin Bigley) is a city-slicker. Due to this, it should come as no surprise that the narrative is very predictable. That said, the film did succeed with its surprise twist.Furthermore, the second major detriment is the horror, or lack thereof. If you've seen the trailer, you've probably seen the most entertaining 'frightening' moments. All scares are accompanied by generic horror music that takes away from any terror that could have been naturally generated, thus warning the viewer long before anything happens.The Wretched has elements of Disturbia, The Hole in the Ground and The Ritual. These movies are horror/thrillers I remember, and unfortunately, The Wretched is largely forgettable, despite the promise you can occasionally witness. It additionally bares similarity to Under the Bed, in that the movie seems to have an identity crisis as to who its audience is: the central figures are teenagers and children, emphasizing the movie may be targeting a younger demographic, and yet it contains sequences of blood and viscera.All in all, The Wretched is passable, but it has little to offer to truly separate it from the quantity of other horror films out there."}, {"id": 179, "text": "I had not heard about the 2019 horror movie titled The Wretched prior to stumbling upon it by sheer random luck. And being an avid horror fan, of course I picked up a copy and decided to sit down and watch it - even without knowing what the movie was about. The cover of the movie was more than sufficient to get my attention.And I will say that The Wretched was a rather enjoyable and entertaining horror movie. It had that old-school style of horror feel to it. You know, like the way they used to make horror movies back in the mid- to late 80s. And that was definitely something that appealed to me.The Wretched had a good storyline and script to it, and writers and directors Brett Pierce and Drew T. Pierce definitely were on the right track with what they had conjured up here. The Wretched was good in the way of building up the story and slowly revealing more and more of what was going on.The movie also had a nice ensemble of cast to perform the various roles and characters. I can't really claim to be familiar with anyone on the cast list, and that is without a doubt something I enjoy; so the actors and actresses are not associated with previously portrayed characters in other movies.It should be said that the horror elements to The Wretched were perhaps subtle to mild. So if you are expecting an intense movie that will leave you cowering behind a pillow or sitting at the edge of the seat, then The Wretched is not going to do the trick. No, this was more of a slow build up of thrills and a sense of dread, and it worked well in favor of the movie.And also the special effects in the movie were good. I especially liked the make-up on the creature. That was just great and it looked really good.Without ruining the ending, but that was just brilliant. I loved the way that the ending was built up and it totally leads you by the nose. I must admit that I had not expected that turn of event to happen at the end. A stroke of brilliance from writers Brett Pierce and Drew T. Pierce.If you enjoy horror movies, then you shouldn't let The Wretched pass you by. It is a movie well worth the time, money and effort. I am rating it a seven out of ten stars."}, {"id": 180, "text": "Looking at the poster and the set, I expected to be routine horror with some intimate scenes thrown at audience. But it hasn't been the routine horror genre these days. I liked few concepts that put in especially about forgetting the children in their life completely. Never thought it could happen to the main characters itself.Screenplay convinced the audience from the main character view. But the story need some work to do, especially character development. I don't mind even if few scenes are cut down and used for witch flashback or about the kid. Having the extra depth of why and how, would have provided more interest among the audience.One thing still mystery to me is how does witch enter the buck while she was in a woman in 1980s. Didn't the witch had any human interaction all this time and needed an animal only? And how come she comes active and leaves without anyone noticing? Only the family might forget about kids but the neighbours, local community, schools would still remember and get intrigued.A thousand year old witch unnoticed till now at least for that town is fishy."}, {"id": 181, "text": "Negative:The acting is a little too focused on the main Charakter, acting not so well...The suspense and creepy moments are too standardized and are forced upon you with exaggerated musicAffirmative:There is a plot twist that I think works really well in the movie.I really like the locationsBut because it's supposed to be a horror genre I found it a bit too lax regarding the creepy factor."}, {"id": 182, "text": "Now the main problem with this one, is the poster. When I first saw it, it almost made me stay away from it, cause it looks so generic, so simple, even low budget you might say. On the other hand, the movie itself is far better than your usual horror, it is one that takes itself serious, makes a nice premise for itself and delivers a well balanced execution. It relies on more than just 2 or 3 actors, so really all in all, even tho it seems to be a small indie film, it is not, it is a rather darn good one.I liked the plot a lot, the dialogue, the characters, it went strong from the start and finishes with a nice touch, so The Wretched, a movie with a name and poster from the 80's, pays homage to nothing but its own idea. I have to say I had fun with it and it think most people will have the same experience as I did. It doesn't go overboard with gore, torture, mostly mystery, it reminded me of Disturbia, just more scary because the genre is horror after all.So of course I will recommend it, it was a good movie, especially for a late rainy night and everyone should give it a chance. Such productions should get more exposure in order to raise the bar a little more for others to come as well.Cheers!"}, {"id": 183, "text": "A thought provoking thriller that follows in the footsteps of many horror classics before it, The Wretched may not be perfect- but it does certainly prove to be a rather fun and entertaining little horror flick. The acting is decent, which is surprising with such an under the radar horror film, but in the end, no performance really proves itself to be in anyway extraordinary. There really all decent, they all try their best, and in the end, you don't end up caring as much about the characters, instead where the story will take them. The script can vary from clever and smart, to formulaic and tacky. It has more than enough clever moments up its sleeve, and it does do a rather good job at keeping you in the loop all the way through. However, where its flaws lie largely in the earlier moments of the film, largely the setup which can seem incredibly formulaic and predictable at times- a series of circumstances you have seen time and time again- especially when it comes to horror. I also wasn't a huge fan of the final conclusion itself either, at least at the very very end that is, though I won't risk spoiling why that is the case, just that it felt uneven considering all that had happened. In the end, The Wretched is in no means a great horror film, but a surprisingly decent little indie flick that I can't help but appreciate in the end. I would be interested to see if a sequel is ever made to this film, not that its needed necessarily, but I feel they can take the story in a direction that is far more worth telling than other horror follow ups in the past. Or at the very least, a whole lot more unique. My Rating: 8.5/10"}, {"id": 184, "text": "The Wretched is a new horror film directed and written by the Pierce brothers, who co-directed Deadheads.The film is about the teenager Ben (John-Paul Howard), who goes through a tough time after his parents' divorce. Ben decides to go to his father in the summer and work at a marina. Ben only bonds with his new colleague Mallory (Piper Curda). The rest of the teenagers on vacation here only make Ben look a bit strange and they treat him as staff. When Ben sees strange things happening to his father's neighbors, he begins to suspect that something is wrong. He finds out that the neighbor is possessed by a year-old witch. Because no one wants to believe Ben's witch story, Ben must investigate what the witch wants and make sure that no one around the marina is endangered by the witch.With this film it seems as if the Pierce brothers tried to make an old-fashioned horror film. With how they portrayed the film and the design of the witch, they did this well, but unfortunately they paid less attention to their script. It never really becomes clear what the witch wants and can do everything with her magical powers. Sometimes it seems as if they have given her extra random strengths and weaknesses so that the story can continue. They know how to create tension in the story, but the film itself is not really scary.This can be an entertaining film for horror fans, but it can also be somewhat familiar. This film uses elements and storylines, which have been seen in other horror films such as The Blair Witch Project, Fright Night and Rear Window.The effects are well and appropriately done. They put the witch in her monster form to a large extent without CGI as a doll and with other attributes in the film. When the witch is in her human form, they show with good make-up effects that she is not a normal person.Another weak point of the film is the acting, because the lesser script makes the characters seem a bit too simple and sometimes a bit too emotionless. For example, as a viewer you don't care much about the main character. The rest of the cast is not really built up. If the witch threatens to do something to someone, you as a viewer are not worried. Piper Curda tries to do a bit of good acting, but her character is not used enough in the story or she is portrayed a bit too forced as the romantic interest of the main character."}, {"id": 185, "text": "Apologies for the Trancers steal but this is a new twist on the old tale of Hekate the Dark mother and its a rather polished performance all round.Plenty of scares , some great creature effects and good acting make this one a cut, slice and chop above most of the horror films this year.One to add to the spooky forest horror tales - Personally i have always found films centred around nature, the woods , trees and folklore rather disturbing and interesting at the same time - Must be something primeval but this adds to the terror especially the scenes underground, it reminds me of films like the Kevin Costner film The New Mother and The Hollow and many others but I feel this one has spun it well with Hekate the witch instead of the usual goblins and sprites and things that go bump in the night.I don't normally like endings which prepare for a sequel but i did like the cryptic understated ending on this one.A good 7 hatchets out of 10 for this one!"}, {"id": 186, "text": "This was a movie that I saw a bunch of people on podcasts covering and talking about, so I asked Jaime if she wanted to watch this with me. Since she agreed, this is my 2020 release for a podcast so I can keep up with my new horror film watching. Other than that, I came in blind. The synopsis is a defiant teenage boy, struggling with his parent's imminent divorce, believes that something is wrong with his neighbors that might be based in the supernatural.Now I did doctor the synopsis as I think it spoils things and one thing that I really enjoy about this movie is that, we see things going on, but it is also from the point of view of as the synopsis states, a boy that is a bit troubled.We start this all though 35 years ago. Megan (Sydne Mikelle) is going to babysit for a family and it is raining outside. She knocks at the door and no one answers. She goes around to the side door where she calls her mother to let her know where she is and what is doing. There are some flowers that are dead and she finds a picture of the family. The husband's face is crossed out. She hears something in the basement and goes to check it out. This will be the last thing she does.The movie then shifts to someone's face in water and they're moving around back and forth. It then tells us that we're 5 days in the past. Ben (John-Paul Howard) is on a bus to visit his father. His arm is in a cast and an old woman comments on him being an artist. He is dropped off and he goes into the gas station where the proprietor is out fishing. There's an honor system and Ben at first ignores it, but he's growled at by the dog.Ben then meets up with his father. They have dinner while Ben plays Connect-Four. Liam (Jamison Jones) and Ben have tension, but his dad is trying to work through it. When he asks Ben if they want to talk about why his arm in the cast, they don't get anywhere.To fill you in, Ben's parents are going through a divorce. Ben is a bit more upset that his father seems to already have moved on as he's seeing Sara (Azie Tesfai), a young woman who works at the marina that Liam seems to be the harbor master at. Ben is going to work there for the summer where he meets Mallory (Piper Curda), a quirky young woman. He also meets a group of rich kids where one of the young women seems to be making eyes at him.Liam lives next to a young family of Abbie (Zarah Mahler), her husband Ty (Kevin Bigley) and their two children. The elder boy is Dillon (Blane Crockarell). Him and his mother go into the woods to explore where he finds an odd mark on a tree. This is the same mark that was on the door 35 years ago. It is an upside triangle, almost like the anarchy A, but it is probably representing a deer skull. Dillon then hears something and sees a creepy hand coming out of a tree. His mother gets him and they leave. On their way home though, they hit a deer and since Abbie's father was a hunter, she decides to bring it home.Things get weird that night when Ben hears something on his roof. He goes outside to check on it and it moves over to his neighbor's. He thinks it goes under the porch, but he notices something perching on the railing. That's when Ty asks what he's doing. Ben makes up an excuse and the two go to bed. The following day, Abbie gets attacked by something and goes off into the woods. Ben tries to point this out, but he makes a mess of things by not coming to a dinner that he suggested and put on by Sara. We also learn about something he did that caused him to be here for the summer and he isn't the most reliable.Now that recap ran a bit long, but there was a lot I felt I needed to establish before moving into what I thought about the things that we get in the movie. With that out of the way, I thought that the cold open was interesting in giving us what to expect later. This movie really doesn't waste time getting creepy and it never goes too long without giving us something which I can appreciate. Parts of this creature and the story work for me while others don't. The first being that we see what happens to this initial scene, but aside from establishing as I said. It really doesn't come back to that.What I do like here is we aren't messing around whether or not there is a monster. The movie does play with no one really believing Ben, but I like that. It is a clich\u00e9 to have a flawed character like him. I'm fine with it though, especially with a reveal at the end of the movie. This really confused Jaime and I do think there's a bit of issue with it myself. The movie is making us think that Ben is sent there because he got in trouble, but there's actually more to it which I liked.This is slightly problematic though. Since this gets revealed pretty early on, Ben learns about the entity through a website called 'Witchopedia'. The lore they're using for it seems to be very similar to a Changeling that takes the form of people, but it doesn't use all of the aspects. Using the deer skull also made me think of a Wendingo as well. It really just seems to be borrowing aspects of both for what we get here. I'm fine with that since it is creating something. What it does though is eat the 'forgotten'. My problem here is that Ben seems to remember those that are forgotten where other people don't, but there's something he does forget. It just seems inconsistent in my eyes and really just altering things to progress the story.What I did like though was the acting. I thought that Howard was solid as our lead here. Even though it is a clich\u00e9, I like that they make him a flawed character that we can't believe. Plus he does some crappy things to Mallory, Sara and Liam so we don't love him. I like my heroes to be like this. Curda is solid as his quirky counterpart who is more grounded and not really believing him. I think that Mahler does a really good job at being the character. We get a slight baseline of her norm before she changes. There's quite a bit of children actors here which I thought were fine. Overall I'd say no one really had a bad performance and I commend some of them for a reveal as well.The last thing I really wanted to delve into would be the effects. It is movies like this that I get a bit nervous about since they tend to go more CGI heavy. This one does seem to go CGI. I don't want to give the impression that it doesn't. There are some really good aspects though that is done practically. Having The Wretched shown in darkness is good. The glowing eyes are creepy and what they do with the CGI to enhance worked for me. The only issue I really had was a gunshot as I could tell that was done with computers. Cinematography for the movie was also well done.Now with that said, this movie I was glad I gave it a viewing. I think that we have an interesting concept here with a creature that for me borrowed from a couple different things to make it its own. There are some slight issues with logic that I had, but the acting was solid. The effects for the most part are good. I never got bored and the soundtrack fit for what was needed from what I could remember. For me, this is a good movie in my eyes. It also has the potential to be one of my favorites of the year thus far."}, {"id": 187, "text": "In writer/director duo Drew T. Pierce and Brett Pierce's coming of age horror movie The Wretched, 17-year-old Ben (John-Paul Howard) busses into the quaint, boat-slipped town where he and his dad Liam (Jamison Jones) are spending the summer.As Ben tries to acclimate to his new summer digs-complete with the 'warming up to dad's new girlfriend' and 'trying to fit in with the local townies' tropes he begins to observe strange occurrences coming from his next door neighbor's house.Unbeknownst, a witch has made the house its new quarters and begins to cast a spell over the townsfolk, causing them to forget their children so that it can easily devour the forgotten ones without a tussle (smart).When children begin to go missing though, Ben's suspicions turn real and he must devise a plan to stop the witch and save the children. However, with a checkered past including drug use and stupidity-jumping from a second floor window-resulting in a broken arm, Ben is up against a wall as he finds it increasingly difficult to find people who believe in him.With elements of Fright Night and The Lost Boys-meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers-all while on a snoozy summer vacation, The Wretched replaces vampires and aliens with a pagan root-like witch that prowls the woods and makes pit stops into peoples homes and eats their children.There are no bad shots in The Wretched. Kudos to the Pierce Brothers for being natural born purveyors of horror. They know how to tell an effectively scary story. The dialog too, thank god comes off as natural and the acting is good-all of which creates a solid foundation for a decent creepy summer movie.As always, there will be naysayers whom gloss over the accomplishments and only focus on the flaws. And The Wretched is certainly not without flaws. But follow through and you may be pleasantly surprised that more than a little thought went into making this film, and it shows."}], "reviews_amount": 188}
