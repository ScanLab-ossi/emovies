It didn't try too hard to be something it's not, force a narrative or leave you feeling dissatisfied.Yes, it was predictable but it was the predictability that made Love, Guaranteed quite charming in its execution. Cook and Wayans have such a lovely chemistry as well that drives the movie along quite nicely."}, {"id": 1, "text": "You just don't find love stories like this.

This movie has all of it. Oh no! The deadline is in two weeks? Their date was nearly ruined by a precocious kid? There's a major obstacle to this perfect romance and they can't talk about it? Whatever will they do????Damon Wayans Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook are delightful in this movie and I found myself rooting for them every step of the way. Will it win an Oscar? Doubtful, but it's better than your average Hallmark movie and I enjoyed every minute of it."}, {"id": 4, "text": "It's a cheesy, sappy, highly predictable romantic comedy with a few laughs here and there.

The previous Rom Com movie on Netflix, Desperados, was good but not great with co-stars from, New Girl, - Nasmin Pedrad and Lamorne Morris (as much as I love them). This Rom Com movie, Love Guranteed, featuring Damon Wayans Jr. blows past it with flying colors. Very surprised the ratings on this movie doesn't keep it a solid, 7. This movie definitely has a predictable outcome but it is a must watch movie with character and authenticity (compared to other movies now and days)."}, {"id": 6, "text": "It was an okay movie to pass the time.

I mean, you spend the whole time fighting this company only to BECOME THE FACE OF IT at the end??"}, {"id": 7, "text": "I wanted to like this, but the film ended up as Netflix's pandering to those that grew up with 90s romcoms. Sure, it played the formula (pretty/unconventional girl meets handsome guy in a funny situation and so on), but the leads lacked in chemistry. Jokes were flat thus missing out completely on the com part of romcom, especially since comedic timing felt stilted and unnatural. Situational comedy was used but it was half-hearted and didn't make any of the characters endearing. The film ended on a predictable note (which is to be expected) but it could have at least been built up better."}, {"id": 8, "text": "What a lovely movie. A must see. Short and really enjoyable.

Yes, it is the predictable girl meets boy storyline, but I thought the script was perfect for this genre. The look at the online dating world was hilarious. Cute movie with good acting.

I would love to see the 2 leads in more movies."}, {"id": 12, "text": "It's an amazing movie. It's not about the predictability of it all, it's about how love is portrayed in the movie.

If you don't love rom-coms stop right there. First, it's not a comedy. It's pretty much just a 'rom' and mildly so. Sweetly so. I watched Love, Guaranteed on a whim and enjoyed it very much. The dialogue was fresh and sincere. Nothing overly dramatic and I'm glad! other reviews said there was no chemistry and I disagree. Acting was great all around. This was a thoroughly enjoyable film for this Saturday afternoon. I rest my case :)"}, {"id": 14, "text": "I liked the leads, I think Damon is very charming and great as a romantic lead. The premise of the movie is not very believable, but regardless of the problematic plot, the story was shown in a very shallow way, it never developed into anything interesting, they didn't discuss why Arianna cheated, introduced any normal woman into the dating mix or explained why the dates didn't go well (1000 dates and all weirdos?), I couldn't understand when he actually works, if he even had a second date with someone on the website or if he was ever interested in any of them.

As soon as she gets the call that threatens the case (when they begin falling for each other), the plot just goes downhill. The whole aspect of being able to somehow PROVE that they're falling for each other in a court of law is so absurd. And why does she suddenly go cold on him instead of just explaining to him the details and waiting till after the court date to resume their relationship? They quite literally only have to wait a few weeks at the most and then they're free to be together. As soon as that part of the movie happened, it became personally unwatchable and I had to stop the movie because it was becoming so cheesy and quite frankly unbearable to even continue watching."}, {"id": 29, "text": "Good film, easy watch, sweet film.

Looked like a fairly decent cast, therefore, a cheeky hour and a half well spent. WRONG. Hard to know what's worse, the writing or the acting. Beyond predictable. It's the sort of film you'd see in the background of a decent film; an over-the-top, extreme, embarrassing version of a romcom where the characters cut their conversation to side eye each other sighing at how bad the film is.

The plot is ridiculous, and there are plot holes big enough for Zorro to drive through! (You ll understand the reference if you see it). I finally gave up on it when the opposing lawyer made the case that if she fell in love with her client, that would break her case, because then the dating site would have been responsible for him finding love.

I will say, I did enjoy the special touch on the credits."}, {"id": 58, "text": "This was so bad. Like terrible! I remember when romantic movies used to good. Like sure they were cheesy but still had a good premise. This movie is not. Like at all!She's a lawyer and fell for her client. Very bad ethics but anyway.

I could see her playing parts similar to Sandra Bullock.The movie itself was quite pleasant to watch. Rachael Leigh Cook and Damon Wayans Jr. had good chemistry. I could have done without the cutesy touches that the filmmakers throw in (such as the cute text graphics).Overall, it was pleasant and a nice way to spend 90 minutes or so. It didn't create anything new or groundbreaking, and there are some similar romantic comedy Sandra Bullock movies that I liked much more.

I can't root for the Wayans character too much because he is one of those persons who abuses the legal system.. no matter how noble the movie trie to make it.

The comedic timing of all characters was great, including Nick (Damon Wayans Jr.), Susan (Rachel Leigh Cook), and Susan's 2 office staff.While it was obvious that Nick and Susan would likely end up together, it felt very realistic, just a little at a time, and not at all contrived.The CEO of the company Love Guaranteed and her lawyer were perfectly swarmy and easy to dislike.I did feel that the company Love Guaranteed should have been found guilty of portraying lies, since the couple on their posters were models instead of a couple who had met on the website. In addition, Nick went on 1,000 dates and did not find love until AFTER the 1000 dates, so he should have won his court case.Nonetheless, Nick and Susan end up together happily, and there ends up being money for the children's portion of the hospital, so that's a win-win."}, {"id": 103, "text": "I absolutely LOVED this movie.

All we knew was that she didn't really have time to go on dates, she did a lot of pro-bono cases as a lawyer and lived right next to her pregnant sister.There wasn't much depth to her storyline especially as she's considered the main character, later on we do find out about a previous relationship but its the only time we really here about her love life. If you didn't already know Damon Wayans Jr has starred as Coach in New Girl, Brad in Happy Endings and has starred in a variety of hilarious comedies. I think the writers really missed an opportunity to make him the romantic lead which I think could've saved it.All in all this film was full of missed opportunities and random story points that lead to nowhere. They could've shown more of the 1000 dates that Nick had been on adding a comedic relief that was much needed. I would have also liked a connection to the Tiffany song 'I Think We're Alone Now' which played several times throughout however was only acknowledged once when we learnt that the tape is stuck in Susan's car and is all she listens to while driving.This is definitely one of the worst rom-coms I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of cheesy Hallmark Christmas films.

For those reviews that say they were able to figure out the ending in the first 5 minutes of the film, congratulations. You should have figured it out from the three or four line plot description and the fact that it's a romantic comedy.All romantic comedies are predictable.

I think you should really focus less on writing bad reviews and more on brain development. I suggest the elevate app if you have the means to purchase it.The boy meets girl and they fall in love story will always be the centre of a romantic comedy. That ain't hard to figure out. What's different is the story of how they meet and fall in love. And I for one thought this film had a nice, fresh story of how the lovers meet and get to know one another. I've certainly never seen it before.If you like cheesy rom coms which I think everybody should once in a while, then this movie is for you.

And a lady hit her own lawyer. Imagine if the role was reversed.(they censor somethings then allow others to get away with being violent')Overall, the quality looks good. The story had potential it would have worked better as a comedy romance.Verdict: Its a week movie. This guy went on 1001 dates I can't even get one. #incel"}, {"id": 166, "text": "You come home after a long workday and you'd like to relax, unwind, watch something lighthearted and new that has a hint of originality - not another superhero flick or a reboot, thank you very much (I do realize there're other kinds of movies but these are the easy targets so just.. shhh, let me finish.) You can't go wrong with this one.The premise of the movie is simple enough: Nick, a heart-broken, honest no wrong-doer sues a dating app company over the misleading promise of a guaranteed love. To help his case in court he hires the young, beautiful and celibate lawyer, Susan, a Jake Brigance-type woman of the people who self-proclaims as standing up for the little guy. You can already see where this is going, and I'm not here to convince you otherwise, that this is a genre-subverting, trope-mocking self-aware movie: it isn't. In fact by around the first quarter of the runtime you could guess what the ending might look like. But!... despite all the that, it succeeds none the less, and here's why:For one, the writing (narrative, character dynamics, dialogue) is engaging. The premise is interesting enough to get you to click and although the plot-line, to an extent, is predictable, it's never boring. It checks all story conventions without somehow falling prey to it and I couldn't but follow and fall for what I knew was coming (movie magic, amirite?) It's well-written, the story expands a bit and then is tied back together perfectly by the end. It's funny all the way through (stick for the ending credits) and heartwarming and might even get you to drop a tear or two.The characters serve their purpose and then some more! They're entertaining, lively and fun to watch. You got Susan's quirky co-workers; the antagonist- how should I describe her... imagine if Goob (Gwyneth Paltrow's company) was a person and it started a dating app company; the wise old man; Susan's sister and her family who seem to have their own thing going for 'em, adding a bit of 3 dimensionality (is that a word?) to the movie. And then there's our main couple, cute and adorable, rom-com style.Side note: In the Romantic Comedy spectrum, the movie tilts more toward Comedy, but I think it had the potential to be more serious (ever seen Love, Rosie or About Time?) Now I don't know if it would've been a better or worse movie for it. Maybe it would've made for a deeper, richer, more re-watchable movie; or maybe it would've made the tone off-balance or something... I don't know, just throwing that out there.If I had to 'critique' it, I would say that it felt like more of Susan's movie than Nick's. Everything we know about him is 'economical': it serves a purpose in the narrative. That isn't a bad thing in its own but when you contrast it with her and what we learn about her life, Nick's character falls somewhat under-developed.I don't know what else to tell you, watch it and you will probably like it; don't and you won't be missing all that much. Time flew by when I saw it and if this was playing in the theaters it would've been a good day at the movies' for me.M"}, {"id": 167, "text": "I took a chance on Love, Guaranteed on Netflix mostly because I wanted to watch a sappy romance, and I thought this sounded like a decent concept for a rom-com. A man who brings a lawsuit against a dating website for guaranteeing love is a timely topic, and the irony that he falls in love with the lawyer he hires is a cute idea. I also thought with this cast it would be a legitimate movie, because there are a few movie names in there that I wouldn't expect to be in a shoddy made-for-tv romance. (And it's hard for me to resist anything with Rachael Leigh Cook.) Sadly, I was wrong, because this is straight out of the Hallmark Movie handbook. It doesn't take place at Christmas, but otherwise this is cheesy, and utterly lacking in any solid story-telling. It's kind of embarrassing how bad the writing is throughout the film, and they don't even keep a logical storyline going. It's one of those films where things just happen because the movie needs them to happen, not for any good reason.The saddest thing about Love, Guaranteed is that even when I turned off my critical brain and accepted the kind of schlock I was watching, it didn't deliver on either of the most important points. For starters, it was completely unfunny. Even the montage of bad dates they show are such played out jokes that it didn't make me crack a smile. The supporting cast of wacky characters were utterly lacking in anything funny to say (it was kind of pathetic.) I struggled to even laugh AT the movie because, while it was incompetent, it wasn't in a humorous fashion. Likewise, the romantic moments in Love, Guaranteed were lackluster. I didn't have that warm swell of emotion as I watch the couple finally realize they belong together. The romantic speech was poorly written and didn't have the kind of pay-off you want to feel from this kind of sappy film. While I've seen worse excuses for a rom-com than Love, Guaranteed, this is far from good and I think even someone desperate for romance would be more satisfied with the cornucopia of other options out there."}, {"id": 168, "text": "I caught this on netflix, and thought it was amusing in spots, It has great leads, and a sweetly well told story.

And just when the movie pretends to have surprises, and then it says no we don't. Heather Graham is not much of a character she's a cliche waiting to happen. But all in all an amusing film, despite what I said, I didn't hate this movie, it's a good way to spend 90 minutes. I thought Rachel Leigh Cook and Damon Wayans Jr where good in this, just not together."}, {"id": 169, "text": "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.I love the opportunity to see Rachel Leigh Cook act again. There are a few moments in the movie where she's a little stiff, but I'm quickly reminded that she's playing a stuffy lawyer type as she goes into a highly emotional mode.Damon Waynes Jr. is great and not only embodies a level of cynicism that also makes him act stiff in a couple of points, it clearly shows his character is cynical because of how open he actually is to love.The writing itself holds some great values, from its concept of the legality of corporate lying, and testing the bounds of a terms of service agreement through such a ridiculous implementation as 1,000 dates to using a situation to do something good for charitable service (like a rehabilitation clinic) to capitalizing on situations despite the cost.There is a lot of good drip feeding of information despite it not being a mystery movie. The discovery being used as a character building is a really good mechanic and you don't see it very often.I think most of the credit goes to the actors for bringing such charming characters and situations to life, but I'm just glad that there is a 30's style romantic comedy this good out there."}, {"id": 170, "text": "Love, Guaranteed (3 out of 5 stars)Love, Guaranteed is a fair romantic comedy film that is cute with its cast ensemble and entertaining love story. But filled with a cheesy script and direction. And a predictable outcome. It is about Nick (Damon Wayans Jr) who hires a lawyer Susan (Rachael Leigh Cook) that he wants to sue a dating app called Love Guaranteed. That after 1,000 dates he did not find love.A cute and fun predictable love story. Nick is a gentleman and courteous. Susan is a loveless lawyer. Which her team sets her up on that app to date. And come across awkward and weird dates that did not match there own profiles. Which is true about the reality of online dating. Which is funny to see on film. The boss of that app played by Heather Graham was entertaining. Which she tries to play as a love guru.The film is filled with cheesy dialogue. And a cheesy direction. The cast ensemble sells it. With the charming Rachael Leigh Cook which is nice to see her make a come back. The last thing i seen her in was She is All that. Damon Wayans Jr. was also good playing as Nick as well. Along with Heather Graham.It is a cute and fun romantic comedy film but not really something that would stick out to the rest in that genre. Entertaining but easily forgettable."}], "reviews_amount": 171}
