The plot - A team of mercenaries travel to the remote n dangerous part of Africa to rescue hostages from a brutal gang, unknown to both the parties that horde of lions jus escaped from a lion farm and one ferocious lioness has gone rogue.

Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching things scene, and overuse of the singing Backstreet Boys' song scene! Make the film unwatchable! The shooting and stabbing scene in the film have blood at certain point, but overall not satisfy, not intense, and too short! Majority shooting scene also quite messy, and barely showing opponent getting hit! The explosion scene just occur at the beginning of the film!

Another disappointed action film!"}, {"id": 15, "text": "I hoped this would be something along the line of Prey or even the The Ghost And The Darkness but this was just a terrible and low budget creature feature with mercenaries and a lioness. In fact the lioness was there more as an afterthought and a plot device then a main antagonist.A bunch of mercenaries led by Samantha O Hara played by Megan Fox are rescuing a daughter of a governor in Kenya. They end up rescuing three hostages instead of the one and when the helicopter which is supposed to pick them up is shot down they need to keep on running from the terrorists who are after them and encounter a rogue lioness on a lion breeding farm. It turns out that the lioness is just protecting her cubs and is attacking anyone who endangers them.The acting is ok mostly , the effects go from b to c grade to just terrible and there is the annoying blood mist that disappears into thin air when someone gets shot which makes the movie look cheaper and cheaper. The story and script were a major let down at times as well. You could literally tell which person would be attacked by the rogue lioness by certain sentences that were uttered moments before. This took out all the excitement from the movie and just left mostly jump scares. The movie loses the plot with the lioness only attacking the villains of the film the main terrorists who is British turns out to be just a criminal saying his country never wanted him, one of the dying mercenaries saying how beautiful lions are and so on and so forth. There is even a scene where one protagonist says well that just happened as if acknowledging that something makes no sense in the movie makes it in any way ok for the audience just because you mentioned it in the actual film. While the end message of how the breeding of captive lions need to stop is commendable, the movie does not draw attention to it properly. A 3.5 out of 10."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Fox and the young girls acting made this watchable and it was filmed well. They out-acted the rest of the cast. However, the comic relief one-liners seemed forced and overboard. Some of the lions' CGI scenes could have been better, much better. Some were just bad. Also, I think they used someone who had watched a lot of military movies to advise on the technical aspects and military specifics, but who was never in the armed forces. Some of that didn't seem right. Not an A movie, but not quite a B-movie. Not a terrible idea to combine an animal vs people and a hostage rescue plot."}, {"id": 17, "text": "The IMDB trolls are alive... but I found it entertaining.

It isnt the worst movie out there and I liked seeing Philip Winchester in this role again as I love the tv series Strike Back. So it was good to see jim again.

Megan Fox is no Scarlett Johansson or Kate Beckinsale, but she wasn't too bad in the action role. The script and characters were well-written, and, overall, the cast and action were excellent, although some of the visual effects could have been a bit more refined.I appreciate the movie being about poaching, a subject I haven't seen yet in other feature films, and it does it without being overly preachy. All in all, I definitely recommend checking out Rogue."}, {"id": 21, "text": "I don't know what's wrong with peoples but this movie definitely don't deserve 3.8. Its between 6-6.5. I have seen so so many movies from classics to latest one and from experience i can say its not a great but a good entertainment movie. CGI tiger was definitely not good but its also not so bad. I mostly watch movies alone so others don't ruin my experience by criticising every aspect which i guess happened to lot of people here. I was holding this movie from a while and today at last i watched it and am not disappointed or felt like it was complete waste of time.

If you weren't expecting trash before you watched this movie than you're dumber than the plot but as far as trash goes, it was actually not too bad !!! The first 20-25mins was a great start and quite engaging. I went in expecting the worst so with my low expectations I was pleasantly surprised how entertaining it was. Look.....its predictable but there were some really cool scenes and this movie has plenty of laugh out loud moments just maybe not for the reasons intended.Give it a go, as long as you've seen the trailer and your expectations arent unrealistically high you might actually find the entertainment in this, I certainly did."}, {"id": 23, "text": "I think people are so anti Megan fox it's tainting the view of the movie.

It is an action packed thriller. It keeps you at the edge of your seat with a few twists and surprises. The characters are well developed for an entertaining action movie. The highlight of the movie is Megan Fox. Indeed, she delivers. She portrays a tough no nonsense leader of a pack of mercenaries. The character is competent, fierce, charismatic with nerves of steel. The graphics of the lioness, however, were poorly done. The setting was in South Africa. This is a refreshing change from most action packed movies set in LA or New York. In summary, it is an entertaining movie that should not be taken too assiduously."}, {"id": 25, "text": "It's not a movie you take seriously.

As much as the message in the film is grand, the movie did not do it justice.Hostages were extremely annoying but somehow managed to survive in the middle of a gun fight by just standing out there in the open and the lioness, an added afterthought to promote feminism the way I see it, just happen to kill the villains (twice) in order to not end the movie early. What's more, it feels like the characters in the film were just making stupid irrational decisions to again, promote feminism (when the girls decide to run out into the middle of a gunfight and that over exaggerated shout scene towards Pata).The next weakest thing would probably be VFX. Those blood mists made the film look really cheap, so were some of the muzzle flashes. Lioness herself was passable as a CGI however.Megan Fox was always clean and unhurt when her teammates were in tatters. It is however good to see a female lead role that is not used to support a male lead and in my opinion her acting was passable in this film. I believe she does have the potential for niche lead roles if the direction and script were better.All in all 4/10. Nothing against feminism or animal rights activism if done right but there are structures to films to make deliveries impactful. Just because someone had a good message he or she want to deliver behind scenes does not make it good or significant if it was made with such poor thought."}, {"id": 33, "text": "This movie is about a young women who is hired to rescue the daughter of some gouvenor in some African country and does this with a group of the best mercenaries money can buy. While the recue goes sour they have to run for their lifes and hide in an abandoned lion farm, wich is not so abandoned at all. This movie has great potential but fails on to many points. First the rescue, amateur hour at it finest. They try to pull of a distraction and then sneak in the village, but when this does not go according to plan, they dicide to shoot all the bad guys, and where do all the bad guys come from when a dozen or so are already shot dead? Why plot a recue with zero causualties when at some point they shoot everyone they see? Then they have to run from the village with the recued hostages in a couple of jeeps. The bad guys till have to get their things together, get their cars, but for some reason the catch up within the minute and there is some stupid car chase where everyone has forgotten to aim. Then when the vehicles die, they have to jump of a clife into a river. Never ever do you see them accually jump, only out of camera action. Luckely the bad guys dare not to jump, perhaps they can not swim? In the abandoned lion farm they are, off course, attacked by a remaining lion. But the CGI for this is so bad you never, ever, can believe one thing of it, most fake lion ever! The hero girl has been a soldier all of her life and that explains why she can shoot from the hip, she does not even have to aim to hit, and, after hours of chasing she only has one (1) scratch. Sometimes the movie did not even make the effort of creating bulletholes in bodies when they are shot. Meanwhile the bad guys keep comming and comming like an endless stream of lemmings. In the end she has a couple of t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate's with the bad guys leader, who, for some unknown reason does not shoot her."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Half way through this movie, I realised this was better than Extraction starring Chris Hemsworth.

Absolutely, there are quite a few but it wasn't near as bad as some make it out to be. In the case of the CGI, brutal. Very bad and the story was all over the place. The so called comedy fell flat but I thought the action decent and she reloaded. That should be worth a star right there. I've seen worse.Overall I'd say if you get a chance, watch it for yourself but don't spend your hard earned money on it. I thought it was a decent time waster and would watch it again. I really can't believe I'm actually defending this movie but a 3.8? It's better than that, hell, the Doorman is rated higher and that sucks way more than his one.

The screenplay had major plot and technical issues, with dumb dialogue in most scenes, and the acting was terrible. There was a scene that Fox actually acted really well, but that was overshadowed by her perfect hair and make-up with a single permanent red smudge on her forehead - the only evidence she was involved in any action. I also feel a better female lead should've been cast that would've been more convincing than Fox.

It's just your typical, VHS made-for-tv film that you would have rented at Blockbuster 30 years ago and you would have love it. Today, not so much, but it's still not atrocious. Frankly, i have to say that Megan Fox is the sore spot. It is utterly ridiculous how miscast she is, and not *just* for being a rose lipped, skinny, peach skin model who could not pass for a merc if she was covered in tar, but her delivery is also completely off.But, forget about Megan Fox. There's plenty of competent extras willing do happily die at the hands of smugglers and/or CGI lions while shooting guns, blood splatter, prosthetic wounds, and believable sets to keep you entertained through a jumbo sized bowl of popcorn.Just - don't expect a serious film.6/10 - this film should be less pretentious and more self-aware"}, {"id": 54, "text": "Ignore all the reviews that mentions Megan Fox's acting.

Yeah, that doesn't end well.Sprecial thanks to Megan's MUA, since during the movie there seems to be hardly any scene where she isn't perfectly made up while even the female co-stars look like they seem to have been dragged through lion dung and broken glass.The whole movie would have been a lot better if the heroes were just some tourists dealing with a broken down tourbus, so we would at least have some patience with the idiotic ways in which they plunged to their deaths.."}, {"id": 111, "text": "Yes I've seen worse, but only just.

The main protagonist of the team is the always expressionless Megan Fox, who seems to be doing exactly what her character is doing--cashing a paycheck.To be fair to Miss Fox, I don't blame her. I blame the casting director.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: Roar follows a team of mercenaries lead by Boss Megan Fox as they rescue some of the most annoying young women from human trafficking somewhere in Africa. When cornered in an abandoned complex, the team and their pursuers are slowly picked apart by feral lions.I won't even bother talking at length about the awful CGI lions. They were bad in the trailer and they're worse in the movie. Why? you may ask. Because there's so much more of them, which really allows the laziness of the CGI to sink in.Instead of talking about the awful CGI lions at length, lets discuss a few things that are a little less obvious but equally appalling.BAD EDITING: The filmmakers clearly don't know how to tell a story. The first car chase/gun battle sequence has so many wasted shots that do nothing to propel the story forward, and this is a problem the movie suffers from throughout. This may sound like a minor gripe, but it's a symptom of a much larger problem.Things like shot choices, camera angles, character beats, and jokes, are thrown around because they're cool or to fill time or to give the illusion of development, but in actuality this is story-telling at its most shallow. You can tell there's effort to craft interesting characters here, and, to be fair, some of it works, but it's all padded by so much lifelessness, gunfire, and bad editing that the entire movie drowns amidst the wasted potential.BAD EDITING EXAMPLE: After a ridiculously prolonged escape sequence rife with terrible editing, one of the heroes remarks that they need to keep going because they haven't gotten far enough away from their pursuers. The choice of camera angle here is key because we the viewers can clearly see in the background that our characters have, in fact, come a very long way and are in no immediate danger. It equals a wasted line of dialogue, a wasted shot, and more wasted time.Oh, and then an alligator pops up because... something needed to happen? I'm not sure.You can always tell when someone's about to die in Roar because the camera angels are so cliche. The back-and-fourth cutting during numerous gunfights is so ham-fisted and lacking in creativity that you'll be surprised how you can fall asleep amidst so much gunfire.BAD CHOREOGRAPHY: If the characters aren't running and shooting guns, then they're driving cars and shooting guns, or getting shot by guns, or getting eaten by lions, or shooting lions, or getting eaten while shooting lions. No matter what they're doing while they're shooting their guns, they do it in the most boring way possible. A knife fight at the end of the movie has a few seconds of interesting choreography, but apart from that the lack of creativity and the almost endless gunfire makes the movie feel b-grade, like they couldn't afford anything but blank rounds.BAD DIALOGUE: When the characters are in mercenary mode they like to use dialogue lifted from every single detective show on TV. Words like asset and boss are used as though the writers did no research into the actual lifestyle of such characters beyond watching reruns of Criminal Minds. The rest of the dialogue exists to spoon-feed the audience exposition in the most boring and predictable ways possible.BAD DIALOGUE EXAMPLE: When the baddies manage to pin down the heroes in a building, Megan Fox quickly sets some explosives on one side of the room to create an escape hole in the building. It's obvious to the viewer what she's doing, but a side character idiotically screams in fright, You're going to blow up the building?! to which Fox replies with all the boredom she can muster, No, just the wall. Such dialogue is redundant and pointless. How much more badass would it have been for Fox's character to reply with an ACTION, like pressing the detonate button and letting the explosion just be her answer? It's amateurish dialogue and doesn't fit a character who is supposed to be this battle-hardened warrior.And now that I think about it, it's the kind of dialogue that never ends. Everyone in this movie talks almost non-stop so you're never at a loss of what they're thinking, feeling, or planning to do. It sounds stupid. It makes the characters look stupid. It makes you the viewer feel stupid.And it makes for one boring movie.Show don't tell is one of the oldest rules in the writer's handbook, a rule the makers of Rogue clearly know nothing about. Or maybe they just forgot. Or maybe they took that rule and burned it in an effigy of good filmmaking."}, {"id": 126, "text": "Rogue is a 2020 American action film directed by M. J.

I've always loved her in movies like Jennifer's Body and although she's not known for her Oscar-worthy acting chops I thought she played the lead here rather well. She's a strong heroic presence, bringing a bit more emotional depth to her performance than I anticipated. The film itself however slowly crumbles under bad dialogue, bad direction, bad CGI and shrewd characterisation. Beyond all of the key things that make a movie great, the film is sporadically rather entertaining - it's got a few fun fight scenes and car chases here and there and I was never bored throughout the film but the films cookie-cutter plot and cardboard characters weren't enough to warrant a higher rating from me I'm afraid."}, {"id": 127, "text": "Day one: Watched approximately the first 40 minutes of this film before I decided it was trash and gave up on it.Day two: Decided to give it a second chance, watched from around minute 30 to just over the hour mark, and again, gave up on it.There will not be a day three.

The plot seems to veer from one topic to another and it hasnt even seem to have worked out what story it is trying to relay, the acting is pretty poor, the action scenes laughable (did they even have anyone on set teaching them how to hold weapons?) and the special effects b-grade.Maybe something happened over the final 30 minutes that redeemed this utter botch job.

Certainly i have no criticism, on the acting front.Really, this is what could have been two films, rolled uncomfortably into one. I'll add I'm also a little critical of the way it presents what are increasingly endangered animals, in a less than flattering or for that matter, accurate light.It tries to smooth this over at the end with a conservationist message but I still don't think personally, this was a path that should have been taken to start with.4/10 from me."}, {"id": 129, "text": "It's non-stop action with little room for character development.

I also enjoyed the scenic African landscapes and the message of the film.With less action and more dialog and backstory/buildup this could have been a better story. It could have been a Jurassic Park type of film, but it was very violent. It was hard to clearly hear the dialog and follow the characters' personal journeys, and the shaky camera work was distracting.Megan Fox was great in her role, but she didn't have much to work with.

Brandon Auret (Elijah) and Philip Winchester (Joey) were definitely my favorites, but there are good personalities and interactions all around, which is REALLY surprising.

Bassett, I can't really claim that I had much of any high hopes for the movie, as it was starring Megan Fox after all. But it being a new movie and a movie I hadn't already seen, of course I managed to find the time to sit down and watch it.Turns out that the movie was actually better than I had feared it to be. So that was a positive thing working in favor of the movie. Sure, this was by no means Shakespearian entertainment, but it was a pretty straight forward movie. It was entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, although it was a bit on the simplistic side. However, at the same time there was just something oddly familiar about the plot and storyline, something very reminiscent of something you'd see in movies back in the 1990s or thereabouts.And I must say that Megan Fox actually managed to impress me with her performance in Rogue, proving that she is actually more than just a pretty face. She actually handled herself well enough in a movie such as Rogue. Sure, you might have a hurdle to get over in terms of taking her serious in an action movie such as this, but give her a chance at least.The storyline was straight forward and easy to follow, although it was a bit generic and predictable. But it proved to be entertaining enough at least. The characters in the movie, however, were a bit bland, as most of them were lacking distinctive personalities, motivation and backstories. At times it felt like they were just an androgynous mass of characters milling about, one starting where the previous ended. So a bit more effort on the writing part prior to filming the movie would have been appreciated.The CGI in the movie was adequate, and the lion looked realistic enough in most of the scenes. That was something that the movie needed. Sure, there was room for improvement on the CGI effects, but at least they served their purpose well enough in bringing the lion to life on the screen.All in all, Rogue is a decent enough action thriller, but it is hardly a movie that you will watch more than once, given the simplicity of the storyline. My rating of the 2020 Rogue is a mediocre five out of ten stars. Watchable, but not an outstanding movie."}, {"id": 133, "text": "Hardened former soldier Samantha O'Hara (Megan Fox) leads a group of mercenaries on a mission to rescue a governor's daughter kidnapped by terrorists in remote Africa. It goes badly when their helicopter is shot down. With their escape cut off and low on ammunition, they jump off a cliff, get battered in a river, encounter dangerous wildlife, and stumble upon an abandoned lion farm which had its lions escape two day earlier.At first, I thought Megan Fox would be the toughest hurdle. Let's be clear. It's odd to have her play a hard-edge military type. I try to go with it but the lion farm is the more formidable barrier. It's way too convenient and weirdly bad. I'm guessing somebody wants to make a point about lion farms. It would have been much better to go with a pride of wild lions stalking the group. The crocodile is great. This would be a fun horror adventure if they're being pursued by lions. The CGI lions look bad anyways. Also, there is plenty of room under the car for the lion to squeeze under. Megan should be fighting her off with a big knife because the scene doesn't make sense otherwise. There are other annoying little things. The girls are the annoying standard victims who do little more than screaming and arguing. It's odd that this group is led by a new action woman and yet they have the pathetically weak girl victim characters. Instead of crying about one of their rescuer getting killed, grab his gun and shoot back. It's an odd old style B-action movie with a couple of ill-fitting new concepts."}, {"id": 134, "text": "The writer/director MJ Bassett deserves some credit for dealing with the important issue of animal poaching (and human trafficking??) however everything else in this movie is childish, unprofessional and down-right laughable.Nothing in this movie works, the locations, the photography, the acting, the script, it is all if it was a yearly project of high-school film club. One frame there are 5 soldiers in a Jeep and the next there are 20 on the ground. People jump from a cliff and the next cut they go into the water from what clearly is a 2 meter jump, etc etc. Megan Fox is pretty as a flower but her wearing army boots and leading a bunch of mercenaries just doesn't work. Speaking of mercenaries, maybe to be more believable they should not act like little kids; or maybe, you say, they saved on acting talent so they can invest in good CGI and makeup effect? spoiler alert - not a chance. The CGI is one of the worst I've seen in a while.The media that this movie is recorded on should be erased and reused to create some good movie about animal poaching and mercenaries, hopefully by someone who holds a higher bar than the Bassett family. Exact score: 42 / 100"}, {"id": 135, "text": "Rogue is a new action thriller directed, written and produced in part by M.J. Bassett, the director of Solomon Kane and Silent Hill: Revelation.In the film, a squad of mercenaries led by Captain Samantha O'Hara (Megan Fox) is on a mission in a remote African area to save the governor's daughter from a group of rebels. When their escape plan fails, the team becomes trapped in an unfamiliar area with the rebellious group after them, and later they also discover they are dealing with a hostile lioness.Director M.J. Bassett had withdrawn from directing episodes of TV series since directing Silent Hill: Revelation, as her last film was poorly received. With this film she tries to make a comeback as a film director with the help of her daughter. Unfortunately, this film is disappointing again. This film was also intended as a passion project of mother and daughter to show how bad the husbandry of African wild animals is and that it must stop.The story of the film quickly resembles a simple copy of the story of the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Predator from 1987. In contrast to this film, Rogue has hardly any character build-up, so you as a viewer care little about the characters. M.J. Bassett also filmed the action scenes very movingly, so you do not get clear what is happening and characters sometimes seem to die just like that.The special effects are also poorly done in the movie. The lioness is fully portrayed in the second half of the film, but the bad, unrealistic effects make the animal not really scary. Sometimes the lioness even comes across so unrealistic that you can actually laugh about it more. Most of the fire from the explosions in the movie doesn't come across as believable either, and if someone is hit by a bullet from a distance, you'll only see a simple red spot appear on the character.Thanks to the simple script and lack of character construction, the acting is not very visible either. Megan Fox co-played supporting roles in her other films and later more minor roles. With this movie she also seems to be trying to make a comeback as an actress, but this is not done successfully in this movie either. Among the muscular men with camouflage ink or bloody wounds, she doesn't come across as the leader of the team seriously, as she only gets a small scratch above her eye for much of the film."}, {"id": 136, "text": "M. J. Bassett, a director whose best work was also her first (Deathwatch, Wilderness), adds a new film to her portfolio after 7 years of directing only TV episodes. Rogue is a typical, uninspired and problematic thriller, with an (for such a character) unlikely lead actress and the recently more screen-active Megan Fox. Compiled almost entirely of ever-used blueprints &amp; flawed in the execution of it all, Rogue offers very little with any weight, even though its presenting serious issues like animal abuse and human trafficking.The intro leading up to the title screen already functions well as a sample that gives a pretty clear idea of what the next 95 minutes will be like - mighty clich\u00e9 script architecture, dull action sequences, iffy cgi and creature design, cheap comedy, stereotypical and hardly likeable characters, but... Cinematography's decent, which puts the half-cooked cgi in even more shameful position, and acting's allright, I suppose, though it's hard to tell with all these cardboard characters. Megan Fox portrays Samantha O'Hara, an experienced and tough leader of the kind of mercenary gang you've seen in many 'guy flicks' before. Megan Fox, being in the outfit that otherwise has always went on a heroic, skillful and muscular guy with some one-liners in the back pocket, is about the only thing that's not typical about Rogue. The team of mercenaries spend the first act realizing their action-packed mission to rescue hostages, after which everything goes wrong, leading us into a draggy second act, featuring loads of predictabilities, exposition and too long night sequences. Rogue really struggles to generate any suspense, and most of action/kills play out in ineffective and highly foreseeable ways. Throughout the movie, the team of heroes is hunted by a ruthless local gang and later by a couple unintimidating cgi lions, eventually resulting in an underwhelming and empy-feeling third act or climax, topped off with an ending that surprises no one. The main message is received loud and clear, it's wholly agreeable and has to be supported. It's just a shame it's given to us via such an oversimplified screenplay.It really feels, looks and plays out like many guy's flicks, the VOD, straight-to-DVD, B kind. Same elements over and over again. Rogue, clocking in at 105 minutes, feels very stretchy, so stretchy that I believe one could go out of the room for 15 minutes, come back, and still fully understand what's going on in the movie. If you are interested in seeing Megan Fox (in a role as multidimensional as a cucumber), or creature features, or adventure flicks set in Africa, check it out, at your own risk. My rating: 3/10."}], "reviews_amount": 137}
