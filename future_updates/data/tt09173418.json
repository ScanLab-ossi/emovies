The boy was good because there was no supernatural stuff going on. The very alive and crazy Brahm's coming out of the mirror with a creepy mask and a childlike voice was different, scary, and interesting. Doll from first movie ends up being alive and getting boys to do it's dirty work, not even a little bit. I repeat...WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS A HUNDRED TIMES! Child's Play, Annabelle, all of their many unnecessary sequels...why make another one? Why ruin what was unique about this film? Oh, the movie was enough of a hit that you want to make more money with a sequel, but you've supposedly painted yourself in a corner with the ending of the last movie? How about using your imagination. I'm a writer. Here's an idea, off the top of my head. Brahms survives knife attack from first movie. Keeps hiding in the wall with his doll that he put back together. Family comes thinking house is abandoned. Instead of latching onto the boy in the family, he becomes obsessed with the mother, which goes along with his serial killer persona from the first movie. He starts with the manipulating with the doll again, the mother finds the woman from the first film to get the backstory, she comes back to the house to take care of the unfinished business with Brahms, and...go from there. Something like that is more in line with the first story, and if you have the imagination, you could do a lot with that premise to make it a good sequel. Just stick to the first one. Pretend these unnecessary sequels don't even exist. Sigh."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I don't see the horror behind this movie, it feels to me - at most - like a slow haunted doll thriller with the lack of scares. The story is limited, a traumatized family moves to guest house where their kid, Jude finds Brahms the doll in the near forest and things starts to get weird around the family for not following the doll rules.Nothing new here, the screenplay is dull and you can skip full minutes without losing any of the storyline, the character development is awful, the movie is well shot but with the lack of a strong plot it doesn't add much. I think it'd have been a very good film if it was summed into a short film because clearly if they wanted this to succeed as a feature film they could've gone through the trouble of coming up with an interesting new idea or at least a single twist in the story, I believe this movie is an effort and a chance gone wasted. over all it's watchable but won't be enjoyable unless you watch it in 2x speed."}, {"id": 2, "text": "There's a lot to consider when reviewing 'Brahms: The Boys 2'. It would be impossible to do so without going into spoilers for both films unfortunately, so please be warned. As its own film I actually kind of liked it. The problem is that it kind of ruins what made the first film so great. The first film had a great twist where we are led to believe the doll is evil the entire movie, when it reality it is someone in the walls controlling it. Even though that movie had other flaws, that's still a great twist. This movie says screw that the doll was possessed the entire time and was controlling the man in the walls.The film is riddled with dream sequences and needless, unearned jump-scares. The jump-scares were always going to be there, but I still feel dream sequences are the worst thing a horror film can do. They are so lazy and such a cheat. Having one is bad enough, but having multiple ones is inexcusable. The film is never overly scary. There is one sequence where Katie Holmes' character is behind the walls herself that is reasonably tense, but that's about it. The film works more in terms of being an interesting mystery. You know the original's twist and so what you are seeing is not making sense and you are asked to work out what is going on.I had forgotten what a terrific actor Ralph Ineson is. He isn't in a lot of scenes but when he is he is captivating to watch and listen to. I'm a little torn on this film and how I feel about it. It was probably better than I expected going in. I do wish they had kept the supernatural element out of it though, because to me that was the biggest strength of the original. There are a million possessed doll films out there already. All I do know though is that this series is in a better place than the 'Annabelle' one."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The first movie was an astonishing thriller realistically accomplished with just a china doll. Nothing supernatural, what so ever...The squel ruins the whole heritage which the first movie built of."}, {"id": 4, "text": "The story follows a boy who stops speaking after a hime invasion, and finds Brahms buried in the woods. In the original, we were led to believe that the doll was created for the Heelshires after they lost their son, who ended up living in the walls. This movie changes that, and takes away tbe elements that made the first movie good and creepy.This film is predictable with no real plot twist that catches you off guard. The kid is really good though, and if you enjoy movies with cute but creepy kids, then it's worth Redboxing for that.Katie Holmes is okay, the camera angles used in this film were not very flattering a lot of the times, and did not pull off what they were trying to do. Instead of making her look scared or in suspence, she just looked constipated.If you enjoyed the original, don't bother with this one. If you just want a movie with a creepy doll and kid, with a few cheap scares, then I guess you'll find it interesting."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I really dont know why this movie doesnt seem to be appealing to a lot of people I thought it was decent.The acting was good, it kept up a suspenseful atmosphere and managed to make sure you felt tense at all the right times. It was a continuation (obviously) of the boy and while I will admit I thought the first one was better this was still a decent sequel.My suggestion would be to give it a try at least, while i dont think this was a spectacular classic it was in my opinion an enjoyable watch and worth the time to give it a try."}, {"id": 6, "text": "This wasn't the best movie ever but it's an enjoyable hour and a half.There was nothing wrong with the film, it was well made, the acting was fine, had the jumps in all the right places.

It was so fresh and creepy and that TWIST! OMG! \ud83d\ude32So I went in having high hopes for the sequel, especially since I saw it was same writer and director as the first one and they managed to attach Katie Holmes.But I had to say I was highly disappointed with this movie. It checks off all the boxes, but it's kind of slow and pretty predictable. The plot could have been ramped up more as there was no real danger and the scares were pretty generic. And the final twist / 3rd act felt lackluster, especially when you compare to the 3rd act of the original.Again, it's not a bad movie. You'll be entertained. It's just a missed opportunity in my opinion. The script needed a another pass."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Not a matter of weather it's as good as the original. It's seems that both movies are different enough to stand on their own. So I'm guessing the original made enough money to do a sequel, but the original's story does not give much wiggle room for a squeal, so they alter the purpose of the boy so that they can make more movies. It's a story change similar to Friday the 13th part one and part 2 (if you seen those movies, you'll understand ) As for the movie as a stand alone It takes a while to really get to the point where I'm scared. These ghost stories are starting to get lame. They need to go back to killing people without mercy. Not really sure if it's worth just watching Katie Holmes be cute but old for like 70 mins before something horrific happens."}, {"id": 9, "text": "The first film was fairly surprising imo though many hated the twist ending. I thought it worked rather well. This new film rewrites the story with the doll quite a bit and it will work with some and won't with many. The film has an overall similar feel to the first I. Ambience and scares and even gets a bit more demented at times. The cliches are there but if you know what you're getting into it shouldn't be surprising. Overall there are some interesting moments and enough creepiness to be decent enough."}, {"id": 10, "text": "It's a horror film about a doll.

He finds a doll in the woods that he connects and bonds with, but after a while a bond becomes an obsession and strange events are happening all linking back to Brahms. The boy 2 surprised me at how good it was. Great acting and building of tension and much more so lets talk about this.First of all I thought the cinematography and set pieces were great. The films visuals were so intricate and detailed it was really great. They really made you pay attention to the surrounding of the house. And just simple things like the doll blinking, moving its head or smiling were really unsettling and done really well. And the set pieces were fantastic as well. There were some really good locations that were perfect playing grounds for horror. Whether it was the forest, the normal house or the house where boy lived, they had a few good locations instead of sticking to one which was great.They also had a fantastic use of tension throughout and well executed Jumpscares. This film-built tension throughout excellently. As the film progressed, I got more and more tense and on the edge of my seat as the events that were happening got more and more unsettling, I rarely feel like this with horror movie, so this shows how good the film was. There was also some very well executed Jumpscares they managed to balance predictable Jumpscares that you didn't know when they were going to happen and Jumpscares that genuinely took me by surprise and startled me which was very entertaining.My only negatives would be the films lack of plot and rushed beginning. This wasn't the films main priority so I get that they didn't need to deep of a plot as they wanted to build tension over an extended period of time but it would have been nice if they had explored certain things with the plot a little bit more deeply. But my biggest issue for me was the rushed beginning. They set up a really interesting family dynamic rarely seen within horrors but it then very quickly went to them going to the woods and finding the doll. So it would have been better if the film was slightly longer so they could flesh the characters out a bit more at the beginning.My next two positives would be the performances, and the chemistry between the characters making them not the usual dumb character in a horror. Everyone in this film did very good performances. Therefore making all there fear much more believable and just genuinely making the film better as you could invest in the characters more. But the obvious key standouts would be Katie Holmes and Christopher Convery who were both fantastic. The family dynamic and chemistry between the characters was also very believable making you genuinely connect with the characters which is sadly very rare with horrors. It was also a breath of fresh air to have the characters actually think and make good decision throughout. There was no searching through rooms because you hear a sound or anything like that. Brahms followed Jude everywhere, so this helped and the mum only went in the house from the first film when she wanted to rescue her son.My final two positives would be the films attention to detail with social issues involving a traumatic experience and the ending. The film actually tackled some interesting social issues about how children cope with trauma, In this case it was Jude refusing to talk which is how a lot of children cope with these things, this was well explored and a really interesting element to the movie, the ending was also incredibly satisfying, when everything came together and the final showdown with Brahms happened in the house from the first film all the tension and fear that had been built throughout exploded into an action packed and frightening finale where they did some interesting things with Brahms leaving it open to a sequelOverall, despite a couple of issues with the plot and pacing, Brahms the boy 2 was a surprisingly good movie. That built tension very well, tackled interesting issues and had great performances of the year. Considering the lack of competition with the grudge and the turning, the boy 2 is the best horror of the year so far."}, {"id": 18, "text": "I'm givingthis a 6 for, will wait for it 5 minutes before the ending.What crazed mind thought of that!?Bizarrely, hubby like it and it scared him. He didn't see the first movie. He might think differently.The movie is generic. Seen a million times before. Having seen the first one, I was surprised when it was obvious the doll was indeed moving itself. WTH?Katie Holmes tries hard. Camera angles indeed were not flattering as another reviewer mentioned. So much so, I had to look up her birthdate and was shocked to see she was born the same year (1978) as her movie husband. I hate when actors do awful things to their faces. It's distracting on a big screen, but it's distracting, too, when someone isn't aging well. Maybe subtle age-appropriate changes are the best way?But I digress.Anyway, the somewhat shocking reveal was, well shocking.What crazed mind?

That was the twist as far as i can remember. No the doll suddenly decided to be completely supernatural in this part, and no it was not meant to be psychological, the end almost confirmed the doll is supernatural. And this is the biggest hole in the movie. It was confusing all the time, the doll was moving its eyes and smiles, that was creepy but it is not what this doll was supposed to be!

Jude befriends a porcelain yet realistic looking doll, called Brahms.Brahms: The Boy II is a below average film. It totally disregards everything that made The Boy(2016) a memorable horror/thriller movie. Returning director William Brent Bell should not have made this film, in the first place. If it was studio pressure, they should have only made this movie, if the script was as unique as its predecessor. Katie Holmes is great as Liza. Owain Yeoman is brilliant as Sean.

Making sure that Greta was completely losing her mind, forcing her to think the doll was possessed by the spirit of the young Brahms who 'died' in the fire. That was a great idea from start to finish.The second one however, was completely off the scales of origins. It didn't even mention how Brahms dealt with Greta escaping with Malcolm. They just mentioned that he just ended his own life, the directors and writers completely throwing our precious man-by Brahms.I don't even think this movie deserves any ratings at all to be honest, completely throwing the crazy man manipulating those who enters the house out the window!

The film uses every trick in the book and it never succeeds.The performances aren't that good. Everyone tries their best especially Katie Holmes. Ralph Ineson is the most talented of the lot but it's one of those films where even if you got the most talented of actors, they wouldn't be able to save it.

Why would you undo such a great set-up established by the first movie just to tell us a story we've heard already?As far as the acting and the technical aspects, it was all fairly unremarkable. Christopher Convery's a really creepy kid, Katie Holmes is a stressed out mom of the creepy kid, Owain Yeoman is The Supportive but Unhelpful Dad(tm). Typical horror stuff.

This year, director William Brent Bell and writer Stacey Menear join forces again to come up with a new horror adventure featuring the titular the haunted porcelain boy doll Brahms.Severely traumatized by a burglary in their London home, Liza (Katie Holmes) was taken on a long respite in a countryside rest house by her husband Sean (Owain Yeoman). Their son Jude (Christopher Convery), who witnessed the violent assault on his mother, was so shocked that he totally did not talk to anyone anymore after the incident. He could only communicate by writing on his sketchbook.One day, the couple wander from their vacation home to the neighboring abandoned mansion left behind by the Heelshire family. While outside, Jude dug up a porcelain boy doll out from the forest floor, calling him Brahms. From then on, Jude would be obsessed with Brahms, obeying the rules he said the doll set and expecting even his parents to obey them. When an incredulous Liza began to disregard the rules, sinister things begin to happen.Unlike the first movie with the all unknown cast, there was a well-known actress playing the female lead here, and that was Katie Holmes. While she still had film projects over the recent years, she had not been in any popular film ever since she played Rachel Dawes in Batman Begins (2005). She was the target of most of the jump scares and psychological torture throughout the film, and she brought us along her harrowing ride.Owain Yeoman played the supportive and patient husband Sean. Conveniently he was usually absent when something strange happens to Liza, lending doubts to her precarious sanity. Christopher Convery played a very creepy Jude, especially in that grim silent mode whenever Brahms possessed him. Ralph Ineson played Joseph, the mysterious watchman of the grounds, who turned out to know more about things than he was letting on at first (but of course he did).This film was as much about mental health and post-traumatic stress as it was about a good scare. Since Brahms was inanimate, much of the scares were reliant on the indicative musical score, with all those sudden crescendos which were designed to startle. The scene which had me at the edge of my seat was that rough play Jude had with his bully cousin. Even if I already sort of knew what was going to happen, but I still could not bear to watch it play out.While the creep factor was still there overall, this followed a more typical and predictable story line than the first. 5/10."}, {"id": 43, "text": "I was very skeptical when I first saw that they were even making a sequel.

With any luck they go even further and create a franchise, a series of movies made for cheap that generate tons of money for the film studios releasing them. This is great for fans of a movie and even better when the movie is a solid flick. But most second features in a series end up not quite as good as the original. Such is the case with BRAHMS: THE BOY II. If you remember the first film it involved a young woman hired by an elderly couple to watch their son while they went on vacation. Except when she got there the little boy turned out to be a doll. Eventually we learned that there actually was a young boy who had been scarred during a fire now living in the walls wearing a porcelain mask. As the film ended we saw he survived a stabbing by our heroine and was repairing the doll she shattered. The sequel kicks off with mother Liza (Katy Holmes) and her young son Jude (Christopher Convery) surviving a home invasion, leaving both of them traumatized with Jude now not speaking but writing anything he wants to say. Thinking a new setting will help they move to the Heelshires' property with husband/father Sean (Owain Yeoman). This is the property from the first film but not the main house, instead still on the grounds. Once they move in strange things begin to happen. Jude finds Brahms, the doll, buried on the property. Taking him home and cleaning him up his attachment to Brahms deepens daily. He wants Brahms to eat with them, to be served a plate of food. Liz can hear voices coming from Jude's room. Out of the corner of her eye she can see someone run by, thinking it is Jude, only to have Jude come up behind her. Is something actually taking place of is this Liz' method of dealing with the trauma of the break in? Also disturbing is the presence of a caretaker on the grounds named Joseph (Ralph Ineson). Walking the grounds with his shotgun, accompanied by his dog, Joseph talks of things from the past but seems to be hiding something. A shadowy figure, could he be behind some of the things taking place? Eventually Jude finds the old mansion from the first film, guided there by Brahms. Liz finds him and takes him home but not before the feeling of something strange going on there. As things begin to escalate at home, the feeling of security the relocation was supposed to bring declines as does the thought that Brahms is a good way for Jude to communicate. Before decisions can be made by both parents, their options become limited. Is it Liz? Jude? Or is Brahms really making it happen? The movie does a decent job of keeping the tension at peak level throughout. Knowing what we do of the first film we're aware of the dangers that this family is facing. At least we think we do. But this becomes part of the issue, we already know that Brahms survived the first film. But do we? Or have they chosen a different path where Brahms is nowhere to be found and some new evil force is making things happen? Or was Brahms the doll really the cause of everything in both films? All of these options are on the table before finally being revealed. I've always said the sign of a good actor is when you believe they are the character they are playing and don't notice that this is acting. All three of the main actors here do a great job. Holmes has developed into an actress that deserves more and better roles. She's convincing here as Liz and you are concerned for her and the safety of her family. Convery, for his young age and playing most of the film in silence, is perfect as the wide eyed innocent whose life is being taken over. And Yeoman shows again how good he is, something I thought back when he was featured in THE MENTALISTS TV series. So does the film work as a sequel? Yes and no. It is a solid story, the performances are well done and it looks good. But it doesn't have the same impact as the first film did and that film didn't feel worthy of a sequel. Taken on its own the film might be better, without the baggage of the first film. If you go in that way the odds are you'll enjoy this one better than someone who saw that film. It's good for a night's rental and entertainment but I don't see this one moving forward into a complete franchise. Better to stop here."}, {"id": 55, "text": "Bad Ronald anyone?? I liked Bad Ronald as a kid but it wasn't horror to me; it was just unsettling and creepy. Which is why I was not happy when the twist occurred in the first one. I wanted a scary Supernatural story. Not some backwoods-esque, overgrown, boy/man inside a wall....again. (Plus, I can just turn on the Crime Channel for that). He even looked like something out of the People under the Stairs even though his parents were proper and elegant. However, if you didn't see Bad Ronald I can see why you were pleasantly surprised. And using the Boy as a way for him to still feel a part of the family was a good, weird, idea. But to me it was more of a bizarre Criminal Minds episode rather than a Horror movie.Which is why I was happy about where this production was going. I do think it was done well and the acting was good. But yes it was slow and not a lot happened. It could have used more scares, atmosphere, and a kill or two. But I enjoyed it. Including the back story. It kind of reminded me of a 1970's horror back before things got gory. The ending was predictable but most horror movies end that way more often than not. Its rare to have a unique ending this far into the game. It's just something we have to accept with the genre.My suggestion is rent it from Red Box or your Library once they open again.

This is a sequel to the 2016 minor hit 'The Boy' and it is clearly a complete money grab-trying to cash in on the former's popularity. Two of the actors from the original-Lauren Cohan &amp; James Russell-declined invitations to reprise their roles from the original for this turkey. Does that tell you anything? Katie plays a woman that is attacked by house invaders when she is home with her son, Christopher. Both Katie &amp; Christopher are mentally scarred by the attacks, Katie can't sleep without having nightmares and Christopher just quits talking-he can still talk, he just won't. Owain-the husband-decides to move and take the family to live out in the country for a while and guess what abandoned house he chooses? Yep, and when they arrive, Christopher finds Brahms-the doll-and becomes real attached to it. Ralph plays the groundskeeper that walks around with a shotgun. Katie keeps seeing the doll move-is she just imagining it because of her trauma?-but no one else does. Is the doll influencing Christopher? It doesn't matter because it's just not scary. It's rated PG-13 for terror-Ha!-violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 26 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either.

It was however a decent enough Horror film that had an interesting story, a nicely executed plot twist, it was well shot in excellent settings and the acting was perfectly fine; even the characters, bar Cole, seemed to have avoided the one dimensional curse of the Horror film. By all rights The Boy should have been allowed to slip into the forgotten space where all 'just fine' Horror films go, largely omitted from the public conscience in ten years or so leaving the greats such as 'Nightmare on Elm Street', Exorcist' and more recently The Conjuring' to be remembered. So when it was announced that The Boy would be getting a sequel it was a bit perplexing as to why. Whilst The Boy was technically a financial success, earning over $60 million against a $10 million budget it was nothing overly impressive and despite the ending being left open for a sequel it would have hardly been the first film to not follow through with such a promise. However the possibility of a good story in a sequel was there, a new family moving into the Heelshire manor and having to suffer Brahms' tyranny, spurned perhaps by his jealousy at watching a young mother dote on her children, or him once again falling in his own twisted version of love would have made for decent viewing. A game of cat and mouse viewed from both sides could have offered an interesting and refreshing film, especially if effort had been put into exploring Brahms' psyche and how months of isolation after Greta's escape had made it deteriorate even further. Seeing how the villain from the previous film functions and works behind the walls would likely be what anyone who had watched the previous film expected when they went into the cinema. That is not what they got however; rather than focusing on arguably the best part of the last film, Brahms the human, the film decides to undo everything the last film did and instead reveals that Brahms the doll, is the villain of this film and was in fact, retrospectively, the true villain of the original as well. The film offers Brahms the doll as a possessed effigy that has been convincing children to murder loved ones for literal centuries because, well just because. In the last ten minutes it is revealed that Brahms the doll, who was destroyed with no consequence beyond angering Brahms the human in the previous film, is a vessel for a demon, monster, ghost; what it actually is is not explained and even if it had been it wouldn't matter. When the head of Brahms is smashed by the father in the film, an attempt at something frightening and grotesque is discovered underneath despite being absent in the last film, however even this revelation falls flat as the design of the creature is not effective and is simply not frightening, looking more like a melted red jelly baby than anything worth loosing sleep over. The acting is what you would expect, acceptable, I wouldn't ask any actor to read a script like this and give an all consuming performance and even if they did the glaring flaws in the script would simply detract from it. Katie Holmes as the mother does just fine, the father is typical and the son hardly speaks so bad child acting is largely avoided at least until the cousins arrive. Visually the film is at an extreme disadvantage, rather than also taking place in the Heelshire manor which comprised of dark hallways and leering portraits of psychotic children this film is set in one of the never mentioned before guesthouses. Never mind that anyone from England would look at the architecture and laugh if you expected them to believe any guest house on any historical estate anywhere in England would look like that but the guesthouse is nothing but white walls and large windows, its simply too bright to be ominous. At first I thought that perhaps they had changed locations for budget constraints but both films had the same budget and the original manor features later in the film so why they moved away from a setting that added tension and atmosphere to their project for a setting that would fit nicely into a romantic comedy remains a mystery. It's simply another example of this film taking the best working elements of the previous film and burying them in the dirt with only a single hand sticking out. All in all this film failed miserably. There where definite elements of the original film that could have lead to a perfectly acceptable sequel. However for reasons unknown the writers decided to do a complete 180 degree turn and back track on the revelation that there was no supernatural element in The Boy. We have endured the doll being possessed by the spirit of a dead child to the child never died and has grown into an adult who has been manipulating the whole situation to the doll is possessed and it was controlling the boy who didn't die. It is for lack of a better word stupid. Unfortunately for The Boy, a perfectly acceptable movie, it's descent into the forgotten has now been halted. I'm not going to suggest that Brahms; The Boy 2 is going to make it so that The Boys will be remembered however it will always be associated with its much lesser sequel. There was more than enough left after The Boy to make a good film, with honest work it might even have been able to be better than the first however any chance of an enjoyable sequel was thrown away by a stupid plot and confusing choices. Lets be honest, no one really cared that much in the first place so it speaks volumes that despite such low expectations people have still been left so disappointed."}, {"id": 141, "text": "The movie was very very boring and all the events are expected even the speech, No production cost has been paid.

For the majority of the film, very little of interest happens: youngster Jude (Christopher Convery) glowers menacingly as antique doll Brahms slowly takes hold of him, he draws worryingly violent pictures, and refuses to eat his dinner. Brahms switches on the television, and turns his head when no-one is looking. Hardly what I would call bowel-loosening horror!After much dull stuff and nonsense, in which Holmes, as Jude's mother Liza, struggles to look suitably concerned or scared, and absolutely no-one dies (a boy has a nasty accident, as much his fault as it is Jude's or Brahms'), director William Brent Bell delivers a rushed final act in which the demonic doll is easily defeated by being thrown in a furnace.A dumb ending sets things up for a third film -- straight to DVD/streaming service next time, I suspect.2.5/10, rounded up to 3 for the subtle changes in Brahms' expression as Liza checks the doll for a serial number, but minus one point for all of the sudden loud noises that take the place of genuine scares."}, {"id": 143, "text": "This film start with woman Liza attack by an unknown person, and her son Jude suffering mutism scene!

The film received all-round negative reviews, and only took $20 million at the box office, compared to first film's $74 million.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. So, at the end of 'The Boy', we learnt the doll was not possessed. It was, in fact, just an ordinary doll, as Brahms was an actual person - still very much alive - living within the walls of the mansion. So, if it was just a doll, why is it possessed now? Is the film now going the direction we all thought it would in the first film? It felt all too much like an 'Annabelle' or 'Child's Play' wannabe.We have the same director. The same premise. The same location (at times). So why does this film feel so different? The haunting atmosphere that was so effective in the first film, is gone. The effective jump scares are gone. The originality is gone. Instead, the film contains cliche upon cliche and felt like a rehash of films I've seen before, notably the aforementioned films. There's even a feeling of 'The Amityville Horror' here, especially with the house's back story.It's also a bit disconcerting seeing a boy of Jude's age so attached to a doll. It was completely understandable in 1988's 'Child's Play', as the child was very young still. Or did Jude become possessed himself? By a possessed doll? I didn't find the acting all that believable. The father, Sean, was a very calm, understanding character - pretty much the same throughout the film, regardless of what happened. The mother, Liza, was an unpleasant character for most of the movie. There was very little character development. For such a short film (86 minutes), there was an incredible sense of deja vu, as if they indeed had run out of ideas. As if they quickly wanted to cash in on the success of 'The Boy'.By the time the film reached the climax, the final scene was so reminiscent of Chucky's death in 'Child's Play' that I was convinced they wanted to create another doll franchise.

But in this movie, the doll is supernatural, as in, more controlling the boy's mind. It sometimes moves its eyes and head but not a lot.

A lot of reviews indicate there is little carried over from the original, but in fact there's quite a lot. Also remember most of the critics hated the original as well, a fact I've never been able to reconcile.The original worked so well because, unlike most thrillers in this horror subgenre, most notably Annabella, The Boy plays out on a more psychological level of horror and pure mystery. It also helped that Lauren Cohan's performance was good enough to stretch believability when Greta, the heroine she played, fell under the doll's spell herself. To have her on the run from an abusive relationship was a subplot that worked to the original's advantage, spiking the tension and the stakes for all involved.With The Boy II, we have another good structural, psychological subplot and a another above-par actress, Katie Holmes, without whom, quite frankly, I don't think this picture would be worth a watch. Holmes has been known to elevate shaky material in the past (Abandon most notably) and she doesn't do the celebrity-walk-on here --- she's committed to portraying a damaged character, this time the victim of a brutal home invasion, which adds a creepy weighty touch of brutality and danger to a film that's lightweight by virtue of genre alone.In this sequel, the doll effects are subtler and perhaps more creepy because of it. The big problem with Boy II is that, unlike the original, it relies on demonic possession --- whereas the original explained everything away in non-supernatural terms, increasing the horror and power of the story considerably.If you're looking for a movie with the scare factor of Child's Play, neither Boy movie measure up.... they're simply on another, less visceral creep-out plane.There are good performances by Christopher Convery, as Jude, who smartly underplays the bad seed role convincingly, and the always fine Ralph Ineson.It's in the last third of the film where Brahms history is unearthed that things go awry and the SFX team goes into full-tilt overload trying to impress each other and things go downhill fast. I was hoping for a suitably non-happy ominous ending --- what we get is yet another predictable pasted on excuse for another sequel --- that tied back to the home invasion in some way, but it's probably too much to expect.I have a hunch that, as the writer and director are the same as in the original (never a bad thing) that this ending was forced on the filmmakers. iTunes has a director's cut and an alternative ending (that I have yet to explore) if you purchase the movie. I wouldn't recommend that unless you're a fan of the original, but it will be interesting to see if the vision of the creators of The Boy produced something a bit more satisfying than what we've gotten in the theatrical cut."}, {"id": 194, "text": "The writer of this movie should stay away from making new movies as far as he can.

And it seems the writers couldn't think of a way to keep the doll in the movie long enough without calling upon the dumb parent trope. At every given opportunity that it becomes clear someone should remove the doll from the house because of the creepy events or the child's unhealthy relationship with the doll, there the son goes--carting away the doll like a spoiled brat whilst the mother is left to clean up an eerily destroyed living room after getting a morbid threat from the doll.

The film itself seemed to have no point to it or why it was needed in the first place. At least if it offered some gore, a decent body count or more scenes like the one with the cousin bullying Jude would've been ace.

This follow-up has been on our radar for some time, yet has been knocked around schedule-wise. Originally set to play theaters in July and December 2019, it finally made its way to the graveyard of films that are the first two months of the year.I wanted to absolutely adore this movie, but I walked away only liking it. That's because the beauty of its predecessor was that while it seemed like a supernatural film, there was an even more unsettling reality as to why Brahms, the porcleain boy, could move, communicate and impact his surroundings.In this installment, the film goes all-in on the otherworldly, sometimes to its credit (the gleefully unhinged look of the villain once his face has been destroyed) and often to its detriment. In all elevated horror, it seems that the true enemy isn't the gnawing unknown existing just on the side of our consciousness, but bad marriages and worse parenting. Liza (Katie Holmes, of whom my wife inquired, Why is she doing this movie?) and Sean seem as if they've had a divide between them since their son Jude was born. He's a sensitive soul, the kind that enjoys pranking his mother for no good reason before a home invasion renders their lives worse than it was before.Between Liza's head injuries, Jude getting shellshocked and Sean seeming not to care at all, the family moves to the country. Obviously, money is not one of their dilemmas. Settling in at the guest house of the first film's Heelshire estate, they soon meet Jospeh (Ralph Ineson, who post-The Vvitch is the go-to for strangely off UK-based character acting).Moments later, Jude has stopped his precious handwriting instead of speaking and unearthed Brahms from his earthen grave. While Jude's therapist sees having the plaything as a positive at first, by the end of the film, the rules of owning Brahms have led to a brutal game of croquet and canine decimation.While the film has a call back scene to the drowing in the first movie, you don't need to know that story to watch this. Neither Laura Cohan or James Russell returned, due to scheduling conflicts and not wanting the role.This will probably be streaming by the time I finish writing this review, but it was a pleasant enough filmgoing experience. There's an end sequence that reminded me of the much more harrowing doll scene in Argento's Deep Red, but I really did enjoy the closing moments.So few modern horror films get the opportunity to become franchises, compared to the movies of my teen years. Brahms: The Boy II engages in world building and trying to place a reason for all the madness, but in my opinion, the unanswered nature of the first film was a much more horrific experience."}, {"id": 211, "text": "Brahms: The Boy II is a 2020 American supernatural horror film starring Katie Holmes, Ralph Ineson, Owain Yeoman, and Christopher Convery.

Who, now traumatised by the ordeal only speaks with a notepad.The film relies too much on dream sequences and jump scares and not enough on genuine frighting moments, which are much more effective. I felt the film for the most part was more about the family dynamic of the two parents and the son, with horror moments placed in between without much effort.As the film begins it's third act, some revelations are revealed that, as other users have mentioned, tarnish the original films ending and make you question what the filmmakers were thinking. The films strong points in my opinion are the performances of the three leads, who are clearly giving their all despite what they are working with.

I was late to the game with the first one, but after seeing it, I really enjoyed it. I didn't necessarily think it was the best film, but it did some really good things. I ended up having an afternoon off from work and decided to check this out. The synopsis is after a family moves into the Heelshire Mansion. Their young son makes friends with a life-like doll called Brahms.We start this movie off with Liza (Katie Holmes) coming home from work. In the background we see someone out of focus as she is calling out to her son. She goes into the kitchen where he scares her. His name is Jude (Christopher Convery). The both of them call her husband and his father, Sean (Owain Yeoman). The two settle in for the night, but something wakes up Liza. They're the victim of a home invasion.It then shows us the aftermath. Liza is having nightmares and refuses to talk about it to anyone. Jude hasn't talked since the incident. He's going to see a Dr. Lawrence (Anjali Jay) to help get over the events of that night. It is decided though they're going to move out of the city for awhile.This takes them to what used to be a guest house to a large manor. They take the place and try to settle in with this change of pace. The family goes for a walk through the woods and Jude hears whispering. This leads him to digging up an old porcelain doll. The parents also find the house from the original movie and together they encounter Joseph (Ralph Ineson) and his dog. Jude is allowed to keep the doll, but after his mother cleans it up.She notices during this that it's been broken and repaired. I don't recall if that happened in the previous movie, but I feel like it did. Regardless, she gives it to Jude and he also discovers a letter that comes with it giving its 10 rules. Liza isn't a fan of it, but when Jude starts to make progress, it becomes a struggle of the fear of the creepy doll that tells Jude his name is Brahms or preventing him from getting better. Things start to get quite weird with some of the drawings that Jude does or he's slowly starting to look more and more like his new favorite doll.What is really interesting to me is how low of a rating I saw for this after leaving the theater on the Internet Movie Database. I was also equally shocked to see that the director was the same from the first movie, William Brent Bell, and the same writer, Stacey Menear. The reason I say this is the fact that nothing gets under my skin more than violating continuity for a movie with a sequel. I think there might be slightly some of this, but I actually think this does well in deepening the story without doing that in major ways.I'm going to be non-spoiler here and I don't really think there's enough to go spoiler either. This movie though does do some things I really liked. What I want to go over first would be our three leads first. First we have Liza. She's 'normal' until the attack through the home invasion. I like that she becomes the one who is more against Brahms, but she's also an unreliable person. Even her husband gets to the point where he is questioning her more than Jude and I like that. It is subtle though where it is believable.I want to shift to Jude next here. Much like his mother, he's traumatized by this event and his way of coping is to not talk. He has a pad of paper he writes things down on to communicate. His parents are being patient and even more so when Dr. Lawrence tells them not to push so he doesn't go farther into his shell. It becomes a strange duality that Liza is noticing some dark aspects to her son, but he is also showing progress. I thought that was an interesting thing to explore here.Since I'm not going to spoil, I'll tip toe around what happened in the first and how this works into this one. I do like they're using the same place, doll and that the events really did happen. We even get them introduced through some investigation and explanation. That was all good for me. It would be hard to do something like they did in that one so I like what they do and the history that is revealed about this doll as well. For me, it worked. I do think it is slightly a cheat, but I'm willing to overlook if I'm honest.Moving this to the pacing, this is where I had my biggest problem. I just had trouble paying attention to this for the most part. That's not to say it was boring, because I don't feel that is the case. I think that it really does well in establishing our characters, getting them to new place where the doll is found. This section is where I lost some interest. It is funny though, the original had the main character that was following the rules where this one they're being violated pretty much constantly. I think that's where part of my issues comes from. There really isn't much in the way of repercussions for that. It might have been better suited to have Liza or even Sean tormented differently than what we got. I was on board though for the research and thought that the ending worked as well.Taking this to the acting I thought it was pretty solid. There's something interesting that Holmes stars here. She seems to be the only one that is not British, even though it takes place in the United Kingdom. It doesn't hurt anything and I think she had a good performance. It was something I just thought of while watching this as it is never addressed. Yeoman was solid as the 'stable' parent who tries to be peace keeper. I also thought that Convery was really good. What is interesting is we see him normal briefly, then for most of the movie he has to convey things with his facial expressions. We slowly see him change to be more like Brahms as things progress which I thought was great. Ineson was solid along with the rest of the cast to round this out for what was needed.As for the effects in this one, I actually really don't have much negative to say if I'm honest. From what I remember in the original, the doll seemed to move, but we never saw it. This one we actually get to see the doll move and with the explanation that comes, it makes we wonder now if that was also possible in the original as well, at least at times. This can be subtle sometimes which makes it even better. I say this with a scene in the dark with a flashlight that I thought I saw something that did creep me out. There is a bit of CGI, not enough to bother me. It really seemed to enhance if memory serves. The last thing would be something that happens at the end I thought was a cool look. The cinematography I thought was really good though. They really use the whole frame where we will see things in the background that are blurry to be a bit unnerving, as well as seeing things move as well.The last thing to go over would be the soundtrack. From what I can remember, it fit for what was needed on the whole. What I wanted to bring up is that early on, Jude is playing a little piano and I'm pretty sure the song he's playing was used in the previous film. That is a good callback and then we get to see something at the main house as well which I'm assuming was that sheet music. It is an older song which makes it even better.Now with that said, I tried to come in without any expectations and having only seen the original once, I was a pretty blank slate. Do I think this is a great film? No, but I think it does some good things. I like the depth of the characters and the actor performance in bringing them to life. There are some interesting back-story elements that are introduced with minimal violation of continuity. The effects worked for what was needed and I'd say that the soundtrack fit as well. The only issue I really had here was that I found it to be a bit boring for whatever reason and I think it is what they focused on. I would say though this is slightly over average for me. Not great, but as a sequel it works and could be watched as a stand alone which I find impressive."}, {"id": 214, "text": "It's too my extreme surprise that I'm going to say this. Especially considering it's the sequel to a overly mediocre disappointment. But not only is it the best horror film released this year but also the scariest that I've seen since the original conjuring. The film centers around a family that survives a traumatizing home invasion. They decide to take a trip into the country unfortunately to stay in the guest house by the mansion from the original movie. Almost as soon as they get there the young boy, Jude played by an impressive Christopher Convery who has been mute since the incident discovers Brahms buried in the woods. Upon bringing him home stuff gets weird. Now I don't want to spoil anything by saying to much but this is the movie I wanted the first time around. The movie is smartly directed by William Brent Bell and has stunning cinematography and an atmospheric score. All of those goods are accompanied by some of the strongest work from Katie Holmes in a while. And Owain Yeoman who stars as her husband Sean is just gorgeous. For the first third the film is filled with a lot of jump scares and loud musical ques. But by the middle its build an effective atmosphere of mounting dread. If I had one complaint I would say that the ending is just a touch lackluster. That being said this is a scary movie. It might be because I went in with no expectations but I really liked it.

That first film makes the events in this film impossible. So it looks like this is just a reboot attempt since Brahms is a very spooky looking doll and could probably sell horror movie tickets if the theme is franchised, except, to tell you the truth, this film is a bit of a bore.The backstory is that there is a burglary that somehow traumatizes the young son in the family, although the details of this trauma are never told. So the family goes out to the country to regroup. The young son, who has simply stopped talking due to the burglary/assault, digs up the porcelain doll Brahms. He begins to bond with Brahms, as his parents sulk around the house, I guess feeling bad that they could not protect their son? So they let things go since at least the son is showing interest in something, but things get weird. Oh, and all you see of the burglar in the short scene dedicated to the incident is a shadow that makes it appear that the perpetrator was Popeye the Sailor.There are some dream sequences that go nowhere as far as the story goes because it seems that there is not enough story here to flesh out a feature film length production. I would say don't waste the price of a movie ticket on this one.

It was not a typical sequel and really could be a stand alone film and maybe it would have been better received if it had been. Katie Holmes give a solid performance as does Ralph Ineson who give it a very authentic vibe as both an Englishman and what I would call a tragic character. . It references the first movie without overdoing it in a way that makes it mysterious and something to be solved. The ending of the 2016 movie is not only explained but also has a twist that I don't think most saw coming. A good performance by Owain Yeoman as a caring and loving husband and father. Christopher Convery plays the part of the young boy Jude and makes it believable which is not always easy for a child in a horror/thriller movie. Sequels are always hard to pull off without it becoming a clique so I was surprised that it didn't follow the typical sequel movie. While it may have had some over dramatic touches it was not done so often that you get bored with the tension building. It does suffer some of modern day horror/thrillers and it is that of the loud noise jump scare which is used too much in modern horror and there was some of that in here. But, I don't think it was overly done IMO and someone else may think it is because it is hard to tell or know how many are too many and I did not think it took away from the story. I really like the history or mythology that is explained in it. I thought it made for a more interesting movie. There was at least one scene I would have done differently because the scene can be seen as too coincidental on purpose and I would have had it come about in a more believable way. All in all, it was a solid movie that told a story. As for the ending, that is for discussions on YouTube and other places.

One thing is for sure, you can't go around breaking Brahms' rules else you'll make him extremely mad! The film takes the typical clich\u00e9 role that one parent (the mother) can see everything and the other (the father) is completely clueless and deep down, he thinks she's going a little bit mad. As the Mother gets whacked over the head by burglars in the beginning of the film, it has you questioning whether what she is seeing/experiencing is actually real or is she simply having repeatedly nightmarish visions/flashbacks of the earlier attack? When the family get a visit from their relatives, it goes without saying that Brahms isn't happy with anybody encroaching his space. I feel the film has had some unfair criticism. I can't really pick any fault with the acting, it's carried out with a lot of realism and sincerity. The story takes you on the usual horror adventure of loud sounds, mysterious actions and jump-scares.

I wish I hadn't.This time another family end up 'looking after' the creepy doll of an old fashioned little boy and the young child of the family starts acting weirdly. About the only person I knew in the film was Katie Holmes, who - sorry! - is looking very old these days. Plus there's a guy in the UK version of 'The Office' who is normally very funny (but wasn't here).If you've ever watched any sort of media that makes fun of the horror genre by pointing out every cliche and trope associated with such entertainment then you might as well be watching this film. It's amazing that a story can be written (unironically) that thinks it can be taken seriously while conforming to every stereotype known to the genre. The mother suspects something's wrong. No one believes her. Father blames the son. Plot points are started and don't go anywhere. The acting is substandard in places and there's a 'bully' who comes into the tale about half way through who is about the biggest cliche every known to film. Seriously, he's so one-dimensional that you can't help but laugh - then you remember that this is supposed to be serious and then everything bursts. Luckily, he's only in it for about five minutes, but his performance is so awful the film can do little after that to redeem itself.'Brahams: The Boy II' isn't really a bad-bad film. Put it this way... if it was the only horror film ever made it would be the greatest in its genre.

There were so many times when I just thought well if I had made this I would have (insert better idea here) and that's never a good thing, especially for someone like me who doesn't tend to dissect the technical aspects of a movie on the first or even second viewing.I do adore Katie Holmes, but she's given absolutely nothing to work with here. It really makes me wonder what made her take this role although I'm glad she's willing to do horror of any sort. I also wonder what the hell she did to piss off the costume designer because she has the worst series of ill fitting sweaters this side of a 1997 Sears holiday catalog. Like girl, where the hell were your gays while you were filming this because I know you have plenty of them!Really the only saving grace is that it's a very visually good looking film and that would possibly be enough for a home viewing, but it left me with a total yawn in the theater.

Perhaps it helped, but the result and verdict in the end is still below average. William Brent Bell has had a rocky road as a director in the horror genre, his most famous work is probably the first part of The Boy, which was certainly a notch or two better than its sequel. Having seen all of his movies, my personal favorite of his is the indie werewolf flick Wer. However, Bell's newest, Brahms: The Boy II, is a lackluster, an uninspired, slow and dull exercise of clich\u00e9s with some amount of lost potential in the middle.I noted somebody somewhere saying how Brahms, as a sequel, nicely expands the mythology. Sure, it does, with the help of a story that feels both poor as an original plot and a poor excuse for a sequel. Brahms starts with a short introduction to a family, which suffers a violent house robbery. The tragedy-stricken family then moves out to the countryside, right beside the house of trouble from the first movie. Boy finds the doll, the evil flourishes slowly so slowly until the predictable and short-fused climax &amp; a typically pushed-in setup for another possible continuation. Brahms exercises all the usual horror tropes, it's not on-the-nose bad or cheap about it, but does it in a tedious run-down-the-mill manner with every next step more predictable than the previous. For many inexperienced genre fans Brahms could work like a decent thriller. The man, excuse me, doll of the hour has a creepy aura about it, and, perhaps, given a better story and more extreme direction, it'd make a decent modern horror icon of sorts. The actor ensemble does a decent job at portraying their rather familiar type of characters. Katie Holmes owns the highlight, and I always love seeing Ralph Ineson in just about any horror movie - the man deserves more roles, bigger roles. The technical/aesthetical departments of the movie work on a standard level, there's nothing truly impressive or anything that'd suggest and extraordinary creativity, but the production design and cinematography sure are done well enough.I fail to see the fear, scares or much of anything of memorable value in Brahms: The Boy II as it is just a standard, clich\u00e9 pg13 horror movie about a creepy doll and happenings around it.

This story thrives on the creeps, acting, and franchise frenzy, hoping you'll ignore the previous installment and welcome the new direction. Some of these things work well, but overall the movie suffers from focusing on potential franchise and skimping on the stories and development other movies have succeed in. Throw in that the scare factor and the suspense are very lacking and you are once again bored in this tale that held potential and dropped it again. The Boy legacy continues to dance around maximizing scares and hybridizing other franchises to craft a haunting legacy that can leave more of a print. Yet, the movie will continue to be mediocre movie productions without tightening up the story and injecting a little originality and development into it.

In particular, all kinds of otherworldly guests adore children's toys, so that with their help they will interest the kids and, perhaps, try to take hold of their body and mind. That's why various dolls for many centuries have become objects of increased attention from occultists and demonologists of all stripes, who have written more than one book based on their research. In addition to folklore and frightening stories later told around the campfire, the cursed dolls also firmly occupied themselves with cinema, where they could boldly single out their own sub-genre of horror. At one time, the infamous Chucky, the main antagonist of Child's Play brought a serious rustle to the audience. Then in his footsteps went the cursed Annabelle, fluttering out from the Conjuring universe, having her own trilogy of box office spin-offs. When the abundance of deadly mystical toys reached truly sinister limits, the director William Brent Bell decided to join in with his movie under the title  The Boy. The film turned out to be very unusual on the one side in terms of frightening elements, but on the other it contained an element of scenario surprise, partly deconstructing a sub-genre of damned demonic dolls. And five years after the premiere, Bell returned to the big movie again with a completely new sequel Brahms: The Boy II, which, unlike the first part, brought an unexpected turn in the story of the doll named Brahms. Honestly, I even thought to skip the film, because based on the story that have been told in the first movie, it was supposed that everything should be pretty clear, and also if considering the fact that the film got a lot of negative reviews. But it wasn't there, I didn't expect anything, but as a result I loved the film. Great sequel no matter what other say!

The guest house they were in for most of the movie didn't add anything to the atmosphere -- it was just a normal, vanilla house.

It is always good to have plenty spooky props, however, if you stuff the frame only with creepy stuff it will soon get boring. That's exactly what was bothering me entire movie: no backstory or simple unveiling of reasoning - just events that mostly happen behind the scenes relying on your imagination and a confusing finale.The actual horror stories of the past were quickly mentioned and this gave hope for at least a bloody massacre but again the gun was loaded with blanks. This teasing simply delivered a killing blow and left a huge emptiness in the place where I was supposed to harbor my before sleep terrors.I will say only this: if it was some kind of origin story - it has miserably failed to hook us with a cheap plastic bait.

I blame that completely on the director.

Granted her lines, character, and situations her character gets into can all be rather predictable- but she does give the performance all she can, and I have to give her credit for at least trying. Besides that, this film is honestly a joke. Most of my complaints of this film come from the films final act, but the first two acts of this film are incredibly dull and provide nothing but a dragged out setup to make this film even exist in the first place. It feels like a cash grab so often, that I honestly wondered if anyone making this film behind the camera did it for any other reason than money. Finally, the main issue I wanted to address, was the last third of this dreaded film. Not only does this film contradict the original in so many ways that it begs some questions, but it also contradicts itself. There are a few moments to the end that clearly make no sense, with the dad acting like he just found out about everything he had already been told. Not only is this moment ridiculous, and serve only as a reason for him to come into the frame when needed, but the constant illogical measures it goes through trying to counter the original film is incredibly annoying and honestly ruins it all together. I won't spoil what they did exactly, but needless to say it doesn't make any sense, as with the very last scene of the film where all logic just seems to be completely thrown out the window.

The only real redeeming factor in The Boy, to me, was the concept and in this one, in an effort to up the stakes, they completely ruin what made the original interesting. There's one moment especially that's just groan inducing because of how much nonsense it is in this universe.Rules are a big thing for me. A movie can build whatever universe it wants, establish whatever rules it wants, but then it has to live in those rules in order to work. The Boy built this universe and set the rules. Brahms takes those rules, crumpled them all up and tosses them in the trash and that just doesn't work.We have Katie Holmes here as our leading lady and she was just bad. Her partner in the film, Owain Yeoman, is doing what he can and he's ok? The child actor, Christopher Convery, does some child acting.
