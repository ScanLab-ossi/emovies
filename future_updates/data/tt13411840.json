The tier 1 nations should be ashamed and right this wrong now."}, {"id": 5, "text": "What an amazing, eye opening watch into Pacific rugby.

Dan Leo gives light to such an important topic and Callum Drummond's cinematography brings the story to life in an amazing way."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Tier One administrators need to watch this doc and hang their head in shame at the appalling treatment of Tier 2 nations. Added to that the internal greed of the Pacific Islanders own administrators who appear to be prime ministers etc and you see the appalling treatment of players who are used and abused and ultimately thrown away once they retire. Sadly these players if they have any sense aspire to play for tier 1 nations rather than their own countries due to the money and being able to provide for their families.Dan Leo does a great job in this doc highlighting the disparity that exists and I hope it will help their cause."}, {"id": 7, "text": "A brilliantly-made documentary on a minimal budget.

What is required is a much more even playing field and in turn enhance the values that rugby aligns itself within the game."}, {"id": 43, "text": "Eye-opening and concerning programme about the failure of our sport to uphold it's own principles.

World rugby is sadly failing the pacific island rugby players, and more needs to be done to address equal pay and voting status.

I have. Happy to do so to watch superstars from the Pacific Islands. Guess what? They won't see any of it. These stars light up our our leagues as well as the international competitions.

All power to Dan Leo and the work he's doing, despite the cost to his career and the personal risks involved.

As a proud Welsh rugby fan, someone who includes Faletau as one of their favourite players, this highlighted to me what damage was being done to rugby in the Pacific Islands. At no fault of the players. More people need to be aware of the magnitude of the problem so World Rugby can be forced to stop the problem here.

Very well put together and credit Daniel for speaking up and being the spearhead to help PI players who are taken advantage of, not just at home but across the world."}, {"id": 63, "text": "An extremely informative, emotive &amp; at times shocking documentary about the plight of Pacific Islands Rugby, the massive amount of high quality players they produce for the world game. The current World Rugby system, which smacks of a colonial past, exploits these nations &amp; the players when they should be supporting &amp; developing the game for the benefit of all. T1 nations must do more &amp; give T2 nations a fair share of game receipts as a minimum. The fact the the World Rugby CEO made a disparaging comment about 'what really is a tier 2 nation' in his interview shows the ignorance which exists. Highly recommend any rugby fan views this film."}, {"id": 64, "text": "This documentary is a must-see for those who like rugby and those who don't. A real eye-opener and a very important watch.

The rugby world must stand together to right these wrongs. Well done Dan on all you are doing"}, {"id": 67, "text": "The eternal rugby question is surely: - Did God make Pacific Islanders to play rugby? OR Did God invent rugby for the Pacific Islanders? In many ways the answer is immaterial. Just thank God both exist.Sadly their treatment by World Rugby is not God like. Dan Leo's film shows how poorly they are treated. They are men of faith who value family and friendship. In fact they treat friends as family. (I have been blessed by knowing many PIs.) This documentary tore my heart in two.

It has been made by former Manu Samoa player &amp; Pacific Welfare CEO Daniel Leo. When our Pacific nations rugby teams perform poorly, many of us often lay blame squarely on the management &amp; governance. While crucial improvements must be made in those areas, Daniel's documentary shows the unfairness and inequities that are built into international rugby bodies and governance structures, that effectively work to suppress Pacific rugby unions, teams, players and the game at large. Despite rugby's public image of inclusion, egalitarianism and offering a step up for Pacific players, the worldwide structure does not live up to its glossy reputation. Watch it for yourself to see, if these inconsistencies are akin to modern day colonialism, slavery or structural racism, as inferred or argued by some of the film's commentators."}, {"id": 72, "text": "The film was wonderfully produced and loved the setting.

A must watch for diehard and casual fans, and will even provide great insight to non sport fans."}, {"id": 82, "text": "An important documentary that lays bare the way developed rugby Nations have exploited small island states rugby and corrupted the administrators.

This is a must watch and paints World Rugby in a particularly bad light - pressure needs to stay on them to change it!

Dan shows a side of rugby that is ignored and brushed under the carpet. Professionally made, produced and can't recommend it highly enough."}, {"id": 87, "text": "An uncomfortable view of the state rugby in the pacific islands, who contribute so much to our great game. Although they provide the majority of professional rugby players around the world, the pacific islands are left to beg and plead for scraps at the table, where world rugby continue to capitalise from them and exploit them by providing no funding or support, and radically skewed contributions to the visitors in the rare occasions where they are afforded the opportunity to play tier 1 nations out of a World Cup year (Samoa vs england at Twickenham, for example). World rugby's neglect of the pacific islands, combined with the corruption and poor administration in-house means that more and more talented players are forced to chase their dreams abroad where they can earn a decent living for themselves and their families, weakening their home nations, strengthening their adopted nations and moving further away from a global game than ever before.

Almost 30 years as a huge rugby fan and I didnt know almost any of what was covered. I'm grateful to know now, but I really don't like knowing it.

Change must happen to give more support to the Pacific Islanders and tier 2 nations but hopefully this amazing documentary is a step in the right direction"}, {"id": 114, "text": "Phenomenal documentary on the powerhouses of World Rugby keeping the tier 2 nations exactly where they want them. Exploitation of Pacific Island players is rife, given their contribution to the game. Incredibly bold of Pacific Rugby Players Welfare to bring these fundamental inequalities in the game to light!!"}, {"id": 115, "text": "Oceans apart is utterly eye opening. It says a lot about the divide between tier 1 and 2/3 nations and leaves you wanting to do more than just speak about this disappointing situation. The Pacific offer some of the best players in the world and they deserve so much more. Rugby minded or not please give this a watch and make up your own mind on what needs to be done to help develop the game we all love."}, {"id": 116, "text": "Excellently written and produced documentary highlighting the struggles that Pacific Island rugby players go through to play for their country.

This documentary brings, at last, the inequalities and exploitation behind the Flying Fijians, Manu Samoa and Tonga to the wider public consciousness. Passionately told by those at the coalface, at personal risk in many cases, campaigner and ambassador Dan Leo exposes hypocrisy and corruption at the heart of the international game. This film lays bare the myth that rugby's values set it apart as the true beautiful game."}, {"id": 120, "text": "Being a massive rugby fan &amp; having played with/against my fair share of Fijians over the years whilst serving in the Army. I've always had an interest in Pacific Nations rugby due to their personality, contribution &amp; flair.This documentary highlights how badly treated the Pacific Nations rugby unions are treated &amp; it is not only shocking but a real shame.We should be working with these nations to make them stronger &amp; allow them to be more competitive on the international stage. Allowing a team from the Pacific Islands into Super Rugby is merely a drop in the ocean of what needs to be done.Hopefully some people of real importance high up in the unions see this &amp; make some changes as a result.Off the back of this documentary I would love to volunteer my time &amp; potentially do some coaching in the beautiful Pacific islands."}, {"id": 121, "text": "Dan Leo is a trailblazer. We will look back one day and realize that what he did here moved the sport of rugby union forward. Thank you for dedicating 4 years of your life to this cause!Let's end modern day colonialism in the sport and get Bill Boomer Beaumont and his cronies (Brett Gosper you snickering weasel...) out of World Rugby so the game can actually grow!It's sickening how hard the European powers are trying to hold onto their power. Perhaps they are scared of what the international game would look like if the playing field were even ...Bravo to Dan. Two thumbs up. If you play rugby union or are involved in the game, you need to watch this film."}, {"id": 122, "text": "Rugby is a global, professional game where the richest countries pay their players $30,000 dollars a game and the players who hit the top can make $1 million+ per year to play - not huge in soccer or NFL/NBA terms, but life changing for people in the poorer countries which provide a huge % of professional players: Samoa, Tonga and Fiji. Think NFL without pads and imagine the potential for injury and early life disability - and then think what you'd need to be paid to risk that. Unless you're a famous player, you might even find that your country doesn't pay you and ends up owing you money for leaving your home to tour - and the people you play against on that tour will earn more from one game than your family might see in a year. Daniel Leo's concise documentary tries to get to the bottom of why Samoan, Tongan and Fijian rugby players are treated like commodities to be used and discarded - it has an even tone but it's hard not to feel the injustice and despair of those who put their bodies on the line for their families, but get exploited by almost everyone running the game. A must watch if you are interested in rugby, sport or Pacific culture."}, {"id": 123, "text": "It's not often that a doco hits hard on issues that have been developing for decades. Especially when there is a power struggle and mountain of inertia to overcome.The inequity and one-sided approach by the bigger, more powerful unions is like modern slavery. Treating human beings as commodities, and feeding them crumbs, takes us back to the days of the coliseum.Dan is a visionary and his purpose runs deep. It is clear he wants to create shifts for his people. A must see doco! Rich, meaningful, and progressive. For anyone interested in equity and fairness, to create change in the world, this doco is for you.Mauri Ora!The Maori Mystic"}, {"id": 124, "text": "Having been involved in rugby for most of my life and understanding how the values of rugby can support and develop people through their lives, it was eye opening to see how people in the Pacific Nations are treated at the highest level of the sport. The documentary is a must watch for rugby fans. It shows that there is a lot more for rugby to do to create a true world sport. Where the values of the sport need to be at the forefront and not just some nice words.The documentary does a good job at showing just how many organisations are involved in trying to work through all these issues.I hope another documentary can be made in a few years where positive actions made to address the issues highlighted.It's also got me really keen on watching Pacific Island rugby. I hope their are ways to watch this."}, {"id": 125, "text": "An Amazing documentary a true eye opener. That should be seen world wide. A truely remarkable insight into the reality of International Rugby and the plundering of the Pacific Islands rugby talent, along with the uneven playing field they endure. This situation needs to change immediately World Rugby has a duty of care to all players. This shows rugby's core values to be a joke and it's a disgrace to quote those values before each International game, especially as World Rugby itself is violating its own values. Come on Sir Billy Beaumont step up lead the World in making a positive change for the good of the Game and the good of all players from all nations. I am a 60 year old lady who started watching her dad play rugby for a local town at the age of 5. I was bought up believing in the its values. Now after seeing this documentary I'm ashamed. How can we treat other teams with such disrespect and lack of compassion. One player gets paid thousands and one player gets pounds.!!!!! I can only put it down to greed and corruption. Old boys brigade it's time for you to join the 21st century and step up and put right this travesty. Thank you to all involved in the making of this documentary you are truly brave as is your families. I for one hope to live to see the day when this has been addressed and all teams play on an even playing field with the tools equipment and pay they deserve and need at all levels."}, {"id": 126, "text": "I am so ashamed to say that I have been almost raised to believe that Pacific Island rugby players seek pastures new for the glory of playing for trams such as the All Black's. This documentary really opened my eyes to the harsh reality that the players have no choice.This is hard hitting and many, many issues need addressing and those responsible geld accountable. The game has always taught me the fundamental values it prides itself upon: respect, commitment and fairness. All the while the governing bodies are treating tier 2 teams with the exact opposite.I really hope this changes and will take part in whatever is needed to help do that.On a personal note, as an English rugby player I feel so disappointed in the lack of involvement from the RFU on this documentary."}, {"id": 127, "text": "Dan Leo's documentary provides insightful questions to the situation of Pacific Islands rugby. Calm and balanced, the interviews are open-minded, yet also hold governing bodies to account.The beautiful scenery of Tonga and Samoa really brought the documentary to life, with fascinating local interviewees. The contrast of local facilities with European set-ups was so visually striking.I would also have loved to learn a little more about the situation in Fiji too, but with so much examined elsewhere, I gained insight into the unjust Tier 2 nations system, set up by World Rugby. Watching Brett Gosper squirm out of providing real answers was the highlight of the interviews - summing the entire situation up.Dan Leo has created a great documentary, opening my eyes to the exploitation of Pacific Island players. I have no doubt that Dan will continue pressuring unions and World Rugby to effect change. Hopefully with growing support."}], "reviews_amount": 128}
