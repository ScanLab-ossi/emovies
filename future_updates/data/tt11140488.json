It's more of a character study than a mystery or horror film. There were a few great funny moments but I would not have labeled it a comedy, more of a drama really, but not a wallowing kind of drama. It's snappy and moves fast and kept me engaged until the end. Riki Lindholme is great and Jim Cummings turns a character who might have otherwise been insufferable into one who can still evoke sympathy. A thumbs up from me."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Yes its slow, yes its quirky yes its a fantastic yarn. If you want Lycan action watch Underworld dont poo poo it because a trailer mislead you and then cry wolf in your review. Watch for over the top characters reacting to ott horror, perfect little Halloween treat."}, {"id": 2, "text": "The effects were great. The directing was competent. The writing needed work, as the story misfired and meandered, defied logic, and had a random reveal that seemed to have little to do with the investigation/clues that had preceded it. The acting was great, with one exception: Jim Cummings, who destroyed every scene he was in - I can't tell if that is the way he normally acts, or if it was a choice, but it was bad. Other reviewers have mentioned comedy, but I found absolutely none (not that I needed any). I'm a werewolf movie fan, and this could have been so good (every attack scene was great). To the reviewer that asked that no more werewolf movies ever be made - that's just daft; you may as well say to never again make a vampire movie, or a drama, or a comedy, or a horror, or a movie about a hit-man, etc. Bring on more werewolf movies - just make them a better."}, {"id": 3, "text": "After coming to terms with the hammy Cluedo acting and embracing it as part of this films ample charms I didn't want it to end. When you get past the flamboyant performances which will irritate you in the beginning you find yourself totally immersed in Snow Hollow and the grisly murder spree taking place. There's a hint of Fargo and a sprinkle of X Files all stirred in together to make a great little horror/mystery that had me guessing right up to the brilliant ending. The compact setting of a frozen small town suited the characters and killings perfectly, the Werewolf was done brilliantly as well, not just some tall bloke in a furry suit,,, pull the curtains and switch off the lights, don't over analyze the dialogue or characters and you'll have a great time."}, {"id": 4, "text": "A alcoholic lawman with severe personality issues and his department are in a race against the clock to apprehend a vicious killer, who strikes under the watchful eye of the full moon.This film turned out to be a true gem, brimming with great character work, a simple yet solid story and just allround beautiful work both in front as well as behind the camera.It also incredible refreshing to see comedic elements that doesn't smother the drama/horror tropes of the story (as is the case with so many features of this kind) but actually enhances the films overall effect.Top that all of with a great looking Lycanthrope - albeit a very sparse look - and you got yourself a real winner.Hope you enjoy it."}, {"id": 5, "text": "The movie definitely wanted to be Fargo, with perhaps a little Shaun of the Dead tossed into the mix. In some places it tried too hard, and came across as forced. Other places worked pretty well for me, like one of his arguments with his daughter, and his fall off the wagon from the stress.I wasn't bored, didn't wish I'd turned it off, but I also forgot most of it once the credits rolled.However, I did like the reveal at the climax. I appreciated that."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Funny and entertaining. Good job Jim for starring and directing this movie. I enjoyed it a lot."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Solid character driven movie. Humorous, good pace throughout and just the right amount of suspense. If you like movies like Club Dread and Shawn of the Dead this will probably tickle your fancy."}, {"id": 8, "text": "The film was bad. But that wasn't really the problem. Problem was that it wasn't bad enough. Lead actor, who was also director and writer was terrible. Truly. Not a single ounce of charisma. Plot, directing, character work, all hovering between bad and mediocre. In essence they should have double down one how bad the film is (and how bad the lead actor is). Make it so bad it's good."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Watching a little part of the trailer, I expected this to be a good movie. It looked right, but it felt stupid. We had a hard time getting trough it all. That police-guy-wanna-be with anger issues (Jim Cummings) just destroyed the whole movie. But hey, the joke is on him, he made this turd. If it had been in the same lane or quality as Super Troopers, I would have laughed. But this was a failure imho.Next time I see the name Jim Cummings on a movie (thinking about a porn actor) I will stay away and not spend a cent or any time watching it.All that being said, I'll give it 4/10Because it's actually better than any of the latest Steven Seagal movies!"}, {"id": 10, "text": "The synopsis is like a thousand others before it: small town, gruesome murders, emotionally challenged Sheriff and plenty of suspects.So what makes this one stand out you may ask? Well, in all honestly, nothing.But, the acting is decent and the pacing is okay. This is completely watchable and I give it 7/10 just because the last 10 movies I watched were all absolute filth and during this one I never felt the urge to hit the pause button to stop the punishment."}, {"id": 11, "text": "This movie was both pointless and obnoxious. The main character just yells at everyone for 90 minutes. There is no werewolf so this is neither a horror movie or a werewolf movie. The premise makes it seem this is a whodunnit mystery but the killer ends up being a random person never mentioned in the movie until the end. Just absolutely awful. It looks like all of the positive reviews are just big fans of the filmmaker (not this movie) and want to give him praise. Do not waste your time with this movie if you're a horror fan."}, {"id": 12, "text": "It's hard to come across some decent horror flicks, so this one was a nice surprise. Light, funny and with some graphic moments.7/10"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Odd ball, quirky, opinionated....some of the terms I'd use to describe The Wolf of Snow Hollow.This film tries to create a subtly eccentric, strangely humorous vibe. Its expressed, in large part, through an odd ball Sheriff who, already carrying considerable personal baggage on his back, is suddenly tasked with solving a series of gruesome and bizarre murders. Indeed, the whole affair is presented as a bloody comedy of errors. Regrettably, its consistent lack of well thought through ideas and contextual bridges, see's the whole thing slowly sink, under its own weight.The films cause is not helped one bit by its rather opinionated attitude towards men either. Lazy, lacklustre, incompetent, reckless and uncaring. A few words that sum up the attitude towards the majority of male characters in this tale. One highlight is the Sheriff's horny daughter, sneaking out for a rendezvous with her boyfriend, in full knowledge of the curfew imposed by her father, the Sheriff, to keep people safe. She's then almost murdered by the killer but promptly blames her father for not caring, when he saves her. Its illogical nonsense like this, that further undermines this already conflicted effort.By the end I was left feeling depressed, irritated and puzzled by this odd little film. The only real upside being the consistently solid acting from the cast and some moderately watchable, if predictable, horror sequences.5/10."}, {"id": 14, "text": "The yelling and screaming drive you nuts, bad script and acting!"}, {"id": 15, "text": "Dumb, that's the result when you suffer from Narcissism and want to do everything. Does this guy Jim Cummings thinks he's Orson Wells or Clint Eastwood? Somebody (his mother, his wife, his friends) should tell him HE'S SUCH A BAD, BAD ACTOR.

He wanted to mix all genres and messed up everything."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Opening scene you are slapped in the face with horrible overacting.

I know it was meant to be a comedy/horror, but it was just so bad that it wasn't even funny. The acting and direction were terrible and the storyline was disjointed and stupid. I see what the director was trying to do, but it just didn't work. Maybe the star shouldn't have tried to star in and direct the movie, though in truth his acting was really, really bad and the direction was pretty awful too. All around a major disappointment."}, {"id": 18, "text": "This film tries so hard to come off as quirky, but the humor falls flat like 95% of the time. It still gave me a couple of chuckles, mainly from the late, great Robert Forster who is effortlessly amazing, but the editing and performances otherwise are nothing that will stand the test of time. I saw one reviewer saying it's like Fargo with a Werewolf, and the truth is the film WANTS to be Fargo but it's MILES and MILES away from the greatness of that film. It's like Fargo for Dummies. That being said, it's very difficult to write, direct and star in a full length feature film, so I have to give Cummings credit for that, but the film itself didn't do much for me."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Absolute garbage!

I can only assume most of the positive reviews are being posted by those who were involved with the production of this trash. I have read adjectives describing this movie like, good, brilliant, charming, gem, etc. I can only assume that these people are lying, or they have never in their lives seen a movie before. One person likened Jim Cummings to Orson Welles, really? Mr. Forster passed away in Oct. 2019, which means they delayed the movie for a year. Most likely because they new it was trash, but with everyone staying indoors these days, they figured to garner more viewers and decided to finally release it. Luckily I never pay to watch movies, even though it was free, I still didn't make it all the way through. I just couldn't stomach it any longer. For those of you who have to pay for movies, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"}, {"id": 21, "text": "These reviews are lies. This has to be the worst movie.

I get the writers wanted to write witty characters but their ideas/concept of said characters are as way off as Dr Frankenstein's vision of recreating humans from corpses. It may be forgiven, from a distance, to think they are humans but on closer inspection you see the abomination... This is what I saw from this film.Ps I fell asleep and woke up hoping it would get better but how wrong could I be?! The best bit is seeing the end credits."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Bad writing, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing. There's absolutely nothing exciting about this movie, even though the trailer seems to suggest otherwise.No one talks or behaves the way these characters do. Oftentimes something completely random happens for no logical reason whatsoever, like a grown man losing a tooth.

Literally anything else."}, {"id": 25, "text": "It's a shame because the premise was great on paper. The movie comes off as more of a bunch of put together clips that has no transition.

They're simply not making films that are watchable to the end without insulting the viewing audience intelligence. A dark comedy thriller with a well knit cast, plot and climax.

I won't give any spoilers but the end completely betrayed the whole film and left me feeling... Why did I bother? No explanation and nothing entertaining about this. I gave it 3 stars as the first 50 minutes kept me entertained but then just garbage. I love monster movies and don't mind if the creatures are not that great but this movie gave nothing!"}, {"id": 38, "text": "I absolutely loved Thunder Road, but thought it might be a wonderfully quirky fluke, but he nailed it again with this one.It could be easy to miss how really incredibly nuanced his acting is because of the somewhat surreal feel to his scripts, but he's amazing. And if he isn't in recovery for real, then he deserves an Oscar.His external dialogue feels like what goes through my head both in this and TR when I'm heading for a relapse, so much so that for both of his films I've seen I had to watch them a 2nd time immediately after (and I've never done that before though a big film buff).Can hardly wait for the next! I hope he becomes huge... sometimes I'll find a director I like but don't want to share with the wider world, haha, I'm sure some folks know what I mean, but he deserves to be gigantic. He's a solid talent in all three areas (and I'm not big on director/actors usually, I still am scarred by The Two Jakes, *shudder*).p.s. Ignore the haters, just looking at some of the other reviews of those rating this low, they were to a person genre fans who I don't think understood this is a character study, not a slasher flick.

The script was fine, the directing was solid, but while I was watching the nagging idea of protagonist miscast was present from the very beginning. A remote country town with always well shaven and perfectly coiffured sheriff? Give me a break. Even when he supposedly relapsed into drinking he still looked exactly like excellent contemporary big city metrosexual. I understand that some of his weird mannerisms were supposed to indicate comedic moments in the movie, but I personally never bought them. They looked misplaced and badly acted by Jim Cummings. I have no problem with other actors in the movie only with the protagonist.

A big mess.For a horror comedy I found this film to be neither scary nor funny. There are moments in the film which I feel like are supposed to be comedic but the laughter just wasn't coming.

I think it could have benefitted from some likability in the main character but that was probably intentional, i just would have enjoyed it more.The four stars went in with a lot of expectations i guess, because nothing in this film deserves four stars not even the cgi which i was impressed with for such a small budget."}, {"id": 51, "text": "I'll be honest &amp; say I wanted this to be so great. Werewolves are undoubtedly my all time favorite monster... if you love them as well, you are painfully aware how rare it is the movies get made now, &amp; even less rare that they are even OK, let alone good or better...That said, I tried so hard to make excuses everytime my mind said this sorta sucks.. but in the end..I had to face reality.It wasn't that good. The pacing &amp; tone were almost dreamlike, &amp; not in a good, nor intentional way. The movie cuts randomly from attack scenes to scenes hours later. The father/Sheriff was just ...he was too weirdly written (not the actors fault I don't think) it felt as if he was supposed to be seen as kind of an incompetent goof...? But also not...? Every scene he is in is bizarre, because almost every line feels like it could've meant to be a joke, but nothing at all done in a joking fashion. This only happened with him, no one else. Everyone else was played very straight, but he was this 'out of his element' goof even in the most serious of scenes...it just came across as too weird for me.The werewolf - the times we see it, it's great. Which isnt often but it's good enough...but with the twist (which I saw a mile away) it leaves obvious plot holes..At the end I'll give my biggest issues, for now... here's how I'd rate it:Story: 6/10 (done to death, but it was fine) Acting: 7/10 Cinematography/Quality: 10/10 Horror: 4/10 Comedy: 2/10Overall, if you just love horror...I could see you hating this. If you love werewolves though, you may enjoy it.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!The wolf turns out to be this somewhat random, very tall, thin man. He just wears a wolf skin basically, okay.. fine... but the police got reports back saying the victims were CLEARLY attacked by a large WOLF... due to the wounds, &amp; bites. These people do this as a career, they aren't going to mistake some knife/weapon for a specific animals teeth. That's giving the film extra credit because we aren't even explained how he did inflict these wolf like injuries. So..How did the victims have clear animal injuries?How did the man vocalize very distinct wolf howls?How was it the only man in this SMALL TOWN who is around 7'0+ tall able to evade being any sort of real suspect, when the only lead anyone had to really go on was that the suspect was VERY LARGE?Why was he cutting off specific organs/parts of people? They made this kind of a big thing, then I didn't see it explained.How was this man (who was in no way muscular or powerful looking) while donning a wolf costume able to generate enough speed &amp; power to ram into a TRUCK DOOR, &amp; Cause it to lift several feet into the air. Then punch through a window of it no problem, then evade the Sheriff firing shotgun blasts... while leaping from car to car, &amp; escape?I see those as not just questions unanswered, but loop holes generated by having it be a human.Also, what's the drinking deal? Never explained.It almost feels rushed, or like many people made the film instead of one vision.I wanted badly to love it, I ended up pretty let down... will never watch it again, but not sorry that I saw it.

There was a fairly good creature effect established, and some nice cinematography with the wide shots - large background scenes, and use of light &amp; shadow. It falls flat when it came to the comedy; some of it such as Sheriff Hadley played by seasoned actor Robert Forster went smoothly with the dialogue &amp; scenes, but then Jim Cummings ruins it with visual comedy. It's clownishly dramatic. You sit through a lot of long camera shots of Jim Cummings shouting things and being buffoonish. Every extended close-up of Jim Cummings made me want to punch him in the face. The film is bluntly a venture to showcase Jim Cummings, as it is directed by Jim Cummings, written by Jim Cummings, and stars Jim Cummings in the lead role. He makes this film unwatchable and brings (we) reviewers into play, because we MUST warn people about this terrible movie.

There was something familar about the character, but just can't see to place it. Demetrius Daniels and Skyler Bible were also super great. Even the extra's in the background were good. Some pretty awesome directing there. What was up with the snowboard instructor look when she's sitting with her students? Right at the camera? It doesn't seem to fit, nor believable that she would go explore the sounds in the forest beside the road. Such an overused cliche in the horror genre.

I'm a sucker for werewolf movies, and so I did harbor at least some measure of high hopes for this movie. On the whole, however, Scream of the Wolf took the same basic premise and did a better job with it 46 years ago.In the case of both movies, the killer turned out to be human, and not a were old. In Scream of the Wolf, the killer turned out to be a big game hunter who had been called in to track down the murderous beast. In The Wolf of Snow Hollow, the killer turns out to be the reclusive local taxidermist.In both movies, the actual killer turned out to be unusually tall and strong. In the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, the epitome of the tall, burly character actor was Clint Walker, who stood in the area of 6' 6 and weighed somewhere around 250 to 260 pounds. The taxidermist in the Snow Falls movie looks to be a bit taller than Clint Walker was, but he isn't as heavily built.Being as I was hoping that the killer was an actual werewolf in the case of both movies, I was let down by the ending of each.

Too bad for all money and other actors efforts spent for nothing."}, {"id": 101, "text": "First, let me start by saying I am a HUGE fan of werewolves &amp; werewolf stories are my favourite horror sub-genre, movies or books. About ninety percent of werewolf movies that are made are just downright embarrassing &amp; is why good production money for lycanthrope movies always get passed over for the countless, garbage vampire &amp; zombie films that seem to be an automatic green light. One of the reasons for this is because it's so hard to get the most important thing right, the werewolf. Well, it shouldn't be that hard with all the CG wizardry available today but these film makers don't have the passion for these creatures to give them the showing they deserve. And practical effects seem to have strangely gotten worse over time since American Werewolf in London. But this movie nailed it. I really wasn't expecting the werewolf to look any good. Disappointment was almost guaranteed whenever I sat down to watch a werewolf flick. But the first time they showed the werewolf in its full glory after it had just ripped the woman's arm off, I literally jumped off my couch &amp; gasped. It was beautiful! I hadn't had excitement like this since the Underworld movies &amp; more recently Howl in 2015. The second time they showed the beast was even better. It was huge, muscular &amp; menacing without the usual token roar whenever a monster is introduced in movies. It just stood there in all its into intimidating glory, just staring. It was what it should be, scary as hell. Not just some overgrown guy in a suit looking like a rabid Wookie. (I'm looking at you Late Phases) And this is why I'm so conflicted with this movie. Because someone finally got the werewolf right, but it wasn't a werewolf at all. Forget that even though the ending doesn't explain how this terrifying, realistic looking creature, standing on digitagrade legs, ripping people's limbs off is actually just a man in a suit. If this WAS a real werewolf movie, it would have easily been one of the best ones to come out in years. Instead they decided to go for a Scooby Doo style twist &amp; now a movie that up until the last 15 minutes I thought was going to be one of my favourite werewolf movies became just another run of the mill who dunnit.

This intensity combined with his realistic refelction of a confused male dealing with things like ego, loss, connection, etc. ring so true that it felt like I was legitimately watching this guy go through this in his actual life.I have seen both films more than once now and eagerly wait his third title.

Boom! That was well done in its writing shooting, editing, and the pacing of everything, was wonderful, the jokes came a mile a minute and I do wish it had been longer and a few little things explained that weren't but hell I'm ok without it. It's done as a mystery and done well. I agree with what someone noted earlier about the juxtaposition of his Jim's wolfen attributes fit nicely and nailed the feeling of dealing with sobriety and what that does cause a person to be like. Been there and know it well. I also know the feeling of a bunch of people talking at me all at the same time and that was on the money, though the people doing that to me where more like synchronized cannibals of the mind dissecting me, but anyhow, I survived and am I'm surviving. Now back to the film it glides from drama, comedy, thriller, horror as a mystery like a slow coiling of rope on a well, the audience in the bucket getting closer to the top and then like a flickering light of continual lighting strikes it shuffles those themes again, quicker never letting you stay in those themes, like a former all night, all day drinker moving into drunkenness' super quick after having been sober for a while was on the money. Sad Reality but Well Done! When he broke the stove door it was laugh and cry in a split second. Robert Forster had moments like that as well where they make you switch emotions like a light switch and That is hard to pull off and they did it without cuts. Massive Cheers! and tears for the master of his craft Robert Forester! Thanks Dan Harmon for bring it up and sending people it's way! I'm going to do the same. I'm also going to definitely watch it again because there was so much that happened even though it was short for the most part, but tightly knit.

It's not a bad film by any means, nor is it great, but it doesn't deserve all these low ratings. Following review will contain spoilers.Jim Cummings is a talented filmmaker. Despite his mostly one note and loud choices as an actor, his dialogue is sharp and the film itself has its own style. Whether or not you can get on board with his particular style as an actor is going to dictate heavily weather you like this film or not. Personally, I found his performance had more strong moments than not, but I think someone on set having the balls to tell him to pull it back now and then would have done wonders for the film overall. Having sad that, the dark Fargo-esque comedy works most of the time and cummings' deadpan delivery certainly elicited chuckles from me.I've watched the film twice now. Upon first viewing, when the film finally played its cards, I was flummoxed by its final reveal and the identity of the wolf. I watch films quite closely and was certain that I had missed a scene or details earlier in the film during which we met the eventual wolf. Because I felt I had missed crucial details, I watched the film again, and to my surprise, I hadn't missed anything at all. In fact, not once in the film is their a mention of a taxidermist, we never meet the killer, there is no explanation as to what evidence the main character is returning at the end, there is nothing that transpires previously that clues the audience in as to why a seam-ripper would tip off the police and lead to the final confrontation. To me, this is a huge lapse in plot and I am certain they must have left something on the cutting room floor. Not to mention the complete red herring of the drug addict burning a body in bonfire outside his trailer. Whose body is it?The film is unique in its exploration of werewolf myth, but would have benefited from another pass. As others have said before me, don't make a werewolf movie without a werewolf.

The reveal *spoilers ahead* that despite everything we'd been shown that the monster was just a dude in a costume felt like a huge misstep.

It really tells you a lot about an actor when they can be both serious and comedic without resorting to cheap, cliched one-liners.The best part about this movie is that everything is unexpected.

After writing a pretty tight script, with simple plot-points, character driven, decent banter in everyman speak, that gives even minor characters their own identity. Jim then hops up to the director's chair and pulls it all together, whilst also turning in a solid main performance. Again I must point out... He is playing an unlikeable character... It is not BAD acting... He is portraying an ex-jock, ex-military, alcoholic, divorced deputy in a small town, with an estranged daughter and a stubborn aging father/ boss. He feels his life is passing him by, he's surrounded by incompetent coworkers, overbearing constituents, and is making promises he seemingly can't deliver on... I thought he brought that right to the table steaming hot. The rest of the cast, particularly Riki and Chloe really assisted in fleshing-out his downward spiral.

It was a rather well-written storyline that definitely had some good flavor to it, and the plot twist was actually good; I enjoyed the way the storyline panned out, especially since it was built up so that you were expecting it to be the most obvious of choices as to whom was the werewolf in Snow Hollow.The acting performances in The Wolf of Snow Hollow were quite good, and were for the most part done by actors and actresses that I weren't already familiar with. And that is something I enjoy in movies, seeing new and unfamiliar talents whose faces aren't already associated with previously portrayed characters in other movies.The special effects in this movie were actually quite good, taking into consideration that this was not a movie that were heavily reliant on special effects to carry it.I think that The Wolf of Snow Hollow is definitely a worth addition to the werewolf genre, and I can warmly recommend that you watch the movie if you enjoy werewolf movies.My rating of The Wolf of Snow Hollow settles on a well-deserved six out of ten stars."}, {"id": 168, "text": "Jim Cummings follows up his excellent debut Thunder Road with The Wolf of Snow Hollow.Here, as in Thunder Road, Cummings plays a police officer trying to cope with both his job and his familial duties, and in both he excels at portraying a man whose nerves are never very far from the surface, often boiling over to either dramatic or comedic effect (often in the same scene). Cummings' performance is astonishing, moving with ease from high emotion to slapstick to a glacial stillness, carrying the viewer along for the ride. He's ably supported by an excellent cast, all of whom impress throughout, though special mention must go to Riki Lindhome and the late Robert Forster for some brilliantly detailed work.Comparison has been made with Fargo, and although I can't deny the two films do share a similar sensibility and setting, I find The Wolf of Snow Hollow to be the stronger film. Though Fargo has many admirers, for me it often feels like caricature. Cummings' seems able to create characters who feel as if they have a life beyond the edge of the frame, and don't merely exist to populate a thumbnail sketch of small-town oddity.There's a freshness to Cummings' direction too; some of the shots are breathtaking, occasionally making use of a staccato visual grammar that might be expected in arthouse but is unusual in a film that presents itself as accessible entertainment, first and foremost. There's no pretentiousness on display - the shots always service the intent of the script, it's just that it's done with such a flair that it really makes you sit up and take notice.The Wolf of Snow Hollow can be many things to many viewers - a rollercoaster horror/comedy, a serial thriller, a commentary on the relationship between the sexes, a portrait of workplace and family or all of the above.

But, I sometimes make an exception when one is labeled as a comedy/horror, as this one was.Anyways, besides what I have just mentioned, it did seem like it might be an okay horror. And, even while watching most of it, I thought that's what I was getting. But, by the end you realize it is basically not even that.

A large part of the problem is that he has created for himself a fairly abrasive lead character, or maybe it's just bad acting. Appealing, very handsome yet annoying. His police officer is so over the top it brings the movie down. Even worse, the mix of comedy (none of it at all funny) edited in with someone being murdered in a realistically grizzly fashion is borderline offensive. On a horror level there is very little suspense and that aspect after awhile seems to be abandoned for even more of his over-acting. The movie, while beautifully shot, is also a mess in even telling the story properly, with obvious plot holes, gaffes, characters coming and going and happenings that are never explained. Other then the cinematography, some of the supporting characters are excellent, Riki Lindhome and Jimmy Tatro are great in their much smaller roles. The entire movie just comes across as one not very good vanity project.

I was wrong, it went much more downhill fast: After those 10 minutes, the music score kicked in and I couldn't place the dialogues anymore. It was like the wrong score was used. It went from bad to worse but still couldn't figure out if it was intentional or not. After seeing this movie listed as comedy, I realized it was just the worst movie score I had ever heard, it may have been somewhat more watchable with better music.Jim Cummings was supposed to be someone with anger issues, performs like a bipolar person but does that in such an amateurish way you can't even distinguish when he switches/switched to play the other guy.Robert Forster is a steady actor when it comes to performance, the only other good performance worth mentioning is the second victim, which says enough.Either I'm too old to get this type of movie/acting, or I need to booze up first."}, {"id": 172, "text": "You want people to stop talking s**t about the police? Do better police work. John Marshall (Jim Cummings)Jim Cummings had an inspired thing about the working class and harried cops in Thunder Road, and now in The Wolf of Snow Hollow he ramps up to small-town cop, John Marshall, facing a rogue werewolf appearing at full moon time in a mountainous place that seems to imprison everyone not in jail.What Cummings as writer, director, and actor has is a sense of the absurd (think Twin Peaks and Super Troopers) and the laughs it brings while commenting on the precarious situation of single parents and questionable authority like police. In both cases, Cummings has characters act foolishly (missing the point with a teenage daughter or falling off the wagon while on duty, for instance). Jaundiced attitudes toward authority are justified.Although the investigation of murders by some entity Marshall believes can't be a werewolf is progressing not much, Cummings is mostly interested in exposing the dull wit of a small town whose soul is tied up in a lost tradition of romantic small-town life. That paradise-lost syndrome is best exemplified in Marshall's ailing dad, Sheriff Hadley (the late Robert Forster), who must give over the duties to his son but who fights the loss of his place of importance: I may look old, but I can handle it.Cummings has done the nearly impossible of lampooning the horror formula while commenting on societal attitudes toward authority and the precarious place police have in the populace's psyche.The Wolf of Snow Hollow doesn't have to be viewed by horror devotees, just by those who like a few laughs while they think of small-town life and national mental health. The ambivalence of culture toward authority like police and parents is expressed in Marshall's cluelessness about their disrespect: Who would wanna throw a beer bottle at a cop car?A mild spoof couched in a formulaic awareness of societal silliness.

Whether it's the overall story, the tonal clashings, or the effects of the actual creature, it seems like something that should've been accomplished by now. As far as this film goes, it's an embarrassing attempt that is downright amateur in every facet.What starts out as a promising opening unravels with awful forced humor that falls flat every time. There's horrendous acting from all involved, and mainly the lead actor who's also the writer/director which is even worse. There's oddly placed music choices throughout killing tones all over during scenes that don't need it . The horror aspects are virtually non existent aside from 3 20 second scenes and that's literally it. The conclusion is pitiful attempt at a twist that renders the whole already mediocre story useless.Overall this is probably one of the worst films I've seen all year and a complete waste of time even when it's good just having something new to watch right now.

Kind of Fargo meets Twin Peaks meets a werewolf movie. I agree with other reviewers that it's more character study than werewolf movie - but that's not a bad thing in this case. Jim Cummings did a great job IMO - although I can see how some people might not quite get what I think he was going for. If you consider that he wrote, acted in, and directed this, it's all the more impressive as usually that's a recipe for disaster. There is a ton of subtlety in what's going on and for the people who think that Transformers is awesome theater, well, they'll probably miss most if not all of it. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the reactions and dialog. If you chuckled your way through a movie like The Station Agent, you'll probably do the same here.There were a few weaknesses in the plot and the character arcs could have been better, but overall, I enjoyed this enough to watch it twice ... which almost never happens.Production values are good, acting is pretty strong, it's not awash in political agendas or wokeness, so, worth a watch."}, {"id": 176, "text": "I've pretty much seen everything the werewolf genre can throw at me, so it's with confidence that I say The Wolf of Snow Hollow entertains and surprises in many deeply gory ways.Unfortunately, it disappoints in lots of ways also.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: Over the course of several full moons, a bunch of young women are brutally murdered in the otherwise quiet town of Snow Hollow by what appears to be a large wolf. One misfit cop is on the case, determined to prove that the killer is nothing more than a man.It's hard to say whether or not I liked this movie. When it impressed me, it REALLY impressed me. But everything in between left me with a big hairball of Meh.THE GOODEST STUFF: Practical werewolf effects win every time. Hands down. And so it is for true fans of the genre that I shout an emphatic: WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW! The Wolf of Snow Hollow has the best practical werewolf effects I've seen in recent years. Nothing since Dog Soldiers has looked this good. The gore effects are impressive and the movie's overall visual style is fittingly mysterious, bleak, and visceral.THE NON-GOODEST STUFF: As other reviews have pointed out, this movie is a tonal mess. When it commits to being a horror movie it's fantastic, but, unfortunately, it treats those moments of horror as setups for a sitcom-esque punchline that never comes. The brutal deaths of young women are handled flippantly and with little remorse. Even the main characters don't seem to carry the full weight of the trauma in a realistic way. The movie tries to walk the fine line between horror and comedy, but I just didn't find anything funny about it.As usual in a movie like this, you've got a cast of characters that never make very good decisions. (Why in the name of all Americans in London would you get out of your car on a dark snowy road to investigate a dead animal while you have a baby in the backseat? I grew up in rural New England. Nobody I knew ever made it a practice to walk up to large roadkill, especially not at night when there are reports of a humongous killer wolf roaming about. Jeeze!) But maybe these moments were part of the horror/comedy vibe the movie was going for.The ending, too, was ultimately a letdown, but I can't say why without getting into spoilers. Let me just say that if someone served you a bowl of wolf meat stew but didn't actually put any wolf meat in it, would you be disappointed? ... Yes? .... Ok, then you probably won't like the ending either."}, {"id": 177, "text": "Its a fairly entertaining film which for the most part I really enjoyed. Its very humorous, whilst not strictly being especially 'comedic' and I think this blends in well with the film in general and what I think it is trying to achieve.It has a great cast and is well acted and directed. There is a lot of suspense and this is placed quite strategically in a well paced plot. Direction is again good and bit for the screen play which lets it down, I think I'd have given it a few more points.The real issue is the story. I'd not heard of the film so when I started watching it I got quite drawn in. 20 minutes in, I thought this movie is like someone who's made it has put every idea they ever had into in instead of weeding out the won'ts that don't work. Well, after looking at the credits, that seems to largely be the truth of it.The failings are with the main character, who is really the main focus of the plot, and whilst its good to have strong focus on a lead, this one over engages in him without really fleshing out the intricacies necessary to convey a true perspective of his character. Too be honest, even if it had, it would still have been a bad idea, the real interest in this tale is in the murders that are taking place, what is going on with regards to the town, the victims, the search for the killer and the suspense, horror and intrigue therein. The focus on the officer Marshall, the thin window into his father's ailing health are inconsequential (for the most part) and are given too much attention. ultimately the film is in need of some serious steamlining.Anyway, I think it still a good film, and Jim Cummings CAN act, but his efforts here are misplaced in many ways since this could have been so much more with a little less.My advise is to watch it and see for yourself, because I think this is going to be one of those films which people will mostly like a lot or totally hate.... mostly. I think 6 is a fair score."}, {"id": 178, "text": "This movie is amazing. It's a superbly crafted, surprisingly serious horror-comedy about men grappling with toxic masculinity. It's also a self-critical werewolf movie. And no, the combination of those things doesn't play out as you might expect.It's not Scream. It's not Cabin in the Woods. It's not Tucker &amp; Dale versus Evil. All of which were fine in their own ways, but also extremely heavy-handed about their novelty of being meta. Rather than a film that's obsessed with trying to impress everyone with how clever it is, The Wolf is just a very clever film.What's more, The Wolf isn't a Hollywood piece of crap that tries to maximize commercial success by playing both sides of the fence at the same time -- an approach previously ridiculed by none other than the film's supporting actress Riki Lindhome in her other career as half of comedy music duo Garfunkle and Oats (see Both Sides Can Laugh). So no, this isn't a horror film that invites anyone to identify with the villain so they can satisfy sadistic, misogynistic fantasies. In fact, it's a film that tells you you're pathetic if that's what's brought you to horror in the first place.But when it comes to the flawed central character struggling to be better and some other male characters, the film doesn't give us demeaning caricatures. It presents these men with depth and compassion, encouraging us to laugh at them as we might laugh at ourselves.Consequently, a lot of people will either hate this film or miss its point entirely. Admittedly, I set my expectations way too low on the first viewing (because werewolf movie), and had to rewatch it once I realized what it was really about. But at least even the haters won't come away from this movie idolizing the next Tony Montana, Freddy Krueger or Big Bad Wolf.Jim Cummings seems to have executed a clear creative vision here pretty much flawlessly as the film's writer, director and lead actor. Riki Lindhome and Jimmy Tatro (American Vandal, Season 1) are perfectly cast and great in this, too -- as is Robert Forster (Breaking Bad, Alligator) in what I assume was his final role.I can't recommend this movie enough."}, {"id": 179, "text": "I was interested in this because I had heard that the Director's, Jim Cummings, first and only other film, Thunder Road, was really good. After watching this film, I'm very excited to see where this Director goes in the future. The Wolf of Snow Hollow is a surprisingly funny and emotional film that is able to mix its horror elements, dramatic elements, and comedic elements almost perfectly together. I never felt as if a scene was undercut by a comedic line or anything else. Some of the jokes may not have been super funny but a lot of them definitely got a laugh out of me. The horror elements weren't drop dead terrifying but they had a lot of tension and build up that made those scary moments effective and the dramatic elements hit really hard at points. Mainly with Robert Forster's character but I think that's because he passed away this time last year so it does feel a little somber. All of the performances here are great especially Forster and Jim Cummings. Each of their characters are mesmerizing and so fun to watch interact with everyone else. The script, also written by Jim Cummings, is great too and makes it easier for those elements to hit. On a technical level, the film has great editing, cinematography, and music. There are issues with pacing at points but it isn't too major and the occasional unfunny joke or weak element doesn't take away from the experience too much. If you are a fan of unique horror films or want a funny comedy horror film, then go check this out when you can."}, {"id": 180, "text": "First off I have to say a lot of these reviews that are below 6 on the scale are just plain ridiculous and pretty much the reason why I don't read reviews before I watch a movie. I feel compelled to say ignore them and watch it for yourself. Some people point out that the reason they don't like it is because of the main character and also the fact that it is not an obvious horror movie. I would agree it is not really a horror movie, it is a more of a character based story.You are not supposed to like the main guy, he is supposed to be annoying because of his inadequacies and that is the whole point of the movie and it is what they focus on the most. I actually really enjoyed the movie because I did not know what was going to happen next, it was intriguing. People mention that the clues etc don't really stack up, that is also the point, they were out of their depth and barely have to investigate murders and so were bumbling around making a mess of the investigation.Overall it was shot well with good quality effects, nice scenery, you really get a feel for the small town location. I also really liked the focus on the characters themselves, I felt like I knew a lot about the main character once the movie ended. Ignore the terrible reviews and give it a watch for yourself, just don't go into with an expectation that it is a horror movie because it is a little more than that."}, {"id": 181, "text": "A howling hybrid of lycanthropic terror &amp; dark humour, The Wolf of Snow Hollow packs as much fun as it does feral carnage and is one of the better delights of the year. A briskly paced, intelligently witted, gleefully violent, consistently thrilling &amp; thoroughly entertaining horror-comedy, it is a wicked mix of laughs &amp; frights that delivers the goods in just the right doses.Written &amp; directed by Jim Cummings who also stars as our protagonist, the story is small-scale &amp; simple in structure but it is executed with such flair &amp; confidence that it leaves behind a lasting footprint. Cummings' writing is sharp, his direction is polished, and the way he makes the elements of comedy, drama &amp; horror work in tandem from start to finish is both impressive &amp; inspiring.The deadpan humour in this story is very reminiscent of the Coen brothers' works, and the small-town setting &amp; inept officers on duty only make the influence more obvious. Cummings is as outstanding in front of the camera as he is behind it, and he is finely supported by the rest. The film is also noteworthy for featuring Robert Forster in his final role and he is simply hilarious, stealing all his scenes with ease.Overall, The Wolf of Snow Hollow is a terrific blend of flat-out comedy, heartfelt drama &amp; full-fledged horror that utilises its limited resources in a highly efficient &amp; effective manner and establishes Jim Cummings as one of the finest talents to watch out for. A smart, solid &amp; sophisticated thrill ride, The Wolf of Snow Hollow has all the makings on an indie classic and is one of the best films to surface this year. Don't miss it."}, {"id": 182, "text": "This is a solid little horror/creature feature, but the only issues was that I was never sure what it was trying to be. Some of the performances and the characters are over the top and give the impression that it's trying to be a horror comedy, but the some of the subjects and actions are too serious for it to be funny. A small town police man is dealing with his divorce, his teenage daughter, his recovery from alcoholism, and the failing health of his stubborn father who also happens to be the sheriff. If that isn't enough, people start being brutally killed in this sleepy mountain town, and some of the signs point to wolves... or possibly a werewolf. As the killings continue and the police get no closer to catching the killer, the townspeople start to turn against the police department which just exacerbates of all the above mentioned issues. It's well made, it looks slick, the special effects are mostly practical and we slowly see more of the creature as the film progresses which helps to build the suspense regarding who or what the real killer is. I had to watch it a second time to pick up the clues that led to the conclusion, and it held up okay on this second viewing. It's not perfect but its a fun watch, and possibly suitable for teens who are starting to get into horror."}, {"id": 183, "text": "In the remote town of Snow Hollow, brutal murders are leaving the police cold and the townsfolk terrified ...The movie started well but it meanders towards the finale and eventually it clicks that the story is less concerned with the mysterious Werewolf than it is with the alcoholic cop and all his issues.It's more of a black comedy / social drama than horror - which might be your bag - but it was disappointing for me. I much preferred the likes of Silver Bullet and especially Late Phases.Aside from the irritating, frequently yelling lead, the characters are good and the acting is solid and overall it's a very well made film. I would recommend it but know what you're getting, to avoid disappointment."}, {"id": 184, "text": "What a strange movie. It tackles so many topics which, if explored deeeper, could have resulted in a smart piece with social commentary. A fragile masculinity unable to fulfill expectations, misogyny resulting in horrible deaths, effects of family bonds being broken, men grappling with emotions, father-son relationship, father-daughter relationship, fighting with addiction, peoples mistrust towards the police; even origins of werewolf lore. Had one or two of these topics been explored and deepened, the film would be soo much better and smarter. But it tries to be everything at once instead, resulting in a convoluted mess with unfulfilling ending. I liked the camerwork, there were some beautiful shots of snowy landscapes. That's definitely one of the highlights. I see a lot of reviews criticizing Jim Cumming's acting. I liked it, I think he showed an absurd, unhinged and pathetic man that cannot deal with reality quite right, and I definitely saw a lot of comedy there. It's a pity that the movie never decides what to do with his character, doesn't give him a proper redemption arc apart from one scene where he admits he's a jerk, or a proper closure (saying goodbye on a cemetery and passing a sheriff's star to a person who - thankfully! - got it at the end would have been a nice wrap up.)A total wasted potential. Nevertheless, I had quite a good time, not expecting much."}], "reviews_amount": 185}
