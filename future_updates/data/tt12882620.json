Listen to your heart or listen to your mother; poor old Pallavi gets into a right palaver once her mother recognises something wicked in the character of her new boyfriend that's all too familiar. An interesting spin on karma, fate, kismet as well as misogyny, abuse and control.

What confuses me is why he takes 20 plus years to finally get revenge. Too many plot holes to mention. This movie was super corny.

It's still fun to watch though. Sarita Choudhury keeps you engaged. Sunita Mani, not as much but not too bad either.

The film description tells us that a mother believes that her daughter's boyfriend is the man who tried to kill her 30 years ago... That is literally the plot. There is not plot twist because it's in the description already. Where is the surprise? There is also no horror element. It's a drama. I'm so disappointed by Blumhouse as I usually love their films"}, {"id": 19, "text": "Evil Eye has a great concept, and is full of suspense. Nothing is given away too quickly, and the way the story unfolds is riveting. However, it seems like the creative team couldn't decide if they wanted to make a psychological thriller or a supernatural horror film, which makes it feel at times like you're watching two different movies. That being said, it is still enjoyable. The film dissects the overprotective mother trope, and doesn't play into stereotypes. I found the dialogue to be pretty realistic as well. The performances really make the thematic inconsistencies less jarring and more watchable. Omar Maskati gives an incredible performance in a very difficult role, and Sarita Choudhury is absolutely phenomenal, giving a very nuanced performance. This film isn't perfect, but it's definitely worth watching."}, {"id": 20, "text": "While the concept of the film was interesting and it starts out okay, the second and final acts leave lots and lots to be desired.

She has to walk a fine line and not be hated too much by the audience. There's of course only two options to this, either she's right or she isn't. I still think it's fairly obvious to what the movie leans on and what is going to be the reveal at the end.So as predictable as a movie can be. And yet due to the fine performances (even when they contradict themselves or their character motivations at time), but especially to a message delivered almost at the end of the movie (which is really important, especially to women), this really makes a dent. Of course everytime something good is being displayed, there is at least a bump in the road. At the very end, the message almost gets completely evaporated by a cliche - even if meant in good fun ... maybe they had to put it in (politically speaking), but it really was unnecessary to say the least"}, {"id": 27, "text": "A plenty of dialogues made me laugh.

If the new boyfriend was a distant relative of the former carrying some kind of curse, it would have been even better to watch.

I actually thought that the movie was a good metaphor to expose domestic violence in a mystery story.

Simple premise with some exceptional acting, the mother is very good. Worth a watch."}, {"id": 31, "text": "This is one of those movies that I'm not sorry I watched but I won't watch again. It wasn't a full on horror movie but it did a decent job at building some suspense. They did a good job building a story around the concept of reincarnation but it could have been darker. All in all I'd say if there's nothing else on you want to watch go ahead and give this a shot."}, {"id": 32, "text": "This is my second Blumhouse/Amazon Halloween movie and I'm 2 for 2. This fun little genre hybrid centers on a young Indian woman and her mom who suspects her daughter's new fiancee is the reincarnation of her evil dead lover. Approaching the material from the cultural standpoint gives it a new refreshing feel and that ending is pretty satisfying. Although it's never really scary it is creepy and suspenseful. And the movie is stacked with solid performances, creative cinematography and inspired direction.****/5"}, {"id": 33, "text": "Finally watched this movie last weekend. It is alright but not must watch. Frankly I felt like more of student film than professional project. Movie has portrayed intricacies of Indian mother-daughter relationship very nicely but has failed to develope obsessive problamatic personality of Sandeep convincingly. Hence his transformation from nice, goody goody boyfriend to that evil, obsssive person felt bit erratic. Acting from everyone is spot on and that is what makes this movie watchable. Also felt story of the movie doesn't grab you, there should have been little bit more element of suspense till last ten minutes of movie and movie should have ended on cliffhanger like was he or was he not reincarnation? At the end I feel there is nothing evil about this movie."}, {"id": 34, "text": "So this is one of those, killed came back in a different body to exact his revenge movies.

It is an interesting angle.

People who are vaguely familiar with unhealthy romantic relationships will enjoy the movie."}, {"id": 36, "text": "The movie has a plotline which is different from the rest of the horror films. The acting is good of all the cast. There could be more spooky, chilling or horror scenes. Its one time watchable though but for avid horror movie fans it will be a huge letdown.

For 90-minutes, that is literally all you hear, and does the daughter listen? Of course not. I appreciate that the entire cast, writer and directors are Indian and hats off to them, but common, give us something to rave about.

There was a good balance of both. I like the way the daughter was portrayed as independent, yet she still had a bond to her mother. A very loving relationship.The father relationship to his wife and daughter was also good.The movie stood alone as a family drama about relationships and the modern and the old fashioned, between the new and the traditional and people loving each other and accepting each other's values.Spoilers ahead********************************And when mother and daughter teamed up to whoop his abusive a** that was extremely satisfying!Sorry guys!"}, {"id": 53, "text": "I feel like I just watched a movie written by my mother. It seems nowadays that every other movie is being called a horror film when this is very slightly a supernatural non-thrilling thriller. 90% of this movie is Indian melodrama with a very good performance from Sarita Choudhury as the mother concerned for her daughter's welfare. Not much really goes on and the fact that half the cast in in India and the other half is in America means we get endless scenes of actors talking into phones. It doesn't work and isn't all that interesting. There is no tension or suspense. When it does finally try to kick it up a notch, it does so in the most absurd ways. I am not sure who would find this entertaining but even as drama it doesn't work. The production values are high, although some of the dialogue, maybe due to the accents is a bit hard to understand. Overall though, I just don't understand why Hollywood churns out these uninteresting mislabeled films when independent filmmakers, on obviously smaller budgets, are turning out great stuff.

Unfortunately, this one is just extremely thin on plot and even thinner on suspense.A superstitious mom with a tragic past living in India very slowly becomes convinced for no legitimate reason that her daughter in the US has started dating a bad guy. Does he do anything to make us think she might be right? No. Not until the very last 10 minutes.Unlike most movies in this vein, the boyfriend doesn't act creepy or overly controlling or violent or jealous or whatever else you might expect. This lack of suspense makes the first 75% of the movie seem like just a boring romance with a crazy mom thrown in for kicks. The entire middle third of this movie drags on until finally, graciously, something happens.

Evil eye had potential and interesting moments but sadly fell apart as the film progressed and just didn't work so let's get started.First of all there was interesting characters and concept, there was great cinematography and representation. The concept of having a mother who believes in the supernatural and things like horoscopes and linking that to her relationship with her daughter and how she finds love was really interesting to me and for the first half was well explored, the character of the mother was also really interesting due to this and that aspect of her character sticked throughout and worked for me. The cinematography was also fantastic, the rich colours linked to the Indian culture, and the repeated emphasis on the evil eye was really interesting and added tension whenever the symbol appeared. I also thought the representation was great, to have Indian directors and actors and set locations was great for me and the proper way for representation, the film went in depth with multiple Indian traditions and I found it very interesting and informative to get a glimpse of the different culture.However, my first few negatives would be the rushed background, questionable character decisions, lack of believable relationships and awkward dialogue. I thought that the movie did a bad job at the background for the mother character, if they had developed her past relationship with her ex husband more at the beginning they wouldn't of had to overuse the flashbacks as much throughout the movie which for me made the pacing fairly clunky, I also thought that their was a lack of believable relationships, I never truly believed a lot of the relationships, due to the poor relationship between the mother and daughter it was just very odd and didn't work for the movie to have such a lack of a mother and daughter relationship or a healthy one, even the relationship with the daughter and the boyfriend just never felt organic, it came across very awkward and forced. There was also a lot of questionable character decisions, some of the things the mother said and did was really bad and made her character come across as mentally unstable and just a bad person, I personally thought the movie went too far the mother and what she did making it come across very over the top, and making the daughter so easily controllable was also a bad decision for me because it became more and more difficult to connect with or care about her character. Finally I also found the dialogue to be very awkward and clunky, most of the dialogue within the movie was just very blunt and lacked depth, this just made It awkward to watch and didn't help toward connecting with any of the characters if the actors don't get good dialogue to deliver it makes the movie feel very clunky and off.My final few positives would be the dark tone, use of flashback and the character background. The movie executed a very dark tone, especially with the attention to detail of the psychological effects of abuse and it's antagonists were very uncomfortable with how controlling the character was which sadly can happen in real life, the movies use of flashbacks to establish character background and depth for the mother was also good, despite me having issues with the pacing of these, I still found them good in terms of them making you understand the mother and her reasoning behind being so concerned for her daughter.My final few negatives however would be the unclear and unrealistic plot points, tonal issues and bad ending. They made so many plot points in the movie unclear It really effected the impact of most of the plot, having the mother obsessed with her daughters boyfriend and thinking he is her ex husband was never clear as he was nothing like him or we never saw his actions mimic her ex husbands because any hint of this was gotten rid off in the dialogue to make the mother seem crazy it just didn't work, I also thought the movie had so many tonal issues in terms of the atmosphere it created with the relationships and what kind of genre it wanted to be and my answer is simple It didn't know, the movie was just tonally a mess. Finally the ending was very bad, the movie tried so hard to make the mother seem crazy and when it turns out she wasn't it just didn't tonally make sense and just made a lot of the movie pretty pointless, having the boyfriend be a reincarnation of someone else if executed right could have been interesting but it just didn't work for me at all.Overall despite an interesting premise and some interesting charcters with great representation, Evil Eye is a big mess that slowly falls apart as the movie goes on, tonally not knowing what it was and sadly just didn't work for a movie."}, {"id": 63, "text": "I liked the basic premise of the movie and how the Indian culture, beliefs, myths and other aspects were layered into the story but rhe execution on the horror standard, that Blumhouse is known for, fell way short of the mark.

It was really funny how the Indian aspects were peppered in like the upbeat songs, the dance sequences from movies, the inclusion of Arre!, Na? Etc in general parlance etc. However, it just didn't feel like a horror movie. It was executed poorly. Never even felt or heard the background music.

First of all it feels like all four movies have been done by the same writer/ director. Even same running time: 1h :30 min. All have poor story, poor acting, poor everything. They all seem very rushed, without any depth whatsoever. In this one, it's basically about a mother and daughter talking over the phone for the most part of the film, like don't you have other stuff to do in your life??? The leading actress Sunita Mani who played the daughter, i liked her in the movie Save Yourselves, she was a lot of fun, here she's like another person, with too much makeup all the time, even when she's in bed sleeping!!!

It's average and here's why.My main issue I had with it was that the storyline itself just fell really flat. It was struggling to keep me engaged with the plot and characters and you could guess the ending half way into the film. The film is marketed wrong. I've seen this placed in horror. Do not watch this at all if you are intending on watching a horror genre film. It's more of a thriller/drama. The film could have gone down so many different avenues with the characters. For example we are introduced to her friends. Who we never see after the first 15 minutes. They could have been used in so many ways and added depth to a shallow plot.I still, however, didn't dislike the film. It entertained me somewhat and the performances weren't too bad either. If the plot was beefed up it could have been so much better. But yeah. 5/10, average."}, {"id": 69, "text": "Nothing is more scary than an overbearing mother. At least that is what Amazon Studios, who has partnered with thriller-maker Blumhouse Productions on an eight movie deal, believes. Their assessment is a good one even if not fully realized.In Evil Eye a superstitious mom burdens the desires of wedding bells and grandchildren smiles onto her unwed daughter who finally engages in a stable relationship. The twist arrives when the mother suspects the boyfriend is the reincarnation of the man who attempted to kill her 30 years ago. The movie is beautifully produced and has a most clever set up. Ultimately, that is all the movie encapsulates. With its long, familial discussions, Evil Eye would have worked better as an offbeat family comedy than billed as a deceptive horror.Usha (Sarita Choudhury) is a hopeful mother. She wants nothing but the best for her daughter Pallavi (Sunita Mani), even if that means mommy dearest must nudge her daughter into dating a proper Indian man. Sandeep (Omar Maskati) enters their lives and as Pallavi eventually warms to his cold eyes Usha sees something else. She is convinced this is the reincarnated essence of the man who attempted to kill her while eight months pregnant with Pallavi.Evil Eye dodges and weaves with the whole is-he-or-isn't-he mystery never building proper suspense. Any foreshadowing is entirely too light; the eventual resolution a shrug of acceptance rather than a sigh of relief. Written by Madhuri Shekar, who also wrote the Audible original the movie adapts from, Evil Eye mostly focuses on the trans-Atlantic conversations between Pallavi and Usha. Their relationship is a normal one, where the daughter is exasperated by yet loves her mother, while mom is desperately trying to warn her. Sandeep and his movements almost entirely stay in the background with any revelation (like - surprise! - an engagement!) breaking between their convos. Any of the horror, thrills, and even true mystery, comes too late in the game to warrant a roll of the dice.Directed by newcomers Elan and Rajeev Dassani, Evil Eye looks modern, sleek, and fun. Jumping between a non-touristy New Orleans to the mango-lassi colors of Delhi, the Dassani brothers establish location, routine, and family, using FaceTime as the ubiquitous deus ex machina. Likewise their camerawork is an artistic juxtaposition between intimate voyeurism and broad angles. Similar to the plot, the Dassanis appear to be more comfortable with light-hearted family fare rather than the mystery of the supernatural and grisly murder. Like many of their settings, the Dassanis favor the open and the airy, shying away from the dark and foreboding.All three principal family members - Usha, Pallavi, and patriarchal head Krishnan (Bernard White) - are enjoyable, relatable, and normal. Maskati's Omar is quiet and flat yet this might have been deliberate to keep the character understated. Understated, however, does not always equal compelling.While the familial concerns drive the narrative there is always the loaded pause of something more; deeper. The Dassanis seek to play in multiple genres yet never fully commit to any of those styles. Aspiring to a clean ending is a difficult task without first getting dirty. Evil Eye&lt; is an entertaining drama but an unsatisfying thriller."}, {"id": 70, "text": "I absolutely never think about the Bechdel test in a movie and whether or not said movie is passing said test. But in 'Evil Eye' I couldn't help but notice it failed it for basically the entire duration of the film. I'm not sure it even bothered me that much, it was just the first time I'd ever noticed it myself without someone else pointing it out in a review and me realising that it was true. That's how obvious it was. Also it didn't help that the film bored me stiff and I had a lot of time to contemplate things. This was not a good movie.This is meant to be a horror movie but it feels more like a romantic comedy (minus the comedy) for the duration of the runtime. I can't remember many horror movies taking this long to get to the point. And even then the point wasn't that good or interesting. I find it frustrating more than anything when one character knows something and the other characters don't believe them - especially when the thing is supernatural and there's no way it could possibly happen, but the main character can't understand why no one will believe them. It's just tedious.Almost the entire movie takes place in daylight, the characters are completely bland and the event the whole movie builds up to almost immediately fizzles out. This is one of the more generous 4/10 I have ever given. There's nothing good to see here."}], "reviews_amount": 71}
