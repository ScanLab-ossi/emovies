If anyone rated this a 10 out of 10 they deserve to be committed to a mental facility. Some scenes are decent at best but overall it's just really awful acting from almost everyone involved.

I need clarification... as my bf and I were watching this I honestly thought that the director was intentionally trying to do an action movie (very horribly) my bf was hilariously laughing at the slapstick comedy - trying to convince me that this was a comedy and not an action movie.

The pace was good, the actions much more than acceptable. Predictable, nothing new? So what? When I watch a movie I want to have some fun and about this movie I don't have anything to complain.

Look its B-movie and its clear the budget wasn't there. Also some of the acting was incredibly subpar. However it kind of gave me an early 2000's movie kind of vibe.

He is one of the most under-rated actors of our time and his real world knowledge of martial arts usually translates very well on screen.However... Even he couldn't save this one. I made it 40 minutes before turning it off. The action/fighting sequences were terrible and the acting was worse. The characters were either dry and forgettable or over acted.

The happy black , whiter -than-rice family comes across as fake, fake and extra fake! All of that has less to do with the actors/the outcome of the movie because the sole responsibility of their on screen acting abilities and dialog they're given falls directly on the writer and/or director, both of whom are Dallas Jackson. He and he alone controls the outcome of what we get to see on the screen but as this movie plays out we're being forced to watch this overload bunch of happy/sappy/toothy achy/breaky cracker and blacker actors do their best fake human being act. As a really old cracker I know FAKEY when I see it. Even the bad guys were all toothy and happy/smiling. Why? This movie did not improve as it played out so the IMDb low score reviews that I read beforehand were absolutely correct. It is a certified/bonified stinker! Watch if you dare? Bon Appetit'"}, {"id": 66, "text": "This movie should be used as a guide to how to not make an action movie! Seriously its bad, actually bad doesn't do this justice!

The dialogue could be taken from GTA.. The terrible acting continued throughout. In one scene, the bad guy walks over to the hostages and the stereotypical music guy slides over for him to sit down.. as if he had read the script, you need to see it to understand, its laughable!From the outset I wasn't expecting a blockbuster and this movie literally failed at everything.Avoid."}, {"id": 67, "text": "I should have listened to the reviews.

I'm sure the crew, actors, etc. did their best with what they had to work with. Unfortunately, their best couldn't save this movie. I'd give this movie 4.5 stars but, there are no half stars so, I'll give it 5 stars. The reason for the 5 stars is due to all the unintentional laughs this movie gave me. This movie ended up being more of a parody of the original movie than an actual sequel to it."}, {"id": 69, "text": "The movie has some minor flaws and isn't a high budget affair. Yet, it still is enjoyable and fun. And the fight/action scenes are enjoyable. Had some comic relief in places as well.

White's martial art - his style and his physique. Remember the prison scene in Blood &amp; Bone? Well, this ain't got nothing of that style.

There's a janitor that's supposedly a comic relief but it's just plain stupid. Everything in this movie is stupid."}, {"id": 71, "text": "I did not know a film could be this poorly written.

Fell asleep watching half the way, and then i happened to use the rest of the movie as a sleeping pill, whenever i lost sleep. But beware the side effects might differ from one person to another. To conclude, the script was sloppy, the acting was achy and the fight scenes we all waited for, were below expectation."}, {"id": 79, "text": "Good fight scenes, pretty scripted though.

But he defeats them one by one or one by three! Good stuff Never a dull moment. Good fight scenes in spite of some are saying.

Nothing about this movie made it worth watching."}, {"id": 99, "text": "OK just start, this isn't like the first movie with them down sudden death, it's much more low budget and not a lot of feeling to it. Michael Jai White is very skilled in martial arts so this movie is very action packed decent story but same kind of idea as the first movie and lots of CGI but it was a decent movie I really enjoyed it"}, {"id": 100, "text": "This movie premise is a familiar and predictable one, but that doesn't stop it from being fun and entertaining. Michael Jai White delivery as always. The comic relief sidekick/friend janitor is horrendous and the characters are annoying. Choreography could have been better, some of them are just waiting to be punched or shot at."}, {"id": 101, "text": "As the title states. I enjoyed the Original, this was an excellent sequel."}, {"id": 102, "text": "The label for this movie should be Comedy. It's like they spoofed all the 80's action movies I grew up on. It was great!"}, {"id": 103, "text": "It's a really good movie! Fight scenes were well choreographed, good lines, very fluid scene changes. Really good acting overall!"}, {"id": 104, "text": "I honestly cannot tell whether this movie is tongue-in-cheek (Police Academy style) or absolutely serious. It's hilariously awful. Bad writing, bad acting, bad fight scenes. Worst of all, the wife's wig budget was clearly $5; though, when the total budget is $200, I suppose you have to cut corners somewhere. I found this movie hilarious. I'm not sure I should have."}, {"id": 105, "text": "It contain no nudity small amount of profanity great family story line to watch with your family. funny and entertaining"}, {"id": 106, "text": "Loved it; full of action and humour. Special kudos to MJ White and hilarious Gary Owen"}, {"id": 107, "text": "They did not try to make serious movie and it works... its easygoing and has good action and fightscenes"}, {"id": 108, "text": "This is like a Disney Channel Original for the family to watch only with violence, blood and language. I would give this a 8 if this was exclusively on the Disney channel and my son loved it, but the fact this is on Netflix I am giving this a solid 4 because this is atrocious and not entertaining. Other than that, solid kids film with blood and language."}, {"id": 109, "text": "Where did it all go wrong for you? Yes I understand that it is very difficult for a cheap movie to get the backing from a major studio but oh boy why did any studio give this the green light? Also why did Michael Jai White sign to do this? sack your agent. Michael is a very talented martial artist and I own quite a few of his movies from the okay, universal soldier: the return to his great movie, blood and bone. This film is way, way down in my estimation, Michael what possesed you make this tripe? I will never know, is he that desperate for money? Another reviewer said that this film was a parody of the first sudden death, ah no it was not meant to be, in fact it was meant to be a serious sequel to it. In fact the van damme vehicle looked like a massive Hollywood blockbuster. Where did this go wrong? Well apart Rom the budget, which we all know about films finding it hard to get backup. Another thing viewers look for in films like this are the fight scenes and this was really bad at it as well. You will always find this in really badly done movies, the moves are done so slowly and loom very amateurish that anybody who has watched a few action movies can do better and just think people get paid for making these dreadful fight scenes. Do yourself a favour and don't watch this, the less people watch this may go and make Michael choose better vehicles to do. Go and watch Security and Acts Of Vengeance, which both made cheaply but are great actioners."}, {"id": 110, "text": "Imagine an action film from the 80s/90s: Bad guys take over a place and the protagonist has to fight through them to save the day. Now, imagine all of the cheap knock offs, parodies and satires of those classics. This one tried to be both and a good movie was not the result.The action was just stitched together fight scenes with every punch and kick requiring its own edit. The humor was bad, oh so bad, but if the writing and/or acting hadn't seemed like 95% of it was being phoned in it could have been so bad it was good instead of just bad. Nothing any of the characters said felt natural in any way.It almost seemed like this film started out as a kid friendly action film where the stakes were low and it was supposed to be more goofy than serious, but something happened along the way where that idea was scrapped but nothing was changed except gore being added to bump the rating up to an R. What's left is an awkwardly goofy movie that takes itself way too seriously. The two leads were the most okayish things in the movie even though they're just generic action hero and generic evil guy.Overall, it's a generic action flick that doesn't add anything new or do a whole lot well. If you've got the time to waste give it a watch, but avoid it if you value your time."}, {"id": 111, "text": "Jesse Freeman, a former soldier turned stadium security guard who's still readjusting to civilian life, takes his kids to see a basketball game where he works only for a well armed team of mercenaries to take over the arena and only Jesse can save the day.Welcome to Sudden Death is the latest in a long line of films produced by Universals Direct-to-video studio Universal 1440, a label that specializes in making sequels to moderately successful theatrical releases like Backdraft 2, Inside Man 2, and a glut of Dragonheart sequels just to name a few. In this case Welcome to Sudden Death is a remake of one of the better Jean Claude Van Damme vehicles Sudden Death from 1995 but the movie takes only the bare bones of its inspiration and slaps it on what feels like the tone and humor of Paul Blart.First the good, Michael Jai White is still charismatic and brings energy to the movie even if the material is beneath him. What fun there is to be had from this movie is because of the charm and physical prowess of white. The hand to hand combat scenes range from mediocre to okay(with the best one being a sequence in a locker room at the tail end of the movie) and despite not being as well staged as superior White vehicles like Blood and Bone or Falcon Rising they do convey some dynamic and forceful fights.The bad, the movie is obnoxiously silly. It is over stuffed with comic relief characters like Gus the janitor, Jesse's Kids, and a panicky rapper named Milli who all play their roles over the top with broad humor that does not land. Michael Eklund plays the villain code named Alpha and he is not a good villain. His performance feels more like a deranged hillbilly than a criminal mastermind and even taking into account the movie's goofy tone he still doesn't work.Welcome to Sudden Death is a pointless remake of an okay 90s action movie. While not completely without merit thanks to the usually reliable Michael Jai White your time would be better spent watching similar fare like Final Score or the original Sudden Death.Edit: for those of you who duck out before the end credits(or the end of the movie for that matter) the movie has the audacity to try to sequel bait with a post credits scene sting.......yeah, that's not happening."}, {"id": 112, "text": "That's what this action has going for it, it's in no way a great film, but it has fun with it's awfulness. You see it in Michael Jai White's performance, even he knows it's not a good movie, but he has fun with it anyway.This is a sequel to the Jean Claude Van Damme film from 90's, which I did not see. The stadium scenes are pretty good, the bad guys are cartoonishly over the type. Fight scenes are pretty fun also. Go into this movie not expecting a great film, but just an enjoyably bad action film, you'll just have fun watching."}, {"id": 113, "text": "I truly do love all movies, they all have something to offer and I've seen a huge amount. There are however three movies I've stopped watching after about 30mins, first was sliding doors with Gwyneth Paltrow, jungle 2 jungle with Tim Allen and now this piece of rehashed crap that was given a green light by the production company, why is anyone's complete guess. Don't get me wrong I do love Michael Jay White in anything because the guy can act and most importantly fight well but it has to one, have a story worth telling and two, be original. The description puts this as a sequel to the original with Jean Claude Van Damme but no, it's a complete rip off of the story, the scenes are nearly play by play and just adding African Americans to the story does not make it new. Hence, go woke, go broke. That and Michael Eckland (whoever the F he is) is by no means near the ruthless bad guy that the late Powers Boothe was able to bring to screen. To be honest, do yourself a favour. Do not spend money and more importantly time watching this. I watched Range 15 yesterday and would rather watch that on repeat for a week straight than sit through the rest of this crap and Range 15 was cheaper to rent."}], "reviews_amount": 114}
