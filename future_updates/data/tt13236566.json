The leads had great chemistry with each, the scenery of Guam was beyond gorgeous and it was something genuinely pleasant to watch. 2020 been stressful enough and sometimes you just want to enjoy a movie that doesn't require you to be invested. Hopefully, this draws more attention to the beautiful territory of Guam and it's people."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This is my first Christmas movie of the 2020 holiday season and what a great way to kick the festivities off.It wasn't as corny/sappy as the usual Hallmark/Lifetime Christmas movies tend to be (which I love) but instead had a slightly more realistic feel to it. I didn't feel amazing heat between Eri and Klaws and I believe that was intentional because the primary focus was the Christmas drop. I could have used a little more spice between them but overall the movie was solid and predictable.I am giving it a 6.5 on my Lifetime/Hallmark/Holiday movie scale."}, {"id": 3, "text": "A run of the mill Romantic comedy that isn't original, but ticks most of the boxes, the acting was okay but the scenery was amazing. It is a Christmas movie, so you don't need to be Einstein to figure out the ending, but it gives you that warm glow you need. Nice movie to pass the time."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Not sure why this received low review ratings from people. It was a cute christmas movie which was enjoyable to watch. Its nice to see a different style of Christmas movie and also shows what happens in the real world. Kat and Alexanders chemistry was nice to see and id love them to make a second movie."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I loved this movie. It's such a heartwarming and touching message based on the real Christmas Drop done by the US Department of Defense. It's a unique story and a reminder of the kindness we need more of in the world. Well done Netflix!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "This movie wants to come off as a Christmas Romance movie, but it never really gives time to develop the two main characters relationship, until the very end with a stereotypical kiss ending which feels weird because to the audience the two main characters just feel like new friends instead of love interests. It seems to develop a good friendship between an Air Force Captain and a Congress Aid/Assistant. Together they spread the Christmas spirit and generosity with the help of the service men and woman of the American Air Force. The movie is slow and predictable and feels like it wants to be a lifetime movie or a Christian movie. The lovers plot is uninteresting."}, {"id": 7, "text": "It was good enough that I watched it all the way through. Cute moments between characters. Good background that the movie was based on. I just wish it spent more time on the people they were helping and less on the 2 main characters side story."}, {"id": 8, "text": "I kept thinking something wasn't quite coming through with the legitimate sentimental feelings of Christmas. It might be mis-casting with actors that don't have chemistry (I kept thinking what if Kurt Russel and Goldie Hawn were in the roles, how much more humble and regular their love struggle could be, more real). These two aren't bad, though, so it might have been a combination of lax directing style and a script that needed punching up. Too much seem like actors are struggling to be in a good mood, to be kind, to be real. Instead it too often feels preachy because the actors fail to relate the realness of their characters and their backgrounds. It could have worked. I'd like more like it, but done better, less fake sentiment and more real legit love in the lines."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Did anyone else notice Kat Graham's gait instability?

Yes, a standard Christmas feel good message with cheesy romance thrown in. But,.... I saw in the movie the message that all military feel when stationed abroad and away from their homes and family---- camaraderie and coming together in support and help of each other and their local community. I appreciate the movie for its message of the true story of assistance provided by USAF in the actual Operation Christmas Drop."}, {"id": 11, "text": "It's a bit early for Christmas movie with this coming out at the beginning of November. This one really missed the mark for me, I already had no real expectations going in, but this movie was over the top cheesy and predictable, not in a good way. From the worst CGI gecko I've ever seen to the random cringey Christmas carols uncomfortably sung by the actors to the overly happy locals and base people, this movie was one of the most generic I've seen."}, {"id": 12, "text": "If you've ever seen a good movie, you will notice this isn't one.

Sorry, but this movie sucks."}, {"id": 13, "text": "This movie inaccurately depicts the gorgeous island of Guam. Claiming that the military is a savior for them, when all they do is ruin the land and terrorize the people. On top of the tiresome storyline and terrible portrayal, the moving is plain and boring. No chemistry between the actors and it sounds like a 13 year old on wattpad wrote it. I would give a 0/10 but it's not possible."}, {"id": 14, "text": "I tried to like this movie but I kept getting distracted by the bad acting and the constant thought that Kat Graham either crapped her pants, has the back of an 80 year old or she was drunk while filming because the way she walked had me rolling. Idk but I couldn't stop laughing at the awkwardness of it all."}, {"id": 15, "text": "This was a fun, look at how other countries celebrate Christmas.

The dialogue wasn't too corny and ridiculous like some of the others tend to be. The plot made sense and didn't get crazy or unrealistic. It didn't feel forced and it stayed on topic. It was light hearted, but also had a good meaning. If you watch these types of moves expecting something new/different than the usual predictable...why bother watching? These are feel good movies that can put a smile on your face.Kind of wanted more of the development of their romance, but also liked that it wasn't the main focus."}, {"id": 24, "text": "This movie is outrageously predictable and not very entertaining."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Ok, Let me take a deep breath.

But it is a pretty standard Christmas story wrapped up in the tropics and military garb.

The casting was a nice choice and the location was not some small town! Yeah, it was a small island, but whatever.

It was quite boring for me to watch, it just seemed like it was all about the military and how they serve. The romance and attachment seemed odd and thrown in . It is nice to see Amazon doing Christmas and some clean content movies but this was too documentary! I feel like if you are like me and don't like documentaries, you won't like this either."}, {"id": 41, "text": "The story background is interesting but the movie was sooo boring, no action at all and all the scenes and the ending were so predictable."}, {"id": 42, "text": "I absolutely loved this movie.

The plot is Hallmark. The acting is Hallmark. Even the music is Hallmark. Nothing wrong with it. Just don't expect it to be Scorsese.

The scenery is stunning, the real military hardware and the CGI gecko set it apart from the usual Hallmark.

The usual christmas movie staples of snow, hot chocolate, ice skating and cookie backing were traded for beautiful beaches, sunshine, snorkelling and coconut shavings for snow! Living in a tropical country myself this rang closer to home. The lead actors were brilliant and had wonderful chemistry and the captain wih his twinkling eyes and smile truly made you want to just stop everything you were doing at the moment and go do somebody a Christmas good turn right away. The romance was secondary and the true essence of the film of paying it forward and helping people who were less fortunate than you shone through without being too sappy. And also it helped rekindle the Christmas spirit not only in our leading lady and the congresswoman but also in me. It also helped bring to the spotlight the very real operation Christmas drop which has been happening since 1951. It has surely earned a place in my list of go to Christmas movies from here forward."}, {"id": 50, "text": "First of all, the CGI gecko was absolutely ridiculous. It was so bad that I laughed and thought it was going to be a Disney-like character in the film. Maybe that it would start talking to them. I dont know. Somebody should get that artist over to Disney. My biggest complaint, which I havent seen anyone talking about, is that they dropped the CARDBOARD boxes in the middle of the water...filled with supplies like clothing, medicine, and whatever the hell else. They couldn't drop them on the actual island? Maybe move over 20ft and hit the beach? Or how about something a little more robust than cardboard boxes? It just doesn't add up to me."}, {"id": 51, "text": "Sweet, warm and finely executed this Christmas set rom com is a fresh surprise. The pair of protagonists are really good and appealing, the story resonates to familiar themes with accuracy and magical realism. it's funny, lovable and emotional (it subtly depicts the effects of being apart from Loved ones, especially during holidays). Perfect for all ages."}, {"id": 52, "text": "I like a good romantic comedy, but this is so far from a good romantic comedy.

The scenery is beautiful and the message of helping people over the holidays is both happy and inspiring in a year where neighbours may be doing it tough. The highlight for me is that it's a Christmas movie without a love declaration. It's still cheesy, portrays unrealistic scenarios, and has ridiculously young hot people in bathers but at the end of the day, it made me smile and feel happy. That's all I really want over the holiday season!"}, {"id": 55, "text": "This movie is all things that make a Christmas movie a Christmas movie. The cheesy super sweet dialogue, the over the top Christmas decorations, and of course the romance. What makes this movie stand apart, however, is the true depiction of what military families experience away from home. We do whatever we can to make it feel like home by sharing joy and love with others. This will definitely be a holiday movie we watch for years to come."}, {"id": 56, "text": "I like military movies and I love Christmas, so this was a win win choice to pick.I really liked it. I like both leads anyway and I liked the story. It would be so cool to be a part of something that amazing in real life. Bringing happiness and joy to people who aren't as privileged as others. So nice.I'm glad I watched it and will watch it again."}, {"id": 57, "text": "A generic Christmas comedy. It is about a girl who goes to an island to see if the procedures they are performing are functional or to close it, discovering the unexpected. Quality. Entertaining Parsimonious at times. Light jokes. It does not focus on the love story, it goes to situations. The problem is that the ending is the most trite, the performances are linear, the moments that should be the most emotional pass without meaning. The message he tries to give is good, about giving to others and rediscovering what made us choose what we are professionally, but with the precarious actions that he has, he does not succeed. Some effects are not fully achieved. It shows data of this type of operations which turns it into a fiction based on a real situation.

The setting itself becomes a character, makes you feel like your really there and Kat Graham and Alexander Ludwig started out with no chemistry, but it got better has the movie went on. Virginia Madsen is also good in her role also.

So, how did this film compare to other Christmas romance films? It was...OK. I mean, it was a decent film, not the best I have seen nor the worst. It was a nice story, a caring story. And the script/dialogue was not bad. The acting was pretty good too. I am a fan of the Vampire Diaries and Vikings, the TV series that the two leads are known for. Kat Graham's performance was strong; she does a good job in such roles. Alexander Ludwig was not bad. To be honest, it was a bit strange seeing him in this genre of film after watching him for years in Vikings. But he did OK, though I am not sure this is the genre for him. The chemistry between them (the leads) was pretty good as well, which is important in a romance film. The supporting cast was strong. Fans of Battlestar Galactica will be happy (and maybe surprised) to see Aaron Douglas (as the Mayor) in the film. The scenery (filming location) was quite beautiful. I especially enjoyed the drop from the cargo plane at the end of the film. It was a nice scene. Overall, it was a decent film that Netflix has added to its original Christmas movie collection. Worth a watch if you want to get in the Christmas spirit."}, {"id": 94, "text": "Initial Thoughts: In the age old war of Netflix's quantity vs quality. I feel like this film fell on the quality side. Based on the real life, OPERATION CHRISTMAS DROP, this film is definitely a feel good, heart-warming movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family as a month before Christmas, Christmas movie. Though the acting and chemistry between actors seemed almost fake, or forced, they were still able to bring about a decent movie.Pros: The story, for me, is incredible as it uses the real life OPERATION CHRISTMAS DROP as the inspiration for the movie. Emotions were strong with regards to the Christmas spirit and trying look out for those who struggle, especially around the Christmas season. Though the acting wasn't outstanding, it was just strong enough to bring this one home to a happy ending.Cons: There was hardly any CGI used in this film, but the little that was is enough to mention. The gecko they used for the film should've been real as opposed to the awkward VR looking one they had. Besides bad CGI the chemistry between actors was weak. On their own they seemed to be great, but the romantic interaction they should've had was not. Any time they were together it felt awkward, forced, and uncomfortable the entire time.Overall: I'd say if you're looking for a decent quality, family movie that doesn't have a bunch of romance in it, than this one would be for you. Would I recommend watching this film specifically as a Christmas movie? No, I wouldn't, but the story is great as it speaks about being selfless and doing what you can, and what makes you happy, to bringing joy to those around you."}, {"id": 95, "text": "If the US Military were ever to do a rose-tinted promotional video, then this would certainly serve that purpose. Kat Graham (Erica) is the ambitious aide to a Congresswoman (Virginia Madsen) who is looking to save money by shutting down surplus military facilities. When she spots an article featuring pilot Capt. Andrew (Alexander Ludwig) complete with Santa hat describing their Polynesian Christmas Drop, the Scrooge-like politician despatches her assistant to their idyllic island base to write a report that will shut the whole thing down. On arrival, however - her horizons change as she realises that she has the hots for the handsome Ludwig and that there is a heck of a lot more to the goings-on on the island than she had originally thought. We are never in doubt as to the outcome; but the two stars do gel, Ludwig has some charm without his Viking leathers, and the story has a gently comedic, Christmas feel good factor that nods to the somewhat crucial combined operations of US, Japanese and Australian forces that supply (not just at Christmas) many of the tiny islands and atolls in the Pacific at actually very little additional expense to anybody. Sure it's sentimental, but it's the time of year for it..."}, {"id": 96, "text": "In a word: Boring!I will say I did enjoy Kat Graham and Alexander Ludwig in the lead roles, I thought they worked well together. They are, unfortunately, the only plus points I have for 'Operation Christmas Drop'.It really is just so dull. The way they set the plot up is weak, with it instantly becoming obvious what is on the way. You are just waiting for Graham's character to switch, which she actually does quite early on. So the rest of the film, until the 'big moment', is filled with nothingness... just pointless filler.The real life story that inspired this is quite cool, but this doesn't do it any justice sadly. It isn't even anything negative, at least to me, but there's little to nothing positive about it either."}], "reviews_amount": 97}
