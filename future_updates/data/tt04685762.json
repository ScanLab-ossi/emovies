I can understand the main character, Lily, having such strong powers if Nancy conceived her while having all the power of Manon. Like at the party with Chris before she pushed him out the window. But that doesn't explain why all of the girls have such powerful magic without any explanation. Don't even get me started on the random male witch guy. Also, what happened to his son's after they kill him?"}, {"id": 1, "text": "The Craft is far better than this sequel. Believe you me, it's not at all worth watching whatsoever."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Honestly this was such a disappointment to see. This movie contains more like a cliche teen high school movie elements instead of thriller/horror. I personally can't see any horror items in it. I hate how they never mentioned main characters' backstories or their daily lives. And there were SO many plotholes that i can't catch up while watching. Literally I'm so disappointed rn just go and watch the original one and don't waste ur time watching this. In the end I'd like these characters so much if writers wrote them better. But with that many unanswered questions in the plot and zero backstory on main characters... a no from me"}, {"id": 3, "text": "I loved the first movie, so was really looking forward to this. Don't waste your time it is dreadful. I actually kept rewinding it thinking i had missed something. No story, no plot , no explanation for anything. The main character is a reaonably good actress but that is the only positive comment i can make. Total disappointment"}, {"id": 4, "text": "The whole story was rushed and nothing made sense!

Very poorly written, impossible to like any of the characters.

I saw The first movie when it came out and was really excited for this sequel.. but what the hell just happened here? Zero character development, the story.. there is no story besides the fact she somehow is connected to one of the first movie characters and probably that was the only thing that made me watch this disaster till the end.. to see Nancy again.. for about 2 seconds.. in the whole movie.. yeah..So many holes.. how was Helen connected to Nancy? Who or what was that Adam guy? He has a family crest with a snake and a knife.. cool.. and that's about it, all you get to know about this guy.. oh and he has 3 sons that are like just there.. adding zero to the movie (that scene where one of them is apparently sleep walking in Lily's room.. ???) What's the background on the other girls (I cant even remember their characters names, that's how good it was)? They were supposed to be the main characters.. When I saw legacies I was expecting that the girls were connected to the originals.. in some way.. but no, not even a tiny mention of them. Aaaand how did Nancy got pregnant if she was locked up in an asilum all this years?!I just can't.. I'm sorry guys, but this one shouldn't exist.. :("}, {"id": 8, "text": "This is such a bad movie. Where is the magic, where is the darkness, I miss Nancy. The score was interesting, Nicholas Galitzine as Tommy was good and the last scene appearance was nice. The acting and the screenplay with its undeveloped plots were awful. Stick to the original!"}, {"id": 9, "text": "I was one of the ones who thought this movie actually looked quite good, everyone was hating on it from the jump. I've watched the craft since I was a kid I'm 24 now. It felt so rushed? So many things was left unanswered? How the hell did Nancy conceive lily if she's been in an asylum all these years? Was the step dad menor? Some stuff in the trailer wasn't even in the film? First they was friends then they were best friends? Then they was practising then all of the sudden they're these powerful coven? The ending with the step dad? Felt like I blinked and it was over? How was the adoptive mum connected to Nancy? There was no character development at all with no one, and I hate to be so negative about this cause I really thought it looked good but I was left so disappointed. And what was that ending with the step dad that was it? They really should have left this one alone or if anything brought the original 4 back and continued some type of story with them. It's a HUGE no from me. Again I'm so sorry to be so negative but you'll probably get it once you finishes it"}, {"id": 10, "text": "I get that changing things with the time was important but the craft was never a friendly little movie for the kids. The fact that blumhouse produced such a film that should have been in daytime TV surprises me. I mean charmed has more edge than this. Also the build up just to get one quick scene with Nancy is just baffling. Nancy also wasn't a natural born witch so how could her daughter be? So many questions but so little to go off."}, {"id": 11, "text": "No depth and no development...So disappointing. This movie is garbage for 2020. weak and without essence, made more for teenagers ... It had potential."}, {"id": 12, "text": "As a teenage fun of this movie back then, this 'remake' is like a bad C rated movie you randomly found playing at the television late at night. They destroyed what would have been a great remake. The characters couldn't fill the gaps of their own storyline, the special effects made the whole witchcraft moments looked like a Nikelodeon fairy tale thing and the story - for a moment I was wondering about what I'm watching here. Just bad.The original movie had a natural essence in it. A storytelling which not only tells you where the original characters come from and go to but also showed some realism and understanding to paganism and witchcraft.F-this movie."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Pure GARBAGE. Only saw it because my man David Duchovny is in it. GAAARBBAAGE. Can't stress it enough.

I loved The Craft, this film had NOTHING to do with the original, other than stealing a character for a very predictable ending to try and sell the film. No explanation at all about anything!This felt more like I was reading a teenage girls diary, hormones, gender equality, men are bad yet I have a crush on one who treated me the worst, oh wait and he is bisexual, blah blah blah.The Coven felt like a joke! There was nothing ominous about the girls, it was trivial and disappointing.I cringed the entire way through.It felt more like the girls belonged in a superhero universe than an esoteric one.Sigh. This is a definite MUST MISS!1/10"}, {"id": 15, "text": "As a huge fan of the original I went in with an open mindset, clean slate,- trying my best not to compare it to the original. But this movie was just bad all on its own. It was like a really bad after school special - like a bad Disney movie. - I've seen better low budget movies that did more and made more sense. The special effects / powers etc,,, were just a joke. It would have had a better chance selling itself without trying to connect to the original movie. Everything was super over acted, and they went wayyyy overboard with all the slow-motion scenes. If you removed all the slow motion parts, the movie would be probably 30 min shorter. Also., it was over edited- you saw most of the movie in the trailers, and some of what you saw in the trailer was removed from the movie. There was one small twist, and if they incorporated that earlier in the movie and made it more of the plot, the movie may have had a small chance. To sum it up, don't waste your money on this, - I'm sure it will be available for free on Netflix or cable very soon."}, {"id": 16, "text": "I loved the 1996 original. Watching this shows just how much the world has changed. 1996 it was the movie for those of us who didn't fit in. This is just boring, predictable and safe. Where is the violence and the darkness of the original. The teen girls pushed to far taking revenge."}, {"id": 17, "text": "This movie was so badly made... I almost liked the beginning, the mother-daughter moment in the car but that was the only real emotion I got from the whole film. It felt like a teenage flick, where situations don't really develop, you just jump from one situation into the next one. No depth and no development to the girls whatsoever. So disappointing. This is garbage. And the ending? Laughable."}, {"id": 18, "text": "The original version of The Craft is a movie that has never gone away. Written and directed by Andrew Fleming, who also made one of my favorite (and most derivative) slashers, Bad Dreams, and screenwritten by Peter Filardi (Flatliners) with direction from producer Douglas Wick, who wanted to mix the high school experience with witchcraft, the stories that it tells have continued to engage audiences since it came out in 1996.This Blumhouse reimagining/sequel had the opportunity to be interesting. Would it take a whole new pass at the story? Would it refer to anything from the past? Or would it be a muddled mess that tries to have a little of both?This new version has the same problem with so many reimagining: instead of either giving you a new look at an old story or moving past the origin to tell the real story that people want to see (doing so here will necessitate a big spoiler, so I'll explain more at the end of this after plenty of spoiler space), this just tells a new origin and sets up characters without creating a single memorable moment or character that you come back to and want to know more about.The original four girls - Sarah, Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle - each had their own reasons for turning to witchcraft. They all had their own issues, personalities and even styles. And almost 25 years later, I can still tell you about them and how their individual stories all come together.I just watched this movie last night and I can not tell you a single identifiable thing about the three supporting characters that make up the witches other than two (Frankie and Lourdes) are interchangeable brunettes and Tabby is a black girl who jokes that she doesn't like Beyonce. We learn nothing of their home lives, their challenges and who they want to be in this world, only that they feel ostracized and they feel the need to turn to the left hand path.Lily Schechner is the girl who will be their fourth, completing their coven. She's new in town, as her mom has moved to a new town to live with Adam Harrison (David Duchovny) and his three sons. Maybe I've grown too old, but every boy in this movie felt so interchangeable that I had difficulty figuring out which one was their friend Timmy and which were the three brothers.In fact, why did there even have to be three brothers? None of them are truly essential to the story at all, with the oldest being a cipher at best and a living jump scare at worst. They are interchangeable stock characters that you could remove from this movie and still end up in the same place. Even the villain - spoiler, it's Duchovny) never really seems to gain any steam or even appear to be much of a threat.Zoe Lister-Jones, who wrote and directed this, never really sets up any tension. Again, I must refer to the first movie, where it seemed like without magic, the girls' lives would be meaningless. Nancy, for example, has a life so depressing that you wonder why it took her so long to go completely off the deep end. Her reveal as a sociopath and the girls must working together to stop her tragic unraveling speaks volumes. The moment where the girls realize that getting everything they wanted still leaves them wanting more is as well. Not a single moment happens in this movie that comes within a newt's eye of that.That said, Lister-Jones based much of the film and its characters in her own adolescent experiences as a misgendered youth. She also moved with her mother into a home of all men, so she had to adapt. This is the only part of this film that seems true to me.Now, after adequate spoiler space, I'll tell you the problem.Have you ever seen the Jem and the Holograms movie? It spent so much time telling you the origin story - which took 22 minutes in the original cartoon - that the moment you want to see, Pizzazz and the Misfits vs. Jem and the Holograms, is relegated to a post-credit scene of a perfectly cast Kesha threatening to ruin the happy ending.Here, Lily learns with about ten minutes left in the film that she's adopted. As we get to the end credits, we follow her to a hospital where she gets to meet her birth mother...Nancy Downs (Fairuza Balk). The story of what happened, why Nancy is still in an asylum and how she could have had a daughter, as well as what happens next, is way more interesting than what we just watched.The frustrating thing of Blumhouse - the studio who made a Black Christmas that seemed more like The Skulls and a Halloween that spent inordinate time discussing sandwiches and peanut butter on private parts than having The Shape murder people - is that they will eventually remake every horror movie worth anything. Sure, we'll always have what came before, but for some young folks, their first exposure to something great will be a watered-down modern reimagining that's missing the word imagination."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This was a train wreck of a movie.

There was literally zero character build-up and whilst the acting was good, the storyline was pretty basic overall.

The real question here: if you have no vision how to improve a story/movie, why even bother to make a remake!? Anyway, talent seems a scarce resource in the movie business these days. People should work on their skills and craft and not on their hair color, next piercing, or social media accounts or whatever they are using their brainpowers on.

Nancy wasn't a natural witch and she was bound at the end of the first film so how did she have a daughter born with natural given powers they didn't even explain the amulet that was given to her at birth. It would have been so much better if she was Sarah's daughter and the stepfather was just a glamoured Nancy out for revenge who had previously killed Sarah and made it look like a suicide after giving birth.

There was mental illness, young love, and of course witchcraft, albeit a fantasised version of. This poor knock off had none of that. A random massive period leakage at the begining, which was completely unnecessary and the small occurrences after could have been brought fourth in so many other, less degrading ways.

Her being involved with this chewed-up bubble gum, new-age teen remix by wannabe woke Nickelodeon vibe they had going on in this film (when -or if- you watch this film, you'll understand what I mean) was a bad batch that very few would or could appreciate. It was an insult to all the fans who wanted to know what happened to Nancy and the rest of The Craft characters (who aren't even mentioned).If they had named the film something else &amp; hadn't tried so hard to push that Men Are Evil, Women are Queens agenda the whole time (along with dragging my beloved Nancy into the mix), it might've been something worth watching. I mean, I gave Charmed a chance (with Alyssa Milano. I'm not interested at all in the remake) and that was kind of a rip-off of The Craft BUT they didn't butcher the film or say it was associated and they didn't have to. We knew it was something that was inspired by the movie. And then it turned into an entirely different thing. This could've been like Charmed and then they wouldn't have had to bring back an iconic character from the previous film to try to legitimize this.Now, unlike a lot of other people that have reviewed this film, I have to admit, there were some things I did like about this one. I liked how the three girls seemed to have an understanding of how magic was meant to be used and that they realized that with great power comes great responsibility. And I did enjoy how the three girls backed the new girl almost immediately (coming to her rescue after her menstruation situation was beautiful and I wish that more people were as understanding as those three girls in that embarrassing moment). I also liked that even though there was an issue with a boy, it wasn't like the previous movie. There wasn't any jealousy among them. In fact, there wasn't any real emotions in this film at all (except for that one young man in the movie making his confession).This is the problem that Hollywood has been having lately. All these remakes and sequels and prequels, trying to one-up each other or capture the magic of the originals and they've lost the heart and soul that went into the first project which is what made it so transcendent. It's like they've run out of original ideas and are now just running with anything they can think up without taking the time to make a proper script or give any explanations for anything that's happening in the films.

Oh, where to begin? Firstly--weren't there supposed to be four girls? Like the Rocky Horror before it, one of the main reasons the original worked was the characters. The original became a cult (no joke intended) classic because it spoke to the often maligned groups of young girls/women that weren't often portrayed in film.Whether you identified with Nancy as the poor trash girl who is surrounded by the affluent who looked down on you, or it was Bonnie and her scars that reminded you of that physical defect that made you unpopular: There was a character to relate to. Here--there is none of that. From the first moment we see the girls on screen, we're struck with just how normal they are. My first thought was: I think you've forgotten your target audience here. The original spent a good deal of time making us identify with and understand why each girl was a reject from 'normal' society. Here, they're all pretty and seem of reasonable means when compared to their peers. Heck, the one girl lives in a house that you can literally run down its halls!So, our MAIN character (I put that in caps because she is literally the only character we get to know) and her mother are moving in with mom's boyfriend and My Three Sons. Well, evidently nobody bought this girl the book Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret because she has an unfortunate accident in school. Then Carrie uses her supernatural telekinetic powers to take revenge on all those who laughed at her! What? That's a different movie? Oh. Well, you can understand my confusion. Anyway, she meets the other girls and...you're a wizard, Harry. She of course takes this news with little muss and fuss and is soon casting spells. Naturally they teach her THE CRAFT by instructing her how they ALWAYS form a circle of salt when they cast spells...and by ALWAYS--we mean just this one time and then it is never spoken of again. There's an odd moment of What's your lineage? You have to get it from somewhere. Um, what? Wasn't Sarah's whole deal in the original was that she was a 'Natural Witch'? (Yes, I know she got it from her mother, but it does imply that witches can be born with the power.) Given the ending (that was completely ruined by the trailer) this lineage thing leads to some serious questions. (SPOILER ALERT!) Nancy didn't have any magical lineage that I'm aware of--so no--not sure what your talking about. Well, anyway, they stop time, move things with their minds, and levitate...this sounds like something Spelling would write...oh wait.Anyway, the movie takes a serious left turn into Soap Opera land when the girls cast a spell on a mean guy to make him a nice guy. Umm...sweetie...I don't think you read that spell book. I'm pretty sure any practicing witch would tell you your instruments to be cleansed (and possibly sacred)...I'm not sure a bong counts. Well, now he's just one of the gals! There's an endless and agonizing scene where he confesses that he has bisexual leanings. Being an outcast herself--no wait--no she isn't--whatever. Our heroine decides to screw with his already confused sexuality by casting a love spell on him....our hero ladies and gentlemen! Am I missing something here? Look, I'm all for you playing to the LGBT crowd that love and support the original...but wasn't that the point of including a Trans character? You remember? The one you made such a big fuss about including? Shouldn't you...I don't know...give her some focus! Well, look--we're right back to forgetting our other three girls exist.Now we hit the point that really veers away from the original's message. The original had the very strong message about power corrupting. We understood why each girl let the power go to their head...but it was still a big part of the plot. Now--the other three almost immediately realize they've abused their power and take steps to limit themselves. There is one vague moment where you think there might be some repercussions happening...but it turns out the brother sleepwalks. Huh? Wow. That was the worst fake-out I've seen in a long while. I'm glad it was never mentioned before and then never spoken of again. Well, this time around the message is girls are good and down with the sexist male regime! Yes, only men can be corrupt evil pig-swine who want nothing more than to take a woman's power away. Yes, it turns out the stepdad is an evil manwhich (thank you Xander from Buffy). Of course, for those of us that remember our Thundercats, this moment was spoiled at seeing his family crest. Well, girl power to the rescue!Well, its finally over...and none of us have to go to jail for murder. Too bad about my bisexual friend though...oh well. Too bad about my stepdad's sons too. I mean, they didn't really do anything...oh well. Time to go find my birth mother...yes, I was adopted. (Spoiler Alert again!) Well, turns out its Nancy....dun dun dun! How? Good question. The movie takes great pains to avoid answering who my father is. Now we all know it couldn't have been Chris; considering he and Nancy broke up months before the first movie started...and she didn't seem pregnant. Has she been in the asylum this whole time? Was the janitor my father? So--how does this make any sense?A manwhich did it.Final Thoughts: Who are these people? That seems to be the massive lumbering dinosaur in the room. We spend WAY too much time with the Main girl; to the complete detriment of the others. I don't know them and therefore can't identify with them. There is absolutely no characterization or development here to make you care one whit about any of the other three girls. Which maligned group are these girls supposed to represent? Part of the charm of the original characters was that they appealed to several underrepresented social groups. Here--they all sound like Valley girls that just want to 'dish' about boys at the mall. And look--I'm really not trying to downplay the bisexual guy's story. I really appreciated the comment about how everyone just assumes he's GAY because he happens to like both. It's just too bad there wasn't some other character on the sexuality rainbow that could have made us feel for her struggle with non-conformity and gender identity. Someone in the Pans or Trans spectrum perhaps.

There's woke and then there's throat punching us with it.

Physically and emotionally, they don't seem to convince as a group. I have to say that apart from Lilly, the three other witches have been given no backstories and excessive amounts of sassy dialogue which doesn't give us any insight into their lives at allDavid Duchovny must just need money for renovations to be involved in something like this and the suicide theme is awkwardly handled with the girls not accepting that they actually played a role in what happened.

Some of the characters were great, and I loved the ending. However, this movie was predictable and the dialogue and acting were weak and bland. The first scene when all the girls meet up together, they start talking about the one being a twilight Stan and throwing just about every buzzword into that scene alone. It was cringey and unnecessary. The acting was ... meh. I hated how they blamed Lily for mixing spells after whatshisface died (he was so useless I don't remember his name), but they were at fault for just throwing her into witchcraft without explaining the rules and restrictions. The only likable character was Tabby. And the ending, while great, was extremely predictable, as was much of the rest of the movie. It's not a long movie, give it a go, but know what you're watching.

That's all we need to know about them. Movie is a solid 5 to 6 rating. It's not a horror movie and I'm not sure why anyone would expect it to be. These other reviewers must not have seen the 1996 movie which also was not a horror movie. I hate when people who know nothing about films leave bad reviews for a movie.

This one lines more in the department of Charmed meets the Craft in that aspect but I really enjoyed it and the connection to the original character was awesome to see.

I mean, according to the stepdad they should've gotten this bye someone else-The ending, I loved it and hated it. So Lily is Nancy child ? Okay but Nancy lost her powers, right? So how did she give it to her child? When did this all happen :O ? -The stepdad was the evil one here so I get that but was he Manon (don't know if I wrote that correctly) Or who/what was he? -Killing or made the stepdad disappear was way to easy Timmy could've gotten a bigger role imo. You would've , again, more character development and could feel more sentimental. Now I was like: So he tells his secret , his stepsister digs him and puts another spell on him and the next day followed up being killed by his dad!? What....?-Would've loved to see the girls using their magic more on other ways. In the craft you see them really doing spells and trickery on themselves. I missed it a bit in this movie except for some parts. They're teenagers...what would you've done if you could do magic?So still give this a 6 because I think there will be a third part and I would love to see this happening and I hope they'll do something with advice given by the audience."}, {"id": 142, "text": "So.... Just watched The Craft Legacy. Where do I begin? Firstly, I feel there is a hell of a lot of unjustified hatred being aimed at this film. Yes, it is woke. Woke AF!

It had a lot going on so the film could have done with being longer to give us some more in depth knowledge about certain characters and their storyline but it didn't try to be the original movie. It really made itself its own entity which I'm so pleased about. There was a shedload of Easter eggs which I loved spotting. The chemistry between the Coven is amazing!!! All the girls are great. Their bond was lovely to see. It was very respectful to Witchcraft practice. It thankfully didn't fall into the final act of the first film which I always felt upset by. And.... That final scene has me terribly excited for another film Blumhouse! Very well done. \ud83d\ude03"}, {"id": 143, "text": "I really enjoyed this film. I love all things wicca/paganism.

We followed the character Lily moving to her new school and home with her mother, new step-father and 3 new siblings. Very simple yet conveying graphics and spells. This movie does a great job at paying homage to the original without it being a retelling and more of a continuation. If you are into wicca in television/film, this is a good watch for you and a cup of wine. The actresses did a great job and the guy who played the character Timmy, brought tears to me.

I like that they didn't turn on each other though but we're trying to protect themselves from themselves, but because of the need of a bad guy I felt Duchovny's character was a fleshless attempt. I would've preferred it to have been the eldest brother and develop that character. There were far too many characters with little backstory and little to do. Timmy was great but then killed off without real exploration. Plus the cameo at the end felt like a last minute u-turn to change it into a sequel.I think it would've actually made a great Netflix exclusive, with 10 or so episodes to make use of the characters, give them more backstory and really develop the ideas that were touched on.As a movie I enjoyed it and am glad I saw it on the big screen but I'm left feeling like it deserved more."}, {"id": 148, "text": "Because the entertainment was light as a feather and stiff as a board.It feels more like a parody but i don't know if it was intended.I don't even know why there were three other girls, except they needed fillers for every cardinal direction.

It's not a masterpiece. It's not iconic. It's not supposed to be, but it did keep my attention. And, might I add... It's so funny how people get so offended by men exploring their sexuality, or people figuring out their gender identity.

Basically, three teenage girls, Frankie (Gideon Adlon), Tabby (Lovie Simone) and Lourdes (Zoey Luna) try to use magic to freeze time but fail and realise they need a fourth member. Lily Schechner (Cailee Spaeny) moves to the town with her therapist mother, Helen (Michelle Monaghan), to live with Helen's boyfriend Adam Harrison (David Duchovny) and his three sons, Jacob (Charles Vandervaart), Isaiah (Donald MacLean Jr.), and Abe (Julian Grey). Lily is befriended by the three girls when she has her period during class and is mocked by her other classmates. Then they are amazed to see Lily telekinetically push classmate Timmy (Nicholas Galitzine), who was teasing her, into the lockers. The girls communicate with Lily using only her mind, the girls confirm she is a witch and ask her to be their fourth member to form a coven. She agrees to join them, and they chant together to cast their first spell, and they succeed in freezing time. Seeking revenge on Timmy for being nasty, they cast a spell on him. The next day, Timmy behaves sensitively, confirming the spell is successful. They continue to experiment with their powers, including levitation. When Adam discovers about the incident in school, he scolds Lily, but Helen defends her. Lily goes outside after hearing Adam and Helen arguing, Abe is there to talk to her about his father being authoritative. Timmy hosts a party, inviting Lily and the others, he apologises to Lily and becomes friends with the coven. The five of them spend time at Lily's house, they all make confessions about their pasts, including Timmy who is tearful confessing that he had sex with Isaiah, and that he is bisexual. Later, Lily places a love spell on Timmy, and they share a kiss. The next morning, during class, the teacher tells everyone that Timmy has allegedly committed suicide. Lily opens up to her friends about the love spell and kiss with Timmy. Believing that Lily caused Timmy's death, the girls cut ties with each other and bind themselves from magic. Following Timmy's death, Adam displays aggressive tendencies, and Lily becomes concerned he is dangerous. After failing to convince her mother that they must leave, she searches Adam's office for something incriminating, only to find her down adoption paper. Helen is forced to confess that Lily is adopted and is the child of one of her patients. After Timmy's funeral, Helen tells Lily she agrees to move out. She also confesses that she knew Lily may develop powers and asks Lily to give her powers to her. Lily is suspicious that her mother would never say that to her, and Helen shapeshifts, revealed to be Adam in disguise, he is part of a pagan cult and is after her powers. After being knocked unconscious, Lily wakes up in a forest at night with Adam, who confesses that he murdered Timmy, and threatens to kill her next. The spirit of Timmy communicates with the girls through a Ouija board and tells them about his murder and Lily being in danger. They arrive in the forest and freeze time to save Lily, but Adam subdues them quickly. The girls then work together and use their elemental powers to defeat Adam, burning him to death. Lily and the girls continue their friendship, and Helen takes Lily to an asylum to meet her biological mother, revealed to be Nancy Downs (Fairuza Balk). Also starring Hannah Gordon as Ashley, and Chris Tomassetti as Jeremy. The four young leads are all fairly good as the coven members, while Duchovny is the slightly too pantomime villain, the spell casting and dark moments are mixed but get your attention, it is not as slick, stylish or glossy like the original, it could have been better, a below average teen supernatural horror.

The original movie is one of my favorites and I was looking forward to this sequel, especially when I found out that Fairuza Balk would be returning for it. Figured that was a sign of something good, but that was a mistake. This movie didn't make any sense and the acting was ridiculous. None of the three witch friends made a lasting impression, aside from their overreaction to the main girl kissing that boy. Their upset over that was absurd and then the binding spell wasn't even the same one used in the original movie. Pathetic. The villain was predictable, I guessed it when we first met him, and he was just ridiculous too. It makes sense that this film would be silly because it's only rated PG-13 whereas the original was rated R, but I truly can't understand what even inspired anyone to make this sequel at all. The plot was nowhere to be found. In truth the only redeeming quality was the beginning where the main girl and her mom were singing along to Alanis Morissette and when the mom messed up the lyrics they had a nice laugh. Sweet moment and my only positive takeaway. When we FINALLY see Fairuza she got to say ONE LINE! This is one of the craziest witches ever and she's all chill with her one line as if her ending in the original never happened. And given her end in the original film where she was strapped to a bed in an asylum, I'm very curious how she is involved in this movie the way she is. I mean HOW??! She's still locked up and yet they just let this girl walk right into her room?! Alone?! Makes zero sense. Clearly they hoped to make a third film with the abrupt ending here, but that will never happen. It was absolutely terrible. So much so that Amazon actually refunded our $20 rental of it. At least there was that silver lining. Can't yet the 1.5 hours back unfortunately. If you're a fan of the first movie, rewatch that instead and leave this one resting in peace."}, {"id": 188, "text": "Even though this version was a mediocre version of the OG.

Way harsh in my opinion. Possibly because die hard original Craft fans just want to be shady. I am a die hard Craft fan and this new Craft movie doesn't take away from the old. Aside from the ending, it has no reference to the orignal movie. Is this a horror movie? No, not by any means. It isn't edgy or dark like the original. Its a teen version of a witchy movie. I think if it was called something different, the reception would have been much better. Its a teen flick, not an adult flick. Adults needs character building and depth and this doesn't offer it. Watch it for what it is. A teen flick with supernatural elements which loosely link back to an older movie."}, {"id": 190, "text": "The Craft: Legacy is a weak sequel with some funny scenes, the first film is a classic but this sequel is just ok.

It has good ideas but wasted potential. A few times it felt lazy but it kept me invested enough to sit through the 1 hour and 35 minutes. A few characteristics I love about this film is the low-budget feel almost every blumhouse film has but sometimes it can feel like a syfy original (aka, the final act). This film could've been easily better if they knew exactly what they're going for, instead, it feels like ideas just scattered around an hour and 30 minutes.

The magic is Contemporary to the times, the Visual Effects were Pretty Ok, And while this movie had a Errie, Alien, Moroccan Like Soundtrack, i gotta be honest when i say im happy they did it exactly like this! True magic is not biased by opinion of what it should or shouldn't be. And the only witches and warlocks that get upset at the glitter scenes clearly havent stepped into their true power and have self doubt at whats possible! Never ever put on constraint on what YOU can accomplish! This movie does a Prime example at teaching the Ego not to Label or judge magic and say what is possible vs what isnt, but instead takes a delightful, childlike approach by showing magic in many flavours and colours!

Ah, here is someone who thinks that gay people existing is too in his face.Then I watched the movie. I think something to take into consideration in my review is that I am a lesbian who will grab every bit of diversity I can get. I love it.My mind cannot comprehend how terrible this movie was. I love it like nothing else in the world. It's a perfect microcosm of look at me! Praise me! I'm Woke! culture. Let me explain the movie.There are three girls who are attempting to form a witches coven. One of them is black. One of them is implied to be trans. Because for Inclusion Purposes, you need Diversity. They finally find their fourth witch, after Misogyny (TM) forces her to divulge her Cool Necklace (TM) that is a magic witch symbol. One of their firsts acts as a coven is to make the school bully (who I literally don't remember the name of because his character, at this point in the movie, is literally just DudeMan Heterosexual Sports Schoolbully(tm)) a better version of himself.DudeMan Heterosexual Sports Schoolbully goes on a CHARACTER 360. IT IS INCREDIBLE. He goes from, yknow, dudebro schoolbullying to talking about cisgender privilege, heteronormativity, toxic masculinity, etc etc. The coven goes to a Teen Party where there are red solo cups (so you know that they're drinking), dudeman sportsbully apologizes sincerely to the MC for being misogynistic. He then says that he will not participate in teen drinking, and that he has a stash of sparkling water in the basement and a playlist full of Woke(tm) musicians like Princess Nokia. Dudeman Sportsbully later comes out to the witches coven as bisexual and they have a whole moment about how it's really hard to be bisexual if you're a man (It is! But the writing of this scene is. It's something). Also he dies at some point.The rest of the movie is pretty much about how David Duchovony runs a cult and wants to take the MC's magic special powers, because she's not using them correctly, and magic special powers need to have control and not be ruled by emotion. This is totally not a commentary on how men view emotion as weak, it is not at all a commentary on that.So it ends in a POWER RANGERS SHOWDOWN where the mc's Girl Group comes to her rescue, because Female Friendship. They defeat the Bad White Heterosexual Privilege man with the powers of female friendship and connection to the earth.This movie is the funniest thing i've seen in my life. If you were to watch it as a horror movie, yeah, it sucks. It absolutely blows. There's MAYBE one scene that's a little scary.It's like the writers took a group of Woke 14-25 year olds, asked them exactly what they wanted in a movie an a character, and did exactly that. It's pandering to the maximum. I swear to god, someone is going to do a thesis on this movie in 10 years about how it perfectly exemplifies the Wokeness culture of 2020.

When I heard Fairuza Balk was making an appearance in it, I became eager to see it. When I then saw that her screen time was cut to less than a minute, I was ultimately disappointed. Putting her very brief appearance aside, 'The Craft: Legacy' seems more like a toned-down reboot than an actual sequel to the stunning original film. 'The Craft' - original - was exciting, dark, creepy, had a killer soundtrack, and a solid plot. It was not short on the scares. 'The Craft: Legacy' has a killer soundtrack, a bland and disappointing plot, too many 'look, we're having so much fun and isn't it pretty' bright parts, and zero scary moments or true homage to forms of witchcraft that could even be relatively possible. Of the cast, transgender actress Zoey Luna gave the only real stand-out performance, and there was a decent attempt by Lovie Simone, given the unimpressive dialogue she was tasked to work with. Cailee Spaeny's 'Lily' seems too much like a Robin Tunney wannabe but without the edge and bravery. Of the cast's four main witches, Lily might have the strongest powers, but she's the weakest in all other aspects. David Duchovny appears as the wicked stepfather-to-be, and seems to run some kind of macho, male-empowerment cult that we learn far too little about to care. Michelle Monaghan does a decent job as Helen, Lily's 'mother,' given that her character is also rather weak and very undefined. Aside from Fairuza's split-second appearance, the film manages to pay homage to a few traits of the first movie - the calling of the elements and directions, the appearance of snakes (although briefly and not fully utilized), and the fact that the girls pair up while in school. What the film truly lacked, aside from it's way too politically correct script, was scares. I found it to be Blumhouse's most disappointing film in recent years. For a company that set a new foundation for horror in their earlier years, they fell way short with 'The Craft: Legacy.' They had an opportunity to make this film something truly great for this new generation, and they failed. Kudos to Nicholas Galitzine, who plays Timmy, for somehow managing to pull off a somewhat emotionally split and unbalanced role with a script that would have had me gouging my eyes out and praying to be recast, had I been him. Two rather fine actors Charles Vandervaart and Donald MacLean Jr. are so incredibly underused in this film that it makes their characters barely worth mentioning. If Blumhouse were to decide to make another movie in this franchise, they need to sit down, review the first one again, see where they went wrong, and give us something new and different. Otherwise, they needn't bother. If you haven't yet seen 'The Craft: Legacy,' it is available for $20 on pay-per-view and streaming services. Save your money. Wait until it's free one day.

The diversity and and whole message of the movie becomes clear when we find that Lily's soon-to-be step-dad is a professional misogynist.The entrance of a male practitioner, a Warlock that steals witches powers, sealed the deal with David Duchovny playing the role of the dark side of the Craft, which resides in the Witch's heart and intentions, not the magic.

For example there is this random scene where someone sleep walks into the main girls room, it is played as a jump scare. And then we never hear of it again. It was pointless and an absolute waste of time. This is just one thing, there are many other things like this. This is a stab in the dark but when watching I realised a few scenes from the trailer were absent from the movie and I feel like this is maybe why so many sub plots are just dead in the water because they are all on the cutting room floor.I found that the ending seemed tacked on too and was just super unnecessary and then even more so the scenes that take place after the climax of the movie. They once again just felt like oh here is an idea...actually never mind.I think this movie would have been so much better if they just focused on the group and didn't bog it down with everything else. I also didn't like that they were just like had powers from the start there was no build up like in the original and no scenes where they had to practice them.I really liked that it was a pretty inclusive movie and had a inclusive feeling running though the middle of it.One small nit pick as well is that I really didn't like the soundtrack and score.

And sure enough, the movie was a weak imitation of the original 1996 The Craft movie.Writer and director Zoe Lister-Jones failed utterly to bring something worthwhile to the screen, as The Craft: Legacy just felt like a watered down more family-friendly version of the 1996 movie. And that was just an abysmal turn for the movie to take. Especially since the 1996 movie was pretty good and impacting back in the day.I am sure that The Craft: Legacy was meant to be a continuation of the 1996 movie, but it just failed at being an original movie in its own right, and it had none of the charm, appeal or impact that the 1996 movie had.Sure, if you haven't seen the 1996 The Craft then I suppose The Craft: Legacy is a good enough movie. But for us that did watch it, then The Craft: Legacy is lacking the magic, the foreboding darkness that threatened behind the alluring call of using witch magic. And more importantly, it was lacking memorable characters.The character gallery in The Craft: Legacy felt like they were using cardboard stand-in, most of them fully devoid of backstory and personalities. Even David Duchovny's character felt like a puppet just brought in for the heck of it.Not even having the likes of David Duchovny and Michelle Monaghan in the movie could do much to lift up what was essentially a hollow and shallow movie experience.The most interesting part about The Craft: Legacy was the person that showed up in the end of the movie, and get this, was present for a whole staggering 3 second or so! Now, I am not going to say whom it is, but yeah, you guessed it already, because it was that predictable.My rating of The Craft: Legacy lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars.

When a male (Timmy) is the most interesting and fleshed out character in a Craft sequel, you've done something horribly wrong.You'll see quite a few moments in the trailer that never showed up in the actual film, which leads me to think that the heavy hand of an editor was involved in this one.

All it does it sets it up they she may just be an over emotional teenager who cries at anything. I also don't understand what was the point of the youngest son... ok he was nice to Lily but those scenes / conversations could have been with ANYONE !! In the original you see the girls daily struggles, from bullying, being outcast, rumours, lack of self confidence etc.... this made you feel &amp; root for them. But in this take theres nothing like this, no struggles at all to be on their side.... the closest is when Tabby mentions she's wanting to protect her brother. and no one sits with them at lunch, even transgender character Lourdes was under-utilised for portraying struggles, the only thing mention by her is she doesn't get a period.... are you kidding me !!! What a waste for not giving her more of a platform........You never see any real struggles, its just portrayed they're just wanting 'super powers'. The only good thing to come out of this is it gave the young cast a job, but clearly the older cast were hard up for a pay cheque to agree to star in dribble. This is just a bunch of embarrassing fluff. There are hints of misogyny throughout.... I kept waiting for this to build to something bigger.... granted no amount of misogyny is acceptable but it seemed like this would become a bigger thing (again another thing lacking).

They only intimidating thing was their eyes went black.....and even that was just eye roll worthy....Not sure whether thats due to lack of a strong story or whether has been watered downed by the studio to make it appeal to a wider audience, but has caused major harm. If your a fan of the original AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!! If you must see, wait till its available for free then cleanse your palette with the original. This is only going to appeal to a younger audience who haven't seen the awesome original. I was skeptical when the rumours of a remake started, that was then heightened when the trailer dropped.... The story was all over the place &amp; just seemed like a lot of fluff that hadn't been fleshed out enough to make a good story with a good confrontation. Just a bunch of glitter dusted misogyny (that wasn't developed enough to be the big bad). Even when the girls decided to take a break made no sense... Im still shaking my head trying to make sense of what I just watched &amp; why the hell there was so much glitter eyeshadow....... Very poor attempt at a reboot, more time should have been given to get it right."}, {"id": 232, "text": "This movie was not as dark and twisted as the original and honestly was lacking in a plot and overall experience that I as a long time fan of the craft was expecting . It definitely was rushed and dident have the magic and spells that I'm sure most people were expecting . The ending was horrible and did not satisfy my dark obsession at all. I feel they had plenty of time to do something better as the original came out in the 2000's. This movie also ended abruptly and left me unfulfilled . The 3 witches could have been decendents of the original in some way and it should have continued off the original . Just poorly done and I was really looking forward to this . Just a horrible movie with a lack of Imagination , it dident draw me in like the original and left me asking myself why did I waste my time or get so excited on something that failed so utterly miserable . Especially since blumhouse was a contributor to the film I expected better . It does not deserve 5 stars somewhere in the negative stars I would say. I know I'm not the only one who waited for this only to be letdown by it's non exsistant concept and overall design . - stars don't ruin anymore films like you did this one .. it just hurts too bad"}, {"id": 233, "text": "* There is no end credit scene *The director Zoe Lister-Jones and crew brought a bland-messy film. The first film The Craft (1996) had its flaws but it was still a good film and this sequel could never be on the same level. I wasn't excited about this movie because the trailer didn't catch my interest but I was hoping to be at least a good watch and it wasn't, not even a little bit. There was no character development and the plot was all over the place, everything was happening very superficially. The magic looked so cheesy like watching a Disney movie about witches and there isn't anything wrong with that but this type of movie wasn't supposed to go in that direction. I did like the turn of events of the witches using magic for fun and for good, it was a different take on it from the previous one.The antagonist could have been better handled, the character might have probably saved the movie but since there was no character development it all kept falling flat, such a shame it was a great missed opportunity. If only they showed more background on the antagonist this story could have a sense of horror or a more serious tone, but if they thought of not doing it just to leave the character as a surprise well they were wrong because it was obvious from the very beginning. The ending twist was predictable from the moment they revealed the secret that was kept from her and it was so clear who it was going to be. This movie is rated PG-13 but I felt like it was rated PG.The composer Heather Christian brought beautiful music and it sets a magical atmosphere. Her music was great, but sometimes it felt too much or didn't quite sync and I blame the film. This music could have been better enjoyed with a more solid script.There was nothing wrong with the cast but it was hard to appreciate their performance when there was no build up in the characters and nothing to grasp with but there was one exception. I did like the performance of the mother of the lead witch, Michelle Monaghan. I like the way she bonded with her daughter though it didn't last long because it was another thing that disappeared while the story was rushed to the end."}, {"id": 234, "text": "I'm not against remakes when done well (except they never are). At some stage this ugly duckling was glamoured from a remake to a sequel. TRUE fans of the brilliant original Craft have begged for a sequel for many years.Unfortunately this was NOT it. This is nothing but an embarrasing mixture of toxic wokeness by an apparent man-hating writer/director who couldn't produce a realistic film if her life depended on it, which completely bismirches the actual legacy of the original.Zoe Lister-Jones clearly didn't learn her lesson from Katie Dippold completely pooing on the legacy of Ghostbusters, which led to the entire planet pooing on her Ghostbusters. Then again, looking at her writing credits...yikes. Enough said.And I gotta laugh at the review of kelly-j-shannon who says this embarrassment is an accurate portrayal of female friendship.

This sequel is directed, written and produced by Band Aid director Zoe Lister-Jones. She is also more known in the film world as an actress.In the movie, Lily (Cailee Spaeny) and her mother are just new to town, because Lily's mother has met a new man she probably wants to marry. During her first day of school at her new school, Lily comes across as a bit embarrassed and quickly falls victim to the bullies. When Lily manages to befriend three girls who are also seen as the misfits, Lily learns that she has magical powers just like the other three girls. With these powers, they decide to take revenge on the bullies and try to make their school lives a bit easier, but losing control of their magic creates dangers for their and innocent students.With this film, the film studio and crew first tried to make a remake, but later decided to make a sequel of the first film. The decision to make a sequel to the first film, however, is hardly visible until the end of this film. Many things come across as a modern copy of situations that also occurred in the first film. By putting the events of the film in a modern guise, this film comes across as a film from MTV. By putting the situations and problems of the film's characters in a modern light, this can appeal to modern teens more and they can enjoy this film a little more. For the older generation it can also be fun to watch this film with young people, but then the film will appear somewhat copied if you are familiar with the original film.Most special effects look a bit simple, but for the most part they come across as fitting and believable.The acting is done well and appropriately by the cast members in the film. Each character brings up a problem, which teens can also face these days. Most older cast members are less prominent. David Duchovny usually comes out a bit nicer in his other roles, but in this film his character is portrayed in a somewhat annoying way."}, {"id": 237, "text": "I really liked The Craft, with its engrossing blend of dark fantasy and strikingly frank coming-of-age drama. Its sequel retains that dark style, boldly going for a borderline R-rated story with some very adult ideas.However, while its predecessor told a challenging story that ultimately showed itself as a moral fable, The Craft: Legacy is a more morally dubious film, gratuitously overloading itself with different social issues of the day and ticking them off one by one as it wrestles with some very problematic themes.First off, though, I really want to praise the way that The Craft: Legacy lives up to the dark reputation of the first film. Though perhaps not as emotionally overwhelming as its predecessor, this sequel really sticks to its guns with a dark and frank story that's more about the characters than pure young adult fantasy.There's a part of me that misses some of the more action-packed fantasy sequences from the previous film, but it's really commendable the way that this sequel commits to a bolder, darker style in a world where it could have been so easy to make a lazy rehash of the Twilight movies.Couple that with strong performances from the film's young lead quartet, all of whom are mature and very assured on screen throughout, and you have a film that's a lot more than just a throwaway bit of fantasy fare.However, I found the way that The Craft: Legacy uses its darker, thematically upfront style really problematic. The Craft told a heavy-going story about bullying and coming-of-age, and although arguably mean-spirited at times, it eventually righted itself with a strong moral message in the end.This film, meanwhile, looks at a variety of wider social issues which are all relevant in the modern world, yet it fails to consider them in enough detail, while also failing to address the morally questionable actions of its main characters.So there are two issues here. First is the way in which The Craft: Legacy seems to tick off mentioning various social issues almost as if it's a 'woke' scorecard, without ever giving them the proper time and attention that they're due. There are throwaway comments about trans issues, racial discrimination, female adolescence, toxic masculinity and more, but the movie does little to really address those issues beyond just including them in the story.All of those themes are important and worthy of discussion, but this film is painfully superficial in dealing with them.Secondly, the film's overarching theme, that of taking on the patriarchy, is somehow used in a really morally questionable way. The film's feminist passions are evident, and it's great to see the way that it lends attention to the feelings of a group of young women, but it spends too much time on the attack, with a bizarre portrayal of men that comes off as incredibly mean-spirited.In this movie, the male characters are either evil masterminds looking to dominate women, or braindead puppets controlled by the whims of women. If the film had addressed either of those portrayals by looking in on itself towards the end, then they wouldn't be such a problem, but it's the way it almost celebrates this erroneous portrayal of men that really doesn't sit right with me.For a film that's clearly there to inspire young women and to tackle important social issues, I was really surprised by just how aggressive and superficial The Craft: Legacy was - a far cry from the engrossing character drama of its predecessor.Overall then, I was disappointed by The Craft: Legacy. Though admirable for its retention of the bold and dark style that made its predecessor so striking, the film struggles in its use of social themes, gratuitously ticking off various issues with little regard for reality, all the while telling a story about taking on the patriarchy in really bizarre fashion."}, {"id": 238, "text": "As a fan of 'The Craft' (1996) I wanted to have a movie experience at least similar to the one I had in the original. The original wasn't a perfect movie. You should listen to Rachel True who played the character of 'Rochelle' define her time making the film. But it was incredibly fun to watch and entertaining ride for horror fans. I still remember the beach scene and how it struck me like WOW Nancy is going Super-Saiyan. None of this exists in 'The Craft: Legacy' and as I titled this review; I don't know where to begin with the problems.Maybe I should start with the character structure; there is none. I finished watching it 20 minutes ago and I can't even remember the names of the three girls who befriended Lily, because there was zero development. One of them is African-American. One of them is a transgender girl. One was Jewish and wore a cheetah print coat. I remember Gideon Adlon because her mother did the voice of 'Bobby Hill' on 'King of the Hill'. The next is the casting of Michelle Monaghan as Lily's mother. Monaghan is an amazing actress, yet she wasn't utilized her for the majority of the movie. She was simply the mom. There was also David Duchovny playing the (soon to be) step-father with 3 boys of his own. His character has 3 sons that (other than Isaiah) I'm completely lost on their names. They basically just exist as a representation of male masculinity.The plot. Is there a plot? Girl shows up, gets laughed at on her first day of school, and joins the misfits.

Its awful pacing is made even worse by the fact that it spends way too much screentime setting up storylines for a sequel that will probably never happen. Quite a shame since most of the cast was very likeable (Mr. Duchovny, though... What the heck was he doing?? Cause whatever it was clearly wasn't acting.)I see some reviewers chalk its flaws up to it being aimed at teens but I don't really see it as a valid justification since the much darker original was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I had pretty high hopes for this one taking advantage of the times and the Blumhouse association to go even darker, but it went the opposite way instead.I could go on for hours about all of this movie's flaws, but it really isn't worth my time, and it probably isn't worth your time either.

It's an ok coming of age story but it's just 120% too much at times. Everything lines up perfectly so that the characters can have sassy lines and the story progresses at the right pace. I love what they're going for but then once you get a sense of the script then you can predict the character choices all throughout the film. Also... let's talk about how it's all about being woke and consent (which is great) but the Lily clearly puts a LOVE SPELL on a boy. Which, I don't know about you but looks like something akin to drugging someone. Lily takes advantage of that boy, he is not making his own choices and that is sexual assault. It's not okay because he's a boy and maybe he liked her before and whatever excuse you have... he didn't kiss her until she put a spell on him. A rough comparison but Lily is basically the bad guy in Jessica Jones. Just boil it down to: human manipulates/drugs other human so they can use them as a sexual puppet. One line by one of the characters about it not being consensual (after earlier in the movie they talk about consent in the school like the screenwriter wants to make it clear that it's not being taken seriously in society) does not equal this movie taking it seriously.Cliche, totally hypocritical, moments that would be individually cool do not make up for the other 99.9%.Just.... don't even try it"}, {"id": 241, "text": "2 out of 5 stars.The Craft Legacy is a tedious supernatural horror film that may be a disappointing reboot.

Sometimes, the filmmakers have an important story to tell and a way to expand upon the original, bringing it into a new generation and continuing the story in a smart, thoughtful way.

She's immediately branded on outcast by everyone in her class except for three girls who practice witchcraft. Before long, she's joined their coven because she's a natural and they're casting spells on their fellow classmates to make them better people.For something branded as a horror film, there's not really any horror at all.

They become close, trying out spells, and using their witchcraft to serve people just desserts, but will their powers soon take over their lives?Any problems the film has are no fault of the 4 lead actresses who create a believable sense of community and sisterhood throughout and it's nice to see a film where women aren't at each other's throats and support one another. I only wish some of them had been better developed, because it seems to me like the filmmakers were more interested in them than the horror portions which come in far too infrequently and don't pack any kind of punch whatsoever. It makes one wonder what would happen if they threw out the horror elements altogether and made it a story of female friendship instead.About midway through, it becomes clear that The Craft: Legacy has done a poor job of raising the stakes for these characters and we stop caring what the outcome will be which is what really drives the stake through the film's heart."}, {"id": 245, "text": "Lily moves into the new home of her mother's boyfriend and his sons and has to switch schools.

The main foursome of girls are a likable group and I hope they all go on to have wonderful careers, because even when there's not much to work with on the page, they manage to overcome it due to charisma alone.Unfortunately, the script doesn't allow for much conflict and it hardly ever feels like a horror movie and more just a series of scenes strung along with very little supporting them.

After all these years, we finally get a sequel with this film.I've seen a lot of really negative, harsh reviews but I don't think it deserves all the hate. For starters it would've benefited greatly by being titled The Craft: Leagacy pt.1. The ending is left wide open for another film and it just felt incomplete.Here's a few of it's problems. The witches are lacking detail. We don't know much about their backgrounds and they are not the dark witches that were portrayed in the original. These girls are white witches. This fact alone takes away from what was expected. We wanted to see those badass girls again but they just don't make an appearance.The good things are it setting up another film and offering some reassurances in it's final moments. All that was missing has an opportunity to redeem itself with an awesome third film. If it can pull it off with a great script, this will not seem like a flop.As a stand alone movie, it pales in comparison with the original. I still found it to be fairly enjoyable and I'm actually more excited at the idea of a third considering how it has been setup.Most die hard fans are going to be disappointed with the lack of horror but I'm gonna hold out hope for the third and suggest keeping that possibility in mind should you decide to watch it."}, {"id": 248, "text": "I adore the original The Craft.

So, the corniness and over the top politically correctness hurts the seriousness of the plot and steals whatever integrity the movie could have had. Be aware, this is NOT a remake. This is a continuation, as the title suggests, it is a legacy of sorts. What I loved about the first one, The Craft, apart from the awesome 90s nostalgia, is that the characters were believable. The tone is solemn. The characters here, aside from the principal actress which is very good, they all act like cartoons. This is not a horrific 4.0 rating movie but it is not great.

As a Witch myself, I am saddened to see certain things in the film that do not truly happen however very happy to see that the girls bound themselves when they realised that they were using manipulative magic. That is a very big no no among Witches. True witches know that using manipulative magic is against the rules I know it was nice to see how the film really showed that side of witchcraft.I'm going to give this film a second watch and perhaps I will see something new that I didn't see the first time around at least I hope that how this plays out.

Drawing a comparison is somewhat inevitable, given that The Craft (1996) is widely regarded as a cult flick, but, as a standalone movie, Legacy works in its own way and, while I can understand why so many people were dissatisfied with it, I would say that it doesn't deserve all these 1/10 scores that it got on IMDb or other websites. This sequel is mostly aimed at a younger audience with a more social justice warrior mindset, for the lack of a more fitting description. While I pretty much tend to roll my eyes at any kind of preachiness, I didn't find it impossible to sit through this flick, like I experienced with other woke movies.While in the original film we get a group of girls who were mostly miserable and dark, because of their inner conflicts and the fact that they were mostly ostracized by their peers, Legacy gives us four girls who are pretty much sparkly and happy. Actually, I would say that, at some point, I found them annoyingly loud and enthusiastic, especially about their magic, which they mostly use to play silly tricks and whatnot. While the 1996 film dwells into the lives of each of the four girls, allowing us to know them and empathize with them, Legacy mostly focuses on Lily, the main character. As a matter of fact, the other girls' lives are never even explored, which is something that bothered me a lot, because it felt alienating and rushed. Who are the three others? Lourdes, a transgender latina; Tabby, who we never really get to know and Frankie, a ditzy and likeable girl who, at some point, receives a snarky comment from a popular girl, who makes fun of her for being allegedly unattractive. I think one of the biggest problems with Legacy is, precisely, that we don't really get to know who these girls are, while the original was a character-driven type of film. Seriously, these four girls are mostly likeable, they don't harm anyone and they just enjoy their powers, but we don't really get to know them and many of their personality treats seem to have a cookie cutter approach. These four girls aren't particularly memorable. So, they're woke social justice warriors... big deal. Don't we get enough of these types of characters these days? Apparently, not. These girls just don't stand out in any way.In The Craft: Legacy the main antagonist is none other than... patriarchy itself (surprise!). David Duchovny basically plays a lazily written character that could be described as the very, very bad man that thinks women are weak and they need to submit to the greatness of the male. Seriously, how stereotypical and predictable is that? So, while in the original film, the girls have a falling out and are pit against each other, in this sequel, they also have a falling out, but eventually team up to fight a greater evil: men. But, to be fair, not all men in this movie are absolute trash... only 93.5% of them are. In spite of this, The Craft: Legacy is not really an anti-men statement, but more like a half-assed essay on the negative effects of male chauvinism. In doing so, the movie offers a bunch of contrived situations and artificial characters, like the school bully turned into a social justice warrior, after the girls put a spell on him. Though, clearly, they are the good ones, the girls are not portrayed as absolute angels who can do no wrong, either. As a matter of fact, at some point, they acknowledge that they have abused their powers and force themselves to quit magic altogether, which was refreshing.The Craft: Legacy is definitely not a masterpiece and it will never gain cult status, like the original film, but it's not the unwatchable mess that people make it out to be. It should be mentioned that, while the 1996 flick had a few horror moments, Legacy doesn't even bother going there, and it ends up being more, like, a teen drama with a few sparkly stars here and there and a shape-shifting antagonist."}, {"id": 251, "text": "I think the main culprit of the bad reviews is that A, it's a remake of the 1996 movie so people have high expectations and B, people thought this would be some kind of supernatural horror-movie, which it isn't.

However, I think this movie isn't the best, but it doesn't deserve such a low rating either.I really liked the first half of this movie. It seemed like a stereotypical American high school movie, but in a good way. It was great to see the girls stand up for each other and it was downright hilarious to see their 'bully' turn into such a sensitive, respectful guy. There were a lot of heartfelt scenes that I enjoyed watching and I also liked the pop culture references. Overall, solid eight.Now, the second half of the movie... I won't give out too many spoilers, but this is the part where the magic and horror is supposed to happen. It was full of plot-holes and had a very confusing story. It was like they forgot they weren't making a high-school movie and this was some kind of last-minute idea. Also, I'm not an expert in this at all, but the special effects just looked bad and unrealistic.The movie started out with a lot of potential, but I can't rate it anywhere above a six.

The only new film that fit in time wise was The Craft. Legacy.

Her disastrous first day at the new school sees her become friends with Lourdes (Zoey Luna), Frankie (Gideon Adlon) and Tabby (Lovie Simone), three women and aspirating witches, whose coven has yet to produce any results. Their power is unlocked when Lily becomes their fourth and they soon use their powers for revenge against bullies at the school.I haven't looked at any of the other reviews here yet, but I can only imagine that they're a cesspit of the Hollywood with their Pro-trans, anti-men agenda type comments. If those ideas are the type of thing you don't like then yes, the film has a trans character and the villain of the story is essentially an embodiment of toxic masculinity. Those things don't really register with me, but there are other flaws that the film has, that I am going to talk about.Mostly, I feel like the principle problem is that the film rushes its story. It could have done with at least one more story point about the girls bonding by using their newfound powers to help themselves, before Lily's misuse of the power leads to them splitting up. Their friendship, fragmentation and reunification would have felt more tangible - had we actually seen them act as friends a little more and not just in a single montage scene. Indeed, the other three girls, particularly Zoey Luna's Lourdes are all sidelined somewhat, in a story that is mostly about Lily. The ending is similarly rushed and lacking in any twist or wit, beyond the one that you'll see coming a mile off.Still, in terms of entertainment it's not as badly made, or performed as that top-level score might have you believing. It just feels more like an elaborate pilot, rather than a full feature and I doubt I'll remember much about when I'm eventually allowed back into a cinema."}, {"id": 253, "text": "Its not well enough developed the way its plotted into a story of young witches doing witchcraft. the caracter building is like almost zero, how and when each of those young teenage women developed these abilities are never told, its just there as if it was told in another film somewhere and sometime. so to all of us who hasent seen the film this is sequilized from, find it. its a barren plotlife.but its a nice film by all means, great filmography,lots of colour and sound, a big portion of teenagegirl bedroom magic, pentagrams and ouijaboards that will tempt your darling buds of may(-hem) into the dark stuff either they live in witchita or in haggerty. there are cool tricks, lovely young female actresses, and a sort of shapeshifting david duchovny who is spelled to be expelled.one thing is for sure, is that it is a horror/mystery/drama, mashed togeter into a film that almost magically induced races of a full speed and the finito is there all of a sudden, thats usually a good sign thinks the grumpy old man that might feel bewitched at the moment. so dont set your expectations too high, then you will like it.recommended"}, {"id": 254, "text": "I love the original Craft - so to see a sequel to the cult classic of my 90s gives me a sense of why? Why wasn't this done before?...however, 24 years later we finally arrive at the Craft II Legacy - which certainly has a legacy to live up to. The film directed by Zoe Lister Jones, isn't as a compelling or Dark as its predecessor, (note for 3rd film) however what it does deserves credit for is its attempt (in this modern world) to curate a worthy sequel instead of the annoy trend to remake/reboot everything. I wont say to much, but this film is vastly connected to the first with its jaw dropping cameo and finale scene. The only let down to this movie is the 3rd act where David Duchovny gets quickly - brought down by this new mesmerizing coven of witches, however, no attempt is shown as to how the main character saved her beloved adoptive mother - nor what happened to her step brothers!!!!.... aside from the small bug bares - this film acts as the perfect stop gap - to a more compelling third film!!! please blumhouse!!!! which will hopefully bring back the original OG cast (cough Rachel True, Neve Campbell, Robin Tunney &amp; Fairuza Balk)----as well as this new cast of delicious witches.... if you like the first, you will like this...."}, {"id": 255, "text": "So I am going to go out on a limb and say that clearly a lot of the negative reviews are I am sure from people who didn't like the movie but were definitely not the target audience.I will do my best to avoid any spoilers.Let me preface this review with the statement that I did enjoy the film and like it a great deal. Kudos to all those that were involved in the project on doing your best to capture the magick that made the first film great. :)The movie was well made, well acted, and captured the spirit of the original while making it fresh with a modern perspective. Also it was nice to see Wiccans shown in a more realistic light as in that it's about positivity and not about Satan or hurting people. Witchcraft has nothing to do with the devil people, that is Christianity! There is no devil in our religion. The one thing I do not like is that it felt heavy handed with women good, men bad. A film representing Paganism of all things should be about balance and equality so the sexism is pretty misguided. I mean where in the $@&amp;* was the male witch representation in this film? For trying to be modern and diverse they should have had a male witch somewhere in the film or at least referenced. I am sorry but being male and Pagan who grew up in the 90's when the original came out I understood that male witches were too tough a concept for people to grasp back then but it's 2020 so don't make Paganism into some sexist gender war. The movie felt like it's messaging was that if you were male you had to be LGBTQ to not be evil and that kind of sucks. It's bad enough that Witchcraft gets demonized and mocked by those who don't understand it but to have The Craft sequel in 2020 still give us no love well that is just a damn shame. Now that my rant is over, once again you guys did a great job and I look forward to more films from the crew involved. The actors in the film did an awesome job and I hope they all have bright futures ahead of them!Blessed Be!"}, {"id": 256, "text": "When I found out that there was a sequel to The Craft i was really excited and couldn't wait to watch it. Before I jumped into this film I read the reviews and was amazed by the amount of negative reviews and still watched it. Being a fan of the original The Craft &amp; Charmed I didnt let the reviews stop me from watching.And honestly I truly enjoyed this movie. Reviews stated there wasn't magic involved in which there wasnt that much but to me it was enough. But the underlining to the movie was alittle deeper than magic. It showed the hardships our young women face growing up with life changes, in school, becoming social and finding themselves. For those living with deep secrets that could alter their lives in the future and to have a potential label placed on them.Being a father of a 1 year old little girl and expecting our 2nd daughter it Awoken me to understand what they will face growing up and knowing that they too will have to seek out that power to be strong growing up. The true power to this movie symbolizes sisterhood and not just hocus pocus like the original movie. But its gives us a third eye to what is really going on in modern day living.So I give Blum &amp; Zoe a 10/10 on this film. I hope that my review helps other truly understand what this movie really shows and dont try to compare this to the original."}, {"id": 257, "text": "In a nutshell, this movie comes on like a plate bearing tasty morsels, that are pushed off behind your back. The plate is placed in front of you with the announcement: Come again, there will be more.My response, I'm still hungry. This film leaves you starving. After the initial sights and smells, there is nothing. Not one bite.THE CRAFT: LEGACY spends a lot of time building up interest in characters who ultimately go nowhere. They simply stop. Not once does the plot circle back to sew up holes. It just plods forward.Excellent youth cast. Four young witches I was amped to get to know, but nothing. Three brothers who are very intriguing and whose characters ultimately go nowhere. Then there's Timmy, played by the sublime Nicholas Galatzine, whose character undergoes spectacular development, but whose fate plays out in the wings... off-stage... and it's never even addressed in flashback or strange visions whose mystery is revealed later.THE CRAFT: LEGACY is cursed by lazy plot construction.Then there's David Duchovny, who has become the creep from Central Casting, and this film takes him in expected directions. He is boring in a bland role. The reports of addiction and alcoholism have played out on Duchovny's face, which is heavily creased and puffy, like a Shar Pei dog.I endured the end-credits, thinking there must be more."}], "reviews_amount": 258}
