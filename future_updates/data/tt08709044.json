Definitely worth watching!"}, {"id": 7, "text": "This is a very raw and granular horror indie film. I decided to take a chance and was pleasantly surprised. It has a unique vintage photography that gives it a disturbing visual atmosphere. Great acting and good plot twists keep you invested till the very end."}, {"id": 8, "text": "** very minor spoilers ** First, I had to say this in response to writers of user reviews who obviously didn't get it: The characters change their accents ON PUPOSE! Dummies. (They're pretending to be locals, but they aren't.) It's quite obvious and the reviewers who attributed the accent switching to 'bad acting' are either morons, or just write reviews without actually paying attention to the film.Now that I got that off my chest...This is not what I would call a true horror film, but it doesn't really fit into any other genres. It's weird, unexpected and fun. A real grind-house film vibe. Creepy, suspenseful and humorous but hits a surprising emotional note once or twice. No big scares or crazy gore, but you'll be waiting to see who's next! The acting from the core characters is uniformly good with one or two amateur performances from ancillary characters. (Just what one would expect from low-budget indie films like this.)Cons: Sound quality is sometimes lacking. Hard to make out bits of dialogue without turning on subtitles! The visual production value is adequate but leaves you wanting in the special effects department. A bit more blood would've made some of the violent moments much more effective! A few afore mentioned performances from the guests/victims were a bit lacking but most were quite good. Some of the plot points/characters don't get paid off (like what was the point of the homeless dude?)Pros: The four main characters were really well acted. The story and characters were crazy original and unexpected. The ending pays off the movie as a whole really well! Final verdict; this was a really groovy little flick for fans of truely independent Grindhouse type films. Recommended!"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Very slow pace snd way too long.

Think Venus fly trap. The victims never suspect what horrors await them inside. Get the popcorn and enjoy.\ud83d\ude0a"}, {"id": 16, "text": "Living out in the middle of nowhere, a deranged family use a bed-and-breakfast as a cover to attract unwitting guests to the place so they can experiment on their bodies, but when their activities start to draw unwanted attention from outside sources they try to keep their experiments a secret as they carry them out.This was a pretty solid and somewhat enjoyable if slightly flawed effort. One of its stronger elements is the engaging build-up to this one with the slow-burn dynamic that sets everything in order. With an enjoyable start that gives the group a fine reversal on a home invasion attempt which gives an idea of their ruthlessness and criminal ingenuity to take them on and overcome the unprepared group. Since this follows them for a large portion of the film, their strange inner-dynamics come into play rather nicely as the series of attacks that show them seducing, drugging, killing and then experimenting on the rash of victims that show up to make their special age-reversing serum offers up a great deal of fun. The old-school formula here of following along with the family and getting to know them rather than the series of faceless victims is a nice touch which makes the film feel quite fun with the information we get around here. Likewise, the film scores rather nicely with the series of explosive outbursts that occur in the second half. With the rapid succession of guests that are shown being taken out and killed to be used for their experiments, the grand reveal about the nature and process to be utilized here add a dark nature to everything much like the series of familial relationships that are brought up which gives the process itself a much-needed boost. The back-and-forth nature on how to carry it out with the various acquisitions of new bodies to be used and the debates over the timeliness and necessity of the operation at that point which gives this one a rather nice back-and-forth series of twists that help to build the action up nicely. The low-key finale, which might be somewhat less exciting and frenetic than it should be but still manages to get quite a fun reveal included, also manages to work quite nicely with the inclusion of a solid theme on the importance of family that is slowly weaved throughout the film but becomes quite prominent in how much it plays into the action. Overall, these hold the film up for the most part. There are some issues to be had with this one. One of the biggest flaws is an overlong and drawn-out pace which gives this a far longer running time than necessary with this running afoul of either unnecessary scenes or just going way beyond the point of necessity. Most of the meals they share or the luring in of victims who have arrived tend to be quite obvious in the latter part where it serves the film to include them but yet run on more than they should. It's mostly the interactions with the various guests coming into play around the guests who tend to skirt around the unnecessary scenes with the idea about what they're doing quite easily yet running on too long for its own good. This mostly comes about due to the rather clumsy narrative structure where it falls into a repetitive pattern where someone arrives and they tend to it only to have someone else arrive and the process keeps going so it can feel quite unnecessary to keep hammering that point home as many times as it does which is what makes this feel so long. Otherwise, there's a lot to like here.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence."}, {"id": 17, "text": "It was a good show, and had a interesting plot.

What was the point of the exotic dancing lady, and her beau? They didn't have the internet, but they went to town for supplies (cigarettes, peaches etc...) couldn't Victoria just access the internet in town?Don't get me started on accents. Jeff Hatch was the worst offender. He dropped his accent in at least three scenes, as did Chelsea Jurkiewicz, but the opposite. She used an accent in a few scenes, but dropped it in most of the movie. You have one job. Show up to the days shooting, and stay in character.Otherwise I found it entertaining to a degree. Worth at least one watch."}, {"id": 33, "text": "The Crumbs is a really unique horror/thriller with some really interesting villains and twists that stand out from the typical horror fare. The leads all give good good performances and have good motivations for their actions to make them all interesting. I also like the fact that there are some dramatic elements to it making it not just another horror/thriller but also mixes some of the drama genre in with it. It's well directed and shot with good quality. Looking forward to more projects from this cast and crew. Especially if you're looking for something different from this genre with more character depth, than you'll enjoy The Crumbs."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Some viewers have questioned the family's changing accents from one scene to another, believing it was a continuity error due to the actors making mistakes and coming out of character. If you pay attention, you will realize they only speak in a British accent when speaking privately with one another and in an American accent around their guests and strangers. They tell everyone that they are locals of the area and have lived there their whole lives. Later, it's revealed they are actually much older than anyone could guess, suggesting they are not really from that town. The accent switching is meant to clue the audience in that they are not at all who they claim to be."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Love the story line. Great movie!

Chelsea Jurkiewicz gives a haunting performance as Victoria, the young daughter of the family who has been sheltered from much of the outside world. Also enjoyed the more off-kilter moments, like the bizarre game of charades and an encounter with some pot-smoking teens. There is also a relationship reveal near the end of the film which is surprisingly sweet.

I'm usually straight up blood, guts and body count. However, this was different.Meet The Crumbs and their extended family. Leonard (Anton Clark), Victoria Crumb (Chelsea Jurkiewicz), Dr. Benjamin Crumb (Jeff Hatch) and The Matriarch, Irene Crumb (Maria Olsen).The opening, at first, reminded me of the classic TCM or Devil Times Five. Clearly, I was not prepared for what I was about to watch. This is TCM, meets David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers, meets Dr. Mirakle In Murders In The Rue Morgue.Anton Clark, whom plays Leonard brings the gore, in a chilling yet humorous fashion. I had seen him before in Penchance, and once again he outdoes himself in this performance. He is absolutely on my rising star list.Chelsea Jurkiewicz, who burst onto to the scene with a stellar performance in The Hunter. She truly becomes her character in Crumbs. Her performance as Victoria Crumb leaves the viewer wondering if she really is the innocent, sheltered, pretty, young lady of the family. Is she completely harmless or delightfully sinister? Ms. Jurkiewicz always brings her A game to the plate and the scenes between she and Mr. Clark were like lightning in a bottle.Jeff Hatch, is the most seasoned of the bunch, and his talent shines through. Mr. Hatch has worked on several TV, film and commercial projects in recent years including lead and supporting roles in independent feature films, a made-for-cable sci-fi/horror movie, several short films, and featured roles on the NBC comedy, The Office and the daytime drama, Days of Our Lives. His Dr. Benjamin Crumb obviously did not take the Hippocratic oath, as he and his family run a Air BnB in the remote woods whereby the family performs experiments on unsuspecting guests in an effort to help Victoria who is suffering with a mysterious illness ( last spoiler I promise).Finally, playing the matriarch of this ferocious clan is Maria Olsen as Irene Crumb. I do have to make a disclaimer here, I did work with Ms. Olsen on Krampus: Origins, Fear Inc. and enjoyed her company while she was on set of Lords of Salem (uncredited) and I was doing background research.Ms. Olsen, is a tour de force, as usual. She absolutely is one of our legendary Scream Queens. I am not giving away anything about her role/ character as her performance is something to see first hand. Keep in mind, however, she has also won four awards (including awards for both acting and directing), had two short films appear at the 2009 Cannes Short Film Program, one at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, plus others at Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors and HorrorFest.Overall, The Crumbs(2020) on Amazon Prime, is possibly one of Craig Ahrens' and Director David J.

It is filmed at primarily one location, there is a core group of actors and the idea is not something you would see in main stream media. This is why I loved it so much and why others may have an issue with trying to get behind it.Here is a quick breakdown.1) The story is absolutely fantastic. If you want to compare it to TCSM then you can but, to me, it would be like comparing The Shinning to Amityville Horror. We get the idea of the film but the tone and the way it is executed is entirely different.2) There are some incredibly strong performances.3) It is a slow burn which I love! The film is not an in your face blood squirting maniac piece. It is a unwinding story of a twisted family and their desires. It was paced excellently.4) The characters were people you wanted to root for even though they were not the ones you were suppose to root for!5) There were some hardware issues with lenses and small issues like that but, welcome to indie filmmaking. They did it and it works amazingly.In the end, this was a phenomenal film about the horrors of a family who sticks together through the hard times even if they are the ones creating the hard times. It is fun, the sets are awesome, the production value is there and the cast looks like they had a hell of a time making this film. I truly do think it is worth the watch, maybe even study and I can't wait to see more from the incredible team at CRA!"}], "reviews_amount": 73}
