It's pure narcissism. It's all about meeeeeee. Me being happy. Me surviving. The allegory it uses to make this point in the film is good and bad people exploding. No explanation as to why, it just happens. And that's a very sad thought. No point. No purpose. Just hope you don't explode and if you don't.

Who knows.. I don't think the director knows either, as it switches very quickly between all three genres.. or it's not funny because it's simply, not funny..Langford and Plummer don't seem to fit, can't quite put my finger on it as to what it is but it feels weird and awkward between them, their characters are total opposites, I don't know if it's just their acting abilities, their characters or poor direction, I'm not sure but I didn't find either of them humorous, not in the slightest, they also have zero fake chemistry.. plus they aren't kids, they're both actually in their 20's in this.. well maybe Plummer wasn't but they don't even look like high schoolers.. it can only last so long that they, especially typecast Langford, can play teenager type roles and this isn't one of them..As acting goes, Langford tries, idiotically and a bit cringe, to be this loud, hip, cool, don't give a crap with attitude type chick, with flaky parents, this role has been overplayed so many times now and also way better, there's plenty of face palm type moments from her, I've seen Plummer in one or two decent films but he's only in them as a side note, to just fill the margins.. kind of like Langford has been in the few films I've seen her in.. And how old is Haley Law? She's almost 30, playing a high schooler and she looks that old in this too.. nice casting..Don't waste your money on buying/renting ($15/$10) this, I was lucky enough not to do that.. if so, ask for a refund.. as it's being released as a full price 'cinema' release on VOD now so just simply wait for Amazon Prime to eventually release it as a normal Prime exclusive release to viewers in a few months.. even then, if you've got a spare 90 minutes to waste, watch something more entertaining.."}, {"id": 16, "text": "The most boring movie I have ever seen.

Even adults have trouble understanding the dirtiness of current political affairs, therefore subjecting teenagers to such content can only be concluded as the willing indoctrination of specific values that their generation must uphold.Seeing with my own eyes how these themes manifest in a mature woman in her early thirties, I'm quite afraid how this kind of narrative seeding is going to affect the social cohesion of our societies in the future.

Why does it only affect certain people? How was it cured?

I didn't expect such good performances from these two relatively unknown (and young) actors.

They go back to same cycle till the school is not over and it is to be believed that everything will be Fine one day.I have to say noone plays a Teenager like Katherine Langford. She was fantastic in Thirteen Reasons Why and that's why the show connected with millions of people around the globe positively or negatively but it was due to her realistic portrayal of New Girl lost in new school. She is soo different from her role as Hannah and still she made it her own a teenager trying her best to deal with loss of her classmates. Charlie Plummer is a delight as always. You should watch him in King Jack and Looking for Alaska.On the whole, it's a unique take on a very serious matter and it makes sure to use it's platform to bring awareness and showcase the survival's grief which never goes away."}], "reviews_amount": 60}
