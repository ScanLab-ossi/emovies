Great work Greer"}, {"id": 2, "text": "I\u00b4ve been a big fan of The Disclosure Project, and when the film Unacknowledged was released, I watched with a kind of disappointment how it all drifted towards a quasi-spiritual personal mumbo jumbo project. It was, however, possible to ignore most of the embarrasing stuff and focus on the actual documentation parts pertaining UFOs. This time, Dr. Greer has gone completely off the rails. Babbling away about his own magic psychic abilities, a godlike power to summon and send away UFOs and aliens, and nutcase claims about his friends being assassinated because of what the know.It also turns out that the US gvmt almost routinely abduct people in Skunk Works built UFOs, where various disabled people act as aliens. This as a tool to manipulate nosy politicians etc. The subject of government funded projects for building precise copies of alien craft and tech is emphasized in the movie. Yet, everything Greer and his companions experiences, is the real thing. I guess Greer can tell because he sends his mind into the ships to check things out.It\u00b4s just too much to mention. I don\u00b4t know if Greer&amp;Co. does this only to make money of simpletons and loonies, or if it\u00b4s an actual insight into a completely twisted and delusional mind. Probably a mix of both.UFO phenomena in and of it self is mind blowing and exciting. The documentation is there, undenied. We are free to explore it in a constructive way. Sadly, Greer and his peers burns to the ground, with this one single travesty of a film, the credibility and curiosity having been carefully built up around UFOs over decades. What could have been a contribution to an open and interesting approach, is drowned by the ridiculous stream of words from the lawyer guy, and of course Greer\u00b4s banalities about meditation, consciousness and him self as a sort of christ; he is the chosen one, and we can only fully communicate with aliens through Greer as a proxy.Oddly enough, Greer also insists that UFOs need telepathic help from us to find where we are so they can show up when summoned. In the next sentence, Greer informs us that the UFO\u00b4s represent technologies and evolution maybe millions of years ahead of us. Still, they supposedly pilot their crafts personally, with control sticks etc, and need Greers help to find Blue Ridge mountain. Not a single time through this massive, uninterrupted or challenged Greer promotion video does anyone even hint to the possibility of UFO\u00b4s being some sort of drones, multi-dimensional visitors or other. Instead, they are obviously contained well within our old fashioned understanding of the universe and physics, blazing through space with speeds many times faster than the light, etc.One thing is for sure: anyone who in the future wants to discredit everything that has anything to do with extra terrestrial phenomenon, need only point to this documentary to win the arguments.

Didnt know you could drink at the same time you are meditating at the same time seeing objects with a camera.The events, all the photos are on the ground and have random lights appear.

The photos of actual Alien healers Looks just like a guy with a camera on himself.None of these show proof, just another form of could be, couldnt be.

Watch for yourself and make an informed decision."}, {"id": 31, "text": "This film is a Tour De Force in insight, messaging, sounds, and visuals. Yet it barely addresses the EXTREME CREDIBILITY of Dr. Greer in establishing the authenticity of extraterrestrial life, and the generations-long extremely illegal cover-up surrounding it.Greer and Mazzola's earlier Unacknowledged is- by far- my favorite film of all time (and this coming from someone who thought about a month before seeing it that extraterrestrial life was a joke). Greer and Mazzola are geniuses, and the message of the movie is at least as valuable as cinema itself.There is no reasonable explanation except that Greer is exactly on target. (As one brief illustration, what exactly is the History Channel's subsequent Unidentified miniseries all about? It strikes me as a textbook misinformation spoof of the film, that accomplishes nothing except to attest that Greer was right all along.)With that as a backdrop, this film is the logical extension to Unacknowledged, as its lays out a practical solution to resolve the illegal cover-up (while changing the world, to put it mildly).Watch Unacknowledged and explore Dr. Greer's work for yourself, slowly and independently. Ask questions and let logic lead you to the answers.Imagine what it was like when the US won World War II. What would have been our natural inclinations? What were the associated risks?What happened to technology within the 20th century? Did the logical insights of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Max Planck decades ago just disappear for no reason?Why do we have a cartoonishly large military budget despite no apparent imminent threats? Doesn't common sense indicate that it would be better invested in diplomacy (prevention rather than remediation)?If we as Americans do not hold Washington accountable for what happens to our money, why would we not be held accountable for what may be done with it? And if Washington is too cowardly to achieve results, who is left but we the people ourselves, collaborating in unity? (Of course, being confined to our individual houses for the first time in decades just as the film premiered, which I'm sure is a complete coincidence.)This film is a mosaic of ingenuity in introducing insights for its viewers to pursue in greater detail (in conjunction with Greer's awesome reading list). Yet it definitely does not go as far as it could in addressing the illegal cover-up of the reality of extraterrestrials- because the theme of the film is the true solution to the situation, not more-of-the-same through endless conflict.Whether or not the media is receiving cash payments (as described in Unacknowledged) to keep this work below the radar, it is definitely a film that you deserve to see. Of course, if those responsible for the illegal cover-up thought about the situation more clearly, they would realize that Dr. Greer is their gift-of-a-lifetime to be readily forgiven as the cover-up imminently approaches its inevitable end."}, {"id": 32, "text": "My father was and my husband is an aerospace engineer.

This was a long, 2 hour documentary, and to be honest, I felt the whole 120 minutes of it! I was struggling to keep my intetest going.I am very open minded about the UFO phenomenon, and I do agree, that it is extremely likely that there are multiple other life forms out there. I have also watched many documentaries on the subject, over the years. The majority of this documentary however, is focused on deep meditation, and expanding our consciousness, to the point that we can communicate with these beings, including summoning the craft to come and appear in the sky for us, asking them not to go away, once they have started to go away and succeeding in them coming back (one example), and even asking for healing of deafness, which, apparently happened (one example). It just felt like these folks want to believe sooo much, that all this stuff happens, that they believe it does, every single time. I could recreate these effects with the birds in my garden! (Barring the deafness of course, but people get spontaneously better from serious medical conditions every day.....it's rare of course, but not unheard of). I don't know how to meditate, but if I sat in quiet contemplation for an hour, and asked for a Robin to appear on the fence, and a Robin did appear, that isn't some kind of supernatural force....I'm not communicating with the Robin. If he flew off, and I asked him to come back, and he did, that doesn't prove anything either. As an ex-Christian, I kind of felt that this belief in the power of being able to communicate with aliens, is very similar to belief in god. If you pray for something, and it happens, then if you have that faith, you believe that it's god that has answered your prayers. It can't possibly be any other reason, if you have that strong faith.I can't obviously explain the photos and videos of the lights in the sky or the lights around the group of people meditating, but that is also not absolute proof. I think this documentary would have been much better, had it been more scientific eg. If they had got scientists, ecologists, photography experts, astronomers etc in, to give their opinions as to what these lights could have been. They were gathered in a small group, out in the middle of the mountains and deserts, so i am assuming the US military fly in these remote areas every night. If you watch other current UFO documentaries, then it is claimed that the military now have the technology to simulate UFOs. I dated a US airforce guy decades ago, and even back then, he told me that the US airforce were technologically 20 years ahead of what the public were aware of, and that if the public knew about these things, it would blow their minds! Think how much more advanced things would be now a days! As to the lights on the ground, those photos were all taken on a relatively slow speed, so all you could see were trails of light. Many insects have eye shine, or phosphorescent abilities, and shots taken at a slower speed would produce the same results, of trails of light.I don't know. I could go on and on really. This just seemed to be a documentary specifically for those that would believe everything that was contained in it, without question. It was completely bias, without any counter arguments or discussion.The sweeping statement that all the animal mutilations and abductions were done by the military, was absolutely astounding! I had to rewind, to hear that again, as it was only said once, and wasn't covered again!! That is a massive subject for debate, and once again, absolutely no proof was given. That was the thing that really put me off, from then on, really. That in itself, could warrent many documentaries! That phenomena happens worldwide, not just in the States, and has been happening for decades!If you are open minded, but want a balanced documentary, with input from both sides of this topic, then this isn't the documentry for you, as it wasn't for me."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Guys, you just need to buy the app and we can bypass the elites and contact the aliens."}, {"id": 36, "text": "I have lost my respect for Dr Greer.

There are space ships and dead ET's being hidden.So they fly around and crash sometimes and don't collect their dead, they just quietly observe us like an ant nest.RiiiiiiightSkip, skip and double skip this, maybe waste your money on a pyramid scheme, America loves those also."}, {"id": 57, "text": "Let me start this by saying, everyone has their own perception and opinion of things. Information is just that, what you do with it, is up to you. With that said, I have spent my entire life aware of the fact that there's something going on behind the curtain and that we're not alone. I have spent the last decade or so trying to make other people aware of it as well. Dr. Steven Greer's work is something I have been following for a some time now. In fact, I have a copy of every byte of media he has ever produced. This documentary is simply a must see for everyone on this planet...including those who don't want the rest of us to watch/wake-up. Perhaps all they need is a change in perspective to see that what they've been doing is in fact insanity. Perhaps, once you watch this...you'll realize, what you've been doing, is also in fact insanity. The simple truth is, once you know, you have an obligation to let others know...otherwise you are just as much a part of the problem. My motto is: If you are not a part of the solution, you are a part of the problem... The only way our species is going to evolve...is as one. If you don't believe in the power of thought...just search up what happens to random number generators during large public events."}, {"id": 58, "text": "Featuring the science of consciousness and the practice and results of CE-5, this is a perfect second follow-up for his movie Sirius, 2013 (after Unacknowledged, 2017). The mentioned official app for iOS and Android you can find under the name CE5 Contact. Here are the CE-5 protocols (from Kosta Makreas, former friend of his and cast member in Sirius, 2013):1. Do this ET Contact any time, anywhere that is convenient, comfortable and safe for you.2. Choose the place and the people you believe are compatible, respectful, and enthusiastic about this coordinated effort. You can also do this alone. NOTE: How you approach your CE-5 Experience is CRITICAL. If you have an attitude of fear, deep skepticism, hostility, close-mindedness ... chances are good you will fail at making contact. Bring your goodwill, love, joy and openness to the experience. The ETs will pick up on your noble positive vibrations.3. Link heart-to-heart with members in your group. Circulate the love energy (coherence).4. Imagine a sphere of love at the center of your circle with each of your hearts connected to it. Project this column of love energy high up into the sky as a brilliant vibrant beacon to our Star Friends.5. When you go into meditation, in your imagination link up heart-to-heart with all of the other Global ET Contact groups who are joining in all over the planet. -Then with love also include our Star Friends as you invite them and guide them to your location. -You can guide them to your location by projecting your consciousness out to them and visualizing how to travel from the location of our sun in our solar system to our Earth. -As you approach it in your imagination, zoom in closer and closer to your specific location on the surface. -Show (visualize) the images of where to find you to them!6. Mentally and with your heart, ASK our ET friends what you and we can do in cooperation with them to bring about a healing for our planet Earth. Invite them to take more of a part in our Human affairs, recognizing that it is nonetheless Humanity's responsibility to solve its problems - they need to be asked, from our point of free will.7. Remember that ET Contact can come in many forms. It may be a sighting of a Star Craft, a lucid dream, a telepathic message, a touch on the shoulder or knee, weird electrical phenomenon with communication devices or lights, and so much more."}, {"id": 59, "text": "To borrow from another tv show: 'I want to believe' - however this didn't help with that. I'd heard some of the debunking of Steven Greer beforehand but thought I'd give this a watch, even if just for entertainment value. The first 40ish minutes are reasonably interesting and there are some interesting theories (though perhaps people with scientific backgrounds would immediately dismiss). Beyond that however it just descends into rubbish. Some of the claims made relating to meditation/Buddhism etc are beyond laughable and almost insulting (and I say that from having in depth knowledge and experience of both). It then goes on to show a series of 'ufo' clips, most of which have been debunked as being Chinese lanterns etc.This is the first time I've seen Greer beyond the odd clip. Maybe he is telling the truth but to me he has no credibility, and the fact he is given such platforms is quite sad and worrying. I mean he talks about how he has briefed senior government officials and infers he's been privy to confidential meetings when actually he's never worked for the government. Yeh some might say 'that's because it's all secret' but to me theyre just obvious signs of a con. Reminds me a bit of nick pope who has made a career off of having worked in the UK ministry of defence, even though he was only an extremely junior employee who likely had zero access to anything interesting - at least though pop actually can claim some knowledge of how government works."}, {"id": 60, "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. Whether you're a believer or a skeptic, one must respect the dedication to the mission of Dr. Steven Greer. His documented research into extraterrestrial activity dates back more than 25 years, and he has briefed every president since Bill Clinton on the topic. This is the third documentary for Dr. Greer, including SIRIUS (2013) and UNACKNOWLEDGED (2017), the latter of which was directed by Michael Mazzola - also the director of this current film.Mr. Mazzola divides the film into 3 chapters: Blood and Treasure, The Crossing Point of Light, and A New World. However, the film's structure matters little, as this is mostly another opportunity for Dr. Greer to present his research, his beliefs, and allow others to comment. Dr. Greer is the founder of the Center for Study of Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (CSETI), and he was also behind the 1993 Disclosure Project, which persuaded the government to release previously classified documents pertaining to UFOs and extraterrestrials.Of course, Steven Spielberg's 1977 double Oscar winner CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND remains quite popular today, and the title to Mazzola's film refers to what CSETI categorizes as the 5th kind of alien encounter: proactive human communication with an extraterrestrial. In support of this, Dr. Green spends a good amount of time explaining his group events, where believers gather to experience these encounters. It's at this point where much of the film focuses on Universal consciousness (ESP, meditation, etc.). The parameters of pure heart and peace are said to be necessary for group meditation cohesion. It's very similar to the idea of attraction - if we think about something, that thing is more likely to appear or happen.A quote from a physicist opens the film, and numerous quotes are highlighted throughout courtesy of intellects, scientists, and spiritualists. Scientific analysis is provided and we hear from some brainy talking heads, including Dr. Edgar Mitchell, a former astronaut. Attorney Daniel Sheehan gets plenty of screen time as well, and does his part to fit right in with the line-up of articulate, knowledgeable experts who offer up their commentary. These are not the wild-eyed types we see on local news or lesser documentaries. These are folks with actual experience backed by video and photographic evidence.Dr. Greer asserts that since no human has ever been harmed, we can assume the extraterrestrials are not here to cause damage - an easily debated point. He also claims that these aliens are up to a billion years ahead of us, though he never explains the math on that. Actor Jeremy Piven seems an odd choice as narrator, given his propensity for roles as a fast-talking smart-aleck, but a montage of video from around the globe (the most recent from December 29, 2019) lends credence to Dr. Greer's claim that the collective conscience has a relationship to the physical world. He has also accepted that skeptics will always exist, and that he will be ridiculed for his work and beliefs. If nothing else, perhaps the film will open up a few minds to the possibility."}, {"id": 61, "text": "When I first heard of Dr. Steven Greer was back during the Disclosure Project and the AP News Conference with all of the government workers, military, engineers and so on to disclose information about UFO, ETs, EBEs, foreign technology and the governments knowledge of it all. It amazed me then to see someone actually bring a mass of people to expose and bring out the truth to the press and public and Dr. Steven Greer amazes me still. At first when I heard of the CE5 project I was very very skeptical. Truthfully it freaked me out and seemed out there and I knew it would bring Dr. Greer's reputation down to the everyday person, skeptic and the king of people who don't take the time to look into something and research it. After looking into what Dr. Greer was saying about CE5 protocol and researching using consciousness to communicate or remote view it's amazing how many scientists, scholars and governments already have been researching this and even using it. A lot of scientists say and have proof that the consciousness of a mass of people can and does effect random number generators. The US government started in the 60s a program for soldiers to use remote viewing and other consciousness related training. Military personnel have stated to be trained to use telepathy to communicate with EBE. It's amazing how much actual physical, 1st 2nd and 3rd hand knowledge and eye witness accounts, documentation(released by many governments_even the US with the Freedom of Information act) and many many many credible, well known, high ranking, public figures have stated the same. After researching everything and seeing that a lot of what Dr. Greer has stated and shown proof of has come out and come true it brought me back to understanding the CE5 protocol and not just being one of those people who are to worried to say something that might embarrass them or bruise there rediculous EGO's or just being called crazy and laughed at. I'm glad I research so when something like CE5 comes up and I get laughed at for saying I see truth in it but I can't fully believe it true until I do it and see it for myself, I am able to throw all kinds of evidence, documentation and studies done by scientists to back what I saw up and shut up the SHEEP who just say and do what they think is what will make people like them and what the TV, media and governments want. Whoops little rant. All in all I gave it 8 stars only because I haven't done or been to a CE5 session. I would love to do try it of observe it. Their is a lot of video and pictures evidence of the CE5 protocol working at least doing something strange at those sessions. All over YouTube, the internet and even TV shows all over the world people have gotten video and pictures evidence of something strange happening at the CE5 protocol sessions. The Florida session in the movie, that an earlier review said was obviously fake, I totally believe it was real. I see people that think like that and hope they stop being the SHEEP followers that the government and media want them to be. A lot of people say it was the flare booms from oil rigs. I worked on a 240' Offshore Supply Vessel supplying oil rigs. I've seen all kinds of oil rigs (stationary, jack-ups, semi submersible and drilling ship rigs) and all kinds of flare booms in all kinds of weather with light inversions and light refractions on the ocean and those lights are not in any way flare booms. From what I saw those lights are no way flare booms or ship or fisherman lights. The lights were way to high on the horizon and we're moving. I think that the CE5 protocol works and would love to take a serious crack at it. It's a great documentary headed by a person Dr. Steven Greer who I think has backed up most of the stuff he has said with hard evidence. As time passes and more things are released time keeps backing up Dr. Steven Greer and proving him right more and more. Its honestly scary and awesome at the same time. I hope people watch this with an open mind and take the time to listen and research and are open to learning about topics that are considered taboo and frowned upon like UFOlogy, the study and use of the consciousness, UFOs/UAPs and ETs/EBEs and maybe actually realize that something amazing is happening on and above our planet and it could be and probably is the most important and amazing thing to happen in human history and it NEEDS to come out to the world and maybe change our planet and civilization forever, for the better."}, {"id": 62, "text": "Belle Delphine and Bhad Babie should not have been in the intro, at all...Now that that's out of the way, This documentary could have been put together better, the transitioning of many scenes with clips and narrating is choppy. Like trying to focus on fishing while on a small boat on rough waters, you spend most of your time focusing on your balance. While interviewing Greer, instead of jumping back and forth between camera angles while he was mid sentence they should have kept the camera steady on him. This is a subject of depth. The brain has to be able to focus and quickly process the information that is being explained. The eye stimulation from scene cuts and camera angles is distracting. The music in the background should be lower or of different tempo. That did not help the fact that there were many times I had to rewind and listen again, sometimes a couple of times in order to understand what was being said. I had a lot of wait what moments.Regardless there is a lot of great information in the documentary that confirms a lot of what those who have a sense of this already know.I think it's funny they suggest Biden and Kamala would win to meet the narrative, well.... Though as intriguing as this meditative state into higher consciousness to be able to communicate intergalactically sounds, it was hard for me to accept the story about the guy who astral projected himself into a spacecraft. This is where I draw the line for myself. I watched it over and over trying to understand but I can't. I don't agree with Greer truly believing that this man physically crashed into and entered a spacecraft in our current space time continuum and then be able to dissect it and explain how it occured to the fellow. It just makes no sense to me.. but neither does Rainbow Body and apparently that is real. (if you don't know what is look it up and watch Tibetan Rainbow Body documentary on YT)Conclusion:The EGO of man is a dangerous, deadly thing. One has to look within themselves to heal from their past so that they are present and able to tune in and receive the information that is being taught by the universe, not our ego driven leaders.PEACE and LOVE Let's all meditate away COVID! It only takes 1%!Also LOL there is a CE5 APP!"}], "reviews_amount": 63}
