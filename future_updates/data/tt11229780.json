There were far more well portrayed and peaceful Muslim characters in this film than there were evil. That's how it is in the Middle East. Most all citizens are sick of being repressed by their governments and their kings, princes and clerics. That was well reflected here and the characters felt like real people.

I was in the industry for over ten years as a location scout. This film has at least 40 to 50 locations. That's not cheap. It was obviously filmed in Jordan. Their currency is stronger than the US's. They used hotels, airports, helicopters, etc and had a ton of international actors and actresses. So my estimate is around $15million and that's not low budget.Now onto the film. I'll keep it short and sweet. It's my favorite film of the year. I was on the edge of my seat from the first scene. There was nothing obvious about it. I adored the cast, specifically the top billed cast (Caviezel, Karvan, Ozsan, Savante), I thought the writing was very smart, and I loved the way it was shot. 10/10 from me."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Incredible movie, go watch and you will not be let down!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "I actually enjoyed this movie and I learned a lot about the persecution of Christians in Iran.

This movie is based on a true story about a Christian, Jim, that is invited to Cairo to speak about military uprisings in the Middle East. Claudia plays his wife, who advises him that he should not go-it's kind of dangerous in that region of the world and Claudia works for the State Department, so she knows what she is talking about. Jim goes anyways-Duh-and makes a Christian statement while appearing on Cairo tv which sets off some extremists. Hal and some of his friends-extremists-kidnap Jim and move him to a secluded spot in Iran. Claudia tries to get the US government to launch a rescue but to no avail. She then decides to go in and see if she can get him out herself. Stelio offers her his assistance-he has some connections. The first part of the movie is a little routine-with the torture scenes-but the last part is a little better in the rescue operation.

D - I consider my time wasted. F - I either walked out, turned of the player or am kicking myself for not doing so.I give Infidel a B-.The story is interesting, mostly plausible and has an acceptable balance between the conflict and the resolution. Jim Caviezal is dependably good in anything he's in. While his character, Doug's behavior is a bit questionable in dealing with other faiths, since he's not actually a Christian leader, but a Christian blogger, that part is reasonable. (I doubt many Christian leaders would have been that blunt on a Moslem TV show, since they'd know it wouldn't be accepted very well). I like that they included Moslems assisting his wife as she tried to get him released. It showed that the problem is not just a religious squabble but actually a political problem where religion is being used as an excuse for political abuse.I did have a problem with several plot elements left hanging with no resolution. And the character development could have been done better.SPOILERS....It's established that Doug's wife Liz (Claudia Karvan) was having a crisis of faith (this was only revealed after she'd used several profanities which was bad timing, making it sound as if Christians normally use language like that). But the movie ended with nothing else being revealed about her loss of faith in God. Did she still blame God, or did she resolve the conflict?Doug also used profanities, including the F-word, but given the context, they were placed during moments of severe crisis, which hopefully people will understand as weakness, not acceptable behavior.The character of Ramzi (Hal Ozsan) murders his own daughter, yet the only punishment or consequences he ever receives is a punch in the face.

LOL.Having said that, this is a film worth watching, not so much for the mains (turning in occasionally hammy or contrived performances), but for the concept overall, and particularly the performances of supporting characters such as Ramzi.The harshness and lawlessness of the Middle-East felt real (if a little cliched in places) ... but you are left in no doubt as to the eternal divides which exist between the (primarily) Judeo-Christian culture of the West ... and its counterparts of radical Islam elsewhere.In short, if these themes interest you ... the film is worth checking out."}, {"id": 61, "text": "The filmmakers claim that Infidel is about cultures, not faiths, and aims to show only that people of different backgrounds should try to get along.

Even now, it seems unbelievable that the filmmakers could lie so blatantly.The truly saddening part in all of this is the fact that real journalists are far too often imprisoned and killed for their investigative reporting which attempts to bring the dark side of humanity into the light of day. There are also valid, substantial and worthy criticisms that should be made of both modern Christianity and modern Islam. I would deeply appreciate a film that authentically and unbiasedly explores these topics. Unfortunately Infidel doesn't even come close. What Infidel does accomplish, is to repeatedly portray Christians positively and Muslims negatively. It's pure and utter religious propaganda that should be labeled as hate speech.

Doug works in a small tech company doing contracts work for the US government, but he is also an active Christian blogger.

At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest film from writer-director Cyrus Nowrasteh, whose The Stoning of Soraya M some years ago was quite good, but who more recently has been involved in some dubious stuff. Second, more troubling, the production company behind this film turns out to be D'Souza Media, the company run by far-right wing activist Dinesh D'Souza, a convicted felon whom Trump pardoned in 2018. (Among other things, D'Souza also claims that the Democrats are racists, and that fascism is a left-wing movement. Yea, we're dealing with that kinda garbage. He is of course very much welcomed in Trump circles.) When I saw that name in the opening credits, my heart sank. Third, the film claims to be inspired by true events, but never discloses what those true events are (if any). Fourth, the movie coulda/shoulda been a riveting film, but alas is just not very good, and it whiffs big time, period. The script has holes the size of Manhattan. The acting is outright poor (Jim Caviezel who plays Doug fancies himself a new Ben Affleck). Speaking of Affleck, Infidel more than anything comes across as wanting to be a new Argo (tense hostage drama in Iran), but comes nowhere close to it. I mean, not by a mile or ten.Infidel opened this weekend in theaters (fully adhering to all COVID-19 protocols). The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended dismally (2 people, including myself). Honestly I can't see Infidel playing in theaters more than 1 or 2 weeks.

None of them are valid in and of themselves. There are no aspects of this film, any critic could point to that warrants an one star but in this current climate of Islamic violence apologetics, speaking out against such a film, is the safest bet both in a cowardly industry and on a personal level. It simply doesn't pay to speak the truth, when no one in power cares.While the threat of international terrorism was historically treated much like any other threat by Hollywood, superficial bad guys with foreign accents, the modern response has been the mirror opposite, both in quality and style. Instead of simple good guy bad guy, we have a reversal of protagonist and antagonist, while instead of right and wrong being easily identifiable, we suffer a post modernist take on the issue. An attempt by modern movie makers to blur the lines between what is and isn't justifiable violence and who is right or wrong. This film is stand out by sheer value of being almost alone in tackling this issue. We need more not less in the way of nuanced, personalised and whenever possible, real stories about terrorism.Instead of making apologies for Islamic violence or portraying all terrorists as evil, it would be far better to address the issue in a way that allows for both sides perspective to be told honestly and let the viewer make their own mind up. Unfortunately that isn't going to happen in the current climate.As for the elephant in the room, tackling the horrific treatment of Coptic Christians in Muslim countries, never mind Christians in Communist countries, there seems no interest and no end in sight to the world's complete indifference.

It's so sad to discover my woman whom I thought could be a back up but it seems I have been deceiving myself for months. I need to desperately know what she's been up to lately so I had to reach out to webhubghost (@) gmailcom who got so many truthful and amazing reviews on the internet to remotely get into her mobile phone. He got that done in a twinkle of an eye, the service was delivered perfectly I was able to see her whatsapp messages, call logs, text messages which was quite amazing and I figured she lied to me about all the money i sent to her and her mails were the worst I could ever imagine.. I sincerely recommend webhubghost @ gmailcom if you are in need of a similar service and you want a perfect job done. This is not a hoax or deceit, I need everyone to find their luck spying their partner with this honest and noble IT expert. This app works perfectly but you need the help of the real deal with the email above to get loose from the chains of a cheater and abusive relationship by getting concrete proof through his expertise and prowess. Give Ben a try and regret no more, better days ahead.Email: WEBHUBGHOST (@) GMAILCOMText/WhatsApp: +19044177214"}, {"id": 68, "text": "Going through the reviews, you see a lot of 10 stars and a lot of 1 or 2 stars. So you might think the this is a thought provoking movie and a manifestation of how polarized we are.IT IS NOT THAT.This is a low budget rushed-in production with few modest action scenes and a conflicting and hallow plot. How hallow? In one scene Covid is mentioned but through the whole movie you don't see a single person wearing a mask. (obviously was added post-production). But most of all, the plot doesn't make sense.Although there are a few surprisingly fresh dialogues but those few are not enough to balance the cliche and half-hatched rest of the movie.SO WHY SO MANY 10 STARS?I think its because no matter how weak the movie is, it is extremely appeasing to those who have already made (and closed) their minds and believe in their own righteousness and the absolute evil. Its their attempt to support their truth as much as they can.And as for the 1 and 2 stars, they just try to balance the bias."}, {"id": 69, "text": "I'll start by saying the film was poor from an artistic and script/story perspective. I'll leave that there.More importantly for me is the broader impact a film like this has on society and the world. As an artistic endeavor, you cannot subsume topics like Islam/Christianity and depict characterizations of large parts of the world like the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and not ask what is the image and truth you are trying to convey about the people in these religions and the geographic areas. Perhaps the makers of this film did just that - I imagine it was calculated - but it leaves Christians and Muslims in a worse place.I will stop here for context and say that I am a Christian who lives in the U.S., who was also a U.S. Soldier, deployed twice to the Middle East.The film goes to great lengths to highlight religious affiliation which pragmatically serves as more of a dividing tool (think here of Bosnia in the 90's with Orthodox, Catholic and Muslim affiliations during the war). Undoubtedly, many far-right conservative Christians in the U.S. who have not travelled to the MENA region and have no Muslim friends will appreciate the subtle Christian vs. Islam shallow and hostile narratives, but ultimately this is perpetuating harmful views. Am I ignoring evils that have been and are still being done in the name of Islam? No. But this film goes to painstaking endeavors to highlight the separation, difference, and division between Christianity and Islam, and chooses to paint Islam with broad brushstrokes as evil and dangerous.Islam and the MENA region is far from homogenous, and it possesses rich history and millions of great people. Most of this film at best paints Muslims as agnostic and untrustworthy figures, and more usually as homicidal ideologues who should always be viewed with suspicion - especially if they are your neighbor or co-worker.In reality, it is films like this - that create or confirm ignorant and divisive/destructive biases - that should be viewed with suspicion. The net result of this one is a film designed to be pro-Christian - communicating a very non-Christian message."}], "reviews_amount": 70}
