Not awfully original but cool nonetheless.Do you ever get frustrated watching a movie because the protagonists keep doing irrational and unrealistic things which lead to easily preventable problems? This happens a lot...This couple gets fooled and bamboozled by obvious tricks and ruses at every turn. You'd think a grown man and woman who have survived this long in a post apocalyptic wasteland would have more street smarts.Anyways, turns out the bad guys were eating the people the whole time.This movie is a steaming pile of garbage. Avoid at all costs."}, {"id": 4, "text": "It's impossible to believe that the actors didn't know they were fed the audience's flesh and that they thought the audience were robbed and their money was then used to buy food."}, {"id": 5, "text": "As a fan of post apocalyptic stories this should have been a solid film for me, but when taking in to consideration the overall lackluster delivery i am rather disappointed.A common problem with Norwegian films in my experience and a quite obvious issue with Cadaver, is that the acting was at best average. Apart from Thorbj\u00f8rn Harr's portrayal of Mathias and Stig Frode Henriksen as Hans the robotically delivered dialogue from the actors gave the impression that they were merely reading the script in stead of actually performing.The story itself is rather solid, but if you have any experience with post apocalyptic films, then you don't have to get far before figuring out what the big secret is. So i wouldn't recommend going in with an expectation of being surprised by any plottwists."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Cadaver: The aftermath of a nuclear disaster in Norway, likely war. Things are bleak food is short, the city looks bombed out, there's a const gloomy fog/mist. A strange man arrives offering people food and entertainment in a local hotel. People are fed and an interactive theatre ensues. That's when reality becomes difficult to separate from the performance. People start to disappear, strange things happen. Some really horrific scenes as what is really going on becomes all too obvious. Not a totally original story but the execution gives it a fresh flavour. Some heavy handed allegories though and the running time could have been pruned. Once again a horror film which might have worked better as an episode of The Twilight Zone.

There is no stage for performances but instead, each actor creates interesting stories enticing audiences to follow them around the hotel. Things change as people begin to go missing and the family find themselves in a horrifying situation in which they must escape. The premise of this movie is really creative and cool but the movie doesn't anything better than alright throughout. As more of the mystery of the theatre is uncovered by the protagonist, the story becomes a whole lot more intriguing with further creative aspects pushing the story beyond the extent it seemed to have to stop the movie from being really great. A very suspenseful horror film with a great story behind it."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Honestly, twenty minutes into the film I had wanted to turn it off.. but I decided to push through as maybe there would be a spark somewhere. I thought that maybe I would be enveloped by the storyline, or that the directing would entice me; I even forgave the characters for such intolerable acting within the first 20 minutes and had monstrous hopes they would prove me different.. how sadly had I been mistaken. Granted, this was a debut so there will be flaws, but flaws does not do this movie justice. The script was so unoriginal and cheesy I could take some crackers, wipe up the excess, and have enough for years to come. The characters were drowning in lack of development, the story was ridden with plot holes and about as barebone as can be. The one decent thing about Cadaver was the set design: the hotel itself had a certain timeless vagueness to it that i would have loved for them to explore further. The antagonist had a single layer of depth, which you do not find out about until towards the end(although, anyone with half a sense can foresee such predictability).

Much like its namesake, Cadaver is completely lifeless. The plot of the movie consists of a starving family living in a post apocalyptic world who attend an interactive play with the promise of a meal afterwards. This is a foreign film, so the vocals are portly overdubbed and have horrific vocal expressions. The ending is completely predictable, when you learn the actors are killing the audience to use them for food. This movie is obvious, dull, and totally predictable. You'll likely find yourself reaching for your phone 20 minutes in out of boredom. Another complete miss by Netflix."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This film starts like lots of other movies. Nuclear bomb ruins world, hungry people looking to survive. At least no zombies walking the streets... A former theater actress takes her husband and daughter to a show which is promised to be like nothing they've seen before, with a promise of a hot meal. The guests are told to put on masks to differentiate them from the actors. From then on, it is up to actors to be interesting enough to lure guests aside, so that the clean up people can kill them and turn them to the next guests' dinner. Started out okay but quickly turns into a silly film that is not much of anything - it is not scary enough to be a horror film, not interesting enough to be a psychological thriller, and not gory for those who like that kind of movies. Lots of plot holes, poor acting, predictable ending, and the fact that it is a foreign film does not add bonus points. The grand hotel is a nice location, but that's about it. If it wanted to make a statement on what people are willing to do to live, it''s been done far better in numerous other films. To summarize - a complete no show. There was one scene that reminded me of Coma, the film based on Robin Cook''s book, but I refuse to talk about that classic and this film in the same sentence. The paintings of the lambs (were they supposed to be creepy?) can be an allegory for the guests led to slaughter, and then turned to lamb chops. Or makes you miss the quality of Silence of the Lambs.

And things slowly start to go very wrong. I had to post here and speak up for this little gem, as I've just finished watching it and loved it. The grim world is stunningly created - dank, impoverished, bodies lying in the street, it's all too real and convincing. Up at the hotel, everything is scarlet and gold, sumptuous food served on silver platters. The excellent cinematography and design create a dark, disorientating atmosphere and as our protagonists get drawn further and further in, the suspense builds. This has a lot going for it, and if it's not the Hostel -like bloodfest people somehow expected, it's something a lot more ambitious.

Where the film falls flat is the writing. I don't think I'm over exaggerating when I say that the movie consists of a couple yelling their daughter's name for a half hour or more while they look for her. 'Annie?' Walk into another room.

Saying that, I did not mind the voice over in this.The cinematography is really beautiful. The idea of this movie is really fresh and made me want to watch it fully. The opening was incredibly strong. However, I do think it fell short with the majority of the film trying to find Alice. I would have LOVED to see more of the guests actually being hacked up and killed, because that room with the hanging bodies was really bad ass and I think they could have cut some other scenes to give the audience more of what was happening behind the scenes, rather than wait until the last 20-30 mins.Other reviews mention this being sort of like Alice in Wonderland. I strongly disagree. Alice is not the lead character, but I suppose some details could lead to that thinking.There is SOME gore, some pretty good scenes that keep you on the edge.If you're looking for something new, a movie that has beautiful imagery, blood, I'd give it a go.

Later, the mom ingeniously saves her own life by making one of the bad guys appear to be a victim but putting a mask on him. A great scene, but it couldn't save this movie. So disappointing after a strong start. The old I'm better than you attitude of the mom ends up taking down the bad guy, but now mom is back to living in poverty with no food or comfort, when she could have chosen a life of shelter, warmth, and abundant food. She made the wrong choice, but we all knew it was coming."}, {"id": 77, "text": "Norway, post nuclear holocaust, presumably Oslo. Improbable conditions, a number of showpieces that are so impossible that they rob the film's credibility before five minutes have passed.The premise, if you're willing to completely suspend disbelief, is very intriguing at first.Insipid dialogue, incredibly stupid decisions, spouted and made by a cast of entirely loathsome main characters without a single redeeming trait make this unpleasant to watch.The end and the plot are tedious and yawn-inducingly predictable shortly into the movie.Waste of time."}, {"id": 78, "text": "The best movie is that it is produced by Netflix and does not support the idea of homosexuality like most of their films are produced. The film has a new idea about the end of the world and the entry of people into the era of blackness (why is it like most films that talk about the end of the world in a way that has become typical)"}, {"id": 79, "text": "It definitely had potential to be a great movie. I honestly kept waiting for it to get better but then it never did. All you could get out of it was that there was a nuclear war going on, the main characters are terrible parents who can't keep an eye on their kid, and there was a rich psychopath that was secretly forcing everyone to be cannibals. That's the entire plot in a nutshell. Nothing special. I swear, I could go my entire life without hearing the name Alice ever again. The only good thing that would've come out of this was if Thorbj\u00f8rn Harr had been blood eagled again. But they couldn't even give us a decent death for the villain. This movie should've been expanded into a series and it probably would've been appreciated more. At the end of the day, it's not a good movie."}, {"id": 80, "text": "The movie is awful.. would like to send a message to the people who wasted my time ...

What I got was a bad voice over movie. What would have been a good movie was ruined by the bad writing."}, {"id": 86, "text": "As far as foreign films go, this was an excellent concept but I feel like it was diluted for American's sake. Like a lot of American horror films, the bad guy must ultimately die in the end. The good guy, albeit the meek one, must triumph and find a strength inside themselves that they had never had before. What I like about foreign horror films is for the most part, they're honest. The good guy doesn't always win. People watch romcoms and fantasy movies to escape from reality. What makes horror movies truly scary is when it closely resembles our real lives. In true horror, hobe doesn't exist."}, {"id": 87, "text": "So the premise of this film (theater show turns out to be super creepy) is definitely interesting, and the events are certainly intriguing enough to keep you going. However, the movie ultimately does fall flat, as it gets repetitive and leaves you wishing that they did more."}, {"id": 88, "text": "This film is set by in post-apocalyptic Norway and a family of three who are barely getting by are invited to dinner and a show by a creepy gent in a wagon. What could the harm in that be? Hmmm? If you've seen the immersive theater production, Sleep No More in NYC, you will be familiar with the hotel set, the masks and the act of following actors around an elaborately staged, multi-floor set. Once the family gobbles down their dinner and set forth in the hotel to follow the actress, Rakel, everything goes down hill quickly. A few twists and turns are not at all surprising but keep the film moving along. Overall, this film is mildly entertaining, mostly creepy and gross and really only worth watching if you have nothing better to do."}, {"id": 89, "text": "It had a pretty good beginning and middle........ but ending didn't make any senseThe actors all shocked at what they were eating.... How stupid could they possibly be?? The world has pretty much ended... and the one guy yells.... I thought we were just stealing their things...What the hell good is valuables furs, diamonds, and money in a time setting like that?Where the hell did they THINK all that meat was coming from? It wasn't like there was a huge farm around or something....

Often some people do take this decision while there is no alternate left..out of the movie I have watched till now, it was a good movie!!"}, {"id": 92, "text": "Leo (Leonora), her daughter Alice, and her husband Jacob are struggling to survive in a postapocalyptic city, when a man peddling a dream too good to be true cons Leo into buying tickets to a theater performance and a hot meal at a luxury hotel. As a former actress, Leo is drawn to the promise of nourishment for her daughter's body and soul, and Jacob reluctantly plays along.Alice with her big eyes, silky curls and red dress is the epitome of innocence, and Leo admits to a foolish hope for something better for her and for the family - what other choice does she have?As the dinner theater begins, the emcee warns the guests that whatever they see is an act - and only the golden masks the guests are given will distinguish them from the cast members, who are strewn about the hotel. A couple of lovers stage a dramatic quarrel and lead the audience through the stairs and hallways to the many rooms where the story plays out with a few quick glimpses of sex and violence.An intriguing start to the plot quickly fizzles with little to no suspense or character development. There is some air of mystery as characters disappear, but it's a crowd disappearing, not people we know, so it's less like a game of cat and mouse and more like turning on the lights in the bathroom and watching cockroaches flee into the walls.If you're hoping for some good blood and gore, there are a few moments of blades splitting veins, but unfortunately the attempt at getting the viewer to second guess whether it is real or all part of the act leads to special effects so pedestrian that you may ask does it really matter?The film misses the opportunity to leverage the family dynamics of the film - Will their love for each other be strong enough to help them survive?! - by splitting up family members too early, and providing the wrong choices at the wrong times to really give us any empathy or feel torn by their circumstances.If you somehow hadn't figured out what the real purpose of the dinner theater is, the movie wastes no time in confirming your suspicions, but does throw in a little bit of backstory to explain the motivation of the villain. But like most elements in the film, it's shoved in as if it was the first idea to pop into the writer's head and is given no space to grow. You'll probably nod and say to yourself oh.A few tiny glimpses of foreshadowing make their way to the end of the movie - notably Leo's acting background and a moment of comfort she provided to her daughter to ward off scary monsters in the beginning - but it almost seems like an afterthought rather than a critical part of the story, leading more to frustration at how a bit more effort in writing the script would have led to a much more satisfying conclusion.Perhaps in another ten or twenty years someone will produce a remake that knocks this movie's socks off. I hope they do. Sadly, for a plot and setting that had so many easy opportunities at success, the execution of this drops the ball in almost every way."}, {"id": 93, "text": "Much as the central antagonist poses questions to his unhappy assembly during the first act, Cadaver asks us, the audience, what it means to be human. What would we really be prepared to do to survive? And would those actions take away some or all of our humanity?Cadaver plays out the ramifications of these questions through its central premise - in post-apocalyptic Norway a starving family are invited to a mansion that remains oddly untroubled by poverty, where they will be fed and entertained by an unusual theatrical performance. The mansion is queasily reminiscent of such sinister spaces as the Overlook Hotel (The Shining) and the Black Lodge (Twin Peaks), a Grand Guignol nightmare of red walls and masked figures, a trap into which our family wanders through sheer desperation.The scenario plays on fears familiar to all of us in 2020 - do we really want to know what's going on in the world? How the desperate and powerless sustain the comfortable lifestyles of others, whether through direct personal exploitation or by economic means?. In Cadaver, this exploitation is brought to its logical conclusion and invites us to make a judgement about how far we would go to ensure our own survival, and then asks us to consider if we would go even further for something beyond mere survival.Cadaver is an intelligent film (ably directed and performed too, and it looks gorgeous) that deserves an appreciative audience. But are you the audience or a participant?"}, {"id": 94, "text": "There are so many downsides, I just don't know where to begin. The cast and setting are mediocre at its best, ain't the worst but there isn't a wow factor either. The actual idea behind this movie was pretty simple and straight forward, but the execution was poor. The movie's plot is basically reflecting what humans would technically do in order to survive in a post apocalyptic world; kill the weakest and those who's guard isn't up. In a real world, this would most likely not be the case. Anyways, let's move forward, the the movie is severely lacking pace, it's just too slow.The only thing I really enjoyed about the movie is the movie's climax (turning point), it was nicely done, if it wasn't there, I would probably have given a 1/10(SPOILER: The theater type building resembles a slaughterhouse, nothing more, nothing less.)Don't bother with this movie, it is NOT worth the time."}, {"id": 95, "text": "2 stars for cinematography, 1 for everything else.I can honestly say this is a very flaud horrorfilm-attempt. The movie doesn't even have ONE scary scene in it. Just pompous music and bad storytelling. That this is a Netflix-movie is hard to understand. The story is plain and simply boring, and very predictable. Nothing engaging throughout.The actors are also so over the top it reminded me of a Spanish soup opera. I truly believe the director don't know enough about grown-up feelings. The performances from pretty decent actors are horrible! And i believe this isn\u00b4t their fault. This is simply just poor directing. Although it has some good cinematography, that is NOT enough for a professional Netflix-movie. This is merely a poorflix-movie.And they made the ending like we, the audience doesn't know the premise from the first minute. Is was clear as day what was happening and what the bad guys was doing. And they didn\u00b4t even TRY to make some sort of twist. Poor poor poor...I dont know what to say really, if you should watch it or not. Maybe just to see that this review is dead on with everything.I saw this after i watched Hereditary tonight, so maybe the HUGE quality differnce in story, tone and build made me write this."}, {"id": 96, "text": "I think they kind of ruined this by giving it the title of Cadaver because it gives a big clue as to what might be going on. However, as the showmaster says, 'all is not what it seems' and there are many moments where you don't know whats fantasy or reality. Although it seems easy to guess what the big nasty twist could be, there are many moments which make you wonder whats really going on-is it all some big misunderstanding, is it all in the protagonists head? There are many films where the premise seems obvious, only for there to be a big twist at the end, and there was enough intrigue with this to keep me guessing and doubting my original suspicions, or at the very least, wanting to know the details behind the premise. The film is visually appealing-the grim, grey of the outside world contrasting with the opulent luxury of the hotel so that guests feel as though they have stumbled on an escape from their harsh reality that's too good to be true. Much of the hotels interior is a deep, luxurious red as is characteristic of many theatres, which simultaneously portrays the elegance of the surroundings while symbolising the buildings darker, true purpose. If you like the genre of horror that combines beautiful imagery with terror such as Midsommar, you may enjoy this film."}, {"id": 97, "text": "In the right hands this could be one hell of a movie but unfortunately the decisions and actions of the main characters are so distant from reality and so against common sense that you really do have to pretend to not be bothered by these things over and over again.The world has fallen apart and a carriage turns up inviting everyone to see a show with a free meal! My first thought would be that I was being tempted to my death but this family decide to take their daughter along. They're told to keep their masks on...and they take them off. They have their little daughter in a strange place surrounded by strangers and they let her run off on her own! And it just goes on and on.There is no need to do these things if you have a good script, setting and characters but all those things just pass by and are left with almost no detail. I'm sure younger people will enjoy this but for me you can't expect me to hang around watching a film that just does stuff to make you uncomfortable...Unrational things that most people just wouldn't do...fair enough in a teen horror flick but not this...this wants to be more and could have achieved it if the characters acted realistically...but when they act like fools it's hard to care! Shame...the cinematography was nice!"}], "reviews_amount": 98}
