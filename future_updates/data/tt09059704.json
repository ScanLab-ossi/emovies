Then there's not one but two Seth's which is great. The film has both comedic value and sentimental value and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It made me laugh at various points throughout and also made me put myself in both characters shoes and see it from their perspective - 8/10Maybe it was kind of a review."}, {"id": 1, "text": "As others have pointed out this is not your typical Seth Rogen film. This is his attempt to make a fish out of water story in the style of Splash or Big and while he doesn't reinvent the wheel in doing so there were some enjoyable moments. This is obviously meant to be a film which you can watch with you family, it is not vulgar and it focuses on the importance of family values and relationships. There are many moments/jokes in this film that have to do with Judaism which Seth has joked about previously, but here this is much more of a love note to that part of his life. I think maybe some of the negativity being directed at this film is because some people don't understand that aspect of it. They instead are expecting the normal stoner humour Seth Rogen. I think this movie is worth watching if you want to see a different side of Seth and don't mind seeing the things I mentioned."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This movie was not bad but not good either.It kept my attention but wasn't anything spectacular or anything I'll even remember watching for that matter."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The movie started off good with the scenes from old world Europe but the transition to life in America was too fast and more could've been brought out before Herschel fell in the vat of pickles. After that, the movie was pretty slow and just not that funny or enjoyable. There was a heart warming moment at the end very in line with Rogen's other heartfelt comedies but that was pretty much the only highlight in the movie with the rest being barely watchable. Almost seemed kind of fetishizing Jewish shtetl life outside the final scenes of the movie which as mentioned above, were nice and heartfelt. Surprised this was on HBO to be honest. 4/10"}, {"id": 4, "text": "It is not completely bad movie, the beginning was promising, but then after 15 min the screenplay becomes quite stupid and most importantly, not funny. I liked some other Seth movies, so he can definitely do a better job. Just boring mess..."}, {"id": 5, "text": "This is a fun, harmless tale that has some light humor and family charm. Seth Rogan gives 2 very good performances and holds the screen attention the entire time. The Brooklyn setting is well done. I don't get all these low grade reviews. People press play and enjoy."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I started watching it hoping to have a good laugh with friends after we got stoned. Couldn't watch it past 30mins and had to switch to a different movie because it was boring. But after watching it alone and sober, it seemed quite impressive. Seth Rogen did a great job, although the story is silly. It's a heart warming movie and resembles 'Forest Gump' or 'The pursuit of happiness' to an extent if you are into those kind of emotional movies. You'd be disappointed with the movie if you expect it to be a classic Seth Rogen comedy, otherwise it's pretty good. P.S: Definitely wouldn't be the movie that you'd like to watch with a bunch of friends or when you're high."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Movie stupid and unfunny, like Cossacks smashing village and killing peasants. Funny movie, it say, but not funny. No jokes. Why no jokes? Tell me joke from movie. I wait. You no tell me joke because movie no have joke, not even little tiny joke. Movie come from very funny story I read in American magazine, New Yorker, but movie not funny. Movie not good. I give one star and spit on movie.You think this review bad, wait and see movie. I not finish movie and go back to ditch digging."}, {"id": 8, "text": "An American Pickle is a decent film. You'll get a couple good laughs, and the run time is short enough to not waste your time. The premise (as you already know) is ridiculous, but the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. That's a good thing. At the same time, you'll probably completely forget all about this movie come next Tuesday.(PS look for the author of this review around the 59 minute mark)"}, {"id": 9, "text": "And I liked this movie too. Rogen movies are either good or bad, I was happy that this was on the good side. You won't be wasting your time by watching this."}, {"id": 10, "text": "It's not a comedy like Pinapple Express or Superbad. Ok, that's out of the way. I liked it, it's a unique premise and I thought Seth did a good job putting himself out on a limb. Pretty good accent considering his usual style of acting. The movie puts out some laughs and makes you think a bit. If you enjoy it, great. If not, pick something else."}, {"id": 11, "text": "This movie was a pleasant surprise. Well acted, the plot goes from ridiculous to surprisingly becoming a battle between old values and new. Great movie night movie. 8/10 would recommend."}, {"id": 12, "text": "A truly awful, self-indulgent waste of time. Uninteresting, dull, boring yet worst of all it stars Seth Rogan on a narcissistic road trip. This film, like the pickles it features, should remain well and truly sealed in a jar and put to the furthest reaches of the pantry."}, {"id": 13, "text": "A thoroughly enjoyable little film, excellent performances, a bit uneven here and there but overall a nice Sunday afternoon flic to watch curled up on the couch. The music was wonderful, probably my favourite part."}, {"id": 14, "text": "An American pickle is definitely a lot different then all other Seth Rogen movies. That does not mean that it is bad. It is a heartwarming and pretty funny movie.I think a lot of the criticism that is said about this movie is very unfair. Simon Rich is a great writer, and Seth Rogen plays both main roles very well. saying that this is anything below a 5 is ridiculous in my opinion.Being rated Pg-13 I can see how some Seth Rogen fans would be disappointed that this isn't more like all of Seth Rogens other movies, but I like this movie and I'm glad they made it.If you know what your going into, I honestly think you will enjoy it."}, {"id": 15, "text": "I really enjoyed this movie especially because I was brought up old school religious. Catholic though. But honoring your dead relatives is a big deal with Catholics too. Anyway the movie was funny and Seth did an excellent job portraying both leads. I could have watched more."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Lets start this off by saying Seth Rogens dual performance is great and I really hope he does more roles like this. I love the character of Hershel but I feel like his relationship and eventual rivalry with his great grandson Ben is a bit rushed and a little hard to believe. But i can't be too hard on it. Its about a guy being brined in pickle juice for 100 years for Schlopsk sake.6.5/10"}, {"id": 17, "text": "A phallus pickle, coated in the scent of putrid roll mop, then left to soak in a fetid cesspit of manure during an excessively long heatwave, finally marinated in a cadavers colon and served with a side of cat vomit."}, {"id": 18, "text": "It is mostly harmless. It was interesting, in a positive way, to watch a film where Seth Rogen is restrained and does not resort to vulgarity. But, American Pickle could have been so much better if the fish out of the tank premise was explored a little further and if it was a little less politically correct. As it is, American Pickle is as bland and generic as cucumber pickle without spices and herbs."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I am baffled by how many people dislike this movie. It deserves at least a 7. It's a brilliant script from Simon Rich (the writer behind Miracle Workers), brilliantly acted by Seth Rogen. It made me laugh; it made me tear up; it got me thinking on multiple levels. It's an over-the-top feud movie in the vein of Tin Men; it's also a clever satire with heart. Yes, the plot is absurd, but it's a satire! That's the point. If you liked Tin Men and/or Miracle Workers, if you were raised Jewish or with any other religion, if you had immigrant parents, if you like satire, if you simply enjoy thinking and watching intelligent films...you will like this movie. If you just want a dumb comedy, you won't."}, {"id": 20, "text": "This eminently pleasant film is about the premium importance good family relationships play in a healthy life. It is sort of told as a lightly comedic fable based on the Rip van Winkle/Futurama premise of a man finding himself displaced in time and culture. From the negative reviews and sub-6 rating, I expected to watch 15 minutes and consign it to the wastebasket of unfinished films, but it kept me entertained throughout and had the added pleasure of having a sweet resolution."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Not much going on here. Your typical romcom this time between great great grandfather and great great grandson. Low on the laugh scale for Rogan. If you pass on it you wouldn't be missing much."}, {"id": 22, "text": "This had the opportunity to be really good. The idea was intriguing but unlike the pickles it had no zest and only the bad after taste of garbage and rain water."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Nice movie. I was a bit unsure of the current 5.8 rating here on IMDB, but glad I did the dice-roll and gave it a shot. It was well worth the time because It made me laugh more than Good Boys."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Seth Rogen could not deliver what is expected from him .

Funny and a simple story. I would say give it a chance."}, {"id": 26, "text": "More like utter rubbish..... premise was good. Execution was awful. Not at all funny. Tried to take itself seriously....a very boring film."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Lazy writing, lack of creativity, boring movie. they're just pushing them out these days,.. terrible movie."}, {"id": 28, "text": "This is one of the most amazing moving movies I have ever seen. The outlandish plot is part of it and it is able to get over itself perfectly and tell a beautiful and hilarious story about family, religion, forgiveness and the climate of America. Seth Rogen's performance as Hershel Greenbaulm is his best acting work I've seen."}, {"id": 29, "text": "Couldn't really get into it, its just too much Rogen. He's funny but not 90 minutes funny."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Not what I expected. Good that I ignored the ratings and gave it a chance. The premise is obvious, but Seth Rogen gives an understated performance. Definitely try."}, {"id": 31, "text": "The movie sets off with a really distinguished and intriguing look at the 1920s which I very much liked, but then transcends into a somewhat-basic new age comedy with the cliche fish out of water storyline. It does manage to get in a few laughs and sets a nice heart-warming message about family."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Having read most of Simon Rich's work, I must say Sell Out was one of his best stories in my opinion. The movie changes quite a bit from the book, cut's out the main character's girlfiend, and focuses much more heavily on the bonds of family. They create a much clearer arch for Ben's character, than Simon in the book. The opening of the film set up the scenario quite nicely. The film is much more political than the book, and sympathetic to the modern generation. In some ways this leads to some positive changes to the story, I do miss Herchell's awe at Simon's lazyness in the book, and I think making Ben a hard working entrepenuer undermines Herschell being able to show Ben how much he takes modern technology and convenience for granted. The movie also makes it seem like things just come easy to Herschell, and you don't see him working hard in the movie, nearly as much as he works in the book. Overall I like this version of the story, it has more heart, but it does weaken the criticism of the modern generation that the book so hilariously gives."}, {"id": 33, "text": "If you want to watch a movie starring Seth Rogen where he doesn't smoke weed and is really enjoyable and somewhat funny, this is the movie for you."}, {"id": 34, "text": "I'm a big Seth Rogen fan. But I am surprised that he did this film. Lots of Jewish stereotypes in the film...the worst being when our hero, the pickled hero, earns a fortune by enslaving interns so all the money goes into his pockets instead of paying the very young workers. The problem is It. Is. Not. Funny. The film gets so bogged down in sentimentality that all satire is lost. Great lead(s). Fun idea. Bad Script. Sad, by the end, we all hated it."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Such a good movie. Great storyline and sooooo funny."}, {"id": 36, "text": "This is a really awful movie with absolutely no point to the story. It was advertised as a comedy ??? Where are the jokes at ?? Granted there are some very lame and bad jokes in it. It does not even have a decent sci-fi edge to it. So it is not a comedy, not a sci-fi , not a fantasy flick, guess that leaves it to be a drama and a really boring one at that. As a matter of fact there is NO DRAMA in this movie either."}, {"id": 37, "text": "The story is really cool. The film is light hearted which is nice. Easy to watch movie with A short run time so you don't feel like you have to get too heavily invested. While it's still a comedy this is a different vibe for Seth Rogen, it's really nice to see a different side of him in the film."}, {"id": 38, "text": "Unfortunately the movie fell flat. I thought Seth did a decent job of acting. Not always believable though. At times I found myself it's just Seth speaking with a heavy accent rather than a character.I did not find any humor in the dialogue, the supporting cast, or interaction with Seth and Seth. It feels that his humor is best with his normal supporting cast. James Franco, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and of course McBride.A comedy that doesn't standout gets a poor score. Plain and simple."}, {"id": 39, "text": "A spark of genius in this movie would be an over statement. Rogen, arguably one of my favourite creative minds missed an opportunity to have fun with a old plot.The concept is stolen (poorly) from the 1967 tv series The Second Hundred Years starred Monte Markham in a dual role as grandfather and grandson. There is nothing new or interesting in Rogen's take on the subject. To a 10 year old boy The Second Hundred Years was funny and enjoyable, this movie is not kid friendly and will adults to tears with its boring presentation"}, {"id": 40, "text": "First review as i felt the need to warn others. do not waste your time on this movie!

The liberty to chose the fair perspective, from nice comedy, clash between generation, best performance of Seth Rogen, decent descending in Jew tradition, sentimental portrait of a life face to new challenges, the life lesson, the nostalgia about lost worlds and irony about present one, the old influence of Hibernatus by Edouard Molinaro .

While most of the movies about accidental forward time travel gives us comical characters that seem not to have a sound mind or common sense, this movie does not do that. It gives us two flawed human beings. Flawed, but human. The only reason I did not give this movie a honorary 10 is that movies really need to stop painting Eastern Europe as a big gypsy village. Come on, learn some history, and google up how Easter Europe looks before making a dumb scene in a movie. Yes, there are slums, but there's those in all parts of world.

In a world where we're all about cancel culture; An American Pickle couldn't arrive at a better time.

Aside form the silly idea of a human being being pickled and living for 100 years to emerge totally healthy, the legalities make no sense. He would never be fined $12k for having a pickle cart, he would not be an illegal alien since he came to the US legally and would literally be the longest living person in the US. Going to Canada would just make him an illegal alien in Canada. A prosecutor can't call for a defense's case to be dropped since the defense has no case bought. There would be a ton of ways to prove who you are in court, from DNA to just knowing your bank passwords, and in his case answering any questions about history a 140 year old pickled guy would not know. Any strip mall lawyer would have gotten him off.And how does an illiterate Russian speaking peasant speak perfect English, let alone understanding modern slang which Ben uses constantly?

Besides Seth Rogen's charm, good music with an even better score, and some funny moments, there wasn't much else to like here. The story being told was odd, but the movie never fully embraced that. Instead, it went for a predictable and clich\u00e9 story with very few memorable moments. The plot was thin, the character motivations stupid, and the humour unfunny. The movie was only 90 minutes long, but it felt much longer than that.

I'm gonna be very sort here, but it starts pretty well, it's weird, but mostly funny, and the whole thing of the guy been from 100 years in the past is a clever concept, but the thing is, they don't explore it very much after the first half of the movie. Some of the jokes start to fall flat mid-way through it, and... it kind of transforms itself into a weird movie about... selling pickles?

His only successor in present-day is his great-grandson, Ben Greenbaum, who meets Herschel. Herschel doesn't understand Ben's lifestyle, and Ben is quick to dismiss any advice given to him by his great-grandfather. 'An American Pickle' explores the family dynamics of different generations of the same family, and while not the balls-out comedy we are used to seeing from Rogan, is a charming and entertaining watch from start to finish.Both Herschel and Ben are played by Seth Rogan, who leads this adaptation of the book Sell out by Simon Rich impressively. I enjoyed watching Rogan play both a serious role as well as the fish out of water role which is both endearing and impressive to watch. The technical achievements of playing against your own character in the same scene are always magical to behold. Ever since Lindsey Lohan's 'The Parent Trap', to Paul Rudd's Netflix series 'Living With Myself', I never get tired of the camera trick that is used in a unique way in playing with the idea that your ancestors and you look alike.I've always had an interest in family genealogical work. Tracing your roots back to where you came from eventually leads to the question; If they saw me today, what would they think? What An American Pickle' does by exploring this concept as well as how would the modern-day world reacts to someone from a different time is incredibly topical. How would someone who never grew up with technology, social media, or even modern-day health regulations, learn to survive in the 21st century?The weaker moments in 'An American Pickle' are where the film goes against it's set rules for the world you are in. In some moments it seems incredibly topical and accurate to the world we are in with consequences for actions. But when it serves the story progression forward, those rules no longer apply to the characters which kind of underminds the films established guidelines. While Rogan's performance is very impressive, there isn't a lot of characters other than Rogan's that maybe could've been interesting to explore in a b plot.Overall, I had fun watching An American Pickle.

It is built on silly slapstick instead of Seth's usual variety of anatomy and fart jokes.And the acting is incredibly skilled (for a Seth Rogan piece).The only frustration I had with the movie is the weak representation of gender roles. One of the messages involves wifehood and the fish-out-of-water character's narrow view of women's' roles. The writing shows how off base he is but does not demonstrate any more refined examples for the 21st century. Most of the good representation is reserved for same-sex relationships. But these are a little too overwhelming. There should be a good spot between under-representation and blatant over-representation.Don't be afraid of this film. It's not the usual Seth Rogan fare.

It's a Rogan film though, so of course it's silly, with Herschel Greenbaum (Rogan) playfully narrating, seeing him and his wife, with all her own teeth, head to America. If it continued in this vein, I might be onboard, but... well it's not going to is it. No, Herschel falls in a vat in a pickle factory and is inexplicably pickled, only to be discovered and reanimated 100 years later in modern Brooklyn. Oh dear. Herschel is alone in a scary new world, full of crazy new adventures. He's accompanied in these by his great great grandson Ben, also played by Rogan (sans beard). I don't really like Rogan. Two of him at once is a bit much. Herschel gets to experience Alexa, cabs, fizzy water. None of it is remotely funny. There's a mildly interesting thread about how Judaism differs for different people and the relevance of religion in modern culture, but I'm projecting really, trying to find some worth. Anyway, for Herschel religion is his world. For Ben, well he couldn't care less. After oh I don't know, a day or two, they fall out. Partly over Ben's lack of faith, partly due to Herschel ruining Ben's none existent app developing career. Herschel sets up a pickling business, obviously and becomes internet famous thanks to a load of hipsters in Williamsburg. This pisses Ben off and... oh dear god what the hell am I watching.

How the new school wants to point the finger and accuse the old school of its plain to see out dated mode of thinking- but no one else sees it until it's revealed by the the new school. Wreaking havoc and financial demise on the old school. And the story basically follows this line until it's revealed to the old school that the new school actually perpetrated all of this on him.

The new school recognizes that the old school still has something to offer what the new school is lacking- work ethic.

An American Pickle is the very first original film released by the respective service, and it gives the opportunity to Brandon Trost (solo directorial debut) and Simon Rich (feature film screenplay debut) to demonstrate their talents. Despite my curiosity about what they could offer, my eyes were obviously focused on Seth Rogen's double performance. Even though he's not the greatest living actor, I always enjoy his comedic roles, most recently in Long Shot and The Lion King. Possessing a premise with tremendous potential to deliver amazing laughs, how did it go?Well, I'm surprised by how grounded and realistic Trost and Rich's approach ends up being. In the first twenty minutes, everything points to a straight-up ridiculous story where the most absurd things occur. Basically, I love every single thing until the title card shows up plus a few more minutes. Herschel's life goals, his relationship with her lover, what leads to him getting brined for a century, the (technically brilliant) scientific justification that they give after he's found out to be alive and that he didn't age a day... Everything is ludicrous, but what would you expect from the already crazy premise?Never forget: having the wrong expectations (unrealistic, overhyped, nonsensical) can quickly turn your experience into a nightmare. An American Pickle has an absurd narrative because it develops an absurd concept. That's what's so incredibly entertaining about it: the possibilities are infinite as long as the people at the helm are creative enough. This is why I feel somewhat disappointed that primarily Rich couldn't take this story even further, both character and story-wise. In fact, as soon as the end credits started to roll, my first thought was is it over already?Throughout the whole runtime, the viewers have to deal with only two characters who aren't deeply explored. Herschel is a man out of his time, but with his impressive determination and hard-working personality, he seems to surpass every challenge thrown at him. On the other hand, Ben struggles to get his product/idea on the market, but he doesn't seem to have the same will that his great grandfather holds. Therefore, the whole narrative is stuck on a loop of Herschel doing things right, and Ben getting jealous over it and trying to mess with his success. Each reiteration becomes less funny, less entertaining, and less plausible (I can accept most plot points, but some are indeed way too nonsensical for the world it finds itself in).Obviously, the comedy bits are almost all linked to Herschel and, as expected, to his dated cultural knowledge. It's a matter of time until he says something he shouldn't, mostly stuff related to his views on religion, racism, and every sensitive subject you can think of. Some viewers might even get offended by a couple of jokes, which are precisely the ones I laughed at the hardest. Unfortunately, Rich's screenplay doesn't have the imagination a premise like this demands (too focused on stereotypes and easy jokes), but having in mind this is his first writing role in a feature film, it's a good start. Trost does a pretty decent job, especially when it comes to film two characters interpreted by the same actor, so I wouldn't mind seeing these two working together again.Nevertheless, it all comes down to Rogen's double performance, and he nailed it. He's the main reason why I'm giving this movie a positive review. He's able to dive into these characters in such a compelling manner that, at some points, I genuinely thought this film was written and directed by him. It feels like a personal project, something that I can easily picture as a Seth Rogen's movie. He's hilarious when he needs to be, and extremely serious when the time calls for it. Finally, I don't look at this film as a comedy because ultimately I don't even think it is. It's strangely a sweet story about family and why it should matter so much to every single one of us.All in all, An American Pickle surprisingly takes a grounded approach on the man out of his time concept, making the whole message about family, even though its premise is absolutely bonkers. The first act sets up a logically ridiculous yet hilarious story that unfortunately doesn't quite reach its potential. Debutants Brandon Trost and Simon Rich do a reasonable job with the narrative, but Rich could have explored the main characters a bit more, having to ultimately thank Seth Rogen for such a fantastic double performance. The style of humor present in the movie will not work for everyone, but it definitely did for me, even though it lost steam throughout the runtime. Its comedy is at its best when it tackles the dated cultural restrictions in Herschel's mind. It's a short, fast-paced story, with a neat score by Nami Melumad (Michael Giacchino wrote the themes), that anyone can enjoy just as long as they have the right expectations.Rating: B-"}, {"id": 191, "text": "Everythiing in america is big, the slogan has flashed over us for nearly 200 years, and this pickeled time traveller really grasps the big apple head on.its a witty, and actually quite funny look at how the american world have changed for a methusaleh aged eastern jew, they have made great vfx and done a pretty good research on product development, i remember the first time i used the seltzer water machine myself , a prototype soda stream 1980 model, and how my finger and body waited for the snarling stuttering puffs when the machine hgad done it ready, shock and awe, made in america.its pretty well acted, the jokes hangs really loose, the irony at its best and the opening section really shuffles the way open into maybe the comedy of the year.the grumpy old man, not a seth rogen fan usually, opens up his doors for more of this neolittic fus farsing. its well worth a watch. a recommend"}, {"id": 192, "text": "'An American Pickle' is one good HBO Max original movie to watch from Seth Rogen, the star and producer of 'The Disaster Artist', '50/50', and 'The Night Before'.The movie is an adaptation of a 2013 short story, 'Sell Out'.The story is about a Ashkenzai laborer, Herschel Greenbaum (played by Seth Rogen) who fell into a vat of pickles and is bribed for 100 years.

The meat of the movie follows his interactions with his great grandson Ben, who's been caught up working on an idea for an app for five years. Hershel gets himself back into the pickling business and causes a stir on the streets of New York City almost overnight, and a rivalry between the two men bubbles to the surface. If this movie is really about anything, it's about family and grief. Ben still hides in the shadow of his grief for his parents who died in a car crash, while Hershel's main aim in the movie is to restore his family graveyard plot so he can properly pay his respects to his wife. Tied into this is how the dead are respected in Judaism, and how Ben's more modern approaches to his religion have taken by the wayside, much to his great grandfather's disappointment. These are all meaty themes to tackle, but An American Pickle gets distracted by other things it wants to say, like the dangers of social media as the modern-day mob rule, and the kind of people that use it as a mouthpiece. But what An American Pickle really struggles with is deciding whether it wants to lean into the inherent silliness of the concept and go all-in on the comedy, or whether it wants to be more serious and sentimental, focussing on the emotional drama between two men from different times. Rather than making a decision, it toes the line in the middle, never truly committing one way or the other, and thus both sides suffer for it. There's some great moments for humour throughout, but the movie only really makes the most of it in the first act, such as the scientists explaining how he was pickled making perfect logical sense. There's of course some great moments of drama as well, particularly in the third act, as Ben confronts his latent Judaism and makes peace with his parents death once and for all, and finding worthy family in Hershel. But the second act is where things completely fall apart. The rivalry between the two men just doesn't feel right. Ben comes off as unnecessarily cruel, while Hershel rides a rollercoaster of acceptance and rejection by the general public. Its inherent themes of family and grief disappear almost entirely, the interactions between Ben and Hershel are reduced to basically nothing, and the comedy value takes a nosedive by the worst offence of just not being all that funny. It's an entire act of padding, to ensure it can meet the ninety minute runtime. To make matters worse, Seth Rogen is at his best playing off other actors, but here he just plays off against himself, and half hour of just Seth Rogen is too much. This movie needed a side-character, or some sub-plots, to keep it interesting.The movie's best moments are, without a doubt, the opening montage back in 1919, filmed in an old-timey aspect ratio, muted colour pallet, and some pretty cool painted backdrops that gives these sequences their own visual identity above and beyond what you'd expect from a movie of this calibre. The relationship between Hershel and Sarah is beautiful, and I'd definitely clock in for more of that. Once he awakens and meets Ben we get some great fish-out-of-water moments, and again I would have loved to have seen more of these moments. An entire movie of this would've kept me more entertained.Yeah, I'll say it, An American Pickle was a little disappointing. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, and there's still plenty of laughs and sentimentality bumbling around for it to hit most of its goals. I was never particularly bored or turned off, and in fact I almost felt the movie ended too early. But I don't have much inclination to go back and watch it again. Ever. There's no hook.

Seth Rogen has never been taken seriously because of his roles, but in An American Pickle, he gives one of his best performances so far.Surprisingly, An American Pickle doesn't have that much comedy. Yes, there are funny bits, but a good 95% of the runtime was just about the story. So, if you don't like Seth Rogen comedies or comedies in general, you might enjoy An American Pickle. The pacing was also really good too. An American Pickle is just 1.5 hours long, and it never got boring; honestly, the time really flew by. With all the good, An American Pickles does have its issues. The second and third acts weren't nearly as good when compared to the first act. If An American Pickle was more consistent with its acts, then it would've been a solid 7/10, or even 8/10.The characters were really likable, especially Herschel Greenbaum. What I love so much about An American Pickle was how it didn't go for the cliches. In Hollywood, when a character gets introduced into an entirely new world, they act mesmerized and blame it on magic or something goofy like that. Fortunately, An American Pickle doesn't do that with Herschel.If you like Seth Rogen comedies, or just comedy, An American Pickle is worth a watch.

Seth does a great job playing both characters and is fair at being earnist and his characterization of his own great grandfather is amusing and non-offensive but in the end one dimensionalI much prefer Pineapple Express, This is the End, and even The Interview over this movie, but if you've seen those recently and just want to turn your brain off with some Rogen this movie will do just fine.

Though probably better suited to the smaller screen and, maybe because I was just happy to be out of the house, I found to be a decent enough experience.Herschel Greenbaum (Seth Rogan) accidentally falls into an industrial pickle vat at literally the moment the factory is condemned and sealed up. Awoken 100 years later, Hershel must come to terms with the death of his wife and son whilst trying to start a new life alongside his great grandson Ben Greenbaum (Seth Rogan) and the strange conceptions of the 21st century.When I say that it might be better suited to the smaller screen, it's because An American Pickle isn't the broad 'stranger-in-town' comedy that it might have been. It's a much more quirky affair than that, and offers more in terms of . . . well, not quite drama . . . pathos maybe, than you might anticipate. Both the Greenbaum's end up having to deal with the deaths in their lives and the role that Judaism plays. Both of them have good and bad traits too, so it's not a case of an obvious wide eyed innocent vs. cynical modern villain, although there are some moments of that.There are a few laughs along the way, Rogan is great in both roles and the way the doubling is done is decent enough that there are only a couple of times you can tell it's someone else. There are plenty of digs at modern life, artisanal culture, about the role personal opinions have on business opportunities. It just doesn't amount to very much, it's not quite funny enough to justify a trip to the cinema (or at least it wouldn't be in normal times). It's definitely worth a chance though, when you can see it at home."}, {"id": 197, "text": "An American Pickle had some entertaining moments, but it also had some major issues that stop me from recommending the film. Granted, maybe I'm looking a bit too much into things for a Seth Rogen comedy, but I would have a least appreciated some of these issues to be cleared up a little.There was an absurd amount of coincidence towards the beginning of the film. I understand that coincidence is an essential part of some story-telling, but An American Pickle contained one convenient plot-point after another.They also didn't do a very good job of explaining how Herschel managed to survive for an entire century inside the pickle brine. They mentioned that it preserved him, but nothing more than that. It's very unbelievable as it is, but Herschel wouldn't have been able to survive without food or drink. He also didn't have a problem walking after getting out of the vat, which I didn't buy.Again, I'm probably looking way too much into all of this, but it took me out of the film. There are also too many silly moments. Silliness is to be expected in a Seth Rogen film, but these moments slanted more towards slapstick than humourous and I wasn't a fan.The screenplay on the whole wasn't great, but it could have been worse. There were some genuinely comedic moments, although they were few and far between, and I actually really liked the fish out of water elements where Herschel was trying to learn how to cope in this day and age.The narrative wasn't particularly compelling, but it was never boring and so that was a major positive. If a film's boring, I feel like my time has been completely wasted. Whilst An American Pickle had some major problems and it's on the verge of being a bad film, I was entertained throughout and that's why my score is going as high as it is.The editing, pacing, cinematography, and musical score were all adequate. Nothing special, but far from bad. It's just a shame about the negatives that I mentioned, because An American Pickle could have been a really good film.It has the structure to be something more, and there were some elements which I really enjoyed, but it's tough to recommend it. If you're in the mood for a silly film to stick on in the background, you can do a lot worse that An American Pickle.

The scenes in the ghetto are slightly awkward, since Sacha Baron Cohen's exploitations, but no cynicism here. Somewhere in the middle developments become a little predicable, and it is a pity that a big plot movement, speeding up the scenario (no spoilers here) happens so late in the film. Some things I didn't get: how can Ben survive for 5 years in New York on no income? How can a 19th centuty man fly to Schlupsk without assistance?

It is more of a drama with funny moments. For all its faults, at least it is technically competent. The cinematography and special effects are surprisingly well done. It is not necessarily nice or visually interesting, but there is a lot of visual variety and it supports the story well. The acting is good as well. Not necessarily that Seth Rogen gives a great performance, but he plays these characters sufficiently far away from his own persona that it is nice to see and enjoyable.Yet, this movie left me with a bad taste. So what is the problem?The problem of the film is not the humour, the visuals, or even the acting; it is the story. The story on the surface is how an isolated hipster living in Brooklyn comes at peace with the death of his parents and the loneliness of his life thanks to the intrusion of his anachronistic relative in his life. Most of the movie is showing how Herschel upsets the life of Ben by applying his last-century logic to the modern world.My problem is not that the plot is razor thin and relies on cheap characterisation of modern society. My issue is that by doing this the movie paints a worldview that is ultimately very alt-right. At the end of the day, this movie presents us with a far-right might makes right mindset and does nothing to challenge it. Presenting him as a sympathetic character, Herschel's attitude and actions are validated by the movie.The movie shows that: sanitary and labour regulations are bad, hipsters are na\u00efve imbeciles, aspiring to a socially responsible business is hypocritical, freedom of speech is a fallacy, conservative religious views are the only thing defining your identity so you can only be yourself and become realized if you embrace them. The movie hints at being about Jewish identity, yet it has nothing to say about it. Ben gets saved by the brotherhood of Judaism, and it offers an explanation of why religious community might have been important in Tsarist Russia. But, in the context of the movie it is mainly the reason of his demise. Ben's American Dream is destroyed by Herschel's attitude, which culminates with his intolerance.Of course, I am being willingly unfair. Of course, the movie did not intend to have a political message. The movie is a lazy drama with Seth Rogen. Yet, the point is that by not being accurate, the movie lends itself to promote this worldview. Granted it is the worldview of the past century, but it blends worryingly well with modern political discourse.The movie needed to rebuke Herschel's worldview. At least, it needed to balance it out with something else, for instance slapstick humour. As it stands, the movie's tone is somewhat austere and serious in a way that does not allow for the kind of levity that would dilute the message. The movie's humour is not only very dry, but it is secondary to the family drama. The movie tells the story of Ben grieving his dead parents, peppered with jokes and funny situations that inadvertently support right-wing ideology."}, {"id": 201, "text": "HBO Max's (low key production) ridiculous dramedy An American Pickle is Seth Rogen's most Jewish film by far and the type of movie that will probably appeal more so to Jewish viewers than a rest of audience. His character, Herschel is a religious and family-rooted man just trying to make an honest living and bring pride to his family. 100 years ago, this was seen as the typical American, but in today so called modern age some might consider this character offensive or outdated. An American Pickle might not be to everyone's taste, my wife liked it (because it is different), I didn't. To conclude, for me, it was a disappointing way to kill some time during 2020 pandemic. Film didn't produce the laughs I was expected, no matter it's one of the safest PG-13 rating ever for a Seth Rogen-produced comedy. Basically, movie is just decent-enough dramedy endeavor in which comedy works occasionally. A whole film of just Herschel adjusting to modern gentrified Brooklyn and Herschel grandson not understanding anything about his own background would've been a far funnier movie.Rating: 6-"}, {"id": 202, "text": "First of all let me say to just ignore the bad reviews. These people are obviously reviewing poorly for a one of a few reasons: They were expecting the typical late night seth rogan comedy and do not have the mind for something more refined, they are easily bored, they are not intellictual and do not appreciate art, or perhaps all of them.This movie is practically a masterpiece. It is in fact laugh out loud funny. And there is something funny in every scene. Not only that but it is amazing story telling. The writing is very good. And it is an intelligent and refined comedy that is extremely meaningful. It is not just about the laughs it causes, but the messages. This is a movie that is more wholesome, and is about family values and the importance of family. It is about the changing times and how different the world is today than it was 4 generations ago (it has changed more in the past 100 years than it did in the thousands of years prior), and just what the culture shock would be like if someone came from 100 years ago to today. It is about entrepreneurship and being a self starter and using business to give your life purpose and pursue something important to you. It is also about how in spite of the fact that most people these days do not feel like religion is relevant anymore, there is still a need for spirituality or at least some sort of meaning in life beyond the superficiality of the mundane world, and especially to help us with things such as grieving over the loss of loved ones or falling on hard times.So you are probably wondering, with such great wholesome meaningful messages, how could there be such bad reviews? Yes, as I said, those people are obviously extremely vapid. This movie is a very great film. It is not only meaningful, but it is clever and funny. It is well written, well acted, well directed, well produced, and all around well done. Here is a movie that is not only extremely entertaining but extremely thoughtful and touching. This not only made me laugh out loud a real lot, but it made me tear up at the end too. And it touched me so profoundly that it left me thinking about it for weeks afterwards. I kept on playing parts of it in my head that I found inspiring. I found myself wanting to make pickles (which I did by the way, and was awesome), and listen to the music from the movie. Until eventually I had to just watch the whole thing over again not much more than a month after seeing it the first time (and I rarely ever watch a movie over again, and if I do it would have to be only after a long time, like a year or two at least).I'm telling you that this is a great american film. One of the cinematic works of art of the modern era. I hope you watch it and will appreciate the fine points.

But still, this being a movie that I hadn't already seen, and I was given the chance, I ended up sitting down to watch it.I will say that An American Pickle was actually an entertaining and enjoyable enough movie for what it turned out to be. Sure, this movie was by no account groundbreaking or particularly innovative, but it definitely did have its moments. And I will say that Seth Rogen was actually good in his two roles in the movie.The storyline was adequate, and it definitely had some interesting aspects to it. I just feel, however, that the entire movie was too shallow. It just felt like writer Simon Rich didn't really delve into the full potential that was readily available with the script and storyline. So the movie came off as being sort of half-hearted most of the times. There were so much potential for delving deeper into many things and exploring them further.I am rating An American Pickle a six out of ten stars. It was watchable sure, but it just wasn't an outstanding or particularly memorable movie ultimately. Nor do I think that this is actually a movie that I will be watching a second time ever."}, {"id": 204, "text": "A toned down version of Seth Rogan, which is not a bad thing. Rogan of course plays both the main characters, one from 1919, and the other in the present.This is not a mindless raunchy film, but instead tries to look at how different our society and culture has changed in the last 100 years. Organized religion is almost a thing of the past, and other traditions and values have seem to have been tossed to the wayside. It helps us remember some things that are actually worth our attention, such as family. As I was watching I thought that it had similarities to 'Being There' with Peter Sellers, especially during the TV interview. If you've seen 'Being There' you'll know what I mean; two people that are getting huge public attention without actually knowing what's going on.I had some slight issues, not with the story but just with the overall realism. Being from Canada, as I know Rogan is as well, I would expect that just because they hike to the Canadian border it does not become a winter wonderland in a 10 mile span (it was fall weather when they started hiking). Also, when present day Rogan gets deported because he is accused of being pickled Rogan. They were both arrested and it was noted that he now had a criminal record. Your fingerprints are taken when you are criminally charged and if there was any question with identity this would be checked. Although, we are talking about a movie where a guy is brined and perfectly preserved for 100 years after all, so I suppose I can forgive the minor details.It has its comedic moments where I chuckled here and there, but it is by no means gut busting. It's mostly a light comedy with heartfelt moments."}, {"id": 205, "text": "An American Pickle is a comedy-drama film based on the short story Sell Out by Simon Rich. Starring Seth Rogen in a dual role, it's a quirky, sweet-natured tale about the importance family and traditional values with a nice touch of humour for good measure.In 1919, Jewish workers Herschel Greenbaum (Seth Rogen) and his wife Sarah (Sarah Snook) immigrate to the United States from Europe after their village is brutally pillaged by Russian Cossacks. Upon settling into their new lives in America, Herschel finds a job at a pickle factory in Brooklyn, where one day he accidentally falls into a large vat of pickle brine just as the factory is being permanently closed down. One hundred years later in 2019, Herschel wakes up perfectly preserved and unaged thanks to the brine and soon discovers he has one living relative named Ben (also Seth Rogen), his great-grandson who has an apartment right there in Brooklyn. Ben allows Herschel to stay with him as the latter tries to adjust to a brand new futuristic world much different from his own.By this stage, there have been a decent amount of stories that involve both time travel and a fish-out-of-water protagonist, with the animated sitcom Futurama and the 1992 film Forever Young perhaps being the best examples of this genre. Much of the entertainment value can be found in watching the main character growing accustomed to their startlingly new environment and the ways in which their older methods of thinking may not sit right with current trends. An American Pickle doesn't really break new ground in this regard due to its predictable outcome but its heart is certainly in the right place. Despite beginning as a typical foreigner working in a new land style of film, this all changes when our lead character Herschel meets Ben for the first time, which then turns it into a nice bonding story with a welcome amount of warmth. Each scene these two were interacting, I couldn't help but feel touched at seeing them grow closer to each other as they found comfort in their shortcomings throughout their lives, even though their plights are separated by many generations. This is quite unusual for a film starring the likes of Seth Rogen, as he is often cast in raunchy and often lowbrow comedies that only mean to make us laugh rather than offer any deep emotional connections. That's not to say this film doesn't have its fair share of humorous moments, although they are mainly lighthearted chuckles rather than belly laughs.Like with most works of this nature, we get a good juxtaposition of life from several years ago versus life today. The customs and core values that Herschel holds true to his character naturally yield mixed results when applied to the modern world of those who are constantly plugged into social media. This is especially noticeable with how politically divided America has become in recent years and how virtually everything you say or do can be uploaded for the whole internet to see. Thankfully, the film doesn't seem to pick sides as both conservatives and liberals are mocked for the extreme reactions some of them may have regarding how someone may simply be acting the way they were raised and aren't necessarily making a personal attack. Scenes like this are clearly played for laughs but I could definitely see that there is some kind of social commentary here on how some elderly people must feel when trying to cope with their beliefs now being questioned by the current generation.It's great fun to see Seth Rogen play these two different characters in the way that he does. Rogen is often typecast as the loveable chubby stoner in most of his movies so it's quite rare to see him show his dramatic side from time to time. As previously mentioned, this film marks something of a change from Rogen's usual style of comedy, as the humorous scenes here are relatively clean and dry, so much so that I'd just about say that this film could be viewed as one for the whole family to watch. He plays these polar opposite characters so well that I even found myself believing they actually were separate people at certain times. I hope Rogen ends up being cast in more dramatic roles in the future, as like with Adam Sandler, he can give a solid dramatic performance when given the right material.Overall, what the film lacks in surprise it more than makes up for with its emotional centre. This oddball story involving a man being preserved in pickle brine for a hundred years has such a kind-natured tone that it is easy to overlook most of its shortcomings. Like I said, hopefully Rogen will consider doing more movies in this style, because who knows, he might just convince the detractors who didn't believe he was capable in the first place. Not that I ever doubted him to begin with but even I have been won over by this shift in change.I rate it 7/10"}, {"id": 206, "text": "Released in America direct to streaming via the HBO max service, An American Pickle gives Seth Rogen the most his had to work with over the last few years in a dual role job that allows the funnyman to deliver one of his best singular performances in a film that would've benefited from a tighter focus and more belly laughs.With well and truly one of the years most outlandish premises, a Jewish immigrant awakens after years upon years of laying in a state of suspended reality due to being incarcerated into a vat of pickles only to discover his last living relative is a wannabe APP developer failure with no prospects or family, Pickle embraces its utterly over the top nature and allows Rogen to get his hands dirty as both the old school Herschel and the modern day Ben but there's never a feeling like we are watching a new comedy classic in the making.Directed by D.O.P by trade Brandon Trost in what acts as his feature debut, Pickle enlist's the help of screenwriter Simon Rich to bring his short story to life but in doing so you can sense the film struggled to find its real identity or vocal point as it wavers between drama, comedy and family centric tale with a sense that a more improvised or loose vibe would've helped the film that goes from depressing to bonkers often in the space of mere minutes of screentime.What at first appears to be a fish out of water tale and mismatched buddy affair gives way to a more scheming comedy as Herschel and Ben try to one up each other in a battle of wits and business smarts and while this at times provide Rogen with some great little moments, such as selling pickles on the sidewalks of New York or getting himself in trouble at public Q and A sessions, there's a sense that we are just watching a series of skits and ideas play out other than a fully formed plotline that would've helped elevate this quickfire affair to another level.One undoubted positive about this exercise that has its share of good little moments is the dual performance of its leading man.After a few so-so years in mostly forgettable exercises, Rogen is as good as his ever been in a leading role with his ability to neatly play off against himself as the brash Herschel and the more mild mannered Ben provides the film with many of its most enjoyable comedic moments.Final Say -A fun, forgettable and unfocused comedy that has a lot of nice ideas that never get time to play out the way you'd have hoped, An American Pickle is an enjoyable watch but one that won't stick in the memory for very long.3 unsanitary jars of pickles out of 5"}, {"id": 207, "text": "Seth Rogan is Herschel a Jewish gent who, along with his wife Sarah (Sarah Greenbaum) is forced from his home by Cossacks.

Anyway, the rats turn on him, he gets trapped inside a vat of his vinegary produce and 100 years pass. When he is finally released into his new world, he manages to track down his great-grandson Ben (also Rogan) and the two start down a pretty bumpy road. This is essentially a drama, at times quite poignant, about a man so far out of his comfort zone, but who has spirit and determination and a fair degree of humanity too. Sadly, once the joke was worn a bit thin (after 20 mins or so) the rest of it is all just a bit too fluffy; the plot twists truly implausible and though it does take a gentle swipe at political correctness and all things artisanal it's all just a bit predictable with a last half hour that is just plain daft. It isn't a terrible film, and fans of Roagn will probably appreciate it more, but for me it was a nice to watch 90 minutes that I don't see the need to watch again."}, {"id": 208, "text": "An American Pickle is a breath of fresh air - or rather, a jar of fresh pickles. Seth Rogen plays Herschel, a Jewish immigrant from 1919 who wakes up in 2019 after being preserved in a vat of pickles. He meets his only living relative Ben - also played by Rogen - but tensions rise and he attempts to launch an old-timey pickle empire, sparking an envious rivalry between differing eras. While the fish-out-of-water concept is done-to-death, I found the offbeat charm of Rogen's performances and the film's offbeat concept to be disarmingly quirky. It could've very easily had a villain, but the only kind of conflict we witness is a form of jealousy that we all recognize and that's enough to tailor effective drama. I feel the humor could've been stronger, though. I mostly found myself smirking, never laughing out loud. While Rogen proves to be an engaging actor when given the adequate material, he's definitely been funnier in many pictures before this one. However, I still recommend An American Pickle for its peculiar sweetness. It's got a simple but valuable message to chew on: Despite radical differences, family is family - appreciate it while you have it."}, {"id": 209, "text": "An American Pickle is a nice movie, light-hearted, with a few dramatic moments.

Jokes made me laugh, they are not offensive, even if sometimes can be subtle.Seth Rogan did something a little bit better than his average movie and I am happy to see him in this hybrid role, in the middle between comedy and drama and he managed to represent both sides pretty well.

Sure, he's the raunchy comedy guy with the trademark laugh that you either love or hate, but he's also proven capable of turning in an impressive dramatic and emotional performance. An American Pickle, although not a great film, definitely stands above some of Rogen's other works as a worthwhile dramatic performance peppered with affectionate comedy that really moves the heart, even if it may feel a bit too unrelatable for some.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: A Jewish immigrant from the early 1900s gets locked in a vat of pickle juice during a factory shut down where he is preserved for 100 years, awakening in modern day New York where he meets his great-great-grandson.Rogen plays both characters in this movie, the immigrant with a hilariously thick accent and extreme traditional family values, and his modern day descendent, a lonely app guru who has lost his family, his faith, and is on the brink of professional ruin. Rogen slips into both roles effortlessly, bringing a strong emotional arc to both characters. I mean, he's not getting any Academy Award for this, but for the type of dramedy this ultimately is, he surprises.The movie's plot sounds like a zany comedy, but at its core this is a movie with a profound message about the importance of family, faith, and overcoming loss to become stronger, better people.BUUUUUT.... THE MOVIE DRAGS: Without giving too much away, I'll just say that things don't always go smoothly between the two characters. They certainly have their differences which leads to a sort of war between the two with each trying to one-up the other. It's old vs new. Traditional vs modern. But this back-and-fourth between them gets old fast. Even when the competition slows down and you think they've both learned their lesson, it ramps up again.The movie has a fulfilling emotional climax with--like I said above--a profound and somewhat surprising message about family and faith, but the plot seems to fizzle out. There wasn't any kind of big event that made the ending memorable. It just sort of... ended... and that ending, unfortunately, because it's steeped in rich Jewish tradition and faith might go unappreciated by too many.I feel like there were other aspects of the strange family dynamic between the two characters that could've been explored, but the movie seems almost afraid--or maybe even oblivious--to tell the truly magnificent story that COULD be told. Don't be surprised if by the time the credits role you find yourself wondering about all the possibilities the movie wasted.Is this a must see? No. Is it funny and upbeat? Sure. Will you remember it once you brush the flavor of pickle juice out of your mouth? Probably not. But it's a great stepping stone for Seth Rogen and I look forward to seeing what he builds next."}, {"id": 211, "text": "An American Pickle gets a double dose of Rogen and doesn't go all the way with it. The film is a clean family watch that plays around the equation between a pickled-for-100 years great grandfather and a liberal, non-religious grandson in present-day New York. I liked the concept for its unlikelihoods - it attempts to shed some light on generation gap and how society, religion, and attitude towards life have changed in a timespan of 100 years. Herschel is a ditch-digging Jew in 1919 and Ben is a freelance app developer in 2019. When these two contrasting personas collide, what can happen?Well, to answer that simply, a number of laughs (the raunchiness of Rogen's R-rated films is completely absent here), some feel-good vibes, a few realizations, and some totally over-the-top Jewish-isms &amp; American-isms. When perceived in totality, I felt An American Pickle balances out its thematic lows with its comedic highs. We don't get a lot of scenes with the two Rogens together, but they play each other off superbly. When they're dealing with their individual lives, the fun quotient is a little less.While religion is satirized early on with a decent dose of circumstantial humor, in the end, the script turns on its head and uses (the nicer side of) religion to reunite the duo. It felt more like a 'Seth Rogen thing' than something universal. Maybe, that's the case with religion all over. Thankfully, the film doesn't take itself too seriously. It'd have done the film a tonne of good if Herschel's fish-out-of-water scenario had been explored beyond its uneven surface. Instead, it shifts focus to Ben's attempts to ruin Herschel's life - a stretch that doesn't fully deliver.It definitely isn't Rogen's most memorable comedic outing (more of a dramedy tbh), but An American Pickle holds up just fine as a comfortable one-time watch."}], "reviews_amount": 212}
