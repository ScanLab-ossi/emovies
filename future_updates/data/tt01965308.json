HIGHLY recommended!"}, {"id": 3, "text": "This is what the world needs to view.

We elect presidents and other leaders that are just, more or less, psychopaths and power seeking people! I sometimes think that most people are too blind to understand what is going on around them and in the world (maybe busy working, or they probably don't have enough all-embracing knowledge to understand what is really happening. Sadly). InterReflection gives, at least me, hope that more people will wake up from their wicked/disturbed sense of reality - and maybe, at least maybe start to wonder if we actually could go in the direction of making the world better. Far better! Hm, how many Trumps or Bidens (of any of those fools) will we elect before we finally wake up and realises that this isn't working anymore...InterReflection is very important, and at least for me, a masterpiece!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "I want to congratulate Peter Joseph on this film. He's done a fantastic job balancing heart and intellect. It covered everything that needed to be said in my opinion. So many good scenes I couldn't choose a favourite. Still trying to understand some of the symbolism but thats rather the point with avant garde style. Couple of scenes that jumped out for me were when the main character lost her job and when people were waiting for her to pick up the dollar bill. I suggest everyone sees this. I mean it, stop reading this and go and watch it. I recommend everyone try to share this film with as many people as possible. If he starts another crowd fund campaign for the sequel next year. I will gladly donate more towards it :)"}, {"id": 7, "text": "I'm not a film critic, but Interreflections was exactly the type of media that I wanted to pair with Peter Joseph's book, The New Human Rights Movement. If you are unfamiliar with the research associated with structural approaches to solving social &amp; economic issues, then this movie simply requires an open-mind.This movie is a creative and abstract representation of the train of thought presented by the book. It has powerful imagery and storytelling that allows the audience to connect on various levels throughout the movie.Personally, I enjoyed the quality of cinematography and screenwriting. I felt that the documentary interviews were an especially powerful way to enable us to interreflect on our society as it stands.Also, this movie has The Matrix &amp; Pink Floyd The Wall vibes."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This is self indulgent woo. The green screen cheapness never goes away. I dare say the guy who basically did this on his own, bit-off more than he could chew. Peter should do a little inner reflection himself (see what I did there?).Buying 10/10's is so obvious, why do people keep doing it, does it work? I guess it does, otherwise I wouldn't be telling you this movie blows chunks.Zero redeeming qualities, getting your hemorrhoids removed is more entertaining. No stars."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Its a masterpiece. I agree that the average Joe, wich is not familiar with Peter work, should wach it multiple times to understand it. But its probably the best movie, wich explains our current world (situation). This should be seen by everybody. Its an educational work of art. Hopefully it will open the eyes of the masses.

The three stories are made so well, a mix of sci-fi, documentary and art merged into one with such technique that reminded me of the great David Lynch. The crucial difference here is that you actually have an overview of the past, present and future of humankind and it is not just some imaginative story like most movies.The actors are brilliant, I liked how the movie stopped at some point and one of them asked for a break which brought us back to behind the scenes and gave us perspective of how difficult was to make this movie.Another good moment was when the other actor on the table was talking about the activist community and said movies will be made, then stopped and looked at the camera that actually made you feel part of the movie, which you are because what they are talking about is what is happening in real life, reality and movie mixed together.I loved the art scenes especially the one in the office, no dialogues needed you just watch it and everything comes together naturally. A pure form of high class art making.There is not one single weak spot in this movie, everything from start to finish was done astonishingly well and after all these years of waiting I can say it was all worth it.Hopefully there will be a sequel at some point, although I know how hard was to make this one by following the regular updates, but the end result is just one of a kind.Well done to everyone involved and keep it up!"}, {"id": 23, "text": "I would recommend the book over the film.

The way it was presented was too long, boring, artsy-fartsy and preachy. If I compare this to Sir David Attenborough's Witness Statement which also brought up habitat destruction, environmental pollution, species extinction, population explosion and other issues, it is like comparing a student project to a professional work of art. You could cut this 2 hour 45 minute long movie and make it into a 60 minute coherent documentary which would get the message much better across with a vastly improved signal to noise ratio. I wish there was a 60 minute director's cut without all the fluff."}, {"id": 25, "text": "This movie is grand... Why? Because it takes the innovative step needed to target the current abomination that is human society. It is a small but malevolent group of people, pulling the strings that control all of us, and anyone who speaks against it, becomes the target of this group. But now, in 2020, when this group has influenced so many over the years (by creating social discord through media, thereby allowing people to do their bidding and fight one another) we the 99.99% are waking in the millions to the deceit and propaganda.If you rubbish this movie, you work for the elite, without even knowing that you do.

A labor of love, every scene is crammed full of thought provoking information and social commentary, wrapped in a beautifully rendered visual celebration. This movie draws you in from the start, and takes you on a journey that at times makes you laugh, and cry, and challenges you on many different levels. I think there is something for everyone, but for those that expect 'more' from a film, you won't be disappointed. I have seen this film multiple times now and I gain more insight and notice new things with each viewing.

It comes across like 3 different films edited over the top of each other. A documentary from the future... the final act of a hacking/revolution movie... an abstract... 'thing' that doesn't go anywhere. The film raised $50K on IndieGogo (I donated, being a fan oof the ZEITGEIST films) I am a filmmaker (look me up) ... there is no reason whatsoever this should cost $50k OR take 6-years to put together though. It's mostly actors in front of a green screen with cheap FX added afterwards. Not $50K's worth. Trust me.

To the creators' credit, they appear to be aware of this.

There is a scene in this 'Movie' called 'off the rails' where a steam locomotive speeds towards a destroyed bridge. Well this serves as a good metaphor for what unfolds over almost 3 hours, an absolute train wreck of a 'film'.What a disappointment, I was really hoping that this would be a big step up from Mr. Joseph's previous work, the 2 documentaries 'Zeitgeist Addendum' &amp; 'Moving Forward' were intelligent, well researched &amp; extremely valid critiques of our present socio-econmic system &amp; the problems inherent in the free market capitalist system with the possibility of a transition in the future to a new system called a 'Resource Based/Natural law Economy'. All very commendable ideas &amp; something that I would hope the human species can aspire to in the future, allowing of course for many variables along the way.I also really enjoyed the book 'The New Human Rights Movement' that the film is supposedly based on but this in itself is odd as I would be hard pressed to envisage this highly academic &amp; intellectual treatise as the basis for an attempt to engage a more mainstream movie going audience &amp; to invite people to look more closely at our societal problems &amp; possible solutions. I would assume this was the writers aim for the movie &amp; this unfortunately is where it fails catastrophically.As one previous reviewer has mentioned, what audience is this movie actually aimed at?There were some good ideas in amongst the chaos which could have been developed into something coherent &amp; focused instead we get a number of talking head academics from the future basically reading out an audio book. A 'Sci-Fi' story so bad I thought someone had spiked my coffe with DMT &amp; I was having a really bad trip, the acting was so wooden &amp; bad that I thought they were doing it on purpose to freak me out. And then the 'Dreamscape' story of the character '23'. A long, drawn out exercise in self pitying nonsense, although the attempted 'Rap Track' at the Human Resources office was so embarrasingly bad it was hysterical.All in all I'm really disappointed I was hoping for so much more, it gives me no great pleasure to have to write this review but rather than getting caught up in the 'Cult of Personality' that seems to have worringly formed around Mr. Joseph I have to call this particular work for what it is, a massive step backward as already mentioned.Sorry Mr Joseph, in the time it's taken for you to make this movie the world has moved on, I would advise you to do the same."}, {"id": 48, "text": "Movie of the year here: If you enjoy Socio-cultural &amp; ecological discourse on structural change &amp; sustainability all wrapped up in a Avant-garde sci-fi/ documentary film.

Everyone should watch this, its intelligent, funny, thoughtprovoking and lovely."}, {"id": 50, "text": "Literally, there's no one else with more knowledge and as well spoken as Peter Joseph. Best in depth analysis of our current situation, the problems and possible solutions to the crisis that humanity is facing."}, {"id": 51, "text": "I knew I would enjoy this film before I even watched it. I have long had a bias towards any works that promote true structural change, such as this does. It has been, is, and will continue to be the most important message for humanity even as we take the slow, painful road towards the destruction of all life on this planet.Peter Joseph has given us this message before, in Moving Forward, sure. This film is simply doing so in a different way; clearly more artistic than straight documentary style. Peter Joseph is after all an artist, is he not?I think InterReflections demonstrates a continued evolution in his understanding of the problems we face. Beginning in 2007 with Zeitgeist: The Movie which he describes on the official website as a 'performance piece'; then Addendum and Moving Forward bringing more informed perspectives, appearing more like documentaries than the first film.My subjective understanding of Zeitgeist Trilogy today is that Peter was communicating his frustrations with the social structure with information current at that time and Addendum and Moving Forward over the following years showed how he was digging deeper and learning more. InterReflections is to me a return to being a 'performance piece' but with thirteen more years of knowledge, understanding and experience of living in an increasingly devolving political society.I have not given 10/10 because I agree with some other comments regarding audience; it is doubtful that a lot of people who really need to see films with this important message will likely not understand the abstract metaphors, the intellecual discussion; and there will most certainly be objections to statements such as 'there is only one race'. For this reason it is difficult to see who the intended audience for this film is, and trolls or not, poor reviews will occur because many people lack an ability to regard things outside of their own heads. It could take a few people who do 'get it', to provide explanations for several audiences to digest properly.I think that the human resources rap song was a little cringey. Although I find society to be cringeworthy most of the time so this makes InterReflections a very relevant social commentary for me. There are also parts to be noticed where Peter is clearly mocking himself and/or the idea of creating this project at all (anyone who listens to the Revolution Now! podcast might be able to infer what I mean when I say that).I love the humour, the mix of styles throughout, and the relevance to events that are happening today. The sci-fi/future element was my favourite aspect, now that I have thought more about it. Imagining how people would look back at this time of insanity is a useful exercise. In 100 years time we could be living the way they describe or we could be on a decayed planet, living out that slow painful death, which will we choose.InterReflections seems to be a challenge to humanity. A challenge to reflect on ourselves now. To question our behaviour, examine our identity crises, our understanding of complex ideas and the nuances that exist within these. This film might be a seminal piece for getting to a 'great transition' such as happens in the film. It won't do so alone and maybe it is a responsibilty for people who have liked it enough to give 10 stars to assist in getting this film understood by as many demographics as possible."}, {"id": 52, "text": "I'm so glad Peter Joseph committed to making this, worth every second!"}, {"id": 53, "text": "Probably the most important movie of recent times.

It's a movie that, in the words of Bill Hicks, takes a squeedgie to the third eye at a point in time when we face so many clear existential threats, not least rising inequality and the climate emergency. It's no surprise. Peter Joseph's past cinematic works, including the must watch Zeitgeist trilogy and the Culture in Decline series, take the viewer all the way down the rabbit hole and then some. His work penetrates the plank length of the contemporary human condition and InterReflections is no different. It's an incomparable opus dei of work for our times with InterReflections as the latest landmark on that journey but there's a very big chance you'll never have heard of Mr Joseph. He has been the catalyst for the Zeitgeist Movement, a global advocacy group that is still very much active, and simultaneously helped to propel Jacque Fresco's Venus Project into the 'relative' mainstream. InterReflections, released on October 6th 2020, could not be more relevant. As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to rage across the planet, revealing the inherent frailties of our political, social and economic systems and a US presidential race in full flow, InterReflections provides a perfect antidote to an era that is increasingly becoming bereft of hope. Three intertwining, interconnected stories, covering different eras, weave into a consistent narrative that not only provides an accurate and mind blowing analysis of our current malaise but offers a transitional scenario and a destination. Not utopia, but pragmatic design. This is a film that should be watched by all. End of. We need more of this type of stuff across all artistic mediums.

I will not talk about the plot, but film is full of references and quotes that is hard to remember, or even catch everything in one time viewing. Second reason for some people disliking this film is it's criticism of political and economic situation. I see some usual comments like  communist propaganda or utopia. Philosophy of the film has nothing to do with communism (which was mentioned in the film albeit in a negative context). Regarding utopia, system on the island at the end of film is fully possible today, from renewable energy, 3d printing, zero waste or direct democracy.

The movie makes very little attempt to fully highlight the ways these ideas that it throws out (which have long been discussed), have been countered and discredited, and to counter these arguments against them since it totally ignores them.Just as one simple example - the idea it presents of that island with the banks and interest, totally misses the point that the interest payments actually go somewhere, e.g. paying the bank's employees who are part of that island's economy etc, thus the monetary system is not at all inherently doomed to be burdened with ever increasing debt. This is indicative of the general level of intellectual argument+thought behind this movie - it tries to appear intelligent with fancy language, but generally simply presents such fallacious arguments.The debate part is somewhat interesting as it actually gives at least some attempt to provide some kind of acknowleding and addressing some arguments against the ideas ... however the lecturers' pontificating is all just very cringe, and then another half the movie is just meaningless wierdness which could much better be cut to reduce the movie length by easily an hour which would somewhat improve its value at least."}, {"id": 115, "text": "I just watch the film on Amazon and not only does it look fantastic for a low budget production, the symbolism is unique.

One character in the film is played as a professor and is quoted as saying Some things were considered external to this contrived competitive game they called business This clearly sounds way too much how Peter Joseph uniquely talks.The script was indigestible and felt like a course instead of a movie. There was literally no plot. I guess you can say there was a tiny storyline, but it was clouded out by over used jargon. It was very hard to keep my eyes on it for nearly 3 hours.The Good: The music was nice and fit the scenery of the film very well.I follow Peter Joseph's work, so I do find the topics in the film extremely importantThe Bad: No plot. Not a documentary. My guess is you can call it a MockumentaryActing is so bad. Like really bad. I can't knock the actors. Al Pacino himself wouldn't be able to give life to such a script.The special effects and color grading was bad and pretentious at best. Overblown soft tones and lumination was a bit nauseating.Conclusion: I gave the rating of this film a 2 and not a 1 because I felt that the film's topic is important. Capitalism is an extremely inefficient system. Although we have no other system better to replace it, we have elitist fans who defend Capitalism which ultimately impedes on any progress to our social condition.This film feels as though it's directed at Peter himself and those who agree heavily with the Zeitgeist Movement. If there was any attempt to bring further outreach to those outside this circle or provide an enjoyable movie, then this Film failed miserably.

Over the last few years since, I've become disenfranchised by the allure of the na\u00efve vision, though I still agree with developing an open source commons of resource sharing somehow.Interreflections, by contrast, is just one voice: Peter Joseph for 2 hours and 45 minutes. This whole confused film feels like one badly structured essay spoken by a few random actors to give the illusion of diverse voices, covering that fact that this is clearly a single minded ego train of one man. There were moments I enjoyed - I liked it when he made references to real research, especially when talking about inequality. And I kind of enjoyed some moments in the great debate. I must give credit to the incredible effort put into the special effects and obviously the huge amount of time and work put in to create this film. Overall, I didn't hate the film, but let's be clear, it was bad. It was jarring, slow and confusing. Almost the entire film was unstructured cynicism with the last 5 minutes for the solution - a city that magically appears out of nowhere and is loosely based on a resource based economy, though is incredibly shallow because there is literally only 5 minutes to briefly introduce a slice of utopia and even more na\u00efve than the Venus Project because this wonderful city just literally gets plopped into the ocean by some group of futuristic activists. I mean seriously. I thought this would be like a development from Moving Forward, but it was a serious step back. If Peter Joseph wants to stay relevant he needs to connect with the real world, not retreat further into cynicism and hide behind a totally shallow veil of utopia."}, {"id": 121, "text": "This is essentially a two hour and a half monologue in the voice of different actors intertwined with two different storylines. The first is some kind of sci-fi short story and the second consists of a series of expressionist metaphors intended to reinforce ideas conveyed by the monologue. Together the three components add up to the two hours and forty five minutes total duration of the footage.The main issue with the monologue itself is that it is purely ideological, meaning non-factual and poorly documented.The artistic insertions, on the other hand, happen to be hackneyed, predictable and poorly executed, whereas the short story end ups being a commercial pitch to raise funds for an utopian futuristic design project.All in all, the whole thing is pretty boring. The only reason I gave it five starts is because, if soporifeous, this thing remains an attemp for refocusing the debate on crucial issues."}, {"id": 122, "text": "With a limited budget (and limited lifespan) one can do only so much. When resources are finished, only thing that can be used as fuel is creativity. This film is wonderfully creative and unique, so much so that it seems as if you've entered Joseph playground.Keep in mind that this is Joseph first movie ever. All of his other works are documentaries and music videos. As a musician and maker of documentaries, he has done one hell of a job with this. It is not the same thing to do something basically alone (like Zeitgeist) or in synergy with tens of other people like in this movie and Joseph has approached it, in my opinion, wisely. You wont be a new Kubrick and if you try to approach a film meticulously, you will fail. However, you can approach a film, even if it's your first one, creatively. That is something no professor can teach you. Joseph has chosen to be creative and it has paid off.This is a movie that one should watch multiple times to understand. For a short attention spanned average Joe, I'm sure this piece will be a torture for eyes. But for anyone who wants food for thought, a movie that will actually stick with him, give him a lasting message, not just entertain him, this a movie to watch.If you want to be entertained, play yourself some Avengers. There are loads of high budget films for kids that will tell you nothing. But if you want an art piece, you are at the right place.At times, Interreflections felt a lot like Baraka and Samsara, At other times it just felt like watching into animated painting. It's full of symbols and hidden gems. It makes you feel at times like a child in a intellectual way, if that makes sense. This is a movie that professors could watch to relax, as opposed to other films whose relaxation come at the price of losing the sanity.For someone who has watched basically everything the man ever produced, it felt relaxing. I'm sure if Joseph used Interreflections script and made it into Zeitgeist 4 with his baritone voice, nobody would complain, it would get millions of views and then we continue buisness as usual, but I like seeing a man trying this different kind of approach. And I guess after almost 7 hours of talking into microphone about money and structual violence in his Zeitgeist trilogy, guy deserves to sit behind a camera a bit and let others do the talking. Joseph is probably tired of saying the same things over and over again so now he used art as a language. And with art you can say structural violence in billion different ways.Anyways, only problem with the movie was - I know, I know, Pete, you saw it coming, sit down - complete lack of mentioning Jacque. But its ok. Movie has only so much screen time, and mentioning Jacque would probably require to change a script a bit. After all, genre is fantasy.Peter Joseph is my favorite film maker.

I understood this new movie to be an artful expression of the Zeitgeist documentary series, but I was not impressed. Actually, somewhat disappointed. As an avid Zeitgeist movie and Peter Joseph presentation follower, no new points were made other than we are all one, although inferred in the Zeitgeist trilogy. I anticipated a movie demonstrating more detail of the problems associated with transitioning the world using a new Venus Project resource based economy, it did not but for a brief part at the end. It simply seemed to be an abbreviated visual supplementary for Peter Joseph's book for a human rights movement. The movie did not follow up to the Zeitgeist documentary series. It repeated the same points made in the Zeitgeist trilogy. I will not chastise the acting and green screen effects as I know Peter was on a limited budget, and it wasn't as bad as many B movies I have watched on Svengoolie. Some of the scenes were entertaining metaphors. However, the film droned on human rights points never detailing how the demise of the ponzi scheme world monetary economic system occurred as quickly depicted at the end of Zeitgeist: Moving Forward. I guess I will have to wait for Zeitgeist 4 to follow up. I will watch Interreflections again hopefully to get a better perspective of PJ's goals that I missed.

If you've seen his lectures/interviews like viable systems and improbable democracy on YT, then this covers most of that.This is not a movie you put on to be entertained. It's a movie you watch and listen closely, because the information is of vital importance to our survival as a species. Especially now, in our confused and divided society mired in conflict and inequality.The points raised and information given here is not really discussed at all on the left. And that's really ashame because Peter is a messenger. This is not his theories or something derived from his own anecdotal experiences. The left and any activist for human rights or advocate of social equality needs to see this. People on the Trump train or people on the right would probably dismiss this entirely. But this isn't for them.The movie isnt perfect of course. It's very heavy and dense. I watched it in two parts. Just a ton of information and pretty grim. It's the truth though.

It was the first time I'd seen, on screen, someone talking about subjects that others felt were too taboo to mention or too strange to consider. I remember that Einstein often got the same feedback, as well as Tesla and many others who developed works that seemed on the edge of simple understanding.A lot of people who don't like to think very much won't get his films. Which, unfortunately, is pretty sad and makes sense as to why the topic of the film hits home for those like myself. In a way, their dissent of the films are self-fulfilling prophecies.However, the one thing I do love about this latest film is that it pokes fun of itself, often commenting on what the non-target audience member may be saying to themselves. And in the words of many famous folks, if you can simply explain something then you completely understand it. Some of the scenes do just that. Others, however, take a deeper level of introspection.In the end, InterReflections takes a deep dive into the human condition, and explains it in digestible bites that allow one to see themselves in the characters, while exploring the possibilities of what could be.

It achieves this well, as a viewer, you really feel the ability to stand back, (something we don't often do) and see the entire picture, as the story is cleverly told from different perspectives, from the present, near and more distant future.I think it was very brave of Peter Joseph to create this, using this style, it is a blend of genres unlike anything you've seen before, and now having seen the film, I would have to say, it has paid off! The artistic approach to some of the scenes are insanely good, they feel nightmarishly dystopian, while keeping the viewer aware that these are the ugly sides to our current system, our current reality, and not from dystopian fiction. A powerful wake up call! It is very different in execution, to anything else out there, so some might not get it, for me though, it was beautifully made, its outrageous and down to earth at the same time, brave, and entertaining.Please do watch InterReflections, over 2 hours of escapism, and after you turn your telly off at the end, you'll never look at the world the same again!"}, {"id": 129, "text": "I am intimately familiar with the filmmaker, Peter Joseph.I know him, professionally, and personally.I enjoyed watching the Zeitgeist film series.While I have many reservations about the content of the three movies, they undoubtedly had a style to be recognized and appreciated. They had a clear tone and a direction.I had hopes for Joseph's latest creation, Interreflections, which has been in the making for almost a decade.While I may disagree with the man and his worldview, I can appreciate an artist's work independently.I tried watching Interreflections.I really did.It was quite literally the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.I've indulged B-movies, C-rated actors, and plain bad stuff. I can endure 10 minutes of something like sharknado every few years.No problem.But I couldn't watch this garbage for more than two minutes straight. I had to skip through to see if it got any better at some point.It didn't.The green screen is so unbelievably bad it makes everything feel fake beyond imagination.The acting is even worse.The plot is non-existent.I think the major problem of this film is that it can't decide what it is.Is it a documentary? Is it a fiction? A docu-fiction?There are scenes where there seems to be a genuine interview with a scientist. And yet, it's painfully obvious that those words did not come out naturally. They were scripted, and badly.The drama doesn't feel like one. If I wanted to explain to my students at a film school what terrible filmmaking is and why, I would show a scene from Interreflections, and have them analyze it.It'd be a great exercise.Interreflections is the perfect example of what you should not do as a filmmaker.It pretends to portray a new point of view, while it simply rehashes old ideologies, minus the insight or the wittiness.It wants to be a drama, but has no story and no structure.It tries to make you think and question authority, but all it does is provide a different kind of propaganda.Between the atrocious use of green screen, the terrible acting, and the condescending pandering of both the interviews and the plot, I could not follow anything for more than 60 seconds.I can't believe Joseph spent half a million and worked for 8 years on this garbage.There is a silver lining though.If I ever teach filmmaking techniques to my students, I will refer to this film as a step-by-step guide on what not to do."}, {"id": 130, "text": "This movie is long! I finished after 2 sittings and I have to say while I love traditional Sci Fi (bad or not) this isn't traditional. With a very experimental feel I was curious in its unfolding and was actively working to put scenes together as there were layers of depth it seemed as scenes progressed. VERY intellectually stimulating. It had me up the next couple days thinking. Things I've never connected before. I'm going to give it a second watch for sure because there is just so much depth and after talking with someone else he was able to notice more references then I did the first time so this is defiantly a movie that deserves multiple watches and not a movie for passive watching, it demands your attention at least if you're a puzzle solver.NOT a movie for those without upper level brain activity or tiny attention spans. The Sci Fi is bad but impressive at times and the ethos of the film and intellectual aspects for me make it a 10/10. Same reasons I love Christopher Nolan films but this one has no where near that budget and still seemed to deliver on the intellect and philosophy. This one is going to go over many heads but those with the eyes and minds to meet it on the level of its presentation will be in for a very rare treat indeed. I'll be following to see the discussions about this film. Very curious as to where this goes!"}, {"id": 131, "text": "This film mentions several revealing truths that people need to know -- like the problems of a debt-based economy (like that created by the very private Federal Reserve in America). But the film also goofs severely on topics like wealth and disparity of income.Now, my take on it all...Wealth is not evil. Disparity of results is not evil. Equal opportunity is good, but we cannot get to that ideal because the people pushing loudest against corrupt corporations are pushing for Bigger Government. Ironically, the Biggest Corporations are also pushing for Bigger Government.Free Market Capitalism, instead of the Leftist Capitalism used by all Publicly-Traded Corporations, would solve many of the problems mentioned in this film, if only Big Government and their Big Corporate backers would get out of the way.This video reminds me of the Zero Sum Game philosophy of economics. Bogus idea! Wealth is created by people adding value. Currency should be based on added value -- not debt. And banks should NOT be allowed fractional reserve lending to loan out 10x what they hold.We have a lot of problems in the world, but they can't be solved if films like this tell half-truths and horrible lies."}, {"id": 132, "text": "This movie is a cross section of the status quo and the structure of our society, showing why things are the way they are and what happens if we continue down this path.The most interesting part is the 'future perspective' where scientists analyze our current societal methods and indicate the flaws and weaknesses contributing to its own misery and demise. This has the surprising effect of seeing our society as malfunctioning and delusional as it truly is and figure out a way to redress it. Nature in our current view is only something to be exploited and man is not seen as part of it, but rather fighting against it.Living in accordance with nature, something we knew for thousands of years is now a fringe culture. This has to be addressed and humanity must once again reintegrate into its environment as part of a whole.Incredible movie, must see for everyone concerned with our current direction. Thank you Peter Joseph."}, {"id": 133, "text": "I had been waiting for several years for this movie to come out, so was extremely nervous (and excited) about what Peter's latest movie would be like and whether it would meet my high expectations. The film contained 3 narratives: the first following a bewillered lady (called Number 23) in a dystopian view of today's materialistic, ego-centric, hyper-competititive society. The second narrative was set in the near future, approximately 4 decades from now there is a struggle between activists verus the defenders of the ruling establishment. The third narrative was set in the more distant future (100+ years) which told the story our species' evolution and provided the most fact-based retrospective commentary of our current consumption-driven economic system, essentially providing viewers with a summary of the concepts described in Peter's book, The New Human Rights Movement. I felt the movie successfully delivered in providing its viewers with a realistic (although somewhat pessimistic) view of today's society, in particular our misaligned, divisive values and the systems (e.g. advertising) that continually reinforce these values in our culture. I particularly enjoyed the storyline between the activists and the establishment but I felt this could have included a little more action and slightly less dialogue. Eventually the movie merged the 3 narratives (or at least the characters of these narratives) in the Great Debate, but i found this scene to be a little confusing. One of the major highlights of the movie for me included the frequent symbolism in the movies (such as the crashing train analagy), i.e. the movie allowed some points to be shown using symbols and metaphor rather than spoonfeeding us every detail. There was also some humour in the film (such as this is apple juice) but I was pleased this wasn't overdone, which could have detracted from the serious messages this film is trying to convey. My absolute favourite part of the movie was the final 10 minutes - what a beautiful and inspiring vision! Peter's greatest strength as a film-maker is explaining complex concepts (such as relative poverty, the pepertual-debt-based money system, the scarcity vs infinite consumption paradox, the economic roots of oppresion / slavery, etc) in a very simple, easy to digest manner. He covers a LOT of points here, but i feel it's a good balance between explaining concepts explicitly and illustrating them symbolically. Overall, i really loved the film and it definitely met &amp; even exceeeded my expectations. Along with Peter's other works, I would definitely recommend this film to anybody, particularly if you don't mind being intellectually challenged and are open-minded enough to seeing the world through a different lense."}, {"id": 134, "text": "There are parts of this movie that I did enjoy, and parts of the cinematography that really captured me, but unfortunately (just like many movies and real life fantasists) this movie missed the most important part of the conversation.This film is trying to convince us that a different way of living together is possible, for which I agree.The problem that I have is this film spends one half criticising the world we live in now, and then almost immediately flips to describing a world which is better in every way.But the only real conversation that we should be having is How do we get there from here?.This is the fundamental argument which has floored philosophers and academics for centuries, so I don't blame this film for not clearly outlining it..But I'm just tired of wishful thinking and dreams of a better tomorrow wrapped up in some fancy words, long monologues and black and white cinematography.This is just another film that tries to say it's so easy to change and be better, whilst being completely unable to describe how to change to something better, and therefore in my eyes comes off just as vague and superficial as the society it was made to criticise."}, {"id": 135, "text": "Genius way to beam the zeitgeist message out and get Our species into a new paradigm .

Any of the Zeitgeist films already presented the same themes, with a better narrative and way better interviews without forcing actors to a script.And also there was no need at all for a sci-fi / fantasy / futuristic mockumentary. Which as a concept, looks cool, but it was extremely bad executed.The over use of green screen, and long and dragging surreal dramatic scenes... It all felt cheap and just hard to watch.I appreciate the effort of trying to make a grandiose art piece, but it was completely pointless in the end. I don't see this film getting good reviews anywhere, not even from hardcore Zeitgeist fans. Its length and extremely slow pacing won't help to engage viewers either.We'll keep recommending The Zeitgeist Trilogy, though."}, {"id": 137, "text": "This movie is more than that, it is a hypothesis of what human society can be, just by applying a change in the system.From the perspective of cinematographic art, it is a hybrid between documentary and normal film, only that the documentary parts are also fictional, with future academics explaining the root cause of humanity's problems, and how they were fixed with a systematical change. THE GREAT TRANSITION.Is the first of its kind (or one of them).The society live in a kind of matrix, and the movie stimulate to the public to get out of this psychological matrix.P.D.: Sorry for my bad english, but i sure that you understand the idea that i expressed."}, {"id": 138, "text": "This movie is grand... Why? Because it takes the innovative step needed to target the current abomination that is human society. It is a small but malevolent group of people, pulling the strings that control all of us, and anyone who speaks against it, becomes the target of this group. But now, in 2020, when this group has influenced so many over the years (by creating social discord through media, thereby allowing people to do their bidding and fight one another) we the 99.99% are waking in the millions to the deceit and propaganda.I first discovered Peter Joseph's work some years ago and quickly absorbed all the Zeitgeist films. It was the first time I'd seen, on screen, someone talking about subjects that others felt were too taboo to mention or too strange to consider. I remember that Einstein often got the same feedback, as well as Tesla and many others who developed works that seemed on the edge of simple understanding.A lot of people who don't like to think very much won't get his films. Which, unfortunately, is pretty sad and makes sense as to why the topic of the film hits home for those like myself. In a way, their dissent of the films are self-fulfilling prophecies.However, the one thing I do love about this latest film is that it pokes fun of itself, often commenting on what the non-target audience member may be saying to themselves. And in the words of many famous folks, if you can simply explain something then you completely understand it. Some of the scenes do just that. Others, however, take a deeper level of introspection."}, {"id": 139, "text": "Peter Joseph changed my life with the Zeitgeist movies. Since I have been a long time fan of Zeitgeist, I can't say I learned a lot of new things from this movie. However, that doesn't matter. The delivery was nothing short of masterful. Peter has been working very hard on this movie and it did not disappoint. My husband and I rented it from Prime video but we are going to buy it. It's not something we can just watch once. It's a lot to absorb. I have recommended the Zeitgeist movies to many in the past and still do. I will now start recommending this movie. I think it's easier to digest for most people versus something like Zeitgeist. Although, I still think those who are not already heading down this path may have a difficult time with it but it was in perfect Peter style and I loved it. There were several laugh out loud parts for me, too. Very entertaining but also spot on with conveying the message about how ridiculous and unnecessarily violent our system is. I especially loved the view into the woman's life that was an abstract way to see reality. It had me laughing at the ridiculous clown world she experienced because that's literally what I feel real life is like. The Great Debate was so beautiful and eloquent, it also hit me in the feels. I thought there was going to be an epic rap battle between John and Simon at one point. There were also other songs in it and oh man...I need the soundtrack. It was an epic movie.

It moved me to tears at points, both from the despair of how sad our situation is, and from a feeling of sheer inspiration, from allowing myself to believe that we can change, and that we as a race can evolve beyond this point, and live in a way that expresses our most beautiful qualities: empathy, love, cooperation, intelligence, community, harmony.The film didn't feel that smooth at all points, you have be forgiving of a couple drawn out scenes that seem a bit out of context, and of the narrative side of it, which wasn't pulled off as well as it could have been (in my honest opinion).But really despite some of these flaws it was still one of the best films I have ever seen. Considering Peter was trying to pull of a crazily ambitious and completely new concept here - fusing visionary ideas and intense analysis of our global socioeconomic system with arty and more traditionally entertaining forms of film, I think he did an amazing job.Highly recommend watching it!"}, {"id": 144, "text": "Peter Joseph has a clear vision of what humanity's true purpose should be. He is a self-taught visionary of our time with great clarity in the work he does. Some might find the idea of his work as a fictional based utopia but his many global supporters can see his vision of a better world as logical and realistic and are able to by-pass all the clutter and noise. If his ideology is classified as fairy tales by monetary visionaries, it is only because they fear his ideas will only continue to expand to a greater audience.In the end, we have been programmed to be purchasers within a system of waste. People don't need to keep buying Crap. People need to be allowed to explore there true passions and if you look at the current state of society, many people are struggling to make ends meet in order to survive for basic necessities. Necessities that should be a human right. If our society is to ever evolve into a more caring and compassionate society, where human welfare and environmental respect are treated as the true purpose of our existence, then monetary values need not Trump change. If the technology is present to find solutions, full application of its use should be applied as a basic law for the greater good of humanity and society. Imagine a family being told they have a cure for their cancer, but because of man-made monetary ideologies, they cannot receive the treatment to continue to live. Imagine!This is the true essence of Peter's messaging. If we have solutions they should be applied without monetary implications. Healthcare should be free for all. Education should be available to all. Food supply can be localized and distributed more equally. If these various necessities do not improve, we will have a society that continues to cycle through its revolving doors of poverty and crime without connecting the dots that all these issues are related.Great work by Peter as always and this film and his lectures should be reviewed by all who care for a better society.

I initially planned to break up the near 3 hour run time in to 2 or 3 chunks but once I turned it on I was intrigued and fascinated enough to watch it in one go....I've watched programmes of an hour that feel longer! At its heart is the story of the unsustainable way much of our society currently lives... with particular focus on the not so shining light of the capitalist/consumerist world, the USA and its numerous problems. It gives an intelligent, thought-provoking and inciteful view of all that's wrong with our power/greed/money worshipping culture and offers a possible alternative to this way of life.It plays out as a sci-fi feature of sorts, using actors, scenes and different metaphors to highlight the movies point. At no point are the audience treated as fools and the different genres and mood changes broke up the lecture heavy moments to create a truly memorable experience. My hope is that in watching this movie, some people may decide they aren't willing to put up with the unsustainable damage we are inflicting on ourselves and our ecosystem in this version of society but will instead look for new ways of thinking and feeling to find a balance greatly needed in these most troubled of times.
