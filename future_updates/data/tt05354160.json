Masuma Rahman Nabila acted superbly well in the film, her simplicity of acting the role was reflected positively towards audiences. Dress design was also done well in the movie, Easter eggs ;)Many would find Partho Barua better one to come out acting for the crucial part of the story, and I would agree with them, persistent characteristic of the role he played in the movie was undoubtedly extraordinarily acted by the singer come actor.General pace of the movie seemed slow however, as the full length of the movie is way more than 90 minutes, building up sheer suspense each long scenes have played out nicely to stand out from the crowd.Syed Gaosul Alam Shaon has enabled this movie to have a sequel, which is another great reason you should definitely watch this great movie. Dialogue and screenplay was above excellent and it was a delight to watch the Barisal local dialect performed.I highly recommend spending on watching the movie Aynabaji in theater, true masterpiece, absolutely worth it!9.5/10 and thanks for reading y'all :)"}, {"id": 1, "text": "So, today i saw Aynabaji and this movie forced me to write something about it. Aynabaji is a metro thriller movie directed by Amitabh Reza Chowdhury and starring Chanchal Chowdhury, Masuma Rahman Nabila, Partho Barua etc.The plot of the movie is very unique from the typical Bangladeshi movie . Here Ayna ,the protagonist of the movie does a weird job for living . He takes people's place in prison for money . But it one such case , he faces a very big trouble .What is the trouble and how Ayna deals with it, that part unfolds in the climax.First of all ,what amazes me most is the cinematography . The whole film sets in Dhaka . Specially the Ariel shots are memorizing . The background music is to the point . There is almost no loo break in the movie . All credit goes to the Aynabaji team for making such a good film in a minimal budget.All the actors justifies their roles in the film.Specially Chanchal Chowdhury does an extraordinary acting in the movie . His transformation from one role to another is just too good in the movie .His role Ayna is one of the unique characters in the Bangladeshi movie history .In a word ,  Aynabaji  is a very unique and ground breaking thriller in the Bangladeshi movie industry . A must watch film for those who loves thriller and suspense stories on the backdrop of a metro city !My Rating -9.5/10"}, {"id": 2, "text": "May be some people could say that it is overrated or something like that but actually this movie is a piece.A challenging role played by Chanchal Chowdhury make the movie special.Every small role was given importance by Director.

As a normal movie audience, the whole film seems to be very interesting and exciting to me.

I was surprised and thinking what he have done !!! Bangla film industry was not in a good condition. I think it will be in a good shape after that movie. The name of this movie is so much related to the story. very nice, smart and choosy name.Thanks to Syed Gaosul Alam Shaon for such a good story. Ayna is a magician of acting. He made an illusion to the society."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I have seen this movie thinking that it will be a waste of time. But once the movie started, I had no idea that how it dragged me into the story. Picturization was very realistic. There are small loop holes though, but a viewer will not notice it if seen once. Other than that it was a flaw less script. no where did it feel that something it was abrupt. The story was created as an experienced story teller. Nowhere did I feel that this particular scene was of no use. It had humor, taste of suspense, thrill; in total a perfect package. Truly this movie has raised the bars of bangla cinema. It is not for any specific group of audience rather it is for audience of all ages.My expression after seeing this movie, as it ended - I just jumped out of my seat and was shouting out I do wish to see part 2 of this movie....Simply a wonderful piece of work."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Not so awesome movie. but if you consider the level of Bengali movies, this movie is just genius"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Absolutely awesome movie indeed.

Aynabaji is one of them. The great drama actor Chanchal was in the movie. He played the vital role. His acting is always the best.

Gifted with the natural talent of acting, he is a man with a versatile character and can morph into anybody he wants. It is also a story about the dark side of metro city Dhaka.Though it was the firstmovie of Nabila, co-actress but she also did well. There are very fewmovies in BD that are thriller.

Hopefully this will be the ground breaker in the film industry of Bangladesh and we will be able to get many more movies like this.

Every scene had its significance. I have always avoided Bangla movie because of its lame dialogues and silly drama. But the makers of Aynabaji took Bangladeshi movie industry to a different level. Chanchal has played 6 characters. Each was played speechlessly by the versatile actor. Romantics scenes between Chanchal and Masuma added a flavor to the movie which never stretched to monotony. An important message is also provided in the movie. That is the corruption scenario of Bangladesh Police and the politicians. Bribery can save any criminals from punishment (jail).Aynabaji can be described in one word and that is MAGNIFICO."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Great movie ever and that's wonderful Bangladeshi movie.

This movie has important part for Bangladesh's social crimes and activities. I think this movie can be selected for Oscar and will be won Oscar.

He proves that you don't need to go abroad or don't need any item song to hit films, all you need is a good story &amp; some good actors &amp; a good director if you want to make a good film.

The story line, Acting of the artists &amp; everything is superb. Chanchal Chowdhury proved himself again by his Aynabaji. We are eagerly waiting to see more Aynabaji from him.

No movie is 100% perfect and also this but the last 30 minutes of the movie will help to forgot every error of the movie. What a super finishing of the movie.

The confabulation on social media like Facebook got my attention. When I went to the cinema! What was that !! Honestly, it's a new series of extraordinary acting and film. Although it would be wrong to say a Movie , it seems like a simple type of drama to me. As I said earlier, however, there is no innovation. We already have enough with Shakib Khan, Jalil and some other actor actress. We are watching their boring movies again and again. It's high time to change the platform. Once my boyfriend said Only poor people like rickshaw drivers, Garment workers watches Bangla movies because there are no Good movies for educated people like us. I agreed with him and i never watched any Begali movies on cinemas. But i think now everything has changed. Here is Aynabaji for all types of people. If you are interested, you should watch Aynabaji. I'm not saying this is an amazing movie to watch but yes it is. Our film makers are doing well. Hope there will be more movies like Aynabaji. Chanchal Chowdory sometimes over acts. Rest of all was good. I'm giving only 5 stats because of poor graphics and sounds, It doesn't looks like a movie to me by the look of graphic. Whatever don't listen to fake reviews above and below. Remember one thing, higher rates doesn't mean the movie is great. There are so many great movies with lower ratings. Make your own decisions and watch it with your friends and family. Enjoy and good luck. Here i wanna say something more. It's sad that our country doesn't have better cinema halls outside Dhaka city.

Today, I went to see the film which was the very first day of it's release and came back home with wide wonderment and joy.The lead actor, Chanchal Chowdhury is one of the brightest actor in this generation. Before, he was so good in Monpura (2009) and Television (2013). And now in Aynabaji he simply enchanted and stole the whole show single handedly. I can guarantee, he will win The National Award for sure. The story line was so unique and had so much depth, which allows Chanchal to make it more blazed. Chanchal is a sheer virtuoso of acting and this is obviously his best work so far.Not only Chanchal, the others actors, actress also put up a good show. Lutfur Rahman George, Partho Barua acted very well. Masuma Rahman Nabila was surprisingly good. There were some teeny tiny irrationality with the story line, but they are absolutely negligible, because if you want to compare with Bangladeshi Standard, Aynabaji was exceptionally good. In camera work, in sound editing and mixing, in casting ensemble, in costume, the whole film so skillfully mastered.

The cinema was even more worthy for watching before two decades. Whereas, a vast amount of film buff in this country and only a few are fulfilling their expectations. Following the great frustration 'Aynabaji' is a name that actually can be called 'New Hope' for the film-goer in Bangladesh. A character name 'Sharafat Karim Ayna' changes his character for the imprisonment of himself in exchange of money. He believes that life is a stage and he is a great actor as he is in real. Ayna shifts from his character to other by rehearsing himself with the actual criminal. That part is really mind-blowing every time. 'Saber Hossein' a drunkard reporter who becomes suspicious over Ayna follows him throughout the cinema. He gets angry while drinking for being called 'looser' as his divorce is final and can't make a true report due to political reason. Though, he follows him but Ayna deceiving him every time. However, Saber was relentless for tracking him. Hridi lives next to Aynas home and noticed him while Ayna teaches acting to the children in a yard of a school. Hridi and Ayna fall in love each other. Hridi stays unaware about Ayna until Saber finds out and exposed to her. Ayna kidnapped by a serious political criminal who committed murder. The intensity of this cinema starts rising during the conversation between that murderer and Ayna. I think the best environment and conversation created in the history of Bangladeshi cinema. Cinematography by Rashed Zaman was stunning. I think this is the first time that wrapped beautifully every corner of Dhaka city. Musical score was astoundingly excellent. The make-up artist hired from India (I didn't find his name on IMDb) can be called 'master' for his brilliant hypnotic performance. There is good color tonality which is drowned with the narrative. Technically it was quite sharp in every sector. Story is beautifully written by Shaon and that is undoubtedly unique. Humorous dialogues made by Anam Biswas are really extraordinary.Amitabh Reza approaches the notion of pure film-making. His devotion toward cinema was suspicious for me after watching one by one his commercials. He is a renowned director for commercials and TV serial. 'Aynabaji' is his first film which really clarified his dedication on cinema. Amitabh Reza is an indigenous for fulfilling audience's expectations toward him. People can really keep their faith on him before buying tickets. After 'Aynabaji' Amitabh Reza is now a great inspiration for new film-maker. Hopefully, he will continue his journey that he started and having strength for contributing a lot in this country."}, {"id": 105, "text": "Ayna is an actor and the prison is his stage. He slips into the characters of the powerful convicted, in exchange of money and take their place in prison. This strange profession is borne out of a society that doesn't give him a chance to follow his passion of acting, but forces him to act in the real life. Falling in love with the girl next door changes his life equation and he decides to end this career with one last performance. But this one takes him too deep in the rabbit hole. While on his job in prison the convict is sentenced to hanging and so is Ayna who was pretending to be the convict. Although the film has a sad ending, the film ends with Ayna continuing to show his brilliant acting skills in the jail."}, {"id": 106, "text": "Sharafat Karim Ayna...seemingly a very ordinary, down to earth guy who loves to spend time with the children as their drama teacher, sometime goes away for weeks or months when his duty calls as a seasonal chef for a ship traveling around the Indian ocean. But under this carefully plotted fabric of impressions, Mr Ayna a.k.a.Ayna Vai is actually a master class real-life character actor who works as a proxy prisoner for the spoiled, rich &amp; ruthless people that failed to get a bail for their hideous crime in court. And every time he takes his job very seriously as he remarkably slips into the characters of his convicted clients to avoid any sort of suspicions from his surroundings. But just when he is planning to quit from this strange profession, one last job knocks on his door - given no chance to refuse, eventually demands too much from him... With an intriguing plot like this, Amitabh Reza Chowdhury really did a wonder in his directorial debut (for a feature length film) that can be regard as a genre-defining celluloid piece for Bangladeshi cinema. Beautifully shot, a neat &amp; gripping character driven thriller from start to finish. Kudos to the director &amp; his entire team for assembling a great cast who were stellar in almost every frame, particularly Chanchal Chowdhury on the lead did a phenomenal job; every time when 'Ayna' tries to impersonate the character of his new client (with a chilling score on the background) were the best moments of this movie, IMO. Partho Barua as an investigative crime reporter and the young new actress Nabila as the love interest of Ayna also skillfully shines on their respective roles. Loved the way ARC put a few popular faces through cameos. And last but not the least\u0085the striking cinematography as another winner of the show. I think we have never seen our city through such amazing wide angle, bird eye view shots in any BD movie before. The dark &amp; gloomy takes on a cloudy Dhaka somewhat represents this city as another character in the movie. Amitabh Reza's AYNABAZI is like a breath of fresh air for BD cinema (that has been in a kind of a limbo for an awful lot of long time due to lack of originality, creativity as well as decency!) and now this gives us hope for an exciting &amp; better future as we all wait for more genre-based films like this through a possible rising line of young &amp; talented film makers in coming days."}, {"id": 107, "text": "The script was fantastic, the theme was fascinating, acting was incredible specially Chanchal Choudhury.

Amitabh Reza Chowdhury did a great job with his amazing direction.Though the movie has few flaws in logic and story but it can be overlooked. What so ever, this movie is awesome.

Read it after watching the full movie!!Shakespeare once said that the world is simply a stage where we are all actors. After watching this movie, I also found myself as an actor. The way Ayna, the central character of this movie frequently changes his roles actually reflects our very own way of leading life. The life of Dhaka city, the dialogues and finally story itself talks on behalf of our selves! Ayna is none but a reflection of us which shows that sometimes we change roles to feel something different, sometimes we are compelled to do so. Regarding the crimes, the movie lovers need to watch the movie keeping in mind that this movie is based on a third world country where crimes are nothing unusual.

Even though the story was borrowed from a 2012 South Korean film 'Changsoo' ('Tumbleweed' in English), the treatment of it by the makers made it quite watchable. The music and cinematography were outstanding. The acting was commendable and direction showed strong promises in many scenes. The kid at the 'Hollywood Studio' deserves an award just for his expressions. The protagonist 'Ayna', played by Chanchal Chowdhury, was almost flawless in portrayal of the character. Gousul Alam Shaon was hilarious and was perfect in the shady role of Gousul. 'Mirakkelian' Sajal as the crime-reporter's housekeeper was funny as usual.Intra-personal communication or self-talking is a sign of weak script, and is not used in good movies or drama nowadays. The script should be written in such a way where this self-talking thoughts would not be needed, and the audience would understand the thoughts going on in the character's mind from the context. When Ayna was falling for Hridi (Masuma Rahman Nabila) but at the same time was being bothered by the crime-reporter Saber (Partho Barua), he went through a dilemma whether he should change his residence. He talks to himself about the situation, and that was a sign of a weak script.The story was a narrative and had no twist. This was the other major fault of the story-line. Although falling in love with Hridi did almost change Ayna from doing further fraudulent swaps, he eventually did not stop and stuck to his deceptions. As an audience, you would constantly hope that the final deal he took from the crooked politician Nizam was actually a ploy of Ayna (who became a good person because of Hridi) to turn him over to the law-enforcers in the end. And, that would have been a nice twist of the plot. But, disappointingly Ayna held on to his guns till the end and did not change being a professional impostor. I understand that modern films do allow the 'hero' to get away with murder or a bank-heist which tickles the common man's dangerous desires, but in this case, it resulted in quite a flat story-line. This also makes Hridi's character redundant, as she really did not play any purposeful role to Ayna or to the story. If Hridi's love could make any difference, her character could have been justified.Nevertheless, 'Aynabaji' showed us that clean movies are always appreciated by the audience. We need more such movies in Bangladesh to relieve us from the usual song &amp; dance melodramas that infest our theaters.

Probably this is the first Bangladeshi movie that tries drama and suspense genre with pure Bangladeshi urban flavor. It's mesmerizing to see familiar locations like Paribag, Puran Dhaka, Sadar Ghat etc with subliminal frames. Chanchal Chowdhury again showed why he was awarded National Film Awards back in 2009. Though the film has an unique plot line but I feel somewhere it lacks a bit depth as a full length feature film (probably it's the expectation from such a talented bunch of creative peoples). The second thing is the slow momentum and pace of events, sometimes you need to wait a bit more to see next events to happen. And the last thing is over using of drone and new/unknown frames to present the sequences. No doubt it is a sex for eyes to see such beautiful cinematography but this also distracts you and make you to give more attention on cinematography and frames (technical aspects) than the story itself.However, the hype creating and overwhelming response of the crowds inspire us that there is still a big market for Bangladeshi movies, our movies."}, {"id": 138, "text": "This is my first time review writing to IMDb, please pardon me for mistakes.According to Bangladeshi movie industry, Aynabaji gave us a totally new taste.

According to my observation I think sound track was recorded using 7.1 channels or 6.1 channels and also of course Dolby noise reduction technology has been used. If the sound recording engineer doesn't mind then I would like to say, there was one mistake and that is, when the political person was speaking from behind then his voice was coming through front or center channels. There could be another improvement, when the train was moving rightwards; the sound should be fade-out/fade-in to right back channel whereas sound directly gone to rear right channel.

Before, he was so good in Monpura (2009) and Television (2013). And now in Aynabaji he simply enchanted and stole the whole show single handedly. I can guarantee, he will win The National Award for sure. The story line was so unique and had so much depth, which allows Chanchal to make it more blazed. Chanchal is a sheer virtuoso of acting and this is obviously his best work so far.Not only Chanchal, the others actors, actress also put up a good show. Lutfur Rahman George, Partho Barua acted very well. Masuma Rahman Nabila was surprisingly good. There were some teeny tiny irrationality with the story line, but they are absolutely negligible, because if you want to compare with Bangladeshi Standard, Aynabaji was exceptionally good. In camera work, in sound editing and mixing, in casting ensemble, in costume, the whole film so skillfully mastered. The songs are pretty good, the script has so many punches and humors. Hats off to the whole team. This movie is highly recommended for all, to the general viewer and also for the other people who kind of love to see different tracks of movies."}, {"id": 141, "text": "Movie Review: Aynabaji (\u0986\u09af\u09bc\u09a8\u09be\u09ac\u09be\u099c\u09bf)This was going to be a solid 5-star. Then the ending happened, which is too abrupt at best and too convenient at worst. But let's begin at the beginning, shall we?If you live in the city, (or if you read the newspaper, or if you don't live in a cave, basically) you won't be surprised with the fact that if you do a crime here, you don't always have to do the time. Money and power, that's what you need, and you can go scot-free. Oh, there's one other thing you need, though. That's Mr. Aayna (Chonchol Chowdhury). Why do you need him? He is only a cook after all, he works in ships. He's simple and he's nice- he even has a drama school for the street children in the neighborhood. But is all really what it seems? Is Aayna really at the sea when he disappears every other month or so? Or is he somewhere else, like, in someone else's life? Is he taking their place, doing their things, being them?Reporter Saber Something (forgot the last name, played by Partho) is having a bad day, on the other hand. His divorce is final, his news is non-existent since people are shutting their doors on his face, and when he does get a scoop, boss won't hear of it. So he drinks, and his manservant/self-appointed guardian (Jamil from Meerakkel) is literally the only one who cares about him. But a reporter's gotta report, and following Aayna around is bound to give him some proof, right? But it's not as easy as it sounds. Aayna plays his game, and better.But hey, there's a new babe in the block, so let's focus on that for a sec. Hridi (Nabila) isn't your typical girl-next-door. I mean, she is, but if you are a single bachelor in living in the neighborhood, she'll flirt with you over vegetable carts, bring you cake for no reason and plan a trip to Sylhet with you in a heartbeat even though she knows practically nothing about you. Girlfriend is either really gullible or really stupid. But what she does in the move is raise the stakes- which way would Aayna go? Love and acceptance? Or the biggest gig of his life that's also the biggest risk he'll ever take? Does he really have a choice?The movie has a fantastic premise, and it works because of its magnificent actor. Chonchol Chowdhury carries this move and he will easily have you in awe. You'll clap at his skills, hoot at his sass and lol at his quips. He is a sympathetic protagonist too. His work is shady and so are his motives- why is he doing this? Money? Escape from his own miserable life? The rush of the game, the playing of a new character? Would you care? Because I think not, and I think in the end you will root for him, as did I and a houseful of people at the first-day-first-show today.All the other actors were good too. Except Partho wasn't really given a lot to do and Nabila sometimes sounds a little fake. Acting, overall, isn't the problem in the movie. The balance between serious and fun is also perfect.What is the problem, then? It's the last half-an-hour.See, the movie isn't very fast paced, and I should warn you right now that if you're looking for masala, you won't find any here. Even the ass-first intro of a girl (it was in the trailer) doesn't result in an item song. The songs play no part in the narrative, all of them are in the background pretty much. And none of that is a problem. A movie can take its time to get going and still keep you hooked. The problem is when you lose the urgency.The movie is almost over. The net is closing in on Aayna. Can he get out of the mess he's in? Can anyone help him? Can he help himself? Will he listen to reason? You want to find out, but all you're getting is unnecessary scenes with Nabila which is taking up time which could be used to flesh out Aayna's final chapter. And them the climax happens and it's too convenient, too sudden- you might even feel it to be improbable. It's not, really, but it feels that way because it came out of nowhere. I can't stop thinking how much better, cooler, tighter it could be if it were done more slowly, more gradually. You'll be happy it ended that way, but you will also be thinking, 'That was too easy.'Also, there was some choppy editing in the second half where you can't tell how many days have passed between events.Aaynabaji is strong enough. It is well-acted, well-directed, well-shot and well-written, except for the climax, maybe. But that's really not reason enough not to watch it. With the kind of movies Dhallywood churns out every year- including movies that try to set themselves apart but falls flat (*coughPodmoPatayJolGangsterReturnsOstitto*cough), this is gold. So be classy and go support a good movie so we can get more of these and less of violence filled bullshit.4 .25 out of 5 stars.P.S. There are three cameos.

His transformation from one role to another is just too good in the movie .In a word ,  Aynabaji  is a very unique thriller movie in the history of Bangladeshi movie industry . A must watch film for those who loves thriller and suspense stories."}, {"id": 144, "text": "If the hype around social media wasn't enough to get someone's attention to this movie, the buzz and response outside surely were. Aynabaji stormed through cinema halls at a time when Bengali movie industry was awaiting its impending doom and eventual loss of identity by morphing into just another counterfeit of more profitable Indian movie industries. Evidently, this was enough to make the Bangladeshi moviegoers rediscover their craving for Bengali cinema. But does it make Aynabaji the movie that it is fabled to be? My answer may not satisfy some. As I am reviewing it anyway, let me get started with the positives first. Aynabaji is unique. There is nothing quite like it in Bengali cinema. And the titular character Ayna is certainly one of the most complex and fascinating characters in Bengali fiction. He can be seen as a meta-commentary to actors in a whole. The struggles that come with their professions and how this affect their sense of personal identity. The director did a tremendous job at fleshing him out. While not a comedy, it's dry humor was witty and fitting but pretty shallow as well. The soundtrack and background sounds were nicely placed in many of the scenes but grossly exaggerated in others. While it tried to break out of the shell of a typical Bengali movie, it failed. Attention to detail in set design, cinematography and the portrayal of Dhaka was accurately done. Another thing also worth mentioning is the way some recurring characters aren't just cardboard cutouts but characters somewhat resembling real human beings even if the primary focus was always on the titular character. Sadly, Aynabaji isn't the perfect movie that many speak of. And many of its strong aspects are overshadowed by faults. The biggest issue of Aynabaji is that it tries to be too many things at once. A drama, a character study, a thriller, a satire, a love story, a psychological thriller, a slapstick comedy and in the end, it doesn't know what it is. The plot was needlessly convoluted and many plot elements were brought up and then thrown out without a warning or handled without necessary care. And some of the major events were made possible by plot conveniences which were undoubtedly immersion-breaking, The director bet his dollar on a willing suspension of disbelief too often and it doesn't pay off.The acting is certainly sub-par. The actors are either overacting or underacting. The sound editing doesn't do it any good either. And the cartoonish and grossly stereotypical representation of some side characters makes them increasingly difficult to take seriously(Especially the major and minor antagonists). In fact, keeping a straight face and not cringing becomes rather challenging as the movie progresses. The writing is filled to the brim with amateurish movie tropes. It doesn't try to think outside the box. As a result, the movie becomes predictable to anyone with minimal movie viewing experience. And the dialogue, oh the dialogue! It is undoubtedly the worst part of this movie. If I had a penny for every time the characters tried and miserably failed to say something profound, I'd have my ticket back. Bad dialogues don't make good chemistry either. As a result, character chemistry was forced. Most noteworthy being the chemistry between two main characters. Last, but not least, the movie's urge for crowd-pleasing ended the movie on a not so high note. And the ending certainly felt weaker than what I predicted. So, is it worth watching? It is if you are a Bengali. Because its success will lead to more filmmakers taking risks or being ambitious and the condition of this decaying film industry may improve. If you are a foreigner swayed by the high ratings on its IMDb page, don't watch it. Overall Aynabaji is a breath of fresh air in Bengali movie scene but only as a source of pure entertainment and nothing beyond. But even a popcorn flick as this comes with a fair share of positives to make one hopeful about the future of Bengali movies. Just don't expect it winning awards anytime soon and don't hype it to be something it's not.P.S.

It was the first ever crime thriller movie that I watched in a theater. Later I watched again on TV but didnt get the same flavour like the theatrical experience. I could have been written a long write-up on it, but decide not to give any clearcut spoilers.I always believe that the core competencies of a person could lead him/her to survive in this cruel world. So, we need to nurture our competencies whatever our situation would be.Sharafat Karim Ayna (Chanchal Chowdhury) is a person who lives in a small room of an old and shrivelled house in Old Dhaka. He runs a small acting school of children. He aspired to become an actor but the fate decides otherwise. He possesses an enormous skill of METHOD ACTING and in this skill he could morph into any character. Ayna converts himself fully on that particular character as if he is that person in real. He befriends with Hridi (Nabila) who develops soft corner by seeing Ayna's struggling, impoverish life but a kind hearted contribution to the children. Hridi is a kind hearted girl who lives with her father and a house assistant (Akter Hossain). However, Ayna's enormous skill has been recurrently used by the corrupted people of the city to woo laws and people's eye and Ayna, to survive himself in this ruthless city, sacrifices his ethics of being a good man. Crime reporter Saber (Partha Barua) follows Ayna for a long time to reveal the linkage between him and the dark world of the city.The acting of Chanchal was unparallel. After tremendous success in Monpura (2009), he escalates his standard of acting in a new echelon. If he was performed this Aynabazi performance at any Hollywood movie, he would be flooded by accolades, praises and awards from all over the world. Feeling sad that he is a Bangladeshi actor where he would never get such platform to unleash his true potential. I also praised the performance of Partha Barua, who is a renowned singer of Bangladesh. Though a small screen timing, Nabila performed very well.The same things of being a small movie industry person, story writer Gousul Alam and the director Amitabh Reza Chowdhury could get more attention if they were in Hollywood. As a crime thriller fan, I expect more stories from Gousul Alam like this. Amitabh Reza is a renowned media person who extends his talent by directing this movie which was his directorial debut.Music of this film was memorable. Personally I like the song Dhire Dhire Jao Na Shomoy by Habib Wahid and Anweshaa. The particular scene of this song, where Nabila stands in the rooftop of a building facing the river buriganga was scintillating. That snap was instantly viral amongst all Bangladeshi people. I have searched on that building and found that building is a private property and not for taking a Personal Photography there.Aynabazi receives 7 awards at the Bangladesh National Film Awards 2016 which are: Best Director, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound Recording and Best Costume Design"}, {"id": 148, "text": "I will say that I have only seen 4-5 Bangladeshi films because you know all others are garbage over-the-top romcom with ugly camera.This movie blew my mind- the plot,the story, which is unique and suits the Bangladeshi setting. This kind of things does and can happen in this country with all the bloody politicians.The cinematography is one of the best, the drone shots to show the beautiful Dhaka city in wide shots were perfectly captured. I could watch those shots for hours and we did have many long shots of characters riding bikes, cars.Chanchal Chowdhury steals the movie with his acting range. He perfectly embodied the other characters roles and was believable. Nabila's romantic subplot wasn't just another cliche romantic plot but it served Ayna's arc of leaving the dirty job. Partha Barua was a plot progresser and we do go to his POV time to time. Non of the other side characters were bad, they made the film to have more of a realitic-setting.The songs, thank god there wasn't any male-female dance party music. Every single music was good and still time to time I play 'Lag belki lag,Aynabaji'. The heart felt romantic music and Jail song was also well done.The story is can divided to a 3 part story but the screenwriter uses it for advantage and tells 3 jail stories with slowly romantic subplot brewing in the back.One of the best if not the best Bangladeshi film of this generation."}, {"id": 149, "text": "Morning shows the day this is not always true, but it seems a little more truth for this movie trailer.In this case that the amount of Hype was made in the expectation that the people that it was no more after watching this movie has crossed the expectation that than the movie and now visitors like her, instead proves response!The main character in the movie Sharafat Karim Ayna(Mirror) another human character holding a mirror to help sustain people's words before the case even though he does not help them see that it will help, then.A total of six agile character played by actor. many people do not like him,thinks typo but if anyone has seen this movie.then he is bound to be definitely a fan, though not his fan,mouth that is to say WOW!Swear word will come out of this one character, and one character from converting another,awesome make-up in one word,that he has charisma and it was great!Amitabh discount anything that has given proof of this make-up man Muhammad Ali brought to Kolkata!

A+ is every department - plot, cinematography, script, cast and music. Aynabaji is probably the first Bengali movie that will keep you glued to the screen without a moment of break. I didn't find one loose second in the film. Its the most visually delightful Bangladeshi movie till date. Old Dhaka, already quiet charming but chaotic - is presented as a wonderland! If you have grown up in Dhaka or are familiar with Dhaka political power-play, this story would be nothing unbelievable to you. It feeds in to the curiosity you already have. To be frank, Chanchal Chowdhury raises the bar for Bangladeshi movie actor too high. His transformation to different characters feels effortless and natural. Debutant Nabila does justice to her character as well. Casting is sensible - though we'd be happy to not see Partho Barua in this masterpiece. Music isn't the best feature of this movie, but then again it is not the kind of movie that needs music to carry it off. Songs and background scores are soothing to the ears with great lyrics.

Everything you want is packed wonderfully in this movie.I am really happy to see Bangladeshi film makers doing such a mind blowing job."}, {"id": 157, "text": "this will be short. no spoilers-The movie was a great one because of the skillful direction of Mr. Amitabh Reza Chowdhury and crafty performances of Chanchal Chowdhury, Masuma Rahman Nabila who inspired the audience to be connected to every plot in the story line of Mr. Ayna( Chanchal Chowdhury).I loved the story of Ayna, his humor, his motive, his pains and love.The movie didn't have any typical Dhaka-ish movie glamour/ hero-heroin saga . Rather it seemed so realistic and charismatic.I hope the producers will invest more for this type of movies and inspire the writers to write good stories for movies and help to uplift the skills of our countries' directors and actors."}, {"id": 158, "text": "It's great to see cinema halls full of people cheering and laughing and enjoying a good film. I couldn't watch it right after the release but I managed to watch it on second week and I must admit the director Amitabh Reza surely kept his promises. We waited for his first feature film for a long time. He comes with great promises and he delivers a very enjoyable psycho-political thriller with a tone of romantic story line which didn't disappoint me at all. Now, instead of saying it pleased me, I said it didn't disappoint me. Why? Let's get to that later. A man named Sharafat Karim Ayna serves time in jail for convicted criminals in exchange of money. He is a born actor, imitates anyone within minutes and manipulates anyone with his hypnotic personality. If you pay him well you don't have to be in jail, he would do that for you happily. This guy loves his con acting and loves his mercenary transformation from one character to another. There is something thrillingly artistic about his life. He isn't bothered about the morality of the act, considers himself a real life actor which makes the character more interesting. A woman comes into his life and a curious journalist starts asking questions. Great outline, great premise. The story begins.The story promised a gripping tale of a con artist and you need a great actor to pull it off. Chanchal Chowdhury has done an outstandingly brilliant job on the male lead. Watching him transitioning from character to character was a delight. All the characters he played were believable especially the transformation into a rogue politician against his will was a showcase of sheer brilliance. The chemistry between him and the female lead Nabila needed more attention. She looked very refreshing yet a little artificial often. The storytelling has a few loopholes, clich\u00e9s and continuation mistakes which I decided to ignore because of the overall experience. The ending seemed a bit disappointing and unbelievable at first but I am happy that it's actually believable if you know the protagonist well. There are suggestions and references in the film for the explanation. But I expected a grand ending. I was expecting a proper 'prestige' act. The director shared his perception about religious fanatics subtly. Comic reliefs were put in proper intervals and I enjoyed some of them. Background score was exquisitely well. Background scores were holding the intensity when required. The Best thing about this movie is the cinematography. The depiction of the Dhaka city was nearly poetic, melancholic, romantic and alive at the same time. Every character and place got their appropriate angles. It was never visually dull.I heard about a Korean film (Tumbleweed, 2013) with an exactly similar synopsis. I watched that one immediately after this. Apart from the one liner synopsis and a few minor questionable similarities, the two films are totally separate films. We can say everything that Korean film was missing we got those in 'Aynabaji'. The Korean one says that he serves jail for other people but we never see him doing that sort of anything in the film. On the contrary, the main lead in Aynabaji kept dazzling us with his versatile character jumping all the way to the end. That Korean film cannot be an inspiring one and even it is, I would say Amitabh Reza has created a whole new story and done much better. Unlike Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, who completely copied the concept of Vizontele and reversed it. The thing that annoyed me most about this film is the ongoing rating mania on IMDb. I saw 1500 people rated this film 10/10 before its release (29/9/2016). Sometimes people do that on IMDb but let's admit it; 1500 general audience from Bangladesh did not register on IMDb to rate this film before its release. This was done under some PR campaign. This was the start and after that, thousands of people started acting like T-1000 with a mission to give a 10/10 rating to save the Bengal film industry. If the IMDb authority checks these accounts, they would find all these 8000 votes came from accounts which were opened before or after the release of the film. It's just funny that some people want 8000 fake ratings for a film. In the end, I have to admit that I was tired of watching our promising directors making trash one after another. Aynabaji is a complete exception to that. Aynabaji is an entertaining film and it entertained me in different levels. This is a great effort for a first feature film and we would be eagerly waiting with positive enthusiasm for the next film from Amitabh Reza."}, {"id": 159, "text": "Aynabaji is a title, which is simply just one of a kind. An unique, classical drama movie, where we find a simple actor Ayna, leading his life through acting in his real life performing various roles. Though the story may seem simple when we just read the plot, oh boy, trust me, It has one of the best and unique plot which you have never heard of!The suspense, the simple romance between Ayna and Hridi, the glorious plot and the sequences all were up to the level, where I thought Am I really watching a movie which was made in Bangladesh? wow!!!!! This movie really shows us how men with wealth and high power leads their life in this corrupted society, It beautifully pointed out a dark side of Bangladesh which was mesmerizing to explore throughout the whole movie! Truly marvellous.Great work by Amitabh Reza Chowdhury, the director of this film. Casting crew were also great in their respective roles. Chanchal Chowdhury, who played the main character Ayna in this movie has done his role superbly.A must watch movie for everyone. Trust me, this movie is worth your money and time. I hope many brave directors will come out of the shadows with their excellent works after seeing how this classic movie rocked the whole nation Bangladesh."}, {"id": 160, "text": "One of the best exceptional creation of Bengali movie industry is Aynabaji. Very much unlike with traditional bengali movies that are produced in both Bangladesh and India.The main role is Sharafat Karim Ayna, which is characterized by Chanchal Chowdhury, has some sorts of by-borne supernatural quality to copy any one's behavior. He also has the ability to enter anyone's mind and can direct the people around him. He goes to the prison keeping the real criminal outside by the exchange of money and anyone can't recognise him. Throughout this movie Ayna enters to the prison instead of several criminals in different times. But at last he gets trapped as the criminal instead of whom Ayna comes to prison, is charged for death penalty. And through this the story goes on.The movie is remarkable for it's exceptional storyline. Such a character like Ayna is so difficult to be characterized. The director was significantly successful. Cinematography was pretty good. Though it contains several numbers of flaws throughout. It was the first Movie for the director but he did his best. Some irregularities can be seen, though for a low budget movie some flaws are very tough to remove Overall, thanx to all the cast, crews and everyone. Hope all the flaws can be removed and we will get Aynabji-2 or it's sequel. Very best of luck to the Aynabaji team."}], "reviews_amount": 161}
