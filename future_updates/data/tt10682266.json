It's simply a feel good, goofy, Adam Sandler Halloween movie. I loved it, glad I watched it."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Everybody watches Sandler's films to reduce cortisol n this one is a worthy entry for the Halloween season which can be enjoyed by the entire family.It has everything, costume parties, carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, kids on bicycles, lots of different masks, corn field maze, a werewolf, a psycho on the run, as well as fellas enjoying horror films at the drive ins n kids at home. It even has some nice cameos n a fat mom with lovely tshirts. The film moves at a steady pace, has lots of comedy n an enjoyable twist."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Sandler can actually be funny sometimes and the movie premise isn't terrible but why does he have to ruin everything he touches with ridiculously over-the-top voices? He got the balance right in Happy Gilmore but this one is hard to watch!"}, {"id": 3, "text": "I usually don't write a lot of reviews and I like to give most films the benefit of the doubt, but I just couldn't with this film. Every 10 minutes of this film, felt like an hour.Sandler's acting/voice was god awful. He is just cashing in the checks now. I tried to make myself laugh a few times throughout the film, but I just couldn't. I believe the film's cast and Netflix's marketing made gave this film, much more exposure than it truly deserved.I enjoyed a lot of Sandler's films in the 90's and early 00's, but this film was completely horrible. I hope Sandler is able to provide better quality films in the future. But for now, this is the content we are forced to view."}, {"id": 4, "text": "It has a lame scenario and it's a complete waste of such talented actors. Giving this movie a 2 is me being generous."}, {"id": 5, "text": "One thing you gotta tell yourself before watching this movie is its just some Halloween fun. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a nice time watching it. I did find some parts were slow but overall I got some good laughs here and there. I've watched Adam Sandler movies since Billy Madison came out in 1995. I believe this is the first movie with Adam Sandler and Julie Bowen since Happy Gilmore (1996) and I really enjoyed seeing them work together again after over 20 years. There are some Easter eggs hidden in this movie that connect some of Adams older movies, it was a nice stroll down memory lane when I noticed them, I don't wanna spoil them for you so see if you can spot them! If you're looking for an Oscar nominated picture possibility then this movie isn't for you. If you're looking for a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and for you to have a nice Halloween laugh and mini scare here and there, then pop some popcorn and enjoy Hubie Halloween! This isn't Adam's best movie but its not his worst either."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I like Adam Sandler most of the time, and wanted to like this Film. It's great that he brought all his friends in for this Movie, there are recognisable faces throughout this film, but i just found it slow, and within 30 mins i was looking at the clock and starting to skip bits with Adam doing the same push bike crash a few times in the first half hour, it had it's moments but hitting you over the head repeatedly with the morality story didn't help. You can look and sound stupid but be the smartest in the Town, and get the Girl. The entire Town bullied and berated him and it turns out they all have their own deficiencies and miserable lives when it comes down to it. Yaaay for Hubie!! Overall i have seen far better from Adam Sandler and worse too."}, {"id": 7, "text": "The movie could be better if they remove th lame voice of Adam Sandler's character. This movie is not funny at all. Using same type comedies as all previous Adam Sandler's movies. The story as well as all the characters are boring. I would not recommend this movie at all."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Unwatchable and I like Adam Sandler.Parts of it sounded like he was mumbling. Unwatchable as far as I was concerned."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I honestly thought this movie would be fun and great since I like a lot of Adam Sandler movies. Plus, with all the cast I was sure it would be amazing. Well, this was the worst movie I've ever seen. Every single thing about this movie was awful from start to finish. The plot was dull and confusing. Every side plot and main plot was abandoned throughout. Hubie's voice was just ridiculous. And the comedy, oh my was it bad. It felt like a two year old wrote it. The best thing about this movie was the Cameron Boyce tribute and the cast, even though the script was terrible. Overall, one star for the Halloween decor and sets."}, {"id": 10, "text": "I usually don't rate movies if I don't like them. But this is not good. Why the voice? Does he had a dissability? I don't understand. Please, don't let him make something like this again."}, {"id": 11, "text": "A family-fun Halloween adventure, that is saturated in Adam Sandler film actors/former-cast/nostalgia. While it's not going to win any major awards, and there's no dynamic acting or writing, this is probably what most Happy/Madison fans are excited to see. (And it seems suitable for family viewing)"}, {"id": 12, "text": "The movie itself it wasnt that bad tbh, but why for the love of god is he talking like that. The voice ruined most of the movie and fun. I wish he reads any of fan reviews so he knows he ruined the movie just by talking like that"}, {"id": 13, "text": "This is just absolute garbage. The whole town, adults and kids alike bully this guy relentlessly. How is that supposed to be funny? If you don't have a problem with that premise alone, you are a terrible person and should not reproduce.Using the voice and behaviors of a developmentally disabled person isn't funny, again it's cruel and sad.So much potential with the big budget and supporting cast, too bad someone allowed Adam Sandler to portray this kind of pitiful and relentlessly targeted character.Come on bro, retire this stupid played out voice and stick to making funny movies where the characters aren't the joke, the story is."}, {"id": 14, "text": "The only thing good about this movie is it's cast. It's a shame they chose to star in this. Not funny at all. Script is awful. You feel like your watching a kids movie with random adult comments chucked in just for the hell of it. The comments don't fit and are just really cringy to watch. Honestly would not waste any time watching this. I wish I could erase it from my memory."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Not funny! Boring, slow, and annoying. I use to enjoy Adam Sandler films but he tends to play the same dumb, slow talking, lisp having, water boy character over &amp; over...it's so tired and played out. This movie sucked!"}, {"id": 16, "text": "I gave it a 1 because you can't give it less. I like Sandler but this is beyond terrible"}, {"id": 17, "text": "Usually don't mind Adam Sandler movies but this is unwatchable. How did it ever get made? Makes a total joke out of the funding difficulties facing many film makers."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Again, for clarity..... literally the dumbest movie ever made."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I made it whole two minutes into the movie, because that how long it took them to resort to puke jokes. If you ever saw a Sandler movie, you know what to expect - but there's no reason we should somehow suddenly start to pretend it's anything but garbage."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I'm not sure why everyone is stressing out over the voice. That's one of Adam Sandlers biggest things, stupid voices are the heart and soul of his comedy. Come on guys, lighten up. Love the cast, fun Halloween film! Sandler fans will appreciate it."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Yes, Sandler movies are becoming something quite different than his old stuff, but of the newer comedies he's been releasing this one is much better. It gives one all of the goofy Halloween vibes you would need. Definitely a treat! There are great cameos of fan favorites. I appreciate the add in of classic Halloween music. I enjoyed the film. Was it perfect? No. Was it a guilty pleasure I'd like to view each Halloween season? For sure!A must see for anyone who enjoys kiddy Halloween in its goofy splendor! Add in Adam Sandler and you've got a recipe for the best monster mash for 2020!"}, {"id": 22, "text": "It's not a bad movie as long as your not expecting a masterpiece. It's a simple feel good movie that is good if you need something to watch also a great movie for Halloween time. Other than the voice I don't have too many complaints."}, {"id": 23, "text": "They just threw together a bunch of famous names but no effort put into the storyline at all. Not funny and increasingly boring. A waste of time."}, {"id": 24, "text": "For those who enjoy his movies, they will enjoy this 1 for sure. For those who dislike or hate his movies then obviously they won't like it and I find it rather rude that they take their time to come write bad reviews. If they already know they don't like his work then why bother watching it? They insult his intelligence but obviously theirs is rather lacking if they are watching something they know they will hate but do so anyways....The movie is jam packed with familiar faces that provide tons of nostalgia for the people who grew up watching his movies and similar movies."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Yes, maybe I get it about the voice, but cmon you guys. It wasn't the worst movie ever. You can have your opinions but if you really didn't like it, you also didn't have to watch it. I personally really loved it and I loved the ton of past movie sneak ins like Frankenstein and the wet bed sheet. Overall, funny and feel good movie"}, {"id": 26, "text": "These days when you sit to watch an Adam Sandler film in the comedy department, you don't know what to expect. His comedic sense is versatile.I'm glad to say that with Hubie Halloween it landed just at the right place for me.It's like a throw back to the type of tv late 80's and early 90's grew up on.If you used to enjoy stuff from Eerie, Indiana to Archie's Weird Mysteries you'll surely enjoy this movie!"}, {"id": 27, "text": "Firstly, what do you expect with an Adam sandler movie? The voice is annoying but he does it in others. If you love Halloween and stupid funny movies then try this. Yes some bits were stupid but overall it was entertaining and nice to have a Halloween movie that isn't scary.Plus I love all the throwbacks to his old films.And if you are like me and worried it might actually be scary, it is not."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Outdated, shallow, ugly, not funny. *THE VOICE* literally feels like this movie came out in 1996"}, {"id": 29, "text": "Laugh out loud adam sandler wholesomeness. So happy I watched it, but even happier it was made in the first place. My new favorite Halloween film aside from Charlie brown of course. Actually trick r treat is the best Halloween movie but that is more of a horror movie. This is for the whole family."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I felt like Adam Sandler was just playing a grown version of the Waterboy without the anger issues. Yes the voice is annoying....I think I laughed at Kevin James more than Adam Sandler. How do you go from Uncut Gems to this? Only he knows..I can't take him as a serious actor when he's releasing films like this....The film is mediocre at best. A lot of well known celebrities make cameo appearances. His two daughters and wife even play in the film. You can obviously tell who his daughters are. It has everything you would expect from a bad movie. Watch it because halloween is coming up but skip it otherwise. If you're watching it with children, they do make jokes about male body parts...pretty tasteless actually."}, {"id": 31, "text": "Great story here and the sets are amazing! Lots of great actors and I imagine they had a great time making this film. Suitable for all ages."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Flask is the main character in this movie. And it played well."}, {"id": 33, "text": "So many great actors delivering wooden dialogue from a terrible script.How did this film get made?"}, {"id": 34, "text": "For a non Adam Chandler fan, I only liked Don't mess with the Zohan, I really, really liked this movie. There is so much fun in this movie, for example, do not forget to read every t-shirt that's in this movie. The only downfall is the uneven balance of jokes between the first and last half, but that's all."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Remember how, back in the 90s, Adam Sandler kept making the same movie over and over again? Every film had quirky new characters and gags, but the same basic premise.Well, I'm glad he's still doing it! Hubie Halloween is hilarious.A lot of reviewers are saying this movie isn't as good as classics like Billy Madison or the Wedding Singer, but I disagree. It's a solid entry in the same vein. If you enjoyed the Waterboy but find Hubie Halloween offensive, I've got some news for you: The Sandman didn't fall off. You got uptight."}, {"id": 36, "text": "Honestly it's bad, Adam Sandler used to be mediocre and watchable he has managed to get worse by a long way. What is it with the voice"}, {"id": 37, "text": "Prices going up, they're paying Adam Sandler $275 million to make 4 movies. So he made 68 mil from this steaming pile. You go from Uncut Gems to the typical, idiotic Sandler movies that might as well be improvised and of course you've got Paul Blart in the movie, because he always casts his talentless, broke friends in all of his movies."}, {"id": 38, "text": "This movie was so bad. I couldn't even get 20 minutes into it. Can't understand half of what Sandler says. Terrible."}, {"id": 39, "text": "A truly terrible film as usual from Adam Sandler, I cannot understand why this man is still allowed to make films."}, {"id": 40, "text": "I'm so tired of Adam Sandler movies where he thinks it's hilarious to portray a disabled character and that be all the laughs of the film.This film had one tone all the way through, I'd hoped it would have elements of zoolander but it fell completely flat. It was so awful, and not even the funny kind of awful. It was just a never ending array of boring and offence.I was so let down as the cast was huge and great apart from Sandler- however his 'comedy' portrayal of disability honestly corrupted any funny moments.I couldn't wait for this film to end."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Alright Alright Alright I know it's a Sandler's movie but was straight trash , No Story, No attention to the casting ( All actors and actresses were from SNL and i love SNL more than anyone )It feels like someone told Sandler that i need a Halloween movie and Sandler just mixed everything he could get his hands on to make just a movie, like it was a sandwich or sth"}, {"id": 42, "text": "Adam sandler does a silly voice and pulls a face while getting into hijinx...That's itThat's the whole movie.Painful"}, {"id": 43, "text": "I love Adam Sandler, but this is the worst movie he's ever made. Recycled bad jokes from previous movies and an all star cast to to sadly go down hill with him. Not even one funny scene. Cringeworthy , stupid, boring and unfunny"}, {"id": 44, "text": "Never felt even tempted to smile at this-so pretty crap for a comedy. This was supposed to be a comedy, right? Terrible acting, even from actors who are normally good and should stay clear of such rubbish."}, {"id": 45, "text": "Had to put subtitles on because I couldn't understand what Adam was saying. His character is the same as most of his characters from previous movies - even the jokes are the same. He of course, has the same celebrity actors in this movie playing the some characters but with a different wardrobe. I couldn't figure out if this was purely made for 5 years and under or if it was just that bad!? I love Halloween - but this sucked!"}, {"id": 46, "text": "I usually love Adam Sandler but this was barely watchable. My husband and I were impressed we even had the ability to watch til the end.

Don't waste your time."}, {"id": 47, "text": "Adam's character's mom's T-shirts were the only highlight of this lowbrow loser of a movie. Don't waste your time. Any effort of any kind would have earned five stars, but there was absolutely no effort at all in this dumpster fire of movie."}, {"id": 48, "text": "Adam sandlers mocking character with special needs is an absolute disgrace in this uninspiring drab film.

But had been told its funny so gave it a go, really wish I didn't what a waste of time."}, {"id": 51, "text": "Worst movie i have watched in my life. There where a few funny parts but it was always when Sandler wasnt involved. Uber cringey, horrible script and Sandler.If you like the comedy of Luis CK, Bill Burr, Dave Chapelle, Trevor Noah, Jim Jefferies, Kevin Hart then avoid this movie, you will hate it and yourself."}, {"id": 52, "text": "Super funny movie. I wouldn't put it ahead of Sandler classics like Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison but it's definitely his best Netflix movie to date. The supporting cast was solid, particularly Steve Buscemi and Noah Schnapp, but Sandman steals the show."}, {"id": 53, "text": "It was funny, extremely entertaining, and one of his best comedies in years! It's the perfect thing to help people into the Halloween spirit! Yes it does have some jokes that don't land and some stupid moments, but it kind of adds to the charm so I don't really mind it. The cast was really good too, with some SNL alumni and Kenan Thompson is always a joy!A modern Halloween classic!I give it a 9 and a pretty high recommendation from me! Don't listen to the critics, watch it yourself before you judge it!"}, {"id": 54, "text": "Boring bland and pathetic. Don't watch the humor isn't present. Written for 5 year olds promoted for teens. Pathetic don't watch."}, {"id": 55, "text": "This felt like Adam Sandler woke up with a really bad hangover and was just like right, best make a film today I guessThis had so much potential but it just felt lazy and tired.It's like, what remaining pieces of effort he had, he left it all in uncut gems.It's like Ron Swanson would say don't try and half ass two things, whole ass one thing and do it well.Come on Adam I know you have a really good comedy left in you somewhere, possibly."}, {"id": 56, "text": "Adam Sandler movies are always hit or miss for me.

Sometimes you just need to laugh and not take things too seriously."}, {"id": 59, "text": "It makes me sad that there's still people in this world that are SO critical. I'm sure they didn't make this movie hoping for it to be Oscar worthy. It's just a fun Halloween movie! You clearly didn't watch the end of the movie where the message was to just be KIND. I loved this movie! It was cute and funny and had a great message."}, {"id": 60, "text": "It's as though Billy Madison and the Waterboy took all the least likeable, least funny parts of themselves and spewed this out. Even Sandler's normal cadre of friends seem bored with this one. The only semi-relatable characters are the foster kids, who are far more mature than any of the adults in this film."}, {"id": 61, "text": "The movie had its lol moments but.....the voice. It's time to retire that voice. It ruined the movie. Hard to watch."}, {"id": 62, "text": "I knew I wasn't going to watch a 'good' movie so I decided to have my drink with me and try to have fun but that wasn't enough.

Nothing but a waste of time."}, {"id": 63, "text": "Adam Sandler was great in the 90s! In the 90s, and not now. If I want to see a goofy talking Sandler character, I'll rewatch the Waterboro.

Adam Sandler knows how to have fun."}, {"id": 65, "text": "As usual, Adam Sandler movie is very good at entertaining, the comedy, i very get that, for the acting especially Adam Sandler himself is kinda weird and disturbing, the way he talk in this movie is just weird, why i give seven in a half in this movie is the message in the ending is very good i like it, overall it's entertaining"}, {"id": 66, "text": "A funny Halloween comedy from Adam Sandler and the crew. Solid production and good cameos from Steve Buscemi and Ray Liotta. It had Some laugh of loud moments and it's a pretty childish movie but it's good entertainment and I enjoyed it.

I haven't laughed any single time. I thought Sandler would play in a good movie like Murder mystery, but this wasn't the case despite all the budget put in it. Bad sense of humor, and the worst sense of romance I have seen since The Nutty Professor. Lost Saturday night with that crap"}, {"id": 69, "text": "Hey internet I have seen people ripping this movie. It is hilarious I couldn't stop laughing. It's not meant to be an Oscar winner it's just supposed to be mindless fun.

It is about an old man who is mocked in town for being mentally retarded and everything scares him, everyone makes fun of him and on Halloween night he tries to solve a mystery.

I don't know if the voice was supposed to be funny or if they thought it would add to Hubie's quirky demeanor but it just didn't work.Some people wrote that the critiques are too harsh but I disagree. Personally, I did enjoy some of Adam Sandler's movies and I usually don't even mind him doing silly voices but in this movie it didn't make any sense. There are some nice references and like I said the movie has its funny moments but all in all, it was very slow and boring."}, {"id": 97, "text": "I lost interest in 10 minutes, it's worse than you expect and I preferred Jack and Jill, that should be enough of explanation."}, {"id": 98, "text": "Stupid funny movie with some classic sandler references.

So many callbacks and it reminds me of water boy. There might be some cringy scenes but the rest of the movie is filled with fun and a mystery.

I also found the plot to be a bit strange because of the fact that everyone hates Hubie.But I have to say, the cast was quite good and the horror element mixed with the comedy element worked in this film.

It's a streaming, Netflix 8, not big blockbuster pay $50 at the theater 8. Anyone who gives it a bad review clearly doesn't know much about today's films or Sandler's work.

Once you get over Sandler's voice (which isn't that bad) and the fact that the townspeople are awful lol, this movie actually is a decent story. It surprised me a few times and though it took a bit to get going, I found myself cracking up at some of the jokes.

In my opinion, mu h more could have been done with these tools. All-in-all I would call this movie a predictable, enjoyable, Star-filled, seasonal, Sandler-medy with added censorship of 'safe-speak' resulting from current political environment; great for cooking or doing something else while watching, and shouldn't be taken critically; Then can be a lot of fun.

Everyone liked it a lot. It's one of his better movies. Has a great cast. Super cliche which is what makes it great. It will probably be a movie you watch every Halloween because it's the perfect family Halloween show.

Sandler's Hubie is a strange but ultimately lovable creation, and all the other characters were very likable.There is a very big twist at the end, which I really didn't see coming, and I very much loved this film, and while it certainly won't be everyone's cup of Halloween tea, for me it does for Halloween what A Christmas Story does for Christmas.

And as a result its an unfunny, unoriginal and terrible movie with the worst performance by Adam Sandler in his whole career. And the voice he uses might make you want to slam your head onto the nearest flat surface. He plays Hubie Dubois who seems to be the most unlikeable and hated person living in Salem and yet he is described as the nicest person by a girl he had a crush on in high school. He appears as somewhat mentally challenged and acts as a Haloween monitor who realises there is a monster roaming in his town on haloween night and people are disappearing.Overall there is not a single funny moment when Adam Sandler was onscreen. All the other actors were ok and clearly they did this because they know him and got easy money. Unfortunately whenever they were about to elevate the movie from being utter tripe Hubie shows up onscreen and ruins any humor.

I'm a huge Julie Bowen fan, and I loved on Modern Family, but she is completely wasted... and thoroughly unconvincing as the hot mom figure who secretly harbors a crush on Adam Sandler's hopeless idiot character. Anyone with a third of a brain and an ounce of self-respect wouldn't be attracted to the Hubie Dubois character in the least, but Bowen's character, Violet Valentine, has the same crush on Hubie that he has for her, although both are unaware of this unspoken attraction for one another.There's nothing in this movie that we haven't seen from Adam Sandler 5,000 times already. Help from real-life buddies Kevin James, Tim Meadows, Maya Rudolph, and Ben Stiller is futile, as they aren't any funnier than Sandler is in this crap fest.

Every time I watch an Adam Sandler movie, I'm left with the good feels and uplifted attitude.Adam once again plays an outcast who lives with his mom; it's very reminiscent of the Waterboy. His character, Hubie, is a kind man with a heart of gold who only wants his hometown of Salem to have a happy and safe Halloween and is abused because of his eccentricity.However, the movie is heartwarming and hilarious; it features regulars from Sandler's circle and they don't disappoint.

I mean, I think at one point, there was a sword thrown. I get it, it was crazy over the top stuff. I laughed. But, it was just to much.There were so many things that just existed for no reason other than to exist. I mean, a bunch of stuff went nowhere.The way his lady friend talked about him, it was like, meant to sound fake. Which is odd.I liked how so many people, who have worked together in the past or are always a part of one another's movies were together. It brought back so many memories of when my dad, brother and I would go see Sandler movies in the late 90s.

But still there are so many smug types that somehow ridiculously expect some huge swings into left field for his Netflix original comedies. Obviously he's shown incredible versatility in his career but people should be able to gauge by the trailer and it being part of his Netflix contract that these aren't Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, or Uncut Gems. Know what you're getting. The snobs that hate Sandler are the types that would go into an Applebee's and expect a five star meal.This film sticks to classic Sandler formulas which isn't an issue imo. A humble basic story about an odd yet lovable main character that finds himself in the middle of a series of hilarious problems. Along the way he runs into other weird zany characters and maybe a few villains that join in on or his hilarious antics. The actors are the usual Sandler friends that he's had in other films.Overall its just a nice comfort Halloween themed Sandler comedy that shouldn't be taken so seriously by snobby critics that can't grasp the point of these films after all these years. Throw it on and forget about the world."}, {"id": 776, "text": "Another in a long list of disappointing recent movies. In a continuing attempt to find something worth watching in the last few years I was hopeful here.I like Halloween, and typically I have liked Adam Sandler. I couldn't agree more with the other reviews that his stupid voice almost ruined the movie immediately. It is so obvious fake, and often hard to understand, ruining the whole movie before it starts. Tried to fight past that to see some really gross stuff that wasn't funny and clearly just looking for lazy laughs.Usually in these movies there is a good turning point where things start to go better for the main character, until ultimately the movie finishes with a conclusion making you feel like the main character won.In this movie, everyone loses. The performers, the director, and certainly the audience. This isn't a spoiler, just a fact."}, {"id": 777, "text": "So Adam Sandler said if he didn't win the Oscar for his performance in Uncut Gems then he was going to make the worst film ever and here it is Hubie Halloween and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a man who loves Halloween but ridiculed amongst his town have to save the people from certain peril.Main Character It must be rare to see an actor give one of the best performances of the year for a film and then also give one of the worst performances of the year in another but Sandler has managed to do it. He is so bad here, it is like he is trying to challenge Water Boy but it doesn't work here in this day and age and it is horrendous here. The voice is so weird and he is actually quite hard to understand and even though you are clearly meant to care, never for one minute did I care about him, also for a guy who loves Halloween so much why does he get so scared of everything, it makes no sense.Supporting Characters There are some fun supporting characters here, mainly because of the shock value that they would actually be a part of this film, I mean it is full of comedic talent and they rise the film up a bit but not much. I don't want to spoil them just in case you don't know, because I didn't know and it made me enjoy this film a little bit, but then there are some really bad performances. Kevin James is used to being in Sandler films and he is just not funny here, he just phones it in and is happy to get another paycheck in another terrible film. Julie Bowen who I actually think is funny in Modern Family is also really bad here, she is so over the top and the writing for her character is also bad and makes her just seem so stupid.Story The story actually has quite a nice story to it about accepting others and not being mean to them due to insecurities about yourself, but that is all it has. The relationships between the characters is poor and the twist involving the villains is unnecessary and actually makes no sense and makes you scratching your head as to why certain things are here. I mean there is this romance between these two kids and it is such a weird thing to add here and adds nothing to the film at all, it feels like they had a 45 minute plot and had to pad out the remaining hour to make it a feature length film.Script Now the most important thing in a comedy, unless I have it wrong is to make you laugh and this film didn't make me laugh once, which means it fails. It is basic and not good humour, I would say it was made for kids but then it makes adult jokes and you just aren't sure who the hell this movie is for and why it even exists.Style Now the most important thing of a horror film is to be scary and this film fails that as well, so it fails as a comedy and a horror so this style is all over the place. Things just aren't scary or spooky at all and it makes this film feel way longer then it has any right to be and just don't bother with it.Overall Well I don't think it is the worst film ever but it is still awful and should be avoided at all cost. I know people will tell me just to turn my mind off and enjoy it for what it is, but no that excuse didn't work for The Wrong Missy and it doesn't work here and hopefully this crew just stops making these comedies and retire so we don't have to put up with this any more."}, {"id": 778, "text": "Instead of Sandler playing the typical single guy with an anger streak but a heart of gold who meets a girl, falls in love with girl, loses girl then wins girl back, he's instead made a poor mans sequel to The Water Boy.Sandler has phoned this one in, and trying over the top cartoon law for gags and failing miserbly to try and lift the ducked projectiles gags from Animal House and driven it into the ground. Then slap a horrible beard on Kevin James and he's thankful someone is still dumb enough to give his has-been career a paycheck.This movie proves that Sandler just knows enough people now and has enough family to get any old garbage he wants to be made on film. Please, will someone tell Sandler to stop already and not attempt to write another movie unless it really feels like it should be made.This one feels like rehashed ideas already seen before, but not in a fun nostalgia way or revisit... it instead stinks of desperation.I'm not a Sandler hater btw... but his last few movies have been pretty bad. Just whatever can be thought up on the spot to do another film with a co-star that was a success in the past... but by God, this one just digs it's own grave and covers itself up. Its the worst Sandler film since Going Overboard."}, {"id": 779, "text": "It really baffles me when people who claim to be Adam Sandler fans, give poor reviews of his movies, claiming to be 'disappointed'. What were you expecting from an Adam Sandler Halloween flick? A coming-of-age comedy drama? A complex character study?I give this a 7/10 because I judged it exactly how it should be judged. If all Adam Sandler's comedy movies were judged on whether or not they compare to the truly great films of our time, then 90% of them would score 1/10. At a push. But films shouldn't be judged that way - they should be judged on whether or not they achieved what they were trying to achieve.This brings me onto comedy movies - and I mean comedy movies. Not 'dramedies' or other genuinely serious, dramatic films with some small comedic elements - but 100%, straight down the line, out-and-out comedy movies. These types of films shouldn't be judged in the same way we judge dramatic cinema.The brand of comedy Adam Sandler uses most of the time, is 'slapstick comedy'. It's not to everyone's taste, nor is it the most nuanced form of comedy - but it undoubtedly has it's place in cinema and TV, and it's served Mr Sandler well. Very well, in fact. Disappointed 'fans' of his who are giving this film poor reviews probably aren't, in fact, fans at all.This brings me onto 'Hubie Halloween'. A textbook Adam Sandler slapstick comedy flick, that follows a middle-aged man as he's subjected to mockery and bullying by the locals in his town, as a result of his nerdy appearance, and his obsession with health and safety - particularly when Halloween comes around. This year however, mystery ensues as Herbie investigates a number of sinister events that take place on the night of October 31st.Of all the comedy films in Adam Sandler's back catalogue, Hubie Halloween probably borrows more from 'Murder Mystery' than any other. If 'Murder Mystery' was a spoofy, slapstick take on the classic, Agatha Christie-esque 'whodunnit' genre, then 'Hubie Halloween' is very much a light hearted spoof of the 'comedy horror' style that was famously re-popularised by the 'Scary Movie' franchise - the difference being that any spoofing in 'Hubie Halloween' is of the films of Adam Sandler himself. One of the many Easter Eggs coming in the opening scene of the film - which, without spoiling it, will be sure to please fans of Happy Gilmore!This isn't one of Sandler's best comedy films, but it certainly isn't one of his worst either. Whilst Hubie Halloween won't have you 'belly-laughing' from beginning to end, there is enough solid material throughout to keep audiences amused. It's a fun, lighthearted piece of cinema that has exactly what it's supposed to have - jokes, slapstick comedy, silliness, wackiness, lightheartedness, and a plot that is interesting and captivating enough to keep us - the audience - interested.On this basis, I give Hubie Halloween a solid 7/10. It's silly, and it knows its silly. It's wacky, and it knows it's wacky. It achieves exactly what it's trying to achieve, and that's good enough for me. Bravo!"}, {"id": 780, "text": "I like Adam Sandler so I was excited for Hubie Halloween although it doesn't look good. I expected another okay comedy and that's what I got.I recently read an article on Sandler which states he keeps on phoning it in which is true. Sandler talks in a goofy accent here so you can't always understand him but I understood him for the most part. The cast is fine including Kevin James whom I don't like and Julie Bowen who worked with Sandler on Happy Gilmore. No spoilers but there's another Happy Gilmore connection.The plot is weak and absurd which I expected. This movie is just a bunch of jokes mainly Hubie being mocked and scared. No spoilers but there's a kissing scene so cringey it's funny. There are a few plot elements that doesn't make sense.Overall, Hubie Halloween is entertaining but forgettable. It's aimed at teens but it's not extremely crude. I understand why some hate Hubie so you may want to skip it. Keep in mind Hubie was made before Uncut Gems was released. I just heard Sandler is making another drama which is nice."}, {"id": 781, "text": "If you are like me and work with special needs kids you may be put off by Sandler once again playing a mentally impaired man. Yet there is something different in this role he has played, the goofy things you would expect from an Adam Sandler film exists here in Hubie Halloween but there is more behind it. Hubert Dubois is a mentally challenged man living with his mother in Salem Massachusetts, he has a bright personality and a crush on a sweet mom of three two of which are adopted named Violet Valentine. He lives for Haloween and lights up with joy at the excitement of his annual job of providing safety to his community. The people don't see from his point of view... without giving away too much of the film know this, Hubie is treated like garbage, assaulted, bullied, and not respected. But he seems to be unphased as a man with special needs, he doesn't see the hatred as a treat to himself he continues to remain pure and devoted to the people... no matter what. I give this ten out of ten because I cried... I cried because this man is so special and people don't want to see it because it exposes their own insecurities. People with mental disabilities are challenged like Hubie, they are challenged by the insensitivities of a select few in their community. So I ask to see beyond your opinion of an Adam Sandler film and notice the lessons to be learned, A mother's love can know no boundaries, be kind no matter what, fall in love with yourself, and let who you are shine out over those who deserve it or even those who do not.

Almost like it's promoting abuse as funny.The humor is questionable at points, but the majority of the movie is really enjoyable with a pretty well written script and some really great moments throughout the movie.As it moves into a mystery movie it relies less on the investigation and traditional drip feeding of information on discovery and more of a battle against almost everyone in the town basically wanting Hubie dead.

If you really think this is the worst movie ever then you obviously haven't seen very many movies - or taken any chances on different or independent movies which can be very hit or miss - so why should I care about your opinion since you don't know what you're talking about and have no perspective. When you clicked on an Adam Sandler Netflix comedy you should have known what you were in for and if you're hard to please then watch the trailer first so you can make a more informed decision about whether or not this is a movie for you. No, it's not a piece of brilliant filmmaking, I gave it a high rating because I personally liked it a lot, but if you thought it was a *1* then in my opinion you've got no business rating movies because you're not capable of a level-headed or proportional review."}, {"id": 786, "text": "This movie is Adam Sandler being Adam Sandler from the 90s.

There will definitely be at least one moment where you laugh out loud.Story is actually pretty decent. First the movie does a good job of introducing the characters and building Hubie's character.

I'm 34 and my wife and I watched it with our six kids, aged from 6 to 17, and we all loved it. us older ones laughed at the more adult jokes while my youngest daughter loved the slapstick comedy of Adam Sandler getting scared by puppets and falling over.

I don't like much from the guy but the Grown Ups movies were some of my favorite comedies of all time, and this movie seems a lot like those, even using a lot of the secondary actors from Grown Ups 2 like Steve Buschemi and Tim Meadows.Also a cool easter egg my eldest daughter picked up on, in Hubie Halloween Ben Stiller plays a mental hospital attendant named Hal, and in Happy Gilmore Stiller played a nursing home attendant named Hal, and both characters have the same moustache."}, {"id": 790, "text": "Adam,I am grateful you have taken the time to make a fun Halloween movie.

Some work for me even though they fail for others, and some make me want to put my fist through the TV screen. I was leery of Hubie Halloween, but my wife is an avid fan of Halloween and likes movies that explore the holiday, so we gave it a shot. There are small moments of the old Adam Sandler magic in this film that I tried to cling to and enjoy. Some comedic bits work because they are so ridiculous that they feel like something out of a Mel Brooks parody film. I must admit I had some hearty laughs at the running gags, and the way they would escalate the jokes. For example, there was something that tickled me about a thermos that acts like a Swiss army knife with all its uses. Plus the whole mystery that is built up throughout the film was decent, even if it was predictable. Watching antagonistic people get payback for their actions isn't so bad.The biggest detriment to Hubie Halloween was Adam Sandler himself. I cannot figure out why he insists on these terrible voices in some films, but it's kind of astounding that he hasn't realized what works in a 5-minute SNL sketch doesn't translate to a 100-minute movie. I got so annoyed every time Hubie spoke because of that dumb speech pattern. The character could be funny and downright endearing if he would just play it straight, or make him a bit childish and naive but without the stupid way of talking. The ending also becomes less satisfying and less realistic because of his acting choices. Kevin James is also a trainwreck in Hubie Halloween. He's intended to be an obnoxious character, so I guess he was successful, but I didn't think he fit in with any of the other people in the movie. Admittedly, I didn't hate Hubie Halloween as much as the truly atrocious Adam Sandler films, but it also won't become an annual holiday tradition for us to watch it each year."}, {"id": 792, "text": "I see by its score here that many people did not care for this film, and my question to them is why did you bother watching it? Adam Sandler has been around for a while now and has made numerous movies, so by now you should really know whether or not you are going to enjoy a movie by him or not. I am not his biggest fan, but then, I usually find my comedy from stuff like MST3K and Rifftrax rather than a movie. I watched this one, only because my wife started watching it and it caught my attention when I saw Ben Stiller at the beginning with that horrible mustache! So I watched and while it was silly and goofy and immature, it also provided a nice distraction from a very bad work week for me.The story starts out with a person escaping a mental institution and then switches to Hubie, a person who is a super nice guy who likes looking out for others, but who gets picked on constantly by the town bullies even at his advanced age. Well, a guy trying to play a prank on Hubie in a corn maze gets taken by something and soon so do others. Hubie suspects it is his new neighbor who may be a werewolf, the town officer thinks it is the escaped mental patient from the beginning and soon they will find out the truth!The cast is rather good as it was fun to see a lot of the old Saturday Night Live alum in roles as well as Sandler perennials Steve Buschemi and Kevin James. One person who I kept expecting to show up was David Spade, but he was curiously absent from this one, unless I just missed him some how.So, it is not a super great comedy at all, but I enjoyed it for what it was. I thought the story was harmless enough and I liked the ending as the mother had a really funny line about her destination. It plays out like one of the those films in the 90's featuring a popular Saturday Night Live character in a full movie and like those, it does get a bit too long in the tooth; however, Sandler's Hubie has a bit more depth than girl who folds her arms and the two clubbing brothers. Though, that is not really saying much now is it? In the end, pretty much your typical Sandler character movie, by that I mean he does a voice and tries to be someone totally different rather than when he plays just a regular guy like in Grown Ups or Big Daddy."}, {"id": 793, "text": "This movie seemed like it was going to break 2020 with this amazing cast from great actors such as Adam Sandler, Noah Schnapp, Peyton List, Maya Rudolph, etc. I am a bit dissatisfied with the movie here's why...

The voice he did throughout made me have to keep on the CC so I can understand him.Hubie was the main character and I feel like every other character got only 10 min of screen time in the whole show. Some cast members were barely even shown.The plot could have been 1000% better if they added a spin off on the psych war escapee with making them a huge part in the film.The message in the movie was amazing and showed how kindness is amazing and if everyone is kind we will love ourselves.Overall, I believe with everything the director was given, this movie could have been the best movie ever, but it was hard to follow."}, {"id": 794, "text": "Silly, stupid, but ultimately more bareable to watch than most of his film's- Sandler's latest flick has a decent amount of humor in it that surprisingly lands, although it certainly isn't great or even good in any way. What I love most about this film was Steve Bechumi's performance as Walter Lambert. He honestly steals the show in every scene he takes a part of, and is the most enjoyable part of this film. Sandler's weird voice can be a bit of an annoyance after a while, for some it may even be from the very get go, but Sandler does bring humanity to the character in a nice, if corny, sort of way. This film also stars frequent Sandler alum Kevin James, Rob Schneider, and Shaq who I guess can be considered one now too for some reason. For the most part all of them prove to be quite funny. I wasn't a huge fan of Tim Meadows or Julie Bowen's performance throughout, nothing I hadn't seen before anyway, but I did enjoy the cameo of Ben Stiller at the beginning- which for some, just may make their day. This film is packed with stars, insults, and gags- and I can say that some of it works. It's not much I suppose in a turn of film, but I was entertained watching it. I was never bored, and there's some continuing gags I chuckled along with throughout. The visuals are nice, and there certainly is a fun feeling of nostalgia present throughout the film, which I think any fan of Sandler's, halloween, or both will enjoy. In the end, Hubie Halloween is nothing special, but it's Sandler's best comedy film in quite a while. That may not mean much, but it proves to be, for the most part a decent watch, and if worse comes to worse, a fun movie to have on in the background.

But when news of an asylum patient escaping, a possible werewolf, and people going missing, it is up to Hubie to figure out what exactly is going on in the town of Salem.Well, first of all, if you love Adam Sandler movies, you will probably like this film. If you are not a fan of Adam Sandler comedies, then you will not like this film. Personally, I am always in the middle of the arguement when it comes to Adam Sandler comedies and this film is no exception. The humor in this film is the type of humor you would expect out of an Adam Sandler comedy. Bodily function humor is mostly the type of humor in these type of films and in the first few minutes of this film you will get bodily function jokes. Which is largely unfunny. Humor like that is not clever and when it comes to Adam Sandler comedies, I always expect those type of jokes. But I will give Hubie Halloween credit because this film does get some laughs out of me. (More than I would care to admit). Now, the humor is really good when something completely random happens and catches the viewer off guard. There are several moments where that happens and it is still not clever but it is better than the immature bodily function humor that is in a majority of Sandler comedies. With that being said, this is probably the best Sandler comedy to come out in recent years (and that is saying a lot and also not saying very much either). Most of the time Adam Sandler himself is not funny (actually the supporting cast is funnier and I do give them credit here). The acting is what you would mostly expect in an Adam Sandler comedy. The characters are the same. But there are some things that I have to point out. First of all, why is everyone a huge jerk to Hubie? Everyone pretty much bully poor Hubie for no apparant reason. It does not make a whole lot of sense. Also, this is one of those Adam Sandler films where he talks in a voice that is mostly hard to understand. It can get annoying but it is not close to how annoying as his Jill voice from Jack and Jill. Another thing is Hubie's crush. First of all, her character sucks. But the point I am trying to get at is that, why does Hubie have to worry about her not liking him? It appears that she already likes him and she does not appear to ever have disliked him so why didn't she marry him beforehand? Pointless.... Like I said earlier, the supporting cast is funnier than Sandler most of the time here. The story was kind of a downer (though that probably should not come as any surprise). Before watching this film, I had no idea what this film was about and had this idea that it was gonna be like a Goosebumps type of story (honestly that would be pretty cool the more I think about it). When the film first starts, it appears it might be that way. We have someone escaping an asylum. But all of that adds up to nothing really. The film does have suspense at certain points in the film. The ending is kind of a downer and tries to have this message about bullying which is something that is important to talk about, but I am not sure if this is the right film for that. People have Halloween traditions where they watch a specific Halloween themed movie every Halloween whether it be A Nightmare Before Christmas, Hocus Pocus, or even John Carpenter's Halloween. Hubie Halloween is not a film that would be a Halloween tradition (at least for me). I don't think it captures the Halloween spirit as well as some of the Halloween classics that have become a tradition.For many, Hubie Halloween is just another Adam Sandler movie. But for me, it made me laugh more than I would like to admit. It is not anywhere clsoe to being great but it is definitely not the worst Adam Sandler film."}, {"id": 796, "text": "Basically the same quirky character as The Water Boy, or Canteen Boy from SNL, add in a Halloween theme with some childish spookiness to it, and that's what you got with this movie. It's not really that funny and is just another movie where Sandler can get his friends and former/current SNL personalities involved to produce something that ultimately he gets paid for either way as executive producer and actor.Included are: Kevin James just hanging on to his career however he can at this point. Same goes for Rob Schneider, a regular cameo staple in all Sandler movies. Gratuitous involvement by Steve Buscemi, Maya Rudolph, and Tim Meadows. A smattering of Kenan Thompson, Colin Quinn, Blake Clarke, Shaq, and Dan Patrick.Throw in the mom from Modern Family, Julie Bowen, and the cast has recognizable faces but the rest of the story is straight trash. Jokes that land are in the form of sarcastic snipes at Hubie and Hubie right back, but the rest is flat and boring.Lastly, a lot of people are asking, why the voice and if you have to ask that, then you'd have to ask it for movies like The Water Boy, Little Nicky, and Don't Mess With The Zohan. It's a personal choice to deviate the character from his normal characters. He tends to do this more with socially maladjusted characters or characters that are introverted or rejects. If you don't know by now then you have only started watching Sandler movies.Bottomline, if you're an avid Sandler fan, you'll watch it for better or worse. You may hate this trash, but you'll watch it anyway. If you're not a fan, then you'll absolutely hate this and turn it off after a few minutes."}, {"id": 797, "text": "Compared to recent Sandler comedies; Hubie Halloween is actually decent, with laugh out loud moments and a sweet message to go with it.In this comedy film, a man constantly mocked by his hometown, will stop at nothing to save Halloween when things begin to get spooky in town.It's not one of Adam Sandler's best comedies, but Hubie Halloween has an endearing quality to it that you simply can't resist. I had a few good laughs throughout and there's a decent enough spooky twist in the end. I believe the issue is that Sandler's antics don't come across like they would've maybe 20 years ago. Is it ok to make fun of a middle aged man with some sort of mental issue? No. That's where the message comes in to explain to younger viewers bullying is not ok in any shape or form. Sandler needs to continue focusing on roles in drama films, which he absolutely kills. A decent enough spooky comedy to get you through a Friday or Saturday night.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"}, {"id": 798, "text": "It's that time of year again - Halloween, the time of year when we spend far too much on costumes that we wear once and eat so many sweets that we're literally sweating sugar. It's also the time of year were we spend countless hours watching horror films, and it's also the time when we get stupid comedies that aren't so bad that they're good, they are just bad. Hubie Halloween the latest Adam Sandler and Netflix team up 'comedy' is just that. Last year Sandler built himself a reputation as a guy who can actually act given the right material as the gambling jeweler in Uncut Gems. So good of a reputation in fact that he was praised for his good work, this is perhaps the opposite. It's not the Safdie Brothers' literal diamond mine of a film...nope Hubie is the bad mine, the one with no diamonds and should be condemned. Sandler is Hubie a devout Halloween connoisseur who is picked on and teased by the entire town of Salem, Massachusetts. He's essentially the same character as in Waterboy or Little Nicky or maybe even Billy Maddison you know that kind of annoying character that you just want to smack in the chops and hope they never speak again. But unlike the aforementioned Maddison who is actually good Hubie is awful in comparison, he's the kind of person you only see in a bad dream. And that's exactly what this film is, it's a bad dream. It's not funny, or charming and has about as much personality as a cigarette that was stomped out 20 years ago, around the time Sandler did this type of film. It seems like history is repeating itself, but then that much was clear for Sandler more than 10 crappy 'comedies' ago. 1/5. Just a stubied waste."}, {"id": 799, "text": "This is no Water Boy but the main character Hubie is supposed to be at that level of stupid. Yet, he owns a deli/supermarket? and everyone in the town dislikes him? makes fun of him?The all-star cast is impressive. I'm guessing Sandler pulled out all his favors with the number of A-list stars.I don't care for the bullying and the kids being disrespectful to the main character. I get it, kids will cause mischief, but they have a roaming gang of these bullies and the parents and law enforcement does nothing? Is this supposed to be reflective of Salem?I did not like this movie. The kids might and simple minded people, also the fanboys of Sandler's sense of humor, but I did not care for it. It has no structure and no purpose. It is lacking in substance. A movie made of just visual gags doesn't work."}, {"id": 800, "text": "Well, I guess this is back to normal.I have not seen Uncut Gems, but I have heard some high praise for the Sandman regarding that film, some going as far as to claim he should have been nominated by the Academy for his role. Again, I can't judge here, but the Adam Sandler that I saw in Hubie Halloween looks much more like the Adam Sandler I know of than the Adam Sandler that is out there contending for prestigious awards.It's a messy and clich\u00e9d screenplay, it's stupid, it's cheesy, it's everything you expect it to be. Is there some fun to be had too? Absolutely. In fact, I will even praise this film for effectively building the small-town Halloween night atmosphere. It's colorful and full of costumes and decorations, which makes it, in a way, the perfect watch for this time of the year (at least if you can manage to refrain from using your three pounds of grey matter for an hour-and-a-half).Well then, if it's entertaining enough, why is my score so low? I will admit, I considered rating the film a bit higher for most of the runtime... until we got to one of the most ridiculous, cheesy finales that I've seen in a long time. Maybe Sandler is only trying to make fun of the genre, but is he really? I'm not entirely convinced. In the end, this is a decently fun Halloween watch, but a totally skippable movie."}, {"id": 801, "text": "This is a movie that I really only watched because of my Halloween episode for Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast. I realized that I needed to do something for the holiday and I couldn't find a 2020 release that was focused on it. This one I really debated hard and figured it would be horror enough. The synopsis here is despite his devotion to his hometown of Salem (and its Halloween celebration), Hubie Dubois (Adam Sandler) is a figure of mocker for kids and adults alike. But this year, something is going bump in the night and it's up to Hubie to save Halloween.We start this off at a mental hospital. Orderly Hal (Ben Stiller) busts into a room to find that the resident there is missing. He calls it in that Richie Hartman (Rob Schneider) has escaped. This information gets relayed that he's coming back to Salem to the officer in charge, Sgt. Steve Downey (Kevin James).In this town though, we're following around Hubie. He loves the holiday, but he's bullied by everyone. We see him as he has to dodge things that kids throwing at him, one of which is Andy O'Doyle (Tyler Crumley). Hubie is great at avoiding things, but he tends to get distracted and crash his bike. The first time is due to seeing Violet Valentine (Julie Bowen). He's had a crush on her since the second grade and she was the nicest girl in school.Some background here is that Violet was married to Sgt. Downey. They're now divorced and she has adopted 3 children. There is Tommy (Noah Schnapp), Danielle (Sadie Sandler) and Cooky (Sunny Sandler). She has a crush on Hubie, but he doesn't seem to notice it.Hubie really has a rough go at it though and I can't stress that enough. He is bullied by Mr. Landolfa (Ray Liotta), Mrs. Hennessey (Maya Rudolph), Lester Hennessey (Tim Meadows), Father Dave (Michael Chiklis), Deli Mike Mundi (Karan Brar) and pretty much all the kids too. He just wants everyone to enjoy Halloween and despite what he goes through, he keeps a positive outlook. He also has his Inspector Gadget thermos that is like a Swiss army knife and has different machines that can be used from it.He does still live with his mother, June Squibb. She wants him to toughen up before she passes on, but it doesn't seem likely. Things start to get weird though when Walter Lambert (Steve Buscemi) moves in next door. He says some weird things to Hubie about ignoring weird sounds coming from his house. There is also Richie Hartman coming back as well.Halloween starts off as it normally does with Hubie out trying to police people to do the right things. We learn that he's a bit of a snitch, which doesn't help him. People around him start to disappear. He thinks it is Walter and Hubie believes him to be a werewolf. What is really happening on this spooky night in Salem?Upon finishing this movie, it is really hard to call this a horror movie. I'm still going to include it as it does play with a lot of elements and since I would consider Ernest Scared Stupid, then I have to include this. It really is in the same vein as like Hocus Pocus in that it is a family friendly horror movie. What is weird is that it feels like if you watered down Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore so you could watch it with children of all ages.There is a good Halloween feel here though for sure. Placing it in Salem was good. Having the backdrop of witches, werewolves or something supernatural really helps there. Don't come in expecting it to be too scary though, because you will be disappointed. What I will give though is the uplifting message it gives. Hubie is bullied his whole life, but no matter what he stays positive. It is easier said than done for sure. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I teared up a bit at the end.What did make me chuckle here is all the references to previous movies from Sandler's universe. James obvious has been in Grown-Ups. Bowen was in Happy Gilmore. Buscemi and Schneider are long time guys who've made at least cameos in many of his films. Meadows knew them as well from Saturday Night Live. They brought back O'Doyle from Billy Madison. Stiller is his character from Happy Gilmore. It also seems like there's a person dressed in a haunted house as the demon like things from Little Nicky.There are also references in my opinion to classic horror films as well. Not necessarily a horror film, but there's the troupe that Hubie is the boy who cried wolf with his snitching on people. Richie Hartman acts similar to Michael Myers from Halloween. He is wearing a pig mask which could be Motel Hell or Saw. There's a car scene similar to Christine. There is also another aspect with tracing a phone call to be like Black Christmas. I'm also thinking with the radio station is homage to The Fog. There is a reveal that I can't here without going into spoilers, but it is another from the slasher genre. Another that isn't a movie reference is the call letters to the radio station are WTCH.I'll move this over to the acting. It was fun. No one really stood out or do anything to blow me away. Sandler is playing another of his characters, just doing the voice a bit different. James is fine as this peaked in high school cop. Bowen is still quite attractive. She does a lot of overacting. Liotta, Buscemi, Schneider, Rudolph, Meadows, Chiklis, Squibb, George Wallace, Kenan Thompson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kym Whitley, Lavell Crawford, Dan Patrick and the rest are all fine in their cameo roles. I did have to confirm it first, Paris Berelc is quite attractive.There's not really a lot in the way of effects. The look and feel of Halloween is there. That ambience works for me. The CGI used for Hubie when he's dodging things is a bit much and didn't really hold up. I'm not a big fan of the cheesiness with his thermos that he has. There is a supernatural aspect that I think they should have a fleshed out a bit. I think I get what they're meaning, but something more would have worked better. The cinematography is fine aside from that.I will also give credit to the soundtrack of the movie. They use things like Monster Mash, The Purple People Eater, Ghostbusters' theme, Twilight Zone's Main Theme and Werewolves of London to just name a few. This also probably helped with the feel of the movie as well.So now with that said, is this a great movie? No, it doesn't even rank near the top of Sandler movies for me. What I will say though is that they did a pretty solid family film that has horror elements and really embodies the feel of Halloween. It has a good message. There are some fun cameos. I think it could have gone just a bit farther with some stuff, but I'm not really the target. For me, I'd say this is just over average for me. It is fun with a good message, just lacking something to really make it stand out."}, {"id": 802, "text": "After the mediocre to me Uncut Gems, where Sandlers acting was basically Dont do any 'funny' accents, dont try to be 'funny', dont adlib, follow the script, act like a human, I had hoped the Sand Man might lean into something a bit more realistic.WOW WAS I WRONG!!!Seeing that this had a decent average review, I was thinking that maybe, juuuuust maybe Sandler would have realized that his stupid, unrealistic accents (what IS his accent supposed to even BE??? Its not a Massachusetts accent, thats for sure!) and pandering to the lowest levels of 'humor' that Hubie Halloween might trip into a decent halloween movie.Again, big nope.Once more, we have Sandler playing a mentally deficient person with a speaking handicap (grade A humor there) who is widely despised by his whole town, who knows and detests him. It seems like this may be a bit of self-reflection here on his part, as he grew from a once-talented comedian into a hack who churns out garbage movies.As the title suggests, this film has zero redeeming qualities. It looks fine, but having a film 'look good' is not difficult in 2020. A score exists... I guess? It adds nothing. The acting is basically all of the people Adam Sandler puts in his movies: THE MOVIE. Sandlers acting is like rubbing your open eyes vigorously with course sandpaper.After the acclaim Adam Sandler got post-Uncut Gems, I had hoped to see him try to actually act again, instead of act like an ass. Unfortunately, he chose the latter.AVOID LIKE THE COVID!!!"}, {"id": 803, "text": "I'm not a huge fan of Adam Sandler, but I do like quite a few of his movies - Grown Ups for example. This movie is a standard Sandler job, get together a few of his friends, behave in an over the top - almost cartoonish - way and entertain the audience. He does that here. The story is ok, very predictable. Hubie, a grown man who still lives with his Mother (her thrift store t-shirts are hilarious) and is the town joke. He's abused by young and old alike, bullied and ridiculed (The throwing things at him whilst he rides is bike is funny the first time, it gets old by the third, fourth and fifth...) on a daily basis. He loves Halloween, and is the descendant of a woman killed in the Salam Witch Trials. The story is pretty much secondary to Sandler's showboating. The cast comes together fine, they do the job and it's pretty funny to watch.But.... Sandler's ridiculous habit of twisting his mouth and doing that ridiculous voice that he finds so hilarious is cringeworthy. Kevin James' disillusionment that he is some kind of heartthrob is confusing. He seems to find himself way more attractive and entertaining than anyone else does, and pretty much plays the same character in everything he does."}, {"id": 804, "text": "Without question, one of the worst movies I have seen in years. Maybe one of the worst ever. Now, maybe I'm wrong, but all the friends I watched it with agree that all we could take from the viewing experience was the strong feeling that almost no one involved with the film cared or put any effort into making anything about it good, even in the slightest, aside from maybe June Squibb, who is a wonder and we are all graced anytime she is on the screen. Her presence is one of the only positive things about this film, but I'd rather watch her in one of Alexander Payne's brilliant offerings. Steve Buscemi is always pleasant too, but it's not enough to save this heap.After seeing Uncut Gems (a very good movie), I got distracted for a second and almost forgot JUST how bad these Adam Sandler movies can really be. Hubie Halloween was an important reminder, and it takes the cake as the worst one I have ever seen. I don't blame Sandler and his crew for blasting out these diarrhea-tier offerings - I would do the exact same thing if I were them. They are lucky folks to be in the position they are, but, I guarantee that even they know these movies are the lowest of the low. The funniest part about this movie is that the bizarre fanbase gets really upset at people who don't like it - and truly believe it is a wonderful film!"}, {"id": 805, "text": "I read about 150 to 200 user reviews for this before I watched it. When it comes to movies, I feel theres no better guage of how truly good a movie is than to get a concensus on it from the IMDB users. Movie critic reviews are never something I take into account because they are basically a bunch of art house cinema snobs who try to compare every movie to Citizen Kane or Apocalypse Now. I like to get the pulse of the real people before investing my time in a movie.That brings us to Hubie Halloween, the latest Netflix offering from Adam Sandler. I must say, I watched it opposite my better judgment based on the generally poor reviews I read. Mostly unendearing to the viewers seemed to be his accent and the unnecessary need for it. I can't say I'm a fan of it, as I feel its Sandlers childish way of demonstrating a member of low I.Q. in our society and that can be borderline offensive to anyone who knows or has raised a child with mental disability. That being said, I watched it anyway at the behest of my children.From moment one, you knew this wasn't going to win any awards. It was a standard Happy Madison movie with the usual cast of hooligans (including a startlingly old looking Steve Buscemi). I can't say it wasn't nice seeing Adam Sandler and Julie Bowen back together on screen again after 25 years and I loved the small cameo from Ben Stiller as his sadistic orderly character from Happy Gilmore, handlebar mustache and all. Would've loved a Shooter McGavin appearance at some point, but that didn't happen. Irregardless, when the movie was over I found myself having laughed at it more often than I cringed at the ludicrousness of it. Most importantly however, my kids enjoyed it and I think that was the target audience anyway and they nailed it. In the end, this was just a funny family Halloween film and it deserves the respect its due.

Granted, I didn't really have much of any expectations for the movie, nor did I know how was in it aside from Adam Sandler.And now that I have finished watching Hubie Halloween, I must say that I was actually adequately entertained, and it turned out to be a wholesome movie. For me, it wasn't because of Adam Sandler or his annoying voice that he was doing in the movie, but it was a combination of the storyline and the rather amazing cast list that were here.Story-wise then Hubie Halloween was pretty straight forward. It was a storyline that had a little bit of everything in it, so it is very likely that you'll find something enjoyable in the movie, despite of your age and preference.Aside from the lead of Adam Sandler, then Hubie Halloween had the likes of great performers such as Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, Rob Schneider, Ray Liotta, Maya Rudolph, Ben Stiller, Michael Chiklis and others on the cast list. I would be lying if I said that I was wasn't impressed with the ensemble that made an appearance in Hubie Halloween.While Hubie Halloween is not going to be a regular Halloween classic, it is definitely a movie worth sitting down to watch - once at least.

Writers Tim Herlihy and Carter Gray for the most part inject some sharp humorous dialogue, one liners and most of all heart into the story.Actors Ray Liotta and Rob Schneider in small roles are good fun but wacky Steve Buscemi's Walter Lambert wolf man steals the show as do good Hubie tries to solve the mystery of what or who is making the locals disappear.

It sort of came out of nowhere. I also came into the film expecting something like Murder Mystery or Romeo And Juliet but got something better than what I expected.Hubie Halloween is about a fifty year old man named Hubie (Adam Sandler) who still lives with his mom (June Squibb). Halloween is rolling around and Hubie loves this holiday so much that he always goes around to many kids reminding them to be safe on Halloween. Hubie falls in love with a girl name Violet Valentine (Julie Bowen) but still gets bullied by his childhood bully, Mr. Landofa (Ray Liotta). He then realizes many people around town are missing and contacts Srgt.

As I said earlier I came into it thinking it was going to be like Murder Mystery or Romeo And Juliet but came out liking it much more than I thought. By no means is it a perfect film though. The story isn't too investing in this film. It is mainly centered around referencing older Halloween films and many actors that were featured in other Happy Maddison productions. That just isn't the way to structure a story. The film does start off with a mind of its own but then just fluctuates into your typical Adam Sandler cheesy film. Which is what I have came to aspect now when watching a Happy Madison production.The acting in this film is a little better than your typical Happy Maddison film which I am pleased to say. Adam Sandler delivers an okay performance for his character Hubie. He does add some emotion to the character but then is most of the time taken away by Sandler trying to be funny while looking dumb. That is really what his comedy has turned into. The most resent film that has bits and pieces of his original style is Pixel. There wasn't a whole lot of his original comedy in that film either though. If you don't know what I am talking about I would watch Happy Gilmore and Bill Madison. Those are two films that are historical and Adam Sandler is at the top of his game in both of those. Waterboy though, not so much. I think this film was better than Waterboy but Adam Sandler just wasn't that funny in either of them. I don't really mind his voice in either though. I know many people are tired of his voices and that is a main thing piling onto this films criticism. There is other talent in this film though like Kevin James. He does pretty well. He hasn't been in almost anything since Paul Blart Mall Cop 2. That film just wasn't that good either. Although he showed in this film he can still be funny. Julie Bowen didn't really add much to this movie. She was Adam Sandler's crush and she didn't really feel to well developed or acted. June Squibb was hilarious though. She was the main source of many of my laughs. She took everything that happened to Hubie in such a calm way. She was really the light of the film. Ray Liotta was also in this film. You could really tell he saw the contract and his eyes did the thinking for him. It felt like he didn't put any effort into his acting for this picture. He has been doing a bunch of these types of comedies. A couple of years ago he was even in Wild Hogs. He must be really desperate. There were also other actors in this film from many other Happy Madison movies like Rob Schneider, Steve Buscemi, and Tim Meadows. They all just did fine. Although if they weren't in the movie I bet I would have felt the same way.Hubie Halloween is a film that turned out better than I thought but still proved Adam Sandler has lost much of his comedy over the years and will never top Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison."}, {"id": 810, "text": "Adam Sandler still doing that stupid voice, overdramatic falls, over the top screaming, farts, and vomit jokes in 2020.

I have three theories.1) The wacky spirit of Halloween is fitting for a Happy Madison production.2) Much of the film's humor isn't mean-spirited, which is in contrast to other Happy Madison films, which feel like they were written by a 12 year-old bully.3) 2020 has been such a dystopian hellscape that a bad Adam Sandler comedy feels like a salvation in how normal it is, thus creating a placebo effect in which people think it's good.Whatever the reason may be, Hubie Halloween is a hit. You know what, that's a good thing. Maybe it ought to be a hit."}, {"id": 814, "text": "This movie wasn't horrible. I find it truly mediocre. You see, this movie doesn't feel like a movie, it more so feels like an event. With a cast like this you truly could've thought it's gonna be great but the whole point of the movie is to be bad, and I think that all of these critics aren't looking at it that way. Adam Sandler wasn't trying to make a Shawshank Redemption, a Godfather or whatever he was making a bad movie on purpose because Uncut Gems got snubbed at the Oscars apparently. The movie as a whole was alright, it was funny sometimes but most of the time I would've just gave it a sour smile for the jokes. I think making Hubie a lovable character didn't really work out until the end, most of the time I felt bad for him but not really. This movie really didn't have outstanding performances, Adam Sandler was probably the best actor after Steve Buscemi and that's saying something. No particular character was funny, except for when Shaq showed up, that was a good laugh. Everything considered this movie wasn't bad, it had a good plot twist, it had.. alright characters, sometimes funny jokes, average writing but it really shouldn't be looked like this since it was made to be bad but if it were to be reviewed as a real movie, these would be my thoughts. 5/10, probably won't watch again.

Of course it is - makes sense now.All kidding aside (or wherever it is hidden), this is about personal taste. If you like Sandler pretending to be mentally challenged (as I reckon the political correct way to say is now - he himself wouldn't call it that, but make a crude and fun remark), but also witty enough when he has to be ... you will be entertained by this. Lowest common denominator can be enough. I wish I could just sit back and enjoy this, as others do, but I just can't.

Hubie's talents include his swiss army style thermostat, his mileage of yelling like he's about to die and his detective work which he utilises the most on his favourite day, Halloween. One this particular dark and spooky night a few local residents go missing so its up to Hubie to step up and become a hero. The Ben Stiller cameo by reprising his Hal L character from Happy Gilmore and his line special delivery for Mr Loon E Tunes was cool as. Plus, the O'Doyle references were awesome to watch along with the monster mash tune throughout the flick. A few gags and the constant pranks were funny and the typical story of the town outcast will save the day, win the town over and even get the girl was good to watch. All of this predictability is forgivable at times and the movie was enjoyable due to a few cameos including from the Shaq man.

That's Adam Sandler in 'Hubie Halloween.' Sure, he's silly and slightly embarrassing, but I love him and accept him for who he is.And another thing: he made me laugh and smile. I can't help but like the guy. He has a way of winning people over, even in movies that are less than stellar.Fortunately, this movie truly is not bad. It has quite a bit going for it, including an endless supply of recognizable actors, a cute romance warming slowly throughout, and a mystery with just enough juice to keep the action moving. I wanted to keep watching. I wanted to see what happened next. Did I expect a shocking twist to make me gasp or some profound revelation to make me think? Not really, and I was okay with that.This is a breezy movie that features people I like and centers on Halloween. That's all I wanted. If I had one bone to pick, I wish Sandler's Hubie character was bit more Mr. Deeds and little less Bobby Boucher ('The Waterboy').

I started to feel bad for Hubie, but as the movie progressed (if you could call choppy storytelling progression) I ended up understanding why everyone hated him; then I hated him. His speech impediment makes him nearly impossible to understand-it takes you out of the movie. Hubie is annoying, not like Kramer from Seinfeld; more like harass you at a gas station for some change annoying. His thermos gimmick isn't funny, and he looks like a  predator. The development between him and his love interest is non-exsistent. His jokes fall flat, but he continues them anyway; trying to convince you to laugh. This movie isn't funny. I laughed at least twice, and felt angry for the rest of it. Just watch something else, no one cared about this movie. The acting is half hearted, the writing is terrible, and it has no tone-it goes from horror to low brow burp &amp; fart comedy at the flick of a switch.

Even for kids, who are the target audience of this family comedy, some scenes are just too weird and absurd.With a cast like this, with names like Ray Liotta, Steve Buscemi or Julie Bowen, I expected at least that one joke would make me laugh, and it didn't.When I start watching a movie, I go 'till the end, so I went all the way with this one, and survived (narrowly)."}, {"id": 823, "text": "Hubie Halloween, Adam Sandler's latest Netflix comedy, plays like a Halloween special of a wacky Saturday morning cartoon done in live-action.Adam Sandler is Hubie Dubois, the village idiot of a modern-day Salem who speaks in a mumbly cartoon voice. Hubie is a passionate fan of the Halloween tradition and volunteers himself as a community guide, much to the ridicule of Salem townsfolk who perpetually bully Hubie. When Dubie finds himself in the midst of a murder case on Halloween night, it is up to him to save Halloween.I grew up on Adam Sandler movies and even more so, on his comedy albums. Sandler always digs for the silliest base form of stupidity to craft a joke out of and whenever his gags land, it feels like we both got away with something. He got my laugh and I feel certain freedom from social norms having laughed at something so ridiculously stupid. As much as I like to dissect comedy and define what is intellectually humorous and what isn't, there is a joy in being shaken out of that mindset and just enjoying a pure laugh.While this is not to the classic level of Happy Gilmore or The Wedding Singer, I chuckled throughout Hubie Halloween and had two major belly laughs. The first was a gag from Maya Rudolph and Tim Meadows as a married couple bickering in a car. The second was a voice gag done by a surprise celebrity cameo, who I won't reveal here. It's more to the level of The Waterboy and I was pleasantly entertained in a low-key kind of way.Hubie's mumbly cartoon voice may prove annoying to some, and it is a case of take it or leave it as Adam Sandler commits to it for the entire runtime. If it's unbearably grating for you ten minutes in, this probably isn't going to entertain you.Hubie Halloween will fare best with ten to twelve-year-olds or the kid who laughs at everything because they just simply like to laugh and do not buy into the concept of cheap laughs, slapstick, and pratfalls as poor taste. I can see it being a fun one-time watch for a family to build a Halloween mood as we move closer to the end of October.

Unfortunately for Adam Sandler, it's now 2020 and comedy has evolved.To overplay a character with mental issues who gets bullied by everyone is bad and it's just not funny. If there isn't anything in a comedy to make you laugh, then at least some story would be good right? Well guess what? You don't get a story either, it's just nonsensical.Lastly, What's with the voice and silly mouth movements Adam?

I didn't think the trailer was good at all but I held out up but alas, it was no good. This was so disappointing to me because this is the film that comes out right after his amazing performance in Uncut Gems. The film's biggest issue is its script and characters. This script is so poorly written that it's embarrassing. None of the dialogue feels natural. Instead, it feels like an incredibly rough first draft. None of these characters are relatable at all because everyone is so rude and heartless. No normal town would treat one person this way. I know it's supposed to be a little unrealistic but it was too irritating not to mention. The performances here really aren't that good. Some of them were fine and harmless like Steve Buscemi but Adam Sandler and Kevin James were pretty terrible. Their performances felt so unnatural and Sandler's accent was just very obnoxious. The plot itself made no sense at all and felt very loosely put together. It felt as if they structured the story around the jokes which is something you really shouldn't do. Most of the jokes weren't that funny anyway. That's not to say all of them were bad because I did chuckle a few times but not enough to make me think this film was clever. The cinematography and music were fine. The film didn't look visually bad at all but it didn't do a whole lot that was interesting. If you're a fan of Sandler's style of comedy, then you might get something out of this. If not, definitely pass on it."}, {"id": 826, "text": "Last year, Adam Sandler said that if he didn't win an Oscar for his role as Howard Ratner in the Safdie brother's film Uncut Gems, he would then make the worst movie of his career on purpose. It was a bold claim to make, especially considering Sandler is the one responsible for Jack and Jill and Pixels, two movies that almost made me quit watching movies altogether.Oscar nomination morning came in January and Sandler's name wasn't called when they announced the Best Actor lineup. I gasped and immediately checked Sandler's IMDb page and noticed that he had a new movie called Hubie Halloween that would premiere October 7. I knew that day would be the day of reckoning, the day Sandler would take his revenge on all of us.October 7 arrived and Hubie Halloween premiered on Netflix as promised. To my surprise, the movie was only passably bad and not the ungodly abomination we were led to believe.Hubie Halloween takes place over the spookiest month of the year in Salem, Massachusetts. Hubie Dubois (Sandler) is the town's self-appointed Halloween safety monitor. Because of his overall demeanor and lack of style, Hubie is the most bullied person in town. But this year's Halloween will be like no other as a mental patient has escaped from the local lockup and town residents are disappearing one-by-one throughout the night. Like all underdog stories, it's up to Hubie to save Halloween. And as always, there's a love interest that is way out of his league that he will attempt to win over.If you're familiar with Sandler's filmography, you'll notice that the cast is stacked with the usual crowd of Sandler's buddies and Saturday Night Live alums. Kevin James, Rob Schneider, Steve Buscemi, June Squibb, Tim Meadows, Maya Rudolph, Julie Bowen, and Shaquille O'Neal round out the supporting cast here.Trying to fit all these characters and give them their own little moments makes Hubie Halloween a tiresome experience. Even at 102-minutes (with 15 of those minutes for the credits), much of the runtime feels padded to make way for one-note gags about physical deformities and poop &amp; pee jokes. At least there isn't the casual racism and sexism that Sandler used to parade around in his movies. He is growing up; just really, really slowly.What hasn't grown up is Sandler's schtick. Like Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey, Sandler's brand of humor doesn't age well once you pass the age of 20. It also doesn't help that Sandler is now 54-years-old and has been playing the same character for nearly four decades.Hubie Dubois is a near replication of Sandler's role as Bobby Boucher from 1998's The Waterboy. Like Bobby, Hubie lives with his oblivious mother and talks with a weird mumbly accent. At least Bobby's accent was explained as that movie took place in Louisiana. Hubie's weird manner of speaking is never explained and exponentially grates as time goes on. It's both commendable and sad to see Sandler play a loser for what seems like the one-millionth time.While any praise given to Hubie Halloween is minor in scale, it is worth mentioning. The moments where the movie steps away from reality and enters more surreal territory make for enjoyable bits. Hubie's seemingly magic thermos - which acts as a vacuum, flashlight, megaphone, and grappling hook - does provide a chuckle here and there.Some of the supporting performances within Hubie Halloween do provide some slight fun.Steve Buscemi is allowed to embrace his cooky self as an elderly werewolf who has just moved next door to Hubie.June Squibb is also great as Hubie's mother. Unawarely dressed in sexually promiscuous t-shirts, Squibb plays the usual mother role quite well.Even though her character would fail the Bechdel test in a heartbeat, Julie Bowen does some pleasant work as Hubie's love interest.Rob Schneider and Maya Rudolph are great because they limit their dialogue to only a few lines. The more they speak, the worse the movie gets.Considering how 2020 has gone so far, Adam Sandler delivering his worst movie would have fit right in. Thankfully, the Sandman let us off easy and only gave us an inoffensively bad movie that could have been a lot worse.Maybe it was all part of his master plan to quell our expectations and have us grade this on a curve. Whatever the reason may be, I'll count my blessings and pray that Sandler doesn't try to deliver on his promise anytime soon."}, {"id": 827, "text": "Adam Sandler seems to chuck all his friends in and make big bucks from Netflix now a days.

Some characters are real cringey but some are funny. Adams character is pretty much a grown up Billy Maddison who is a wimp but as many people stated has a horrible voice.

In an age where filter-bubble fanboyism runs rampant (encouraged by Facebook and Twitter communities reserved for whoever consumes the correct product), I have observed that nothing riles up defensive devotees quite like pointing out irreconcilable flaws in the works they admire.All of my blog reviews get copied to IMDb, and due to how fandom has started to operate, I no longer take poor ratings on my reviews as a sign that I've failed to properly articulate the problems with the film and need to improve my writing; instead, I assume I was onto something that the lemmings didn't like. Nobody who's this terrible should have this much hubris, guys. I'll never learn anything at this rate!Today, I might once again draw the ire of Adam Sandler fans. And keep in mind, after Punch-Drunk Love and especially last year's Uncut Gems, I am also a Sandler fan; or rather, Sandler as he should have been. With Hubie Halloween, it's back to oafish, scatological basics, but not without quaint October charm - IndieWire referred to the look of this film as pumpkin-spice production design, which is quite cute.Some people have even called the movie nostalgic; in many ways, it is a call-back to everything that Happy Madison has given us (ranging from horrible to acceptable) throughout the years, complete with Ben Stiller reprising a character from Happy Gilmore (one viewer, however, told me he liked The Waterboy and Little Nicky better when they were two separate films). Outside of these endearing qualities, the movie doesn't offer anything too exciting - in either direction.There is a tinge of disappointment to this verdict, not because I expected Hubie Halloween to be one of the better Adam Sandler comedies but because I expected Pixels-tier trash. And Sandler, in a sense, agrees with me here.When I reviewed Uncut Gems, I said that he had reinvented himself as an actor for grown-ups and that, thanks to that film, he might just get to play with the big boys full-time and even score his first Oscar. Sandler himself went on record as saying, if he doesn't receive an Oscar or at the very least a nomination for his role as Howard Bling, then it's back to Netflix; he promised he'd make something even more inane, awkward, and racially insensitive than The Ridiculous 6. Alas, he has failed to astound.His story of a Salem-based, frequently-ridiculed Halloween monitor getting pulled into a strange mystery isn't too bad on paper, and the execution has its share of Halloween warmth and fun cameos (the casts boasts the star power of Steve Buscemi, Ray Liotta, Rob Schneider of course, Julie Bowen, June Squibb, Shaq, and many more).

Also at times some of the gags without giving to much away were repeated several times to the point where it got annoying more then anything.Second while I do understand the voice Adam Sandler was doing was needed to portray the role of the character he was playing. At times I often couldn't understand or hear what he was saying. It just was too overbearing overall.Lastly I found the movie at times to be a bit draggy. They could have cut off at least 20-25 minutes from the film and still got the point across they were trying to portray.Besides for all that I did enjoy the cast very much there was alot of great cameos in this film, and without giving to much info away the ending was cute, emotional, and definitely a good message.

Where does Hubie Halloween fall into that, we'll it's pretty bad, the plot goes all around, it's what you'd expect from this type of Adam Sandler comedy, but there where two times I did laugh. Adam Sandler gives an over the top performance as Hubie, to the point where he seems to animated to be a real character that can be relatable, Julie Bowen is in this movie just to have a love interest for Sandler, nothing more.

This movie is a return to the nonsense Sandler and Friends adventures that have become so loathsome of late. The bigger issue for this though is I have no idea who it's for.Hubie has a serious identity issue. Is this a kids movie? An adult comedy? A family film? I don't think it really fits in any of them. It's two mature for kids, to dumb for adults and it's frankly to stupid for the family dog too. We get more wish fulfillment from Sandler, playing this character who's great at everything, until he's suddenly not for some inexplicable reason, who despite being a nutter is somehow just catnip to the most attractive woman in town? We've got Kevin James as a sheriff who looks a bit like Dog the Bounty Hunter, Buscemi slumming it as... Everything about this annoyed me. It reminds me of the Ernest movies by Jim Varney, but those were clearly aimed at kids and were much more enjoyable, partly because of how stupid they were.If this would've picked a lane it could have been better. Make it Sandler Scared Stupid, a goofy Halloween movie for his kids or Big Hubie, the story of a man coming to grips with his adulthood around Halloween. Either could have been better but this middle of the road nonsense, flooded with his own wish fulfillment and constant need to shove his buddies into things they don't need to be in leaves us with another garbage movie.

The tees that Hubie's mom (played by June Squibb) wears throughout the film, cracked me up. The nods to Sandler's earlier movies (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison) and the comedic jibes taken at some old movies (Rocky Balboa, The Fog, just to name a few) are also decently done. The cameos of Ben Stiller and Shaq were amusing. Plus, as the title suggests, it's very much a Halloween film - the vibes are all over the place.Now, onto the annoying aspects. Sandler's voice in the film is tweaked for whatever-funny effect but it doesn't really serve a purpose in the plot. Speaking of the plot, it's a big bundle of clich\u00e9s and gets a little message-heavy at the end. While it's fine to see Kevin James, Rob Schneider, Ray Liotta, Steve Buscemi, Maya Rudolph, and several other Sandler-buddies in supporting roles, no one really gets anything solid to do.

The usual appearances from happy Madison actors was very enjoyable with Steve Buscemi, Rob Schneider and Kevin James all playing big rolls. There was a abundance of Disney child actors such as Peyton list, Karan bran, China Anne McLain, Bradley Steven perry, Kelli burgland, and Paris Berlec. It was a nice little change up from the usual cast, although certain actors such as Bradley and Kelli didn't get anymore then 1 minute of screen time with about 2 lines. Overall the movies plot didn't make sense through the middle and End of the film and it was kind of everywhere and at one part unsure who the main antagonist or Villain is supposed to be and seemed like the movie was definitely targeted for ages 8-20 for kids and teens and individuals who love happy Madison's film. Wasn't a terrible film, the cast was super enjoyable and the movie is definitely worth a watch!"}], "reviews_amount": 835}
