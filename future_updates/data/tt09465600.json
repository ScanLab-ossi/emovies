They tried to recoup it by making it mainly about the man and the woman getting back together after all that time, that really it is about relationships, but it was ultimately a big let down. On the most simplistic level, we did not even get to see them hug or cry together or anything, just the looks of shock, apparently to be artsy. Come on!Instead of making the situation with the additional 3 crew into the usual story of the battle to decide who will die - so predictable - they could have made the rest of the film about the journey to Europa and getting there and finding out that other crew had survived from other places, etc.I think there was a major flaw in the plot and that it must have been changed midway through, since the story starts with the idea of the creation of a habitable world on Europa and then retracts to just Pangea Station and no one ever even sees Europa. It sounds like they felt they couldn't manage the story of going to Europa, somehow, and cut it off - I suppose its cheaper set wise to never leave the station. But they sacrificed the film ultimately then, for the small amount of creativity to have had the characters move past just the two people and their own relationship, which was never fathomable anyway.Finally, I have more faith in humanity that if faced with an inevitable end of the human race, not everyone will melt down into a monster except for 2 people. The stupid predictable ploy of the haunted house space station where everyone has to kill everyone else really tanks films at this point. We've seen that so many times and it's so 2nd grade to just retreat to that. I'd rather they never had the other 3 appear if they have to turn it into that."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Right from the beginning. Plagued with bad writing throughout a lame story, it is (probably) supposed to be a study of the effects of long term deep space exposure on the human psyche or some such nonsense.The long, silent opening sequence was meant to fast-forward the viewers through the first 5 years. In 2190, a 4 person crew start a 10 year mission on a space station in deep space near a colony that is on one of Jupiter's moons (Europa). The station is supposed to be some kind of refuelling stop for people travelling between Earth and the colony (though they don't explain that or show anyone coming anywhere near them in the first 5 years).5 years later the captain is losing his marbles and the crew doctor is ready to scrub the mission and have them all sent home for psychological reasons. Then the event happens (conveniently of course).The station is (mysteriously) damaged and a crew member dies. Then the doctor decides to take a one way space walk. The remaining (2) crew try to save him by extending a mechanical arm towards him. Naturally, just as its within reach the Doc decides he wants to live - and as he reaches to grab the mechanical arm, the last section of it - just - falls - off, drifting off into space along with the Doc.Then, just as the last 2 crew members are about to take some kind of suicide pill - literally about to put them in their mouths - miraculously they spot a shuttle drifting outside the station. Inside they find 3 crew who had been on the International Space Station orbiting Earth and find out that the event was actually the Earth exploding for some unknown reason. Despite being right next to it, apparently they weren't as damaged as the space station that was hundreds of millions of miles away from the explosion. Their shuttle was damaged but still somehow made it to the station.(More plot holes. The shuttle crew are revived and told that there was enough life support to keep them all alive until the shuttle can be repaired and they can fly to Europa. So what do they do ? Have a party. Smoking and drinking. Without explaining what had happened until the next day (because of course, why would you bother mentioning some trivial detail like how you watched the Earth explode from 400(ish) kms away).Then they find out that the station, which had enough life support to keep 4(+) people going for 10(+) years, will only support 2 people for 3 years. Or 5 people for 1 month. (But apparently there's enough cigarettes to keep everyone going forever !) And supposedly the shuttle (now) can't be fixed at all !One thing leads to another and the damaged station ends up broken into 2 parts and apparently each half has enough life support to last 1 person indefinitely. Good thing too as each of the last 2 from the original station crew are in different parts of the station and the 3 from the shuttle are dead.And somehow, despite the unfixable shuttle being damaged even further in the explosion that broke the station apart, the captain is able to repair it and - roughly 22 years after the station broke apart - in the year 3022 he is able to pilot it and literally fly straight to the other half of the station (despite not having any communication with it the entire time and no way to calculate where it may have drifted to in the preceding 22+ years). And, naturally, his partner is still alive.The movie ends with the 2 crew members reunited on the one half of the station, drifting off into space. The same 2 who, 27 years earlier, were going to kill themselves back when things seemed hopeless. Somehow I don't think there'll be a sequel where some intrepid explorer finds them still drifting through space - and still alive.(Did I mention that during this whole time - they had NO communication with the colony on Europa who apparently couldn't be bothered to check on them or try to figure out why they couldn't communicate with Earth either.)The entire movie was poorly lit (perhaps to disguise cheap sets). The plot holes were big enough to fly planets through. The story line was lame.The acting was OK. I only watched it to the end to see what they'd do with the last 2 (you knew he'd find her, somehow, and that she'd still be alive, somehow, but I wanted to see what happened after that). Nothing.And literally everyone smokes ! On space ships/stations in deep space 180+ years in the future !I mean WTF ! Why is it that half the space movies I see these days have crews smoking like chimneys ? NOBODY SMOKES IN SPACE morons ! Not now and sure as **** not 170 years from now (let alone even further in the future for some movies).Blame that on the poor scripting and directing as well..I would not recommend this to anyone unless you are on a very long flight where you can't sleep and there are no other choices. Even then I'd suggest watching something else. Or reading the in-flight magazine. Or the Emergency card. Or count the hairs on the back of the head of the person sitting in front of you."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Brilliant premise for a film BUT.

I don't have a problem with the acting. The effects were pretty good for a straight to video movie. There were just too many unanswered questions. It started out okay, then the disaster happened and they try to figure it out. My question: Where do these people come up with this endless supply of cigarettes 5 years into a 10 year mission? Notwithstanding the fact that it would prove disastrous to any air recycling equipment they had. Oh my God what have we done? We may be pretty good but we don't have the technology to break up a planet into pieces. Yet. At the end, what the hell is going on? Do they get out safe? Do they head to Europa? That was an hour and a half of my live I will never get back."}, {"id": 4, "text": "It's incredibly frustrating to follow the story when you can only see 20% of what's happening on screen.

Really?"}, {"id": 5, "text": "Just finished watching the movie, only reason i watched to the end was to see how it ended, i could have turned it of after 30 minutes. 4 astronauts on a refuelling ship get stranded after earth explodes, sounds like it could be a good story, wrong, the crew are more like a bunch of office workers than trained astronauts, going to pieces easily, smoking on a space station???, must be sponsored by the tobacco industry, the movie jumps scenes and leaves you feeling like you don't care what happens to them. the special effects are good, camera work and props are good, but the movie falls flat because of the script but not as weird as Ad Astra at least"}, {"id": 6, "text": "Director John Suits said, I was attracted to this story because of the huge stakes and scale and because it's ultimately a very intimate human story. Ryan Binaco, the writer, is incredibly gifted and was able to write a script that felt emotionally honest. Well, Binaco may (or may not) be able to write an emotionally honest film, but when it comes to spaceflight realism, Suits and Binaco are hopelessly clueless.The year is 2190. Earth's first space colony is on Jupiter's moon Europa. So they just skipped the Moon and Mars and went straight for Europa? The space station Pangea refuels ships bound for Europa. What kind of fuel? Nuclear? Storage batteries? Where do they keep it? Because the station's far too small to store fuel. If it's liquid fuel, where does it come from? Earth? So space missions have to come out to Pangea to deliver fuel and then turn around and go home? There are far easier ways to get a manned space mission out to Europa than stopping for gas. And if you still wanted to refuel spaceships, then you'd put Pangea station on an asteroid and mine the asteroid for the raw materials with which to manufacture fuel.Both Earth and Jupiter orbit the Sun in elliptical paths; the distance between them changes constantly: From closest approach at 365 million miles to maximum separation 601 million miles. So where IS Pangea, anyway? Does it orbit the Sun? A Lagrange point? It seems to be out in the middle of absolutely nowhere. The station would be lined up with both Earth and Jupiter only for a couple of weeks a year. Or is it in a solar orbit that keeps it always the same distance from Jupiter? Earth is visible to the naked eye from Pangea. So it must be awfully close to Earth. Why do you need a refueling station that close to Earth for ships going out to Jupiter? To any station far enough out there to serve as a refueling stop, Earth would be invisible without a telescope.Rotating crews from different countries maintain Pangea in 10-year shifts. Four American astronauts arrive to begin their term: Captain John Laine, engineer Jackie Miller, doctor Richard Valin, and Lisa Brown. Would you REALLY select crew members like Jackie, a loving mother who is LEAVING BEHIND her 10-year-old daughter on Earth, or Richard, a loving husband who is LEAVING BEHIND his wife? Where are these crew members' priorities? Ten days, maybe, ten weeks, even ten months; but ten YEARS?Pangea consists of two Stations, each of which is a rotating ring to create artificial gravity. But the rings rotate far too slowly to provide Earth's 1-G gravity. You'd expect that it would be about the same as the Moon, i.e., about 1/6-G. But it doesn't really matter, because a space shuttle docked to Pangea also has gravity although it shouldn't, and then later on, after the two Stations have been separated (to allow oxygen supplies aboard one Station to replenish adequately), Station Two is found, adrift in space and not rotating, but there is STILL GRAVITY aboard.With each passing year, the crew, amicable at first, drifts apart. By the fifth year, isolation takes a toll. There are tired old shopworn physical correlates of the psychological toll: Laine having annoying and totally uncompelling facial twitches and Miller has some minor and equally uncompelling tremors of the right hand. Laine also experiences night terrors. Valin is forced to deem the crew mentally unfit to continue the mission. As the crew comes to terms with failing their mission, shock-waves from a massive explosion damage Pangea. It's Earth exploding from some ground-based experiment gone awry; exactly what will never be known. We see the explosion through the eyes of someone on the International Space Station. The explosion is far too fast; to explode completely like that would take many minutes or even hours. And the ISS is only damaged, which is also ridiculous. The shock-waves were felt out at Pangea; an explosion like that would have obliterated everything around the Earth, including, most likely, the Moon. Fragments of the Earth, from small to asteroid-size, would be blown out into the solar system and travel for years, either hitting other planets and moons or being knocked completely out of the solar system.Eventually, Miller and Laine are the only two people left. When the Station is separated (using timed charges), Miller is accidentally stuck on Station Two. Station Two drifts away into space. Laine then alters the mission of Pangea from fuel station to a search for Station Two. How is he going to do that? Pangea isn't a spaceship, it's a space station. It can't maneuver in space under its own power. But no matter; the film has already committed so many goofs that what's one more? And what do you know, 3 years later, he DOES find it. And what do you know, Miller is aboard and STILL ALIVE. And although Laine has gone all gray, Miller still has a full head of completely red hair, with not one single strand of gray. At that point, the film doesn't so much end as just stops. John Suits also said, I hope people engage with the film in a way where they ask themselves, 'If I were in this scenario, what would I do?' Well, most of the time, the characters' motivations and behavior did NOT ring true to me.Concerning the acting: Omar Epps and Kate Walsh have decent chemistry, but nothing special. Why they cast Jorja Fox as a Frenchwoman I'll never understand: I don't speak French, but even I can tell her accent is atrocious. Is France short of actresses?In summary, this is a relationship movie poorly disguised as a sci-fi movie. If you prefer movies that are more about relationships and don't care that the entire premise of the film is ludicrous, maybe you'll like it."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I knew I wasn't going to enjoy this movie when I realized the expository text at the beginning was very poorly written. I'm pretty sure Humankind didn't construct Jupiter's third moon. If they meant it's near the third moon of Jupiter, are they suggesting Europa is the third moon? That's not right no matter how you classify them. Then we get some pretentious shots of people doing something, followed by a low-res 3D shuttle flying to a space station, apparently to attend a funeral judging by the depressing music. When we finally see the station we are told, again, the station is between Earth and Europa One, but is clearly in Earth orbit. It doesn't appear any research (or God forbid math) was performed since the size and angular velocity of the habitation rings isn't close to being accurate for the Centripetal Acceleration depicted. Also, why are the solar arrays rotating and never angled to maximize exposure? After some shots inside we see the exterior and are shown another card repeating the date, but this time with the Anno Domini incorrectly added after the date instead of before. Next is a boring montage advancing year by year from one to five (told via cards), ending with some mildly interesting images followed by the title (3022). When we return to the story another card again tells us it's year Five, followed by another card that says 'Year Unknown. Really? Smoking on a space station? Stop getting your technical data from other movies or trying to be Alien! No one smokes in space. Ever. From there the writing continues to make no sense and the editing is choppy. Significant events happen off screen while boring shots of nothing linger as the crew falls apart for no reason. This movie is an incoherent mess that feels as though they went into production with only an outline or rough first draft of the script."}, {"id": 8, "text": "All they do is smoke. Literally all they do. I wanted to like this so much but I couldn't get past the utmost stupidity of Smoking on a space station, especially when they're short of oxygen.

Some deep space travellers get stranded in space after Earth mysteriously vaporises.

Well , do not just go in expecting Ridley scott's Alien and u will be fine.Despite the flawed first half, the second half picks u some juice . Overall could have been a better movie if there was better set design and production values. The special effects and props so are reminiscent of the 1990s that u will feel a dash of nostalgia . The story could have been better as the element of unpredictability is missing. The film falls flat in its script, plays more like family drama in space.

The movie is about them coming to the realization and dealing with the fact that they are likely the last living human beings in the universe.

Interesting concept. Acting was decent, animation was good enough, and camera work was decent as well. A few of the scenes could have been moved around to give better chronological flow though.What gets me is that this all takes place in the 2190's and the characters are nowhere as adept as they should be for their given position!My biggest gripe by far is that for some reason 170 years into the future, the technology they have in space is actually worse than they do now. The consoles are a weird mix of touch screens, 70's nasa style buttons, and an an operating system that's tells you absolutely nothing useful like one of those programs cloned off a better program that only does 80% of the work but took 20% of the effort.The station is dimly lit despite having solar panels all around and seems like the crew is all experiencing major depression. Gee I wonder why? You'd think in 170 years LED and solar technology would get good enough to make the place look like a flash bang but no the place looks like a cold war era submarine. On top of that smoking is allowed (and somehow still a thing) as well as hard liquor but not video games/board games, TV or VR on a 10 year mission. These guys share a pack of cards and a ball between them and are expected to not go crazy. Yea okay makes perfect sense.While we're on the topic of modern technology, the supposedly super advanced station isn't equipped with a 3D printer/fabricator despite the ISS currently having one and the smoking guy has to walk around with tape holding his glasses together instead of being able to print a new one.The last thing that makes no sense about the station is that the mission terms are 10 years long but they said it takes 3 years if I recall correctly to get from earth to the station. If that's the case why aren't the terms 3 years each to prevent all these people from getting depressed from the isolation? On top of that why Europa? They never explain why this freezing cold moon which might be able to support life was somehow chosen to be terraformed before Mars.Now let's talk about the crew. Why are these guys so stupid? Captain barely has anymore foresight than the rest of the crew and seems uncertain about any call he makes, the older lady is an emotional wreck, icarly just died before doing anything, and the doctor is out of shape (aren't astronauts expected to workout a lot to maintain good physical form and dexterity?) and very nonchalant about people flat-lining. I mean seriously that scene was just stupid. Icarly just flat-lined and no attempts to resuscitate and no one really showed any emotion despite them living together for 5 years.Radio silence from earth and they all start losing their minds and acting like there's no protocol they have to follow. Then they all act irrationally by themselves instead of thinking ahead together like a bunch of super smart scientists who've undergone rigorous training should. Like some other person said, they're just a bunch of office workers on a space ship.Then the french ISS crew shows up which strains their resources and they all figure they're the last of the human race but for some reason they're still thinking about individual survival instead of species survival. The chiseled jaw french guy decides it would be a good idea to kill them but their captain who is a woman opposes the idea and he kills her leaving presumably only 1 woman left in the entirety of the human race. The 2 french guys then decide it would be a good idea to kill off the remaining 2 members of the station so they could fix their ship and go live on uncolonized Europa together like somehow the 2 guys would be able to continue the human race together. Then instead of going for a surprise attack they come to the meeting room with the other 2 and pretend like they don't know what happened to the french captain and then allow the station captain to find her to they finally decide it would be a good time to attack them.Chiseled jaw french guy then decides to try and blow up the station to kill everyone by igniting the oxygen lines in what can only be described as the slowing burning gas mix ever when that should have been an instantaneous engulfment of the station.After all of that bs, I could live with the ending. Satisfying enough for what I just endured but because they've been building Europa up as the next settlement and safe haven it definitely felt like it was missing somethingOverall, interesting premise, decent actors and camerawork but very poor writing and space seems to just be a creative backdrop as the writer(s) don't seem to have a clue as to how NASA runs currently let alone 170 years in the future."}, {"id": 44, "text": "Nothing happens... i mean nothing.

So that means that the technology is super super awesome. They have a CT scan in space ( nice) so we are talking some high tech space technology. BUT- when there is a crack in the hull - there is no alert - there is no alert to tell them where the damage is or if there is damage at all! That doesn't make any bit of sense to me at all. They lost me at the crack. Now the responses the team had .. to the event were .... unbelievable at best. They do so much testing for Astronauts psychologically speaking that basically if you're going up in space - you're the best the human race has to offer. These guys are astronauts and soldiers and I just don't suspect that first of all- any of them would ever be in space for a ten year trip at all, if PTSD was an issue for example. The Ten Yard stare happens yes, when you're in shock- or more like when you're recovering from the shock. But to bring on that response you've got to have a severe flood of fight or flight hormones... and the response to those hormones isn't silent ( to say the least) Idk.... just too many things like that. Also none of these people would smoke. Smoke in space is just too stupid- beyond the extremely dangerous and life threatening ( they obviously have 02 pumped at all times ) and to think of the technology that they might be using - just highly explosive all around. Probably the worst part was when she tried to escape and the captain is exposed to deep space without a suit or oxygen and survives without a scrape. I mean he is able to pull her back in and all is well. Just doesn't happen like that. Besides his lungs exploding - he would be frozen and frost bitten at the least. Deep coma if he survived with extreme cold burns. What also makes this part hilarious is when he IS outside in space in a suit and she says you only have a few moments before you risk exposure Are we just supposed to pretend like one makes sense and the other doesnt ? Or what. I also thought that going insane was a poor choice for what would happen... we assume so much and don't really invest too much thought into whatever it is.

With a plentiful spectrum of elements that can be stratified in various ways (character profile, profession, age, communication, sex, etc.) There are indefinite combinations in mind, perception, imagination and other more subtle mental functions in play. Decent acting for that part.As I see it, the movie carefully depicts many, above mentioned and more, combinations and particularities. Slowly rising from moment ticks to serious pathology. That's why for good part of audience it will be slow or boring in parts. But, exactly for it's realism in temporal and spatial pace and it's ambient claustrophobic tight space (that was actually always a case in space probes and vehicles; hence obvious detail of E. Musk's spacious design of crew interior in the x-spaceship for future Mars missions). Photography and colors were managed well to support atmosphere and ambience.The real problem of the kind are not the ones we can imagine, test and simulate, but the ones that we can't. Those that eerily remain hidden and the movie exploits surreal psychosis from. Like profoundly social human being staying all alone in vastness of deep space.

We have seen this before with apocalypse movies such as Sunshine or The Road before, but where those movies have something that stands out to make them memorable - be it dialogue, character development, action or interesting moral choices - 3022 fails at being any thing more than a unevenly paced, boring, depressing story that isn't held together by anything memorable.The plot is basic, the world gets destroyed and the only people left alive are on a space ship bound for Jupiter's moon Europa. Then the audience is left to... well we are not sure. Is it a journey to find the true meaning in life now that humanity is extinct? No. Do we see the best in humanity dealing with insurmountable loss and a struggle for survival? Nope. Maybe it is about a slow slide into madness? Not so much.Continuing to plague the film are numerous obvious plot holes and shockingly poor set design. The original Apollo space craft looks more advanced than whatever rickety craft they are flying. There is no modern technology (and this film takes place 150 years from the present day!). There are times that the simplest of iphone apps would solve problems the characters are baffled by.There are some saving graces. The acting, especially Epps and Walsh, are solid. They make the most out of confusing dialogue. The movie is also very depressing (yes a saving grace I guess), with not one light hearted moment or comment - which may appeal to some - so I guess the mood is consistent.So, should you watch it? Short answer is no. The longer answer is probably not. It is clearly a low budget film that is stretched thin and can't make up for it's short comings. I mean, they don't even make the destruction of Earth interesting.

I enjoy edgy movies, relentlessly oppressive and impossible situations exploring the negative limits of human experience. This movie certainly delivers on that front.This movie isn't about the future; it's about the timeless human predicament, the fragility of our attempts to find meaning in a world where alienation and distrust are the norm, and our tragic predilection for self-destruction in the face of it.Every single character in this movie is deeply flawed, every relationship deeply dysfunctional, every possibility for hope dangling on a thread. The logic of the plot is one of inexorable self-destruction, as each character alternates between glimmers of hope, surrender to despair, and narcissistic betrayals, always out of joint with each other.

There was simply way too little of any interest going on to keep the movie going and keep it interesting.I will say, though, that the acting performances were good, despite of the actors and actresses having very little to work with. Most memorable in the movie was Angus Macfadyen, without a doubt, given his strong performance.The movie is dark, a bit too dark if you ask me. It makes no sense that there was so little illumination about a space station. Sure, it sets the mood for a thriller or a horror movie, but it makes absolutely no common sense whatsoever.I endured 3022 to the end, and can honestly say that this is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.

To say, that the FX don\u00b4t look like AVATAR or an installment in the TERMINATOR-Franchise doesn\u00b4t say anything about the quality of the entire movie.The Cast is well chosen (Omar Epps is a guarantee for an intensive Charakter) and Kate Walsh did a fine job in FARGO (series) and DEAD GIRLS DON\u00b4t LIE.I give it a 10/10 because I really have no Idea how this thing could end, so I just hope, that John Suits can prove his talent in filmmaking, like he did in THE SCRIBBLER, which was truly fun to watch.To me its like the message Jordan Peele is doing the TWILIGHT ZONE-Reboot - great news - this is similiar with John Suits is doing an apocalyptic, claustrophobic Space-Survival-Sci-Fi-Movie - also, great News."}, {"id": 160, "text": "'3022' is a horrendous film.The writing is atrocious, almost every scientific element is butchered like it was written by someone with no general education (and someone who has probably never read a sci-fi story or watched a film).Literally from the first scene, nothing makes sense, the existence of the station, the rules of spaceflights, the personalities of the crew, the design of the station, their purpose of being there, NOTHING.Why have this huge fueling station? Why the 10year shifts? Who are these people (since they clearly are not astronauts or scientists), why the ship looks like a sewer and is barely lit? Why are they not doing anything for 5 years but just killing time? Why this specific number of crew members? What are they supposed to be doing? How can they communicate instantly in space? How can the Earth blow up from the inside AND NOONE IS ABLE TO NOTICE THIS (the physician probably noticed that, but it's unclear)? You'd think that such an impossible implosion of a planet would be noticeable. What was up with that light? Why is the crew celebrating when they are low on food and oxygen? Why are they smoking on a space station with faulty vents? Why does the station have terminals with buttons when they have a fully functional AI in control of the ship? Why are they losing oxygen faster than producing it if the station is supplied to handle at least 4 grown adults?I mean, ok, I get the low budget thing, CGI spaceships that look like they were outsourced and made by a freelancer for like 500 bucks, 2-3 sets, crewmembers bleeding ketchup from their ears, explosions in space, fine. But this is science fiction, can you at least try to have an interesting idea? No something that has been done to death? At least one thing that would make sense and not be insultingly stupid? Have you ever read a book? Have you ever heard about space? (talking to the writer obviously).To be fair there is a spark of a good idea here and there, but when you look at it it's just like a dead star, you can still see it, but it's probably dead already and you're just seeing the light that still travels from it.I really feel for the actors since in a horribly written film like this one, some of them still cared, and their performance heavily contrasted with everything else.4.6/10 is extremely overrated, no one should have the right to violate the concepts of science and common sense with this level of writing."}, {"id": 161, "text": "So many low reviews for this movie! They are pretty much in the mark if they are between 3-7. This movie is definitely a stinker! They managed to find some actors with some decent talent, which is where the entire budget for this movie was clearly spent because there are very few CGI moments worth discussing.Plot Holes: Galore! Ok so according to the Earth the continents in the future have reformed into Pangea, or one large continent like it used to be millions of years ago. This is a statistical impossibility I am afraid. The continent's reforming like that occurs over millions of years, not over a thousand of them. So y'a it's a massive plot hole. There are many other holes in the plot, you will have to trust me on that one.Acting: All the best acting in the world couldn't save this stinker from its own bad writing. That said, the actors did what they could with what they had. It's not like we have Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins either....but the actors we do have are all experienced professionals and di their parts for what must have been a particularly small payday on this one.Direction: Very poor. It's like if you had Ridley Scott Directing this movie, would it have been better? To be honest yes, Scott is a master who probably would have rewritten it as he went along. Anyways, poor direction! Omar Epps first crack at direction, and prolly his last. Lighting was terrible, soundtrack and sounds were poor. The sound was just bad having to keep it turned up to hear them talk, but when action happened I had to turn it down because it was far too loudDID YOU KNOW: IMDB, in an effort to restrict angry reviews and angry user scores purposely removes all scores below 3/10. Its true! So many dollars ride on big movies and a movie that has been purposely sunk by review snipers can lose millions as moviegoers still use movie scores to decide if a movie is worth watching. IMDB also closely watches reviews as they are all screened.Overall 4/10. It was good enough to leave running in the background while I read the news on my iPad."}], "reviews_amount": 162}
