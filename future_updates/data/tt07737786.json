Well, this movie is packed with characters having poor judgment and taking the most idiotic decisions possible (and being hysterical), and it's all done for the sole purpose of generating obstacles and create tension. And it works ! It does create a lot tension, but it's all aimed towards the scenarists, for blatantly taking you for an imbecile.

There are loads of scenes with the parents and all of their scenes trying to pull he art strings or get the tension up. The comets could be easily replaced with a California wild fire and this would be the same film.A lame film with a few truly awfully bad scenes with overall terrible plot development. The lead is a guy who constructs buildings, so of course he's going to be a VIP in the new world after the comet hits.Extremely poor writing. The lead character drives onto a runway and prevents a plane from taking off. The pilot and he argue says it's at full capacity. Hero Gerald says take his wife and son and is refused. So Gerald replies that no one will be leaving, basically blackmailing the pilot here. Pilot reluctantly agrees to take the kid then and the mother erupts demanding he take all 3 of them. Pilot sighs and asks the hero Gerald how much do you weight? Hero lies about his weight and is called out. Lol what?! The pilot then accepts them all and this entitled family says sorry to the other passengers as they board the plane.

What I don't want to see is a guy trying to save his wife and child for 2 hours, the egoistic pursuit of a microorganism (family) to save their own little asses, ignoring friends, other relatives, neighbors, other children, stepping on everyone and everything to get themselves saved. It irritates me endlessly whenever I see a movie, where the actor is repeatedly screaming MY WIFE AND KID, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE I don't want to see a disaster movie being romanticized, and idealized into the happily ever ending relationship between man and woman, and the idealized version of a sweet little happy family. Why does Hollywood need to center all their movies around these biases? This movie is way too cliched. Man and woman divorced, husband cheated, woman is angry, man is trying to do his best, has major regrets. A child being ill, needs constant medication. What exactly was this movie about? According to the short description: A family struggles for survival in the face of a cataclysmic natural disaster. No they are not struggling for survival, they are trying to get to a save place, and once they finally get there bumm, it's all over.Dear Hollywood,Why not write an original script for once without these clich\u00e9s?

No way would you be able to go outside hours, days, weeks or even months after this happened and see the sun shining and a few birds flying around.

But in an unexpected and refreshing change, writer Chris Sparling made this story more about family dynamics and humanities quest for survival during an extinction-level disaster. This felt less Hollywood-ish, and more realistic than I expected, and that's a good thing. Director Ric Roman Waugh did a great job putting together Sparling's script. The 119 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing. The score was decent, but felt a little overbearing in some scenes. The casting was good, with Butler delivering as usual, but Morena Baccarin seemed bland in most of the film, and her constant side view during the car ride highlighting her terrible nose job was annoying. The score was decent, although overbearing in some scenes. I was disappointed with the 1990's CGI effects especially having a 35M budget. Nevertheless, a fun and enjoyable ride, and a solid 8/10 from me."}, {"id": 25, "text": "A man is warned to seek shelter as a comet and it's smaller gravity-locked companions decide that planet earth would be a good way to break its fall. Gerard Butler is that man.Thus begin the trials of Gerard and his wife and son. Not in attempting to stop the comet or to survive the impact or it's aftermath. Come on, that's been done. No, you are instead a witness to their attempts to find shelter, for 2 hours!Why Greenland? Could it be because the largest impact crater was recently discovered there, under an icesheet. The biggie that is now believed to have triggered the last ice age? Nope. Something to do with the previous location of the magnetic North pole perhaps? Not even close although both would have been worthwhile.Greenland is the man's destination for safety when an extinction level event occurs. That's it. If the safe haven was in Wisconsin or Jumanji, that's what the movie would have been titled.So what goes on for 2 hours? World leaders uniting to save the species perhaps? Nyet! Missiles? Railguns? Armageddon-style suicide missions and secret projects for evacuation to Mars? NOPE! How about the impact itself, do we get to see that? Sorry. Well, everything except all the above.You get drama, with dad getting off the evacuation flight for his son's insulin that was left in the car. Who knew? There's action, like rioting and looting. It has traffic snarls as people try to drive somewhere, anywhere to presumably get off the film.And it has clich\u00e9s, notably, one at the start that is destined to be the new must-have disaster movie clich\u00e8. Being informed that you must evacuate immediately and to only bring your wife and diabetic son, while your phone is set on speaker at a neighbourhood get-together. Talk about a new record for losing friends. Anyhow, new clich\u00e8 and you saw it first in Greenland!It goes downhill from there. This disaster movie sets the bar so low that Deep Impact would be Oscar-winning material. To be fair, Gerard is an actor in demand and he is prolific, so one can forgive him for this stinker.

Yes like most disaster movies it has the standard recipe of a divorced/nearly divorced family, I still don't get why. The movie shows some special effects of impacts but this is no 2012, this movie is mostly about the breakdown of society when all of the sudden everyday people are confronted with despair. I find it amusing how some comments here are about characters in the movie are portrayed negative and selfish only caring about their own family. Newsflash for you ... that's what people tend to do in a situation of life and death. You ever look at reports in the news of people clawing each others eyes out at food distribution in war zones? They know very well more food is coming. Now imagine the whole world being faced with imminent death ... it will not be pretty. Frankly I would be like that group partying till the music stops.Spoilers: Now as regarding the ending. They arrived at the base in Greenland with the diabetic kid. How did this kid survive 9 months when it was clear in the beginning they were avoiding people requiring longterm medicines? After all when they ran in the Cold War shelter it clearly looked unused since decades. Everyone only knew about the comet since a few days so it's not like they could prepare the place.Since when did places like New Delphi and Sao Paulo have nuclear blast grade old Cold War shelters?Also 9 months!?! I know they need some positive fluff at the end of American movies or they won't do well in the box office over there. But anyone paying attention in science class would remember that after the Yucatan impact it was suspected the skies did not properly clear for several years.So I am still giving it an 8 because the acting was good and so was the overall story.

There he wants to go. Shortly before the end they manage to get in illegally. The ark on which he now lives is one of a few. The film ends with the dramatic opening of the gates of the ark and that they can finally look out into the world. The end.Greenland (aka. 2020): A man (separated from his wife) learns about the imminent end of the world. Of course he wants to save his family. They make it away from home. From there their odyssey begins. Because of his important job and information from a guy he meets by chance, he learns that there is a bunker. There he wants to go with his family. Shortly before the end they manage to get in illegally. The bunker he now lives in is one of a few. The film ends with the dramatic opening of the gates of the bunker and that they can look out into the world (which is still standing). The end. I know that the disaster movie genre cannot be reinvented in its basic features, but I am surprised how little new a film can show.Positive aspects: one of the more 'realistic' disaster moviesSpecial effects - ok.unfortunately I can't think of any moreTotal: 3/10 stars. If you just want to watch a movie that will take your mind off Covid-19 for 2 hours and spoil it a bit with action and special effects, this is the right place. For all others who want to see a really good movie that will surprise and amaze them - Nah...

Nor is this a movie that will satisfy those who are looking for the standard disaster blockbuster type of entertainment. This one is small-budget stuff, compared with any recent flick in that genre. But, if you lock away your brain in a safety deposit box before you walk into the theatre, there is a chance that you may actually enjoy it, to a degree. I did. In my own case, maybe it was because there are three actors in the cast that I particularly enjoyed watching.I'm sure you can easily mention a few meteor-catastrophe movies. Greenland is another one. In anticipation of such extinction event level of crisis, the government has set up in Greenland an underground shelter for selected individuals and their immediate family members to ride this out. The criteria for selection is obvious: people that have skill sets to contribute to the rebuilding of the world. John (Gerard Butler) a construction engineer, is a natural choice, together with wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd). The trajectory is their journey to Greenland, with a whole slew of incredulous twist and turns, including the three of them get separated and back together again in Allison's father Dale's (Scott Glenn) house.I am not going to spend any time on the plotline. All the ingredients you see here you would have seen in other movies, and likely better handled there. I enjoyed this movie, as mentioned before, because of three actors (that does not include Butler, sorry).Morena Baccarin is not a household name but would be favy familiar to the very successful TV series Homeland which completed its 8th season earlier this year. Scott Glenn is one of my favourite evergreen veterans, with 98 acting credits to-date. The third one, which I haven't mentioned yet, is Hope Davis, with 57 acting credits to-date and best remembered, for me, in the TV recent series For the people which unfortunately has been cancelled after two season.

The planet and all life is being threatened with imminent destruction, we don't need a kid with diabetes sub-plot to move things forward.But that's exactly what happens, apparently diabetes in an insurmountable chronic disease for the US Army (even though insulin is so common you can buy it OTC for your pet), leading to a very contrived situation that carries along the rest of the story, and eats up the 1st 1/2 of the film.There's also an absolute bonkers dumb scene where an emergency radio broadcast starts calling out meteor fire like it's an incoming artillery strike, which is just an excuse to watch individual people being pelted by fiery rocks. It's shockingly stupid to watch.As a side note to the writers: A 9-mile wide comet fragment that impacts the planet so forcefully that it leaves surface scaring akin to the moon would not clear up in 9 months.

As seen by Tenet, we don't need a full-on hero's journey with Beat the Cat structure, but even still, there's a structure. This movie starts as if it will be a character driven movie, but quickly evolves into a plot driven one, and suddenly the protagonist gets muddled, fixes that but by repeating the previous beats and adding story elements that were not properly set-up.

Of course many movies before use this aspect but:One of the reviews posted before described it, I quote: Felt like the way they handled this was more realistic, so in a way 'scarier'. We (wife and I) can totally agree with this.Ok, the storyline was sometimes not so realistic: : Greenland is 1/4 of the landsize of Australia, so the plane landed within a mile of the bunker? Come on be real. Being save within 10 seconds before total destruction: is not necessary, but ok we will except it.Being a parent for some years, the moment the familty (due to poor discions) is ripped apart and especiallty the moment your child is ripped away from your side, was truely pictured perfectly and a incredibly scary part of the movie.In some strange way, this movie grips you by the heart, it is the atmosphere created, not the action or the fact earth is being destroyed again (for so many times before).Keep in mind: how far will you go, when you know death is not so far away, will you surrender, freeze or fight?We found this movie totally not pleasant to watch, but it was good.

From the first words things looked bad. Butler used the weirdest, most indecipherable and, I might add most character-pointless, Scot's accent Ever! And Butler is ficking Scottish!

After efficiently establishing he's a contractor willing to cut out in the job at crucial moments AND screw around on his wife it all really starts to pick up speed sliding down the sucks slope. What could've been majestically terrifying inexplicably missed every opportunity for what should've been toweringly horrific special effects. Instead they opted for brief flashes of CGI and long reaction shots from the horrified characters who apparently got to see something much better than we get to see.The race to escape has moments - brief, small moments, but is mostly sadly farcical, more so for the apparent fact that only one road exists in the US and that Max Senate, creator of the Keystone Cops silent films is still alive and wrote and directed most of the action that takes place along that lone road. Finally, after much not worth mentioning all make it toThule Greenland. Thule is apparently a magic place since it's much closer to the incoming asteroid's impact than almost any deep hole in the US. I guess the only road in the US didn't pass near any hunkers. Everyone, well, a few people hustle into the magic Greenland bunker at the last minute and we suffer along with the horde of 10 or 12 bunkered up folks who are way more frightened than anything we've seen would suggest they need be. Then, it happens! The great climactic scene where somewhere something bad is happening, but we should just be grateful we don't have to witness something that frightening! What we get is a not terrifying rumbly noise, sort of farty really, that I like to hope signified something so intense the director just couldn't risk showing it to us so instead we get hacky flashbacks of happy times while the world comes to an end outside, which, again, we don't get to watch. It was, though, nice to see the birds from Disney's Song of the South come out of retirement for the big re-emergence scene where a few of what surely must be hundreds of thousands of survivors, somewhere else, step back out into their brave new world, oh, a good 10 or 15 minutes after the 900 degree deathfire winds (we don't get to see) have roared past, finding the cartoon, yes cartoon birds! wheeling and capering gaily.

Action scenes are predictable, you kind of don't understand why the characters would make some decisions other that to get themselves into problems.

Hard to say how many of those congested highways scenes were real, but if Amazon was involved maybe the producers simply rented miles of freeway and stocked it with hundreds of extras and vehicles.That said, the story itself is a letdown. Too much heartwarming dialogue, zipping around plot holes the size of impact craters, and Garrity doing heroic stuff that makes little sense given the circumstances.But even extinction-level events have their upsides.

Absolutely anything! when they were in the bunker and the clock was counting down they held eachother and had all the flashback of all their happy memories together! I thought that was a good ending personally. Very touching and moving and also cause they made a pretty big point on the size of the comet being bigger than the one that killed the Dinos. Then it went black... sad but touching! The movie showed everything. The ones who stayed behind and were prepared to die where they wanted to. The ones who tried and tried and even if it was no use they could know they gave their son a chance!Then they started showing cities in ruins... now if my teacher taught me right, that comet they showed up with all amazing effects, would have flattened the bloody place.

Again, just comes across as as a redemption act for our adulterous hero and adds nothing.Some of the choices the wider characters make seem unrealistic to me (I couldn't imagine people volunteering to mann army checkpoints while admitting that they are away from their families and humanity will be wiped out in 3 days. I'm not military so maybe I dont know what I'm talking about, but I'd imagine even the most dedicated of soldiers would want to be with their family at this time)Many of the elements of this film ie: extinction level event comet, underground shelters, mention of huge tsunamis (we dont actually see these materialize in the film) harks back to earlier disaster film deep impact, except they did it much better &amp; with far more originalityOverall the film was mildly entertaining &amp; worth a watch if you like the disaster genre - but save yourself some money &amp; wait for the home release."}, {"id": 511, "text": "It is a moving story (it can move you to the edge of your seat).

There has rarely been a movie in the last five years with Butler in it, that was not either bad or completely awful. The last of which, to name few were, the last part of the Fallen Trilogy, Angel has Fallen, the less than exciting WWII thriller Hunter Killer and one of the worst movies to be made in the last few years, Geostorm. Knowing all this I went into Greenland with a certain level of skepticism. Luckily, Butler seems to have gotten a lot smarter in his choices because Greenland is a quite entertaining motion picture. While I am not a fan of disaster movies, mostly because they always follow the same boring concept namely, a family or gets separated for some stupid reason and tries to find each other again over the next two hours while their journey is complicated by various obstacles of human or nature kind. Greenland is no doubt a disaster movie but fortunately it is a little more exciting and creative than most of its kind over the last few years have been. The movie begins with John Garrity (Butler) visiting his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and their son Nathan. John and Allison are separated but they seem to get along fine. Nathan is fascinated by the stars and the asteroid that is shooting towards earth. Soon the Garritys invite some friends over, when a presidential alert appears on their TV and phone telling them to pack some bags and drive to a close by airfield. When they get there they are ushered in and just before they are about to board the plane the separation plot kicks in. Admittedly it's not as stupid as usual. Now this might sound like your typical disaster movie but trust me it's not quite. Greenland is smart in how it handles it's characters and the plot is not always straight forward. The movie tries less to create tension with the looming disaster but rather does so through the human element and the different characters the family members meet on their way. We only get to experience what the family members do. There are no five or six main characters that each have their own agenda. Even when they're separated, the Garritys stay the focus of the movie. They meet good and bad people along their journey and what I liked in particular was the honesty with which the director handles these characters. Many people are selfish and greedy and even in situations like this one, where working together is most important, people still only think of themselves. The movie works also because Butler and Baccarin have a very good chemistry. They are the couple that has had hard times but still loves each other and would do anything to stay a family. Butler is really good here. As good as he hasn't been in years. It's not a very difficult role or something that would be beyond his skillset but it is more serious and dramatic than his usual tough guy parts. Quite a few times I was happy to see that he can do more than growl and butcher an American accent. Granted, he still butchers it but at least his character is so charming and likable that we can overlook it. The love and tenderness he shows in his face a few times is one I have never seen of him and, in a particularly important scene, we see the self loathing and disgust in his face. I believe he always had it in him and I am glad he finally chose a movie that allowed him to bring out his full talent. Baccarin is good too, especially on her own. She hasn't had too many major roles yet in movies but I hope she will soon. She really is a capable actress. Greenland is certainly worth watching and if you have the chance and the current situation allows it, go see it next month when it's released. It makes for a welcome change of pace."}, {"id": 592, "text": "I must admit that I was certainly expecting more from this 2020 disaster movie than what writer Chris Sparling and director Ric Roman Waugh actually managed to deliver with Greenland.Well now, don't get me wrong, because I am not saying that this is a bad movie, nor am I saying it is a movie that isn't entertaining or enjoyable. It certainly was. However, the movie was just way too generic, mundane and predictable. And for a disaster movie, then I am afraid to say that the movie was frightfully devoid of massive scale destruction.Visually then Greenland was good, however, I was hoping to get to see a lot more destruction as the meteor and the fragments made contact with Earth. There were a few destruction scenes, and they most definitely were good to look at, no doubt about it. But for a disaster movie, then there just wasn't nowhere near enough of destruction and pure CGI mayhem throughout the course of this movie. It should be said, though, that the CGI and special effects that were in the movie definitely were convincing and looked very real and good on the screen. So thumbs up to the CGI and special effects crew.Greenland felt more like a family drama laced with some end-of-the-world disaster theme. At no point throughout the course of the movie did I really feel like the world was about to end. Sure, it was mentioned in the movie and the premise was staged for it, but director Ric Roman Waugh just didn't come through. I have to admit that I didn't really sit down to watch Greenland because of the family drama going on between John Garrity (played by Gerard Butler) and Allison Garrity (played by Morena Baccarin) amidst an end-of-the-world scenario. No, I was here for the end of the world and the spectacular effects showcasing the destruction. But sadly, Greenland wasn't really all that great in terms of being a disaster movie.The movie does have a good ensemble of actors and actresses, and I will say that both Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin carried the movie quite well, and the child actor, Roger Dale Floyd, definitely also added something good with his performance. It was nice to see Scott Glenn in the movie, just a shame that he wasn't given more screen time.While Greenland is watchable and entertaining for what it turned out to be, I just felt cheated out of a grand disaster movie experience; one that I thought would have put the 2009 disaster movie 2012 to shame and knocked it off of its seat in the throne of disaster movies.My rating of Greenland, once the ash has settled, stands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars. The movie was just way too generic and following a very strict run-of-the-mill-how-to-make-a-disaster-movie blueprint."}, {"id": 593, "text": "First, let me confess and get this out of the way, I do like Gerard Butler. However, that is not why I think this movie is so good. This was a very well done, action-packed, end of the world film. Was this film totally perfect? No. Were there any mistakes made in the film? There may have been, but you would have to look very hard to find them. The production values were very high. The acting was very well done. Everything had an expensive, polished look to it. The cinematography, acting, editing, sound and SFX were all up there. The budget I believe, was $35 million; and every single penny of that is up on the screen for you to enjoy. DO NOT allow the negative reviewers to scare you away from watching this film! If you do, you will be robbed of experiencing a very good action movie. It seems like some people watch a movie with the sole intention of trying to pick it apart! Some people say that all of this is been done before. Well maybe in a way, it has. Think about it. Just how many different ways can you make an end of the world film? Look where we are. It's 2020. Do you know how many end of the world movies have been made?! Hundreds, if not thousands! So to be honest, it's kind of hard to come up with an idea that is completely original. They say the devil is in the details. The truth of the matter is that in all of these end of the world movies that have been made so far, the differences between them is in the details! For instance, we already know (from the trailers) that a planet killing comet is going to hit. And yes, we know that there are going to be people panicking, and experiencing hardships, and all kinds of destruction, etc., etc., etc. So when you consider all the movies that are made with that general plot outline, the only way they can vary from each other is in all of the many details. For instance, take a movie script, copy it 100 times, and give a copy to 100 different directors and film crews. When everything is said and done, you will end up with 100 movies all about the same thing. But all of these movies will be completely different from each other. They will have a different look, feel, atmosphere, technical expertise, flavor, etc. And the reason that they are all completely different from each other, is because there are so many 1000s and 1000s of small details that make up a movie that cause these movies to be completely different from each other. So like I said, the devil is in the details. And the details are what make a movie either good or bad. All in all, I think that Greenland is a very well done movie. So yes, when you sit down to watch the movie, you already know that supposedly, a comet is going to destroy the world. But you don't really know exactly how it's going to happen. And you don't know exactly all of the infinitely small details that join together and ultimately bring you to that event. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Is it the 'comet ends the world film' to end all, 'comet ends the world films'? Probably not. But this film is definitely worth watching. You will be thoroughly entertained. All of the main actors are people that you actually end up caring about. Were some aspects of the movie glossed over at the expense of other parts? Perhaps. So all in all, let me just say this: This was a very well done, action-packed, end of the world film. And I believe that you will really enjoy it! Because ultimately, the goal of a film such as this, is to entertain you. And Greenland really succeeds."}, {"id": 594, "text": "Ahh Hollywood movies.

Then of course she opens her mouth and its the usual women stuff, so you can go get a snack and come back in 5 minutes. They'll include some kid scene that is annoying and cringe for everyone involved, but you are still in the kitchen getting a snack, so its tolerable.I'm only 10 minutes in but you can tell this movie will end the way it started - predictably, boring, probably large sound effects, a few million in pyrotechnics and more cringe worthy lines.

As a result, I actually saw almost nothing of it And other problems like lazy acting and medium performance at the best of times, and corny sentences that we've heard 100 times before But the vasual effects in the movie were very good and helped the general appearance of the movie to come out well"}, {"id": 596, "text": "Greenland (2020) feels as if the filmmakers wanted to make a profound social/political statement, but lacked the foggiest notion of what to say. Or perhaps they earnestly believed the incoherent babbling that comes across is somehow deeply profound.The earth is about to be struck by a comet which will trigger an extinction-level event, only this is no ordinary comet, but a Hollywood comet. It's existence comes as a complete surprise. NASA tracks the precise paths of 20,000 near-Earth asteroids, 500,000 pieces of space junk, and several thousand satellites, but somehow missed a humongous comet headed directly for us that could wipe out all life on the planet. This comet will wreak havoc and destruction over a course of several days, first with some chunks large enough to wipe out entire cities, then with a meteor shower of molten metal, and finally with a chunk the size of Manhattan, which will wipe out nearly all living creatures.The filmmakers don't explain how NASA could miss noticing so many objects hurtling toward the planet or how all these fragments manage to remain on the roughly the same trajectory and hit a moving target travelling at 107,000 km/hour or 2.5 million kilometers a day.Fortunately (for a lucky few), the president will implement Dr Strangelove's plan, except without the polygamy, and fly the chosen to Greenland to wait out the coming Ice Age in huge underground bunkers. Apparently Trump managed to buy the island in secret, as Denmark doesn't seem to need these bunkers for their own citizens. One wonders how such a plan would have evolved in real life. Trump would have insisted on a merit-based selection process, while Pelosi and Schumer would have withheld funding unless the chosen represent the ethnic and cultural diversity of the populace, with spots reserved for undocumented aliens and geriatric politicians. The filmmakers never try to explain how the chosen are chosen. The president is never seen, reduced to a disembodied robocall voice.Garrity (Gerard Butler) and his family must contend with the forces of nature, an uncaring bureaucracy, a society that has devolved into anarchy, various criminals, and existential dilemmas - the grist of several distinct (and not necessarily compatible) movie genres.

An unknown metior and not knowing where it will impact, with all of the resources at our disposal this is simply not true.In this film in some ways it is more realistic compared to other similar films where the metiors seen to aim themselves but in order ways it is actually very annoying.Annoying because 2 major parts of this film were included just to ramp up the suspence but for me both I felt.......Firstly if someone was chosen to go to a shelter you would think the government would know of a long term medical condition, secondly if a married couple wanted to steal the wrist bands why not simply steal them both and not do what they did with the son?Lazy writing once again!What promised to be an excellent film because of the above actually turned out to be quite a disappointment and honestly just skip the first 90 minutes of the film trying to build up the characters because you honesty don't care about them.Rating 5 out of 10"}, {"id": 599, "text": "Well, I think so, and here i'll explain why his might be one of the best of it's kind, and then I'm talking about realistic catastrophe movie with good acting a.s.o.Greenland is not only a two hours thrill-ride, it's also an intelligent and quite realistic catastrophe movie. My thoughts went to The Towering Inferno (1974) and Norwegian The Wave (2015), and the very best The Impossible (2012). And I rule out the alien-kind like Indendence day, which isn't that good either.The film has great story up-building, and doesn't tell to much on why things are like they are, questions will still be answered later on. No over-explaining, but tension-up-building in a good way. the film also make us care about the main persons, and they sweat, scream, are breathing heavy after a run. All actors are ding a great job. The film is well acted, and full of great actors, even in the smaller roles.When you then also ads a plausible story and mostly very good CGI then there can't be much going wrong. (OK not all CGI is perfect, but its good, especially the fires and comet-fractions.) But the film even takes time to ask very good questions - I won't reveal them here, but the film can actually both make a debate, as well as change how we will react to a comet hitting the earth.The film also is careful not stereotyping, it's very generous and all in all not only a good script, but als very well made. Kudos to Ric Roman Waugh which really is a film maker to look out for. I love his Felon, Shot Caller and Snitch, which all were impressive. But this is in fact his most impressive so far! Go see it in theaters if you can. This film deserves a large screen - and I'll go watch again tomorrow!"}, {"id": 600, "text": "There's nothing like timing a disaster film to coincide with a similar real-life event - minus the devastating consequences of course.Ric Roman Waugh's Greenland has been released just as the comet Neowise is coursing through our skies. The astronomical phenomena was at its brightest on 22 July, becoming as bright as the North Star and visible without visual aids, creating a stir around the world. The comet in Greenland however, had a very different idea.Dubbed 'Clark', the cosmic entity was announced to be a spectacular and harmless viewing event. Then it became that a rogue piece had entered the atmosphere, but would mostly burn itself out and land in the ocean. Everyone was thrilled, until the piece made landfall... in Central Florida.Greenland follows the Garrity family as they make their way to safety. Gerald Butler and Morena Baccarin are estranged couple John and Allison, who work together to bring their son Clayton (Scott Glenn) to their ordained government shelter.Replete with catastrophic events as the urgency builds up, the film's visuals are worth looking out for, both for its terrifying scale yet surreal beauty. It is one of the highlights, even as an extinction-level fragment is making its way within 48 hours of the first impact.Waugh's focus is on the family and their tribulations, so don't expect it to be all smooth sailing. But part of the film is also used to showcase a bitter side of humanity, as people disregard the greater good for the sake of self-preservation. Other than Neowise, the messaging also hits home with the pandemic, as the world struggles to cope with errant behaviour from the public. It's extremely disturbing in that expect.That said, the way it is executed comes across a little trite at times. From a scene of some strangers partying (the hedonists), to a couple that hijacks a situation (the false samaritan), writer Chris Sparling's vignettes are much too cliche for the seasoned audience. Waugh also directs these scenes with little depth, often over delivering on the messaging as characters stir up their motives. Trust me, it's very clear who's good or bad in this film.When the family gets separated, these episodes get even more pronounced. And worse still, the situations they run into veer dangerously into caricatures themselves. There's only that many stalled highways and hitchhikes you can take, and the way people drop in and out of the main thread discourages any emotional investment from the viewer.It's not that Waugh doesn't try, but the episodes are repetitive in formula and so after a while, you just know what to expect. And for a disaster movie, that's not very exciting.But while the side characters are bland, Greenland's biggest lack comes from its main cast - they're not very likeable at all.Throughout the film, the family ditches friends, emotionally-blackmails officers, and at parts even endangers everyone else for the sake of saving their family. While this ode to family loyalty is admirable to a point, the situations start to make the Garrity's seem entitled. And no one really wants to root for entitled folks.From non-stop badgering for information from officers trying to do their job, to allowing exceptional waivers for their case, they throw the greater good out into the wind without so much as a blink of an eye.Waugh tries to negate this with some scenes of the Garrity doing good to a random stranger, but they are so random that you'll be more puzzled than convinced that these are people you should be cheering on.So while Greenland still wins for its premise and effects (minus the incredibly flat orange color grading), the lack of endearment to the characters leaves the title without much impact."}, {"id": 601, "text": "This film really feels like someone accidentally signed off to give one of those mid 2000 asylum/syfy films a larger budget.

The cgi is better and the cinematography is fine. Meanwhile Gerard Butlers accent travels around the world and you are left wondering how he got to be in A-list films.It was nice to see Scott Glen in a film as I haven't seen him on screen in about ten years but like everyone else in the film hes given little to do. It also feels padded, like when a film is trying to make the 90 minute mark, only this one is two hours long. The scene where we see someone go from tent to tent to tent to tent to tent to find someone is supposed to be tense but it just becomes laughable.I like a good(or bad) disaster movie but the characters, writing and direction of this are just so plodding and unoriginal that it all feels pointless."}, {"id": 602, "text": "Well, I am not frequently giving high scores, you can check by clicking my user name, confirming this is a real review as well. The movie is definitely underrated (barely above 6 at the time of this review on November the 15th). I am giving a 10 for several reasons. Most of all, as I said, it is underrated and I hope to raise the final score a bit. This movie is not perfect, but it is very good. It is a disaster movie but it is not a mere copy of existing ones, it has its own flavor. I found that certain periods, although not all of them, are very detailed and highly realistic, especially when it comes to military management. Social psychology has an important place in the movie, not only intra family relations, but general human interactions when confronted to threats to life. Butler has a more developed role than usual, less muscular, more next door guy and this is better. Maybe he can become a more subtle actor ans gain bigger roles \u00e0 la Bruce Willis, yet I find it hard to relate to, and he is barely likable, same goes for the rest of the cadt actually. I found the kid annoying, to be honest, way too fragile and whiny even for his age. I suppose this is plausible if he was overprotected, etc. Even though I did not bond with the characters, it was worth following them, quite a thrill. There are spectacular pictures that do not always entail explosions and destructions. I will not spoil, and I will simply say that it builds a frightening atmosphere. Situations can be disturbing to very young viewers. In conclusion, this is a hollywood grade movie, and its two hours are never boring. Try it and make your own opinion. I think the movie deserves at least 7 or even 8."}, {"id": 603, "text": "I just watch a Blu-Ray copy of this movie tonight and I decided to write this review because I disagree strongly with all the negative reviews on this movie. I loved the screenwriting, how the writer keeps the viewer on the edge with lots of surprises and unexpected turns. It's much better than the usual disaster movies I've seen before this one because the film director used almost documentary visual techniques to get gritty realism in many of the scenes, he was helped too by really good actors all around. Morena Baccarin shines particularly in this movie, she should get an award for her performance in this movie, there is this particular car scene on the highway at night where she let it all rip and she's just amazing. She deserves to get really good parts in movies, she's that good. Gerard Butler carries this film too and has great scenes in it, it's much better than some of his past choices of movies. There is also a great cameo by Scott Glen, always an amazing actor. On the whole everything was good about this movie, cinematography, music, editing, special effects, etc... The only downer for me was the last bit just before the end credits roll, the idea of the screenwriter at the end was good, I just believe that the director could have done a little bit more visually with the actors (costume, hair, etc) to sell it to us. It felt a bit rushed. And that's why I give this movie 9 instead of 10!"}, {"id": 604, "text": "Gerald Butler has been a man that has been in a lot of really bad movies yet despite that I still watch his movies because of his great Scottish accent. Greenland is another disaster movie that stars Gerald Butler. The premise is that John Garrity (Gerald Butler), his estranged wife (Morena Baccarin) and their young son (Roger Dale Floyd) embark on a perilous journey to find sanctuary as a planet-killing comet hurtles toward Earth. Since Gerald Butler movies are mostly a miss, I didn't go into this one with high expectations. Is Greenland terrible like his other disaster movie Geostorm or is this an actual good one?Firstly, I appreciate that this movie takes a serious and more grounded tone and does it well. A fair amount of disaster movies feel really over the top or a bit too cartooney and slapstick like 2012. The characters all act like humans and all the interactions feel human which is a breath of fresh air in these type of movies. Another element of this movie that is quite distinct is the heart and kindness within the movie. Apocalyptic movies or TV shows tend to focus on the worst of people but Greenland focuses on the opposite. Albeit there are scenes with the worst of people for sure. A recurring theme in the movie is the act of kindness and while watching this movie in a pandemic (Coronavirus), it's easy to appreciate the good deeds that are shown in the movie. The director (Ric Roman Waugh) and writer (Chris Sparling) show the different ways that people handle this cataclysm including individuals who would just party, riot or remain kind that feels believable. The action scenes with the Earth's destruction do occur in the movie but the human drama is the main focus.Speaking of the action scenes, while rare, are visually spectacular and lead to some stunning and tense moments. For the most part, the CGI is pretty good but it does get really bad and jarring in the third act. Likewise, the cast does a pretty good job. Morena Baccarin gives a good performance as a fiercely loving mother that is desperate to protect her son. Gerald Butler is a lot better in this movie than a lot of his previous movies even though he is still mostly just the gruff-looking dad. Roger Dale Floyd who is the child actor is not unbearable like a fair amount of child actors. All three of them are mostly giving okay performances but every one of them has one moment where their performance shines.When it comes to flaws it is mostly concerning the way the story is progressing. For the movie to last 2 hours, there are a lot of moments where our main characters tend to make jarring decisions. Most of this is concerning the wife who I just feel makes a lot of dumb decisions in this movie. You do have to kind of shut your brain to watch this movie or else you will constantly go question a lot of things. The movie also has some pacing issues in my opinion as at some points it feels like it dragging a bit and slowing the movie. The movie does start to feel a bit long and could have cut 10-15 minutes off the total run time.On that point of characters, they are quite bland. The movie never really delves into the characters that much and instead are more focusing on their situation. This can work such as in Dunkirk (2017) but for this movie, I feel they should have explored a bit more about our characters. Apart from the dad John who is a structural engineer, I don't know much about the wife Allison and I don't know much about the kid apart from he is diabetic which is the main thing that keeps this movie going for 2 hours. It's slightly difficult to be fully invested in caring about the characters. We also get a revelation near the beginning of the third act that feels irrelevant and if anything makes it more difficult for me to care about the characters.Overall, this is a surprisingly all-right movie from Gerald Butler. It's not the garbage that was Geostorm which is great. With all the gloom that is happening in the real world, this movie provides some mild entertainment with a hopeful message that is maybe something we kind of need at this time. You definitely won't feel like it was the worst 2 hours you spent after watching this movie."}, {"id": 605, "text": "There a lot of movies dealing with the world (possibly) coming to an end. Most of this movies focus on the type of destructions, or on heroes, who do the impossible and save humanity from whatever is coming. Of course all of them will have some kind of human interaction included in their storyline. Love is a key aspect to an ordinary screenplay. So what is then so special about this movie?It is an emotional rollercoaster drive. It digs deep into human nature. Not only scratches it on the surface of what human beings could be capable of, when the world would face such an disaster, but it drills inside, you can actually feel it. You can actually understand, what such a scenario would really mean. It was the first time I was watching an world-ending scenario movie, where I actually believed everything I was given on screen. For me that is absolutely unique, and as I learned from TENET's reviews on this and other platforms; you cannot rely on the publics opinion, when it comes to your own taste.Whrever you live, if theatres are open, do yourself a favor and go watch this incredible piece in a cinema.

The story is about a family that struggles to survive in a catastrophic natural disaster. When I saw the trailer I knew it was going to be a good one and it erased in my mind completely of another disaster film which also the same main male actor was in. The movie was called Geostorm (2017) and it was terrible but it wasn't a shock since the trailer looked bad, thankfully Greenland was over the top and even better than most that are considered the greatest ones in that genre.The way the film sets the pace was terrific especially the depth of the suspense. This is the kind of film which was predictable in what was bound to happen to them but still, the unfolding of the events was thrilling and intense. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time and what I thought about most was what's going to happen next. I liked how real it all felt because this kind of event like in many films, has shown how the government always protects first what they considered the important people even if it's unfair because every life is precious. I also liked that they shot the perspective of the people, not the government, there are many movies already with the viewpoint of the government and this film shot the struggle of a family. The meaning of being human is tested it showed the heartfelt compassion of some people given the situation but it mostly showed the cruelty and the length some go just to survive and not caring the damage left behind. The film is mainly about how some people stop being human beings and all through the instinct of survival. I didn't expect to have tears but I did when the main actor said you are my life that scene was so perfectly emotional, I could feel every second of it and the music helped immensely.The composer David Buckley sets the thriller atmosphere fantastically and he also sets an emotional music theme the one which starts the film anchoring the pace of the events about to unfold.The main cast was fantastic as ever and all the praise goes to Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin, both of them gave magnificent performances. Morena Baccarin deserves to be in more films, the way she touches his face in the most emotional scene, so much feeling what a natural talent."}, {"id": 608, "text": "I saw the trailer and was excited for this new disaster movie as they're my favorite genre. What I got instead was a thrill ride into a survival story of a family who go through many leaps and hurdles to reach Greenland.Race against time movies are nothing new. 2012 did it and many other films have fiddled with it. What this movie does differently is puts you in perspective with a regular suburban family that crosses paths with many challenges within realm of believable things. And yes, there are many cliches and conveniences you'll have to look past. If you can do that, we got a nice edge of the seat thriller that takes you on a ride for 2 hours.Gerald Butler is fine here, his performance is mostly believable but Morena Baccarin stands out the most. Visual fx is strictly okay. Plot borrows some themes and formulae from other movies. Direction is fine. Cinematography is good too.

It can't come even close to standing side-by-side with a movie like 'The day after Tomorrow' or 'Deep Impact' or 'Twister' due to the incredibly low budget.... the problem is: When you're trying to make an apocalypse movie, you HAVE to have a big budget in order for it to be believable. Other movies like Comedy films or Romantic films don't need a big budget and they can still be excellent, but if you skimp on the budget with an apocalypse movie, then you're 100% of the time gonna end up with a B-rate or C-rate movie... it's just a fact.So... is this movie better (or even close) to 'The day after Tomorrow'? HELL NO! And apart from the fact that the movie has very poor CGI, the movie also suffers from being overly dramatic ie. they wasted over 10minutes of the movie on the 'where's my medicine' scene, and it resulted in 10 straight minutes of me rolling my eyes because I knew exactly what was going to happen next. There's 2 other scenes in the movie like this where they just waste screen-time in an effort to stretch the budget and fill up the movie so that it can reach that golden 90minute mark.I'm afraid that this movie is just too hamstrung by the budget... there's nothing really wrong with the actors, but the budget just destroys any change that this movie had of being good. 5/10 for trying to built false suspense too many times and for having a shoestring budget with bad CGI."}, {"id": 610, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This type of movie is always rather divisive between critics and audiences simply due to its nature. Story-wise, it's never groundbreaking or innovative in any shape or form. These apocalyptic films always follow a formulaic screenplay, packed with logical inconsistencies, but also with tons of thrilling action. Visuals vary in quality depending on the studio, as well as sound design and other technical aspects. I always try my best to accept *everything* these movies throw irrationally at the viewer. I prepare myself to be as open-minded as I can, and usually, I have no issues with that (actually, I find the that's not how science works argument a bit nitpicky in this subgenre).However, Greenland fails to deliver the only thing I did expect from it: a planet-killer comet of pure popcorn entertainment. The only positive aspects are the cast and two/three sequences genuinely exciting. Gerard Butler is already used to this sort of film (Has Fallen series, Geostorm), so he has no problems in portraying another thin character with no real motivations or depth. Same goes for Morena Baccarin, who simply plays the wife of Butler. Both deliver good performances, enough to keep me engaged until the end of the flick.The few good sequences are really good. Little scraps of the giant comet hit Earth before the extinction-level event, and these look great. Nevertheless, just this for a 119-minute runtime is far from being satisfying. As expected, Chris Sparling's screenplay is as generic as it could be, just like Ric Roman Waugh's direction, which doesn't really offer anything remotely new. Some narrative decisions (not related to science or technology because these I just accepted as part of the usual illogical stuff) are definitely to pass the time since they have no consequences whatsoever. Greenland is precisely like dozens of other movies in the subgenre, but without the technical aspects that end up elevating the overall picture.The VFX look dated in some sequences, almost like they didn't have enough time (or money) to finish them. I mean, a static image of a meteorite shower as the sky? Really? Sadly, this comes across as amateur and lazy. The absence of a powerful score (David Buckley) makes the action scenes feel empty, like something is missing. A few fighting moments are pretty much impossible to see clearly due to the overly dark environment and choppy editing (Gabriel Fleming). Overall, the action walks the line between decent and terrible.However, the most significant slap in the face is the planet-killer comet that everyone is going to look forward to as soon as they enter the theater. There's no way of working around this: if an entire film builds up a third act's massive comet of the side of Europe, it must show it hit the ground in all of its splendor. The gigantic explosion of ridiculous proportions, the endless smoke that fills up the whole atmosphere, the distinctive sound of the impact... This is the moment that can make or break any apocalyptic movie. Unfortunately, and I'm only going to write this, it broke.In the end, Greenland is predictably underwhelming, packing only a couple of genuinely exciting sequences, and a decent cast. Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin try, but they're not enough to compensate for everything else. As expected, Chris Sparling's formulaic screenplay doesn't add a unique storyline or innovative aspect to the genre, as well as Ric Roman Waugh's basic direction. This would all be fine if the action delivered what most people want to see, but sadly, this component is also quite a letdown. Despite a few occasional, riveting scenes, the entertainment levels are pretty low due to the unimpressive visual effects, lack of a powerful score, and poor editing, culminating in a viewing-killer disappointment. If you absolutely love apocalyptic films, maybe you'll find something enjoyable about it that I didn't. However, if this type of movie doesn't suit your preferences, then this one surely isn't going to convert you.Rating: D+"}, {"id": 611, "text": "Do not expect the usual disaster movie full of explosions and VFX. It focuses more on the Garrity family, and their quest to reach the safety in the government bunker, before the world ends. The family during their survival journey will encounter many difficulties. Greenland tries to be a different movie on the genre, and I appreciate when a director take a different approach, considering also that most of these apocalypse movie are very similar.Characters are very flat, there is no development. The wife, Allison is really annoying and I think that she cries 80% of the time, Gerard Butler tried to do his best, but unfortunately he could not deliver a convincing performance. Maybe the most convincing actor was Roger Dave Floyd playing the kid. There are a lot of boring and uninspired dialogues, that serves to increase the runtime. If they wanted to do a really different thing, they should have focus more on the human side of the family, showing more complex emotions, adding maybe a few tension moments here and there. The problem with Greenland is that it wants to take a different approach from the rest of these disaster movies, but at the same time wants to be one of those Hollywood blockbuster, so at the end I did not really understand the who this movie was made for. For sure not for people that loves apocalypse movies, there is not enough action, but is not either for people that would like to watch something deeper, because there isn't one single interesting dialogue or character.I personally don't recommend this movie, it seems that screenwriters and the director did not even try to do a good product."}, {"id": 612, "text": "For nearly a decade, Gerard Butler has been involved in many underwhelming actioners. Now, I wouldn't put Greenland in the league of a Geostorm or a London Has Fallen. Because it's definitely not THAT bad.

The plot is once again about a family trying to beat the apocalyptic odds (this time due to a large comet named Clarke: what the hell, NASA!) and get to a safe place. The characterization is quite generic; there's nothing that makes John Garrity (Butler) a memorable person other than the fact that he's a structural engineer (and so, the world needs him post-apocalypse).The bigger question in a film like Greenland should be how well the action and the disintegration of the Earth are crafted. Well, the CGI ranges from crappy to decent - Greenland's relatively low budget (for a disaster film) becomes evident at times. The better portions are when the family gets separated and as viewers, we start pondering over the probabilities of their eventual reunion. Ric Roman Waugh's filmography is mixed: a watchable actioner like Snitch, a couple of gems in Felon and Shotcaller, and a half-arsed Angel Has Fallen. What becomes obvious here is that the storytelling in his films is (a lot) better when he writes his own scripts.Chris Sparling's screenplay loses all of its suspense in the third and final act and ends up telling a story that we've heard a zillion times before.

The problem lies in the beginning and in the last section. In the beginning, the people are too sanguine about the comet. Even with the smallest of chances, the news would play up the doomsday scenario. Apparently, there is a government secret program if not a worldwide conspiracy to keep the impending devastation a secret. There is no way that such a big danger be kept secret for long. John could have told his friends to do certain things. I would have told them to gather all the food and essentials, then find the closest deep mine or cave system. It's not all bad but there are problems with the calibrations. These people are doing too many dumb stuff. The middle is the best when the family gets separate. I think they stumbled onto a compelling theme of the story. When things start going badly, they get more worried about being separated. That's the emotional heart which leads me to conclude that the climax should be them reuniting. The problem isn't the end of the world. The problem is losing each other.

This is just the type of film needed at this time: a family-friendly action thriller filled with explosive action sequences, realistic tension and touching emotional moments.Gerard Butler has been lately choosing some great and easily entertaining scripts; Greenland is simply a proof of that. Although it's PG-13, the film doesn't have any vulgarity, obscenity or heavy profanity: making it perfectly suitable to watch with family. The fact that the film deals with this type of blockbuster subject and yet manages to be so grounded is nothing short of great. The pain the family endures, the willingness to survive and the love they share in the toughest of times is what backs the core of Greenland. Visual effects are spot-on and the action sequences: super-realistic and white-knuckle in every sense! It mostly involves disaster action (destruction, explosions etc), but a few gritty fight sequences are also brilliantly executed, at times making you wonder if this is really a PG-13 film. Some of the action is bound to catch you off guard, though, adding to the intensity.Comparisons to other blockbusters of this genre, such as 2012, are inevitable, but Greenland manages to shine on its own, with a fairly thrilling story and an overall grounded, realistic depiction of a family's struggle to survive. Released in cinemas if the pandemic didn't exist, this could set the box office on fire also because of the added family appeal Gerard Butler's last few films didn't have due to the R rating. Nevertheless, it's a really fun film to watch, and you won't realize when time will fly by quickly. We didn't anyways have such blockbusters in abundance this year, did we?"}, {"id": 622, "text": "Gerard Butler is getting the apocalypse as part of his brand. He did the ... Has Fallen series, he played in Geostorm and will play in Afterburn, one could argue that Tale of the Mummy and Reign of Fire were apocalyptic movies as well. And so is Greenland. And it is filled with some of the clichees one would expect from a disaster movie: the average Joe and his family, the dissolution of society, the special effects. Yet this is one of the better ones, as it is well done and has some moments of real tension that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.Let me list the good things. The acting is good, even the child is not bad. The cause of the disaster is very plausible, if not the exact details of it. The threats are quite real and terrifying. Morena Baccarin is in this. And most of all, this film would have worked just as well without the special effects. It was a good story with well crafted moments. Quite unexpected for a movie in this genre.Bottom line: certainly worth a watch, especially if you watched all those other disaster movies which sucked en gros. This one is good."}, {"id": 623, "text": "Gerard Butler, let's admit, is an actor everybody who everyone seems to take frivolously because he has never made anything iconic post-300. I admittedly walked into Greenland expecting it will be like Geostorm again, which was a sci-fi film with a great concept but was ultimately forgettable.I snickered at the fact that how Greenland, the country your geography teacher says looks mistakenly larger on a flat world map than in actuality, has become a safe haven for the apocalypse. I can't help but wonder if Gerard Butler fought all his way to Greenland to find out the shelter have limited space and is left outside to burn due to disproportioned cartography.Well, I stand corrected. I was pleasantly surprised by Greenland. Director Ric Roman Waugh and writer Chris Sparling understand the spectacle of the disaster itself isn't nearly as terrifying as the ugly awful things people would do to each other to survive knowing the world will end. Amidst the impending disaster, the film presents the fabric of society tearing apart and humans turning on each other. As for those Roland Emmerich style panoramic disaster shots, Greenland saves them sparingly for the opportune moments.Another aspect in which Greenland differs from the disaster film conventions is that Gerard Butler's character is not trying to save the world. That is out of his depth. He's just trying to save his family. The story stays with the family and everything else that's happening in the world is delivered sparsely through media outlets.What results is a tense gripping thriller that plays towards one's basic survival instincts that forces the audience to wonder what they would do in these given scenarios. What would you do if you get separated from your family? Could you refuse someone who you knew you couldn't help?Greenland's attempt to break its genre wheel with a character-centric approach reminded me of J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, a disaster film that shares that approach, but with arthouse sensibility. With one foot grounded in the commercial blockbuster sensibility, Greenland doesn't quite land as emotionally impactful as The Impossible, but it is solid experience nonetheless.This is Gerard Butler's best film in a long time and it's unfortunate that it's being released at a time where people can't see it in the cinemas. Most people will catch it on VOD later. If it's safe for you to see Greenland in theaters, I recommend it as a solid matinee."}, {"id": 624, "text": "The series of disaster movies we've had over the years are a confusing lot to rate for me. On the one hand, they are remarkably consistent. They are almost never terrible and are always pretty entertaining for the most part. But on the other hand, they all feel very similar and very safe. They follow a template, a template that happens to work, but also a template that has very little risk about it. You know what you're going to get out of these films, that's for sure.'Greenland' proved to be no exception to that rule. I felt like I knew exactly how it was going to end from the moment it began. There are obviously some twists and character turns along the way, but even those never really take you that much off guard.And yet I couldn't hate this movie. In fact I even gave it a slightly above average rating. The movie looks so great and is so well put together that I'm basically happy to have nothing unexpected happen, and just accept it for what it is. Will I be in the theatre when the next one of these movies comes out? Let's be honest - probably."}, {"id": 625, "text": "4 out of 5 stars.Greenland is an intense thrill ride that captures your attention about Gerard Butler will do whatever it takes to find safety for his family. The movie is realistic to how the event would be. With people going wild. And will do whatever it takes to save themselves.The films first hour will drive you anxious with an intense feeling. John (Gerard Butler) and his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) are separated. While trying to be there for there son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd). When they are about to have a get together party. An emergency broadcast alert has warned them that the comet that was supposedly passing by has changed course. With several pieces hitting around the globe. And a big one that will destroy all life on the planet. The government selecting few to go underground to a hidden bunker. John and his family are trying to reach the air force base while the world is going into chaos. With vandalism and people will do whatever it takes to survive.The first hour is intense. John receiving an emergency alert on his phone. While his neighbors and friends did not. Does make for an emotional moment when he and his family are selected and they did not. While only two days til the big end of the world event put these characters in stressful situation. Like there military evacuation turning awry. The family being separated which John can not get a hold of Allison. Allison coming across another family that may not be too innocent. While John comes across a couple of guys that are looking for trouble. All while they can face oncoming comet pieces that are destroying cities.The film does slow down a little in the middle. When they are driving in a long road trip to another airport. It all picks back up when more comet shards comes crashing down.The cast ensemble is good. Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin did a good job with there characters. The visual effects were pretty decent with the obvious cgi explosions. The director did a good job with the intense thrill ride with action and survival. And a story about a family trying to stay together.The film did a good job in capturing the realistic feel with characters facing stressful odds. Some thrilling action. And a great cast."}, {"id": 626, "text": "John Garrity (Gerard Butler) is a man trying to put his life in order. Despite being a successful structural engineer; he has recently moved back home with his wife Allison (Morena Baccarin), and their son Nathan (Roger Dale Floyd). John and Allison are attempting to rebuild their marriage and despite some awkwardness at first they are moving ahead. In the new film Greenland life is about to become far more complicated for the Garrity family in the form of a comet that is set to pass very close to earth.The authorities have told the public there is no cause for concern but John notices a large group of military aircraft in the skies shortly before he receives an automated call from Homeland Security telling him to come to an evacuation location with his wife and son.Not sure what to make of the message; things become abundantly clear when a harmless fragment strikes and destroys a city on live television. With panic setting in the Garrity family head to the evacuation site only to face complications which leave them separated and facing many dangers and obstacles as they attempt to reunite and get to safety before the big chunk hits in two days.The film is very engaging and what really stood out for me was how the film relied on the cast versus an array of special effects and action sequences which are so common for films in the disaster genre.Despite the circumstances the characters were very relatable and the tension of the pending impact helped shape their actions instead of being a countdown to an elaborate array of FX sequences showing cities being devastated. While there is footage of this sort; it is generally confined to news reports versus being the focal points.Butler was very strong in a departure from his usual action oriented parts as a father trying to make things right in a world that is falling apart around him. It was also nice to hear him using his natural accent for a change as well. While some may wonder about the timing of releasing a disaster film at the end of 2020 and during the Holiday Season the film is so engaging that it did not matter to me in the slightest.Greenland is a film that came in under the radar in terms of hype and expectation but has delivered an enjoyable and memorable viewing experience that is not to be missed.4 stars out of 5The film will arrive on Video On Demand on 12/18/20"}, {"id": 627, "text": "Movie started off good and I was thinking this is going to be a awesome movie then poof quickly went downhill, just too much repetitive stuff and the characters are just plain stupid.Most of the movie is screaming and walking around (must of saved a fortune on CGI), more walking around switching between characters walking around (military base, walking , car, riding in cars, repetitively trying to use the cell phone (....riight).The first half of the movie I thought I was watching a medical commercial about diabetes just on and on about the sons condition, last half of the move it wasn't even mentioned.I felt this movie was poorly done it was a ok single time watch but at times it just never drew me in, I mean a wold ending event is happening and people are still acting normal being all nicey nicey to each other it could of been a great movie it had potential but sadly just flops.Gerard Butler acting was good as always but every other character is just unbelievable"}, {"id": 628, "text": "After the abysmal Geoforce. Gerard Butler stars in another disaster movie to make amends.In Greenland, he plays John Garrity a structural engineer in Atlanta who is going through a patchy marriage.With a comet hurtling overhead. Garrity gets a message on his phone from the US government. He and his family have been selected for emergency sheltering and they need to get to an air force base. Initially the public were not aware that the comet posed a danger.Soon fragments of the comet are hitting the planet causing chaos. The comet is deemed to be an extinction level event.However Garrity's journey is far from smooth. His son is diabetic which means they are refused admittance to the evacuation planes and then the family are separated.Well Greenland is better than Geoforce but that is damning it with faint praise. At its heart this is a race against the clock disaster movie. The Garritys evade peril first from other humans and then try to get to safety as debris falls from the sky.Butler plays Garrity as a good hearted everyman who steps up as a husband and father during the cataclysmic crisis.It just feels like a bigger budget movie than the one you find in the SyFy Channel with a bigger star and better special effects. It is entertaining but it gets increasingly mindless as is goes on."}, {"id": 629, "text": "I mean, how many times are we going to see The Asteroid is Going to Destroy Earth as the theme for a movie? So right there, you already kind of know what this movie is about right out of the gate.I rated this movie 5 Stars because it was just OK. Overall, I thought the special effects were good. The acting was good. The part I did NOT LIKE was the story. There was way to much emotional BS in this movie with the family, the kid, the infidelity of the father - BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH no one cares about, can we get back to asteroids at some point?I mean seriously, we spend 65% of this movie watching someone cry or hug someone. Seriously.This movie needs more Tracking the Asteroids/Comet, Military cool stuff, blowing things up, etc.Also, there was never in the entire movie any mention of any attempt to destroy the incoming comet or comet pieces. Why not? Where was the military of the world during this entire movie? And how does a comet that size just All the Sudden show up days from Earth? - Yeah... kinda BS.5 Stars. Worth a watch but nothing new since Armageddon."}, {"id": 630, "text": "Greenland is an ok film in general, but it's fully constructed with cliches and it is extremely hard to believe that such a family of grown adults could've survived such an event. Although I'm pretty sure that they will eventually be dead since in the real-world an event of such magnitude would turn the planet into an uninhabitable icy hell. But this is Hollywood.It is also around 30 minutes too long, and since the pacing slows down a lot at times, it gets really hard to watch at certain points.This is not a high budget blockbuster so don't expect anything similar to Emmerich's works.Almost everything can be seen from a mile away, some of the secondary characters randomly start delivering the plot. Some of the situations the family gets in are barely believable just because you'd think that grown adults would be smarter than that. Maybe it's a commentary on Western societies getting too soft, but I just can't get over this.They also borrow a couple of famous scenes directly, like the pharmacy scene from World War Z and the debris scene from 2012.I'd be perfectly fine with this film being a low budget serious drama about a world-ending event and not a disaster film, but they decided to spend the limited budget on the effects and not good interesting writing.What I mean is that you don't really need a big budget for a good EOTW film, as the Australians did with 'These Final Hours'.Overall, 'Greenland' is not a bad film, but there's absolutely nothing new or interesting about it, and since there are no massive destruction CGI scenes, it leaves almost nothing of interest to the viewer. Top it all up with lots of unnecessary shaky cam.The ending scenes made me want to see a sequel since it would've been much more interesting to see the survivors trying to live in a new ice age of the destroyed world.P.S. Butler slipping into a British accent was a pleasure though, and it was nice to see Holt McCallany."}], "reviews_amount": 631}
