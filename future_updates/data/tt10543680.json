It shows Ginni as a headstrong woman that is confused between her ex and sunny a shy desperate romantic. It's a love story , with great comedy and the atmosphere is awesome. The cinematography and locations are stunning. I have it a 10 because I think Bollywood is on the decline and doesn't produce many good stories anymore it's repetitive and the songs are whack and most movies have a predictable ending.

I think everyone did a fabulous job in the cast especially Vikrant and Yami as the protagonists were really good. The comedy was light and gives you some small laughs here and there.

And there was something I didn't feel connected to.But still I would say, as compared to some recent garbages that bollywood produced, this movie is still a 'one-time watch'...just something to keep in mind...

But there are three types of clich\u00e9: One, where the filmmaker just uses clich\u00e9s without being aware. Two, where the filmmaker is poking fun at others who have used clich\u00e9s - which comes across as cynical. Three, where the filmmaker leaps whole-heartedly into a field of clich\u00e9s and plays with them, laughs with us, and makes fun WITH them not OF them. This movie is definitely of the third kind.

The very starting point of the movie- the need for Sunny to get married to open his own restaurant doesn't make any sense.

May be it is pressure to pay the bills.Cast is good. Plot is normal romantic premise. But horrible execution and character development."}, {"id": 136, "text": "Looking at the trailer, the only thing that was exciting about this one was the leading pair- Yami and Vikrant. Sadly, it failed to deliver where you get just a glimpse of their chemistry. The story and direction are a little dull and frustrating at times and the climax is so disappointing.The supporting cast offers some relief and the middle part has some pace and funny moments. Vikrant and Yami did not get a chance to show their full potential as the story is outdated.They even have prominent product placements for Haldiram and Manyavar and it looked bad. The music is boring and the background score is cheesy. The twists are stupid and the writing is lame.Suggest you do not even think about attending this wedding at all!"}, {"id": 137, "text": "Ginny Weds Sunny review :After Lootcase earlier this year, Ginny Weds Sunny is a rare satisfying OTT release. It is a light hearted rom com with enough punchlines and a gorgeous looking Yami to keep you engaged throughout its two hours plus of run time.Ginny (Yami) wishes for love marriage only and hence, turns down all marriage proposals until Sunny (Vikrant Massey) secretly teams up with Ginny's mom (Ayesha Raza Mishra) to win her hand in marriage.Avoiding sub-plots, debutant director Puneet Khanna keeps the narrative simplistic with minimum characters relying more on humorous dialogues and chemistry between the lead pair. While he does succeed in building humour in his execution, the chemistry between Yami and Vikrant is not up to the mark here.Vikrant Massey, an otherwise first rate actor and indie cinema favourite these days, appears tad uncomfortable as Sunny and one misses the energy of young Ranveer Singh in Band Baaja Baaraat (2014) which was in similar mould. Ahem!!On the other hand, Yami Gautam not only looks yummy but makes Ginny her own by pitching in a fabulous performance. The supporting cast is also reliably effective.To sum up, Ginny Weds Sunny has its share of fun and can make for a decent weekend watch. Give it a try!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."}, {"id": 138, "text": "Ginny Weds Sunny - Romantic Movie Cast - Yami Gautam, Vikrant MasseyAn entertaining movie that tries to show as many twists as possible. I loved the funny scenes. The starting story is like something that is kind of a dream to everyone. It shows the problems of parents with their adult modern aged son and daughter. The acting of everyone in this movie was relevant. I loved how they implemented a newly furnished story with so many entertaining factors.On the contrary, the finishing part of this movie was not up to the mark. Typical Bollywood ending that occurred in many other movies. Without this part, this movie offers the story of a boy who is struggling to get married. His family is also concern about it. And the girl is having a toxic confusing relationship where her boyfriend is not serious about her. Her mother tries to save her from that boy. So the heroine's mother and the boy with his family make a plan to impress the heroine which leads to an interesting storyline. There occur some complications in the latter part of the story. I suggest watching this movie for a time pass.Personal rating - 6.5/10"}, {"id": 139, "text": "Is this a hilarious or love triangle/square???They showed miss Ginny is confused about her wedding but puneet made the viewers confusedLittle humour was there which he could had continued but he brought unnecessary emotions which spoiled the entertainmentThe climax was so pathetic which threw the movie far behindVikrant expressions and acting were good but he can do far better Yami was looking very ordinary and over actedThis movie has released with scam 1992 series which again became a major drawbackIt was difficult to understand what the confusion was"}, {"id": 140, "text": "A routine love story with a half-baked and predictable plot. The rom-com begins on a fine note, the first half is quite watchable because of Vikrant's comic timing and few comedy punches. In the second half, the film drops due to its tedious screenplay and it lacks the humour too.Vikrant Massey and Yami Gautam shares a good chemistry. Vikrant played his character with ease and Yami delivered a decent performance too. Ayesha Raza gave a charming performance and Rajiv Gupta's dialogue delivery is enjoyable. Other supporting cast has nothing much to offer and were average in their roles.Puneet Khanna's direction is just fine and simple. The makers are failed to deliver a compelling family entertainer.Direction 2.5/5 Acting 3/5 Dialogues 2.5/5 Story 2/5 Screenplay 2.5/5Watch it if want a break from a crime thriller genre."}, {"id": 141, "text": "Vikram Massey's first foray into a mainstream romcom lead role is, unfortunately, a damp squib.Despite the instant likeability he brings to each character, the role of Sunny Malhotra, a 'seeda ladka' trope regularly employed by Bollywood is downright appalling to watch.Yami Guatam is mundane as usual as Ginny Gill, a headstrong girl confused between her long-time boyfriend who refuses to commit, and the increasingly irritating Sunny, who wants to marry her after their first date itself.The only silver lining I could find in this overblown romcom dumpster fire is the hilarious Ayesha Raza who is brilliant as Ginny's matchmaker mother Shobha.Not recommended. Painful stuff. VIkrant should stick to his strong suite-movies with substance."}], "reviews_amount": 142}
