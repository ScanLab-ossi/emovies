The characters/cast are fun and enjoyable. You really get the feeling everyone is having a great time on set. Would recommend people to check it out if your looking for a bit of fun and nothing serious."}, {"id": 1, "text": "This movie was just straight up hilarious. It never got like it was getting boring or going to fast. If you liked the first one you're definitely gonna enjoy this one, maybe even more. The characters were hilarious to watch even if they had little screen time but overall one of the few Netflix movies that feels like it's done well even for a sequel."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Not as good as the first one, but fun enough and enjoyable. The ending saved the movie from being a disappointing sequel. I was surprised about the cast. But I don't want to spoil yet."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Why does this feel so different from the first? It's like they did a Scary Movie version... It's just full on nonsense."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Terminator was not the only film whose sequel was better, I loved Killer Queen more than the previous film.So, McG is back with his satanic cult gang, with a bang. The pure sequel, good storyline, entertaining, crazier, stupid, and Jenna Ortega is so pretty that I'm in love with her.Are you guys missing Samara Weaving right? Go watch this film asap."}, {"id": 5, "text": "The Babysitter was an underrated and guilty watch. This is the one you turn off after 15 minutes or never finish. It's cartoony, forced jokes, editing is horrible.. There's no reason this should've been made, since the first one was such a standalone. if you need a movie to fall asleep on, this is the one."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Its hilarious, gruesome, and fun as its predecessor with a bit of tweak. Cole Johnson is same as last time and casting is great for this genre of horror comedy.. A campy coming of age slasher horror that is entertaining and campy. The story is about the blood cult and this movie is deserved an instant cult following. It seems McG is direction is perfect for this kind of film. I believe this have double twist ending that you look out for..This deserved another sequel."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Cole becomes strong and independent by the end of the first movie but weak and scared by this movie. Melanie who was kind, spiritual, and in love with cole; Melanie is a killer and leading the new blood cult. The whole spin is outlandish."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This sequel's a vacuous disservice to the original. Unfunny drivel.The premise is nothing more than copycat, ripoff, stealing of superior, actually fun 1980's-90's movies &amp; then-network USA Up All Night movies. With a dash of mid-late 1990's Joss Whedon efforts. Ya know, when he still cared?DK, Tangerine Dream &amp; The Cramps selling out &amp; giving this flick permission to play their music is equally sinful."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Nobody asked for this movie. And what a mess! It has nothing to do with the original, it looks like a mix of Quentin Tarantino and Tim Burton, and not in a good way. It is unbelievable to see that the director of the two films is the same. Because the first is a good film, well shot and fun. This film, however, is one of the worst things I've ever seen. Well, I say I saw it, but the truth is that I skipped several parts, watched halfway and then I couldn't take it: I skipped to the finale to end my torment. I will simply pretend that this film does not exist from now on. Because the first one was really good."}, {"id": 10, "text": "The twist is such a spit in the face to fans of the first one, stay away from this movie if you like the first one, it is so bad, not only to people who critique movies, but also the average joe, who watched the first one and figured the second would be as good. WHO WROTE THIS MOVIE AND THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD?!?! WHO EVEN REVIEWED THE STORY AND TOLD THEM IT WAS GOOD?!?"}, {"id": 11, "text": "They have tainted the reputation of the first movie by this stupid,nonsense, and forced plot.Also, Samara Weaving is the real gem of the first one, but the mysterious, dark and interesting character is utterly betrayed and destroyed in this garbage.Melanie's transformation to the demon is like out of nowhere and stupid. Maybe, they did it to add the low effort plot twist and making an excuse to add the new girl. The whole plot is like a cheap copy of the original with everything happening the same again minus the good things which make the first one great."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I liked The Babysitter (2017) but this sequel I even could not finish - it is not funny, it is not creepy, and all in all the humor (just those scenes in the school. feel like the copy of a copy of a copy and than some copy more...) felt very shallow, stale and forced - but maybe I am not the right audience for The Babysitter: Killer Queen, and all those kids born after 2k will like it more. Anyway, more and more Netflix is for me a synonym or label for mass-products and bad entertainment."}, {"id": 13, "text": "This was totally disappointing. Instead of taking the good sides of the first movie, you got all the absurdities and bad things. What a pity."}, {"id": 14, "text": "I will pretend that this was never made. Two stars only because I got to see the characters again."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Netflix's best film in my opinion has dropped an incredible sequel that might just be better than the original. It keeps all the things you love about the first &amp; goes even crazier in this one! The addition of Jenna to the cast was a great casting choice. Her chemistry with Judah was perfect. I am so happy they utilised Andrew Bachelor more in this one because his comedic timing &amp; delivery is incredible. Giving Cole's dad (Ken Marino) more scenes was a nice touch too, brilliant comedy with Chris Wylde. Hana Mae Lee didn't get as much as I would've liked but still was great in what she had. Bella Thorne is so funny in this role, I loved her news reporting back story &amp; freak out! The deaths were so over the top it was just exactly what you want from this film! &amp; most importantly, Samara Weaving returns with a cameo at the end that truly pushed this film from an 8 to a 9. It was great to see her again &amp; a well kept secret of her return."}, {"id": 16, "text": "The first movie I loved, this second carry on was absolutely abysmal. I actually turned off towards the end as I treasure my time more than seeing this train wreck finish."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Loved it, the deaths were even more bloodier and killer in this sequel which made the movie even more entertaining. Samara Weaving does return in the movie, which made me very happy to see. Overall, I was very pleased by this movie, Shout out to the director and the one who made the soundtrack, music was just awesome. Recommend to anybody who is a horror movie fan and a fan of the first babysitter film. 10/10."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Such a good film! I absolutely loved it as much as I loved the first one. It's so funny, the characters are hilarious and the gore in this is intense but I loved it. The ending was amazing and definitely made so much more sense to me. Amazing movie. Definitely made for a nice distraction in today's crazy world."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I was a big fan of the original, so I was quite pleased and also a little apprehensive when I saw this sequel drop on Netflix. Turns out there was no need to worry.Very much in the same vein as the first; this film is good, gory fun that never takes itself seriously.The characters all have memorable personalities that add to the film...although Robbie Amell nearly steals the entire show as the shirtless king of 'Bro'.Perfect for a night in with a takeout and brain set in neutral."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Wow I feel like I should be compensated for watching this it is almost too bad to imagine. Not scary, not funny, not exciting ... not worth anyone's time. If I was on a plane, I'd rather watch the map with the plane moving over it. The first movie was a real treat, this is a punishment."}, {"id": 21, "text": "The Babysitter: Killer Queen - B- (Fair but not Better)The first one worked because the stakes were higher, a young kid followed by adults and then he takes them out HomeAlone style. This one was just Meh, eventhough I really like Samara Weaving and Judah Lewis. All deads are back, just to die again with more gore is not thinking out of the box. Also no stakes here, zombie or vampire or whatever they were didn't work.I thought, I was watching an episode of The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Bit of a let down from original but will pass the time."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Put a bunch of fanfic ideas on post-its, and just start shooting. This would be about what you get. Nonsense. Also several members of the cast seemed to struggle with forming coherent sentences."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Ok so this was #4 trending movie in India on Netflix. The pace is good but is purely made pf adolescents as some scenes are meh! The slasher parts are really good, cinematography is awesome but the movie has no plot. Its one of those movies you can just binge watch! Just remember : Dont use your brain :D"}, {"id": 24, "text": "A Netflix movie is never anything to be excited about, but sometimes you can be pleasantly surprised. The Babysitter was one of those sneaky surprise hits. Admittedly not a great movie by a long shot, but entertaining. Now this was just trying to hard to be 'relevant' and millennial friendly. FAILED on so many levels. Way to much CGI blood and gore and no real substance at all. Seriously what were they thinking. McG really needs to grow up, he is not as in touch with his audience as he thinks if this is what he considers to be entertainment."}, {"id": 25, "text": "I've watched the first Babysitter film maybe four times since it's release. Just great. I had high hopes for this, but it was just as bad a horror film as I've ever seen. Ludicrous. The first film had some really funny moments and there wasn't a wasted scene in the entire film. This one took FOREVER to get moving, and once it did, I couldn't have cared less. Not clever, not funny, just gruesome and stupid."}, {"id": 26, "text": "This film start with the flashbacks of the previous film, and the character of previous film Cole having therapy session scene! As turnout, this film is about Bee has a deal with the devil by using Cole's blood to eliminate all the blood cult member to save a female Phoebe! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the quoting Terminator film scene, overuse of the tripping scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, overuse of the character flashbacks scene, and overuse of the slow motion scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Cole saving Allison by pull off her head! At the end, all the blood cult member including Bee been eliminated after drinking Cole's blood! Still have a post credit scene! The Book Of Devil found cover with sand! That's it! Another disappointed film!"}, {"id": 27, "text": "Was nothing compared to the first one but just like disney, netflix will push articles and reviews that tell basic people that they like it so it will trend for awhile and die off and nobody will ever talk about it again.

Don't look for an Oscar, just enjoy."}, {"id": 29, "text": "To be honest, I didn't liked The Babysitter very much as well, and this sequel goes far more miles ahead in dumbness.The Babysitter: Killer Queen feels like a fun movie but it isn't and it tries to make a stand like its predecessor, but it fails miserable. Try as it might, this second go will make you realize that some sequels are meant to suck.My Rating : 1.5/5"}, {"id": 30, "text": "Please do not watch it for your sake. Worst script and acting ever in Hollywood"}, {"id": 31, "text": "This movie is fun until the very end. I don't like the way they ended it. But anyway, this movie doesn't work on logic but it's a popcorn flick which doesn't take itself seriously and is self aware. It became a bit repetitive in the middel if you've watched the first part, but overall it's just a guilty pleasure to watch."}, {"id": 32, "text": "I kind of liked the first one. This one however is terrible. Super cheesy, lame jokes, awful writing, super predictable. I gave up after 15 mins which is 15 too long."}, {"id": 33, "text": "Just like its predecessor, The Babysitter: Killer Queen is a not so subtle and over the top horror/comedy. From absurd death scenes, an overabundance of fake blood and comical overacting, it has all the ingredients for a parody. The movie features all sorts of clich\u00e9s as well, including a group of horny teenagers and even a secluded cabin at the end, and at times it is done well.The plot is quite generic, with our leading man, Cole (Judah Lewis), again finding himself hunted by a teenage killer cult. Horror movie sequels often thread on familiar ground, but seldom is a follow-up so similar to its predecessor. Again Cole flees, hooks up with a down-to-earth girl, and manages to take his adversaries out in grisly / ridiculous ways. A few problems I had were mainly related to some of the plot developments. One of these was that Melanie (played by a not so convincingly sadistic Emily Alyn Lind) was suddenly the bad guy without any character development leading up to that. Besides that, we did see the return of the previous movie's bad guys (Bella Thorne, Robbie Amell, Hana Mae Lee and Andrew Bachelor). They all died gruesome deaths in the previous movie, and yet have somehow been allowed to return. The explanation for this was given in a throwaway line. Now, I won't lie and say that these characters aren't probably the most amusing parts of the movie. All four are ridiculously over the top, which can either be amusing or annoying depending on one's taste. A special nod to Amell, who kept his weird but funny bromance with Cole going and even applauded him at several points. One last problem was the return of the previous main baddy, Bee (Samara Weaving), who was instead suddenly turned into a literal guardian angel. Her plan, which is absolutely ridiculous, had some major holes in it which everyone just glosses over. Also, Cole seems to have totally forgotten by the end how Bee had spent the previous movie trying to literally blow his brains out.For me, the best part about the movie were the interactions between leads Cole and Phoebe (played by a delightfully charming Jenna Ortega). These two had legitimate chemistry, and gave the otherwise totally insane movie some more grounded moments.All in all, it's a solid sequel which I enjoyed more than the original. The plot is the main problem, due to it being generic and nonsensical at times. The actors did a solid job, with Lewis, Ortega and Amell being the standouts in my opinion. Horror comedies are rarely cinematic gold, and should just be watched to amuse oneself. Now, this movie is definitely amusing, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it good."}, {"id": 34, "text": "It's 2017's The Babysitter with the overall brainlessness amped up and Samara Weaving's presence reduced to a mere cameo at the end. Most of McG's films are like extended music videos; this one seems no different. There's a lot of eye-candy, a plot that can never make sense, cliched character sketches, some silly twists, and a few bucketfuls of gore. The humor is patchy; you'll get a laugh or two out of the blue but for more than 75% of the film, you'll be desperately looking for some. I didn't quite enjoy the 2017 film and hence, I only found this to be a passable sequel."}, {"id": 35, "text": "There are some familiar faces and some new ones, Cole once again battles members of a Devil cult.I was unsure of the first film, but on second watch I enjoyed it, no second viewing was needed for this one, I loved it on first watch.This is very funny, it's full of shocks and surprises, it's entertaining from start to finish.

It's not clever, funny, or surprising like the first. It was cheesy and predictable.I didn't mind the ending so much. But the fact bee was hardly in the movie and then shows up a brand new person bothered me. We get one line of explanation you changed me that night or whatever the line was. A cheap copout to subvert expectations, although they really didn't because you could see that coming a mile away.He didn't really change her though, did he? She gave up her soul in the first place just to save Pheobe. Maybe it could've been that he reminded her of who she really was? Okay I know, I'm knit picking now. A better backstory to what made her give up her evil ways would've been appreciated.A lot bothered me about this movie. And even more made me cringe. I watched it all because I hate leaving a movie unfinished, but I didn't enjoy it. I felt the need to fast forward through certain parts. I'd say the first was a 7, and this one's right around a 3 for me"}, {"id": 42, "text": "There are no words for how truly despicable this garbage is. It's all mediocre.

Even though the first was still a comedy the dark humour really worked I loved it. The 2nd they made it into a supernatural back from the dead that stupid you can barely watch.

What a steaming pile of..."}, {"id": 50, "text": "I mean, if you are watching this then you know what to expect with this film. It's a silly, slasher flick.Did I enjoy the first one? Meh, I found it alright. So the question is did I enjoy this one? Also it's a huge meh. The last one I was slightly taken back because I didn't expect it to be a silly kind of film, so watching this I knew (which helped) what to expect. To sum it up, I think it's a worthy sequel. It gave me a few giggles here and there, plot is ok and characters are likeable enough. To be honest there's nothing that the film excels in, it's just an easy brainless watch.What I will say is that you need to watch the first instalment, because you won't have a clue about what's going on in this one. But just don't expect a serious film, make sure you are watching this expecting a silly movie. And you will be fine. 6/10"}, {"id": 51, "text": "First off Amell is so funny. The script is better than I thought and for a horror film it was pretty good. But what made the movie great was the soundtrack."}, {"id": 52, "text": "Where the first one succeeded, the sequel failed. Babysitter 1 had paid genuine homage to pop culture and 80s movie nostalgia and fandom, and a intelligent script; Killer Queen leaned way too heavily on recycled jokes, references to 80s horror/movie references, cross-generational rivalry between zoomers and millenials, and using of the word bitch as often as your uncle steps outside for a smoke break at the family Christmas party. Judah Lewis stood out as a young actor with great potential in Babysitter 1, but in this one he seemed outperformed by both his awkward laugh over the delivery of his lines and busy cast list. Jenna Ortega's character seems injected for no reason other than to drive the sequal's plot, and cannot justify its existence, and not much more than a back door to connect Samara Weaving to the sequel. Pair this with her breathy speaking and melodramatic acting, and it becomes angsty and tired. Practical effects are used sparingly, but when they are they make the visuals look great...until the CGI ruins it. Overall, it's a true-to-the-first sequel, but does the first a disservice."}, {"id": 53, "text": "I liked the first one, it was comical in a way that it was bad but good if you understand..McG has done some very good movies in the past but this one, it's been rushed because the first one was so popular, so the script writing is poor this time around and doesn't have that grab effect to continue watching like the first one did..I would of given it at least 5 stars but the one thing that completely ruins it, is Bella Thorne, she is complete trash in this movie, her acting is borderline nauseating, how has she has got away with an acting career astonishes me, she tries so hard to be funny it's painful and embarrassing to watch because to put it bluntly, she can't act and she's not funny, not at all"}, {"id": 54, "text": "I have found this film really good constructed. The acting is good, and the direction is superb. For the common public, 9/10 rate is deserved, because the film represents very well the horror comedy genre (teenagers will like it), with a bit of slasher (there is also little suspence). Regarding the plot, the public will find a lot of surprises related to the first film, but also some teachings.

Some of the performances are awful (*cough* Bella Thorne *cough*), some of the special effects are seriously iMovie level, and the dialogue is some of the cheesiest I have heard in a while. Despite all of these flaws, I could not stop myself from loving this movie. Judah Lewis, Jenna Ortega, and Emily Alyn Lind are spectacular as Cole, Phoebe, and Melanie, respectively. Their performances take this whole movie to a whole new level. What I really loved about this movie is the romantic subplot. I honestly wish that we could get an entire movie about Judah Lewis and Jenna Ortega falling in love, because their relationship felt so genuine. The movie loves to be very real, and I loved how McG handled their relationship. The music is phenomenal, which is to be expected from this director. I thought that the ending was beautiful, and seeing B sacrifice herself for Cole and Phoebe was a uniquely satisfying ending. I didn't watch the first film, but I watched the Kill Count video which went in-depth about it. From what I can tell, this is an improvement on all fronts. I guess I just have to accept some times that a film with a lower quality in terms of production can get higher ratings on my list, as long as it has a lot of heart. The movie tries a lot, and it is very funny at times. It does a decent job with the horror-comedy genre, using an extremely dark tone, with tons of gore, while also being light and playful at the same time. I think that this tone went great with developing the relationship between Cole and Phoebe, because it mirrors, at times, a real high school relationship. A third movie was teased at the end of the credits, and if the next movie doesn't take itself too seriously, just like this film, then I will be extremely happy with the product.

Some of the jokes will be outdated in a few years which kind of seems like a bad thing but i kind of like that, due to that only a certain amount of people will understand it, I find that quite funny.

It loses the charm of the first film, the simplicity, which could have worked had the location been more interesting (why not the classic mall... haha).

It tells the story of Cole a couple years later being labeled as a crazy kid because police did not find evidence about the incident 2 years ago, the only person that talks to him normally is Melanie but she denies all the killings and kinda just wants to forget about them, when his parents decide to take him to a psychological highschool he takes up Melanie's offer of going away to the lake for a week with her and her friends only to find out that the cult that he killed back then are back for his blood. Now I don't think this sequal is as good as the original, but I don't think the film is bad in its own right, it does have a lot more comedy than horror tho, the kills are still gory, the references, funny humor and the elements that made the first movie great are still here. I didn't really like the Melanie twist, it was just so out of place for me that she suddenly is a part of the cult and it kinda threw me off, and the ending I still don't know if I like it, we get Bee back and she apparently set up everything so Phoebe can be safe, and everything looks good, now I think there might be a sequal, but I personally think that this a good enough place to wrap up this franchise, if they make a sequal it has to be really creative since they killed off the favorite characters from the previous movies, they might even go for satan is going after Cole, even tho that kinda feels too extreme, but hell this entire franchise is crazy. The pacing felt a little bit rushed to me, since the plot conveniences just progressed the story really fast, it felt like everything that needed to happen just happened, like I don't actually think grooming Cole to get cornered again is that easy, but hey they made it happen I guess. Pros: -Still funny, gory and a lot of great pop culture references -Returning characters made the movie great -We get to see what happens if the ritual is completed and that was kinda epic if only they had the blood of the innocent -Samara Weaving returns at the end as Bee -Very self aware -Its influence is in full swing -Very entertaining Cons: -Too much plot convenience -The ending and the Melanie twist are still meh for me -Pacing wasn't great -First part of the movie was lame as hell Overall Babysitter Killer Queen is a pretty decent sequal, I still think it relies way too much on plot convenience, since without it doesn't get going, but it does maintain the humor and the other elements that made the first one great, while being inferior to it unfortunately. This film was also really enjoyable and funny to watch, and I would recommend it to horror fans out there. Imma give Babysitter Killer Queen a 7/10 for its overall movie rating."}, {"id": 164, "text": "MAJOR SPOILERS (possibly, I might do this spoiler free but be warned anyway) AHEAD BECAUSE I NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!I rated the original Babysitter movie a 7/10 because I love the look and feel that director McG was going for. Stylized sequences, crazy gore and hilarious comedy. The Babysitter is one of Netflix's best movies and it's a highly enjoyable dark comedy that when I first watched it, the twist early on had my jaw on the floor. The kills were great, and the movie had a good overall message, and a unique execution to it.When I saw the trailer for this sequel I was immediately excited, but there was no news of Samara Weaving's return so I was worried it wouldn't be as good without her charismatic personality. Boy was I wrong. This movie is twice what the original was, in the best way!The Babysitter: Killer Queen was better than the first. With twice the gore and kills, twice the hilarious comedy, and about 3x more McG stylization.NEGATIVES: The bits with Cole and Melanie's dads were easily the most annoying. But even those after a while weren't so bad and were pretty enjoyable and kinda heartwarming. All the things I thought were going to be annoying here ended up making me laugh even harder than they did the first time, the movie is a little slow and awkward to start and I got worried it was just gonna repeat itself and feel like the same movie.POSITIVES: this movie doubles down on all the things that made the original so damn enjoyable for me. The kills were more creative and much more graphic and shocking, some of which leaving my jaw dropped. The practical gore in this movie is insane, and when there IS some CGI it's not horribly done.With the characters from the first film returning, we get even more cringy hilarious dialogue between them, but I just love how they all experience the same stuff as before. This movie is self aware in the perfect way, retrospectively. The new character played by Jenny Ortega was the best part in my opinion. A complex but really sweet new love interest for Cole. The bond the two had was a really good emotional backbone for the second half of the film, and it lead to a hilarious climax twist at the end. The whole cast absolutely kills it in this movie, I was laughing, cheering, and smiling wide for most of the movie's runtime.Those who only wanted Samara Weaving back won't be entirely disappointed, as she serves quite a huge part in this movie too, she's just in it less. But spending time with Andrew Bachelor and Bella Thorne is NOT a bad time. They may be a little annoying and obnoxious, but it's written in such a tongue in cheek way, it's so hard not to enjoy this movie's style.And speaking of style, McG directs the hell out of this movie. A great location, great camerawork, great pacing, and of course, a whole heap of on screen stylized sequences that are nothing but tons of fun to watch. This movie literally becomes a video game at one point, also the addition of short little skits on how they came to be part of Bee's cult are pretty hysterical and clever.This movie is way more clever than the more average and predictable predecessor. I literally had no idea what would come next, and it ended up surprising me repeatedly. I had an absolute blast with this movie, and while I feel a 3rd chapter is unnecessary, I am NOT opposed to McG continuing the great work he has going here.Also the soundtrack is killer as well.This is an honest 7.5-8/10 for me, I was really worried going into this movie but I was far from disappointed. I know not everyone will be on board with the changes here, but if you're like me and enjoyed the original for what it was and love when directors experiment, you'll love this movie!"}, {"id": 165, "text": "Yo yo, this movie was fricken bomb.

A great continuation of the first film that keeps the same style and tone of the original movie but has alot of great twists along the way that adds to the original and makes for a great sequel to this Franchise and honestly I enjoy it slightly more than the first.The characters in this are great and love the twists it adds to the people we see in the original. I really like the way they handle Cole in this movie and how people don't believe him about the events in the original. They also do a really interesting twist with Bee at the end of the movie and it's a fantastic way to add to that character and end her story.The kills are a great like the original and the gore is awesome like the original. I also really like what they add to the cult in this one it has a more supernatural feel to it in this movie and I like that a sequel should always add more to the original and this does that really well.My only negative with this movie would be again like the first sometimes the pop culture reference do go a little to far sometimes. For example there's a fight scene that's in the style of Street Fighter and its an odd scene in my opinion that dosent really work. There also isn't enough of Bee in the movie which is a little annoying but what they do with her is fantastic.I also really how they show the little backstories of how the people joined the group its a nice little detail we never saw in the first and adds alot to the people's characters and you understand them more because of it.It's a brilliant story that's got an awesome tone and is a great continuation of the first movie. Some great fantastic twists along the way and honestly I enjoy it slightly more than the original it's just a fun movie and honestly I can't wait to see more of the franchise.Verdict 8.5/10 a fantastic sequel to an already great movie. Got some fantastic twists with characters old and new and a fantastic twist with Bee that ends that character in a great way and shows more of her backstory. A great addition to this Franchise and I can't wait to see more. I enjoy this slightly more than the original."}, {"id": 178, "text": "I love this movie there's so many genres.

Honestly, that is time that I am really not going to get back again, namely because it ended up completely butchering the original film. Like, this film that ended up creating so many plot holes that it made me squirm with disgust. Then again, I probably shouldn't be all that surprised since one probably should expect that sequals have a habit of completely butchering an original, to the point that you basically want to pretend that it doesn't exist, but unfortunately it is just way too hard to unsee it.Like, what really got me was that they decided to make our protagonist's best friend as the big bad, which I just thought was really, really annoying, and certainly made no sense whatsoever. In fact, it just completely destroyed the film. Okay, I can sort of see why they decided to do it, and there are a couple of hints that this is the case, but honestly, it was basically a wasted effort.The other thing that was annoying was that they decided that there was no evidence that the events on the previous film happened. Yeah, come on, pull the other one. We have two missing cops, five missing teenagers, and a fireman that was stabbed while he was in the house, and all of a sudden people think that it was all the figment of his imagination. Yeah, that really didn't work, but I was sort of able to roll with that one, it was just when they decided to make Mel bad that it really put me off.Actually, Mel's Dad was a bit odd as well, though when I checked it out it is actually the same actor playing him, it is just that in the first film he came across as this suave ladies' man, and in this film he is suddenly a video-game playing pot head. Yeah, that really did confuse me, and once again it really didn't make any sense as all. Okay, I guess the whole let's make Mel evil sort of worked to open up some room for our protagonist to have another girlfriend, but yeah, in the end it was just annoying.Oh, and the ritual changed as well. In the first movie it was just a sacrifice, and you poured the blood on the book (and wasn't the book destroyed as well?), but now you need a sacrifice, and a virgin, and you drink the blood and get, well, I don't really know what you get, though since the kids from the first film were brought back, apparently it was just so that they could come back to life. Also, we get a bit of a back story on them as well, but once again, it seemed to just completely undermine everything we understood about the characters from the original film.Yeah, if you liked the first one, I'd pretty much recommending avoiding this one like the plague.

Unfortunately, this movie lost nearly all the charm that made the first one so good; was riddled with plot holes; and most of all, suffered from a severe lack of Samara Weaving.LACK OF CHARM The first film was filled with cute, gimmicky scenes (think video game style scenes). As a grown man in his late 20s, I would think it would be nearly impossible to be intrigued by a movie starring a little boy. But the charm made it happen. There was a slight sense of humor in many of the scenes and it kept the viewer interested.In this movie, however, nearly all charm was gone. Some scenes tried too hard to be charming, specifically the fight scene between the two love interests (boring). I also cringed at Phoebe's introduction scene as it felt overly forced. I can only imagine how awkward it was rehearsing that scene over and over. The entire movie was just too one-dimensional and didn't feel special like the first.PLOT HOLES First off, the entire premise of the movie is that nobody believes Cole that the events of the first movie happened, since Bee did such a stupendous job cleaning up everything. Was everyone there ignoring the fact that Bee just disappeared? Did that not raise any flags? What about the fact that four other teenagers were gone as well as two cops? I could go on about this but it was immediately apparent that the viewer just had to accept this major flaw in order to get the sequel, I guess.Secondly, Mel going evil made no sense. Literally zero. I understand that it was supposed to be a dramatic twist, but come on. She says that she joined the cult because she wants to be an influencer. Wow, how creative. We are soon after shown a scene where Bee is egging on Mel to want more and more followers, which suggests that Bee is the mastermind behind all of the cast's resurgences. Okay, that make sense. But later, it is revealed that Bee cleverly set all those people up in order to protect Cole and Phoebe. So, Bee turned Mel evil in order to save Cole and Phoebe from Mel? Makes no sense. The same applies for all the other evil characters. Bee was the instigator and also their undoing.SAMARA WEAVING Okay, here it is. Nearly all of the reasons that the first movie was great was based on Samara Weaving playing Bee. She was this cool, slick, sexy in-charge chick. She made the first movie what it was. But in this one, she didn't really make an appearance until the final fifteen minutes and even then it was only a shell of her former self. She seemed emotionless, timid, and downright uncomfortable. It was incredibly disappointing to see such wasted potential. Perhaps most curious was how Bee was Mel's babysitter. On the one hand, it was neat how there was some explanation toward how Bee became the evil person she was, but it also felt like a giant cop out of a storyline.There are several other things wrong with this movie that I didn't get to, but the disappointment is currently overtaking me from writing anymore. Overall, there are so many other directions a sequel could have taken based on the first's ending. This movie was a C+ at best and I'd caution fans of the first to take heed when watching this, and perhaps avoid it altogether in order to maintain the integrity of the first movie."}, {"id": 324, "text": "I enjoyed The Babysitter, however, The Babysitter: Killer Queen had very little in common with the first film. The issues come down to Brian Duffield not being retained as the screenwriter. The team of McG (also Director of both films), Dan Lagana, Jimmy Warden, and Brad Morris cobbled together a film full of unrelated film references and teenage sex jokes.The Babysitter wasn't a masterpiece when it came to dialogue, yet in comparison to its sequel, it looks Oscar worthy. The Babysitter: Killer Queen doesn't have anything clever, wastes money on needless graphics, and fails to deliver on narratives in the original.It's shocking the script used for the film wasn't a rough draft for a potential plot sequence. The Babysitter: Killer Queen took the worst possible narrative and turned it into a barely coherent sequel.If you are going to produce a sequel, at least keep it true to the source material.

For horror fans, who don't mind the content as long as it is entertaining, the film is a rather average sequel with the same flaws as the first film. Unfortunately for me, being entertaining, was simply not enough. This film is absolutely braindead, with the script having the intelligence level of a very violent 7 year old. There is nothing new about this film, nothing exciting, nothing memorable, and absolutely nothing special. It's just incredibly bland. The acting is as mediocre as the first film, and though the film does seem to finally give us a somewhat interesting character (Phobe), Jenna Ortega's performance just doesn't seem to fit the character on screen, and it ends up making her performance look a bit forced. However, there is very little about this film that isn't forced, whether it is its outlandish plot, plot twists, or incredibly lack of originality- the film doesn't feel like it should have been made, let alone attempted. In the end, The Babysitter: Killer Queen is an unneeded sequel on all fronts, and I would be completely fine with the franchise dying here before this franchise can somehow get even worse out of hand.

The first one was one of the most pleasant surprises in the comedy-horror sub genre of all time, in my opinion. It caught me totally off guard, was released with next-to-no fanfare, and when I first watched it, I knew I was seeing something special: a movie that sneaks up out of nowhere and knocks my horror-loving-socks-off. It was BRILLIANTLY scripted, cast, paced, and executed (no pun intended. Ok, slightly intended.)When I found out about a sequel? I was pretty much sold from the word go. BUT, that's not to say I don't have my qualms. I'll try to avoid outright spoilers, but here are a few nit-picky problems I had with the underlying premise for the sequel:So our tale begins with hapless Cole being viewed as a cuckoo bird because everybody believes the entire ordeal from the first movie was a delusion.Now, look: I know the movie isn't meant to be Citizen Kane, and suspension of disbelief is important when watching brain-candy movies like this (even though, as brain candy goes, both Babysitter films have WAY smarter dialogue and humor than they have any right to, but I digress,) my problem, from a plot standpoint, is a relatively glaring one:Why does no one find it strange that Cole's babysitter, on whom Cole correctly blamed the entire massacre, is nowhere to be found afterward? What about the nerd they sacrificed at the beginning of the ritual? What about the other cult members? What about the POLICE OFFICERS WHO GOT MURDERED? I literally just went back and checked: after they kill the cops, Bee makes Cole give the dispatchers the code for all clear. The dispatcher initially says what's the status of that 187 (homicide) call on Bigby Drive?I mean, c'mon. Those officers were *documented*, *dispatched* to Cole's house to investigate a murder, were then summarily executed, never to be seen nor heard from again. Cole later recounts the entire story to the authorities with Bee, the entire cult, two police officers, and a nerdy high school/college student ALL missing without a trace- but everybody is stone cold certain that Cole is nuts? His parents included? Even though they've MET Bee? Like dozens of times? Did they not think it was weird that she abandoned their son while she was supposed to be babysitting him? lolAnyway. End rant. That's just the one thing I had a hard time getting over. It was almost distracting how much of a plot hole it was. And for such an otherwise well-written movie, it seems like it wouldn't have been that hard to write this sequel more or less the same way, with a few minor adjustments, without having us believe Cole would be viewed as a loony-tune.REGARDLESS lol, I swear, I actually did love this movie. It's just plain fun, getting to see all these wonderful characters up to their old devil-worshiping shenanigans again. And they really doubled down on the gore. Which any true fans of the genre (Evil Dead, Cabin in the Woods, et al...) can appreciate. Did NOT see the twist coming, admittedly. But once it arrived, I was like alright. I can co-sign on this. It required a *LITTLE* bit of retconning, but it works. And I was happy with the ending.Yeah. Alright, I'm done. If you liked the first one, you'll probably have fun with this follow-up, too. If you DIDN'T like the first one? First of all, what's wrong with you? Second of all, you probably won't like this one either, in that case.Final thought: Max having his shirt off in the fast food flashback is brilliant lol."}, {"id": 331, "text": "Yes, Queen was killer.

The actual new humor was pretty good and the kid (Cole - played by Judah Lewis) still has some of his charm.What was mostly missing was the title character. This wasn't her movie; this was Cole's and his aftermath of that horrible night 2 years prior. So, gone was the chemistry and her absolute charm that made the original film so loveable.I'd say, stick with only watching the original.

Judah Lewis and Jenna Ortega in particular have enough chemistry and give the film a little heart when the movie takes a break from gore. There is one scene that stands out in particular with Cole and Phoebe taking a cruise on a boat at night. In this scene the cinematography, music, dialogue and performances are perfect and I wish there was more like it. The returning cast of killers all seem like they're having fun but most of them are there to be picked off in gory ways and the script does them no favors with some cringe-inducing jokes. Also most of the gore is CGI this time around so that was a little disappointing considering the original mostly avoided this.

In fact, I was eagerly awaiting it. It's a shame it doesn't offer the same guilty pleasures. There are a few shining lights among the disappointing film: Judah Lewis as the beleaguered lead does his best with a script that is pitifully weak. Robbie Amell brings energy to his character once again and Samara Weaving still lights up the screen in her cameo performance. While the cast has expanded to almost double - it isn't double the pleasure.It's still full of pop references as was the first, but they must have determined that the audience for the original had skewed much older than intended because the references are aimed at Baby Boomers not younger people. In one scene a boat named Jenny requires a code to start it. Immediately I knew it would be 867-5309 and I was correct. That's the thing about this film; there are no surprises. The script is predictable and you can anticipate the location of a joke AND even what the joke will be.Now to be clear the acting throughout is competent given the phoned in direction and script. But the quirky characters that appeared in the first film are relegated to the background as a set of new and completely uninteresting generic characters are given a bit of screen time. Their existence were completely unnecessary and I can think of a couple of ways to have written the same script without them.Shame. I really like the first film and the characters.

Such a shame, I expected something different but they brought back the same level of awkwardness and the same horror clich\u00e9s. It worked brilliantly the first time however the second-round felt flat. There are movies that don't need a sequel and when it gets a lot of attention they love to keep squeezing it also by doing so it damaged the original story.

The kind of music that is not good nor bad it just fits well with the atmosphere.I can't say much about the cast performances due to the poor script and there were so many annoying scenes but it wasn't their fault.

It was a great horror-comedy with a fun premise, great performances and crowd-pleasing thrills, and I'm delighted to say that its sequel follows in the same wake. Impressively building on the story established last time out, Killer Queen is a surprise hit throughout, with the same fun factor as its predecessor, but a story that arguably outdoes the first movie.On the whole, the first and second movies are largely similar, but the few differences that separate them do have an impact. On the one hand, it's fair to say that this sequel doesn't use its setting to a strong effect like the first movie, getting lost in a fairly soulless desert setting compared to the terrifying hellscape of Cole's house being destroyed over one night.What's more, the film is missing Samara Weaving's excellent performance, with Emily Alyn Lind brought into replace her, yet doing little to endear or entertain in quite the same devilishly exciting way.However, although Killer Queen misses out on some of the strengths of its predecessor, it also builds on the first film in some very surprising ways. For one, the film takes place in the context of Cole struggling at high school, and broadens its scope to include other characters as well as a cleverly-plotted metaphor about losing your virginity.The movie starts off like a fairly underwhelming high school comedy, but once we see its true nature come out in the second act, that first act starts to hit home differently, playing a part in what proves to be a hugely entertaining ride to the finish.Also, this is one of the few sequels that wants to tell a story with a little bit of fantasy mumbo-jumbo, yet doesn't expect you to take it entirely seriously. For instance, director McG knows that you don't remember all the specifics from the first movie, and so inserts brief reminders in impressively effective fashion that really help you to enjoy the story this time around.Meanwhile, the film's final act is a particular treat, as it brings together all the weird fantasy lore that these two movies have unexpectedly built up and puts a clever and surprisingly touching twist on it. It's not a work of genius, but it is a really satisfying ending to two thoroughly enjoyable movies, capping off the pair with a good sense of humour and imagination.Overall, I really liked The Babysitter: Killer Queen. Once again, it's a fun horror-comedy with entertaining action throughout and a good sense of humour. It's not meant to be taken seriously, but it also manages to engage you in its story, lore and metaphors in a way that shows it's much more than just a throwaway Netflix movie."}, {"id": 336, "text": "Right, well I didn't even know that they were making a sequel to the 2017 movie The Babysitter.

Which is why The Babysitter was a surprising, refreshing edition to the horror / comedy genre, and the sequel is kind of a let down. It has some funny moments, and McG's signature, flashy, music video style, but ultimately the plot is paper thin and all over the place, and essentially, a redo of the first movie. It's the same plot, most of the same characters, saying a lot of the same things, so, not particularly original. And the ending is cheesy and contrived. Basically, one person could write a better script in the original Babysitter, than 4 could write together in the sequel. Probably why Love &amp; Monsters looks great, and Underwater was one of the most fun films of last year.If I was 12, maybe this would go down for me as a cult classic, but, I'm not, so, it's just kind of meh. Judah Lewis is still very likable, and the new girl, his love interest is also likable. Not as good an actress as he is, but passable, and probably early in her career. That's another thing, Samara Weaving is a good part of the first film, and she has an endearing quality, like Lewis, so, you're pulled along for the ride. Essentially, you've got Judah and a bunch of side characters to carry the film, which makes it more like occasional fun vignettes, instead of an emotional ride. It's more like Dexter Morgan, sterile, fake emotion, so, audience is left not really caring whether Judah makes it out of this film alive. But I do need to mention that John and Juan get more screen time in the sequel, and they're pretty funny.I did appreciate their Waxworks ambition, of a low budget that they make work. Like, the compositing matte scenes are pretty good for low budget. They would be garbage if this was Lord of the Rings or a big budget film, but probably most viewers wouldn't notice where scenery ends and a matte begins. The music is good...I think Bear McCreary, which did sound straight out of Halt and Catch Fire, but, hey, Paul Hasslinger doesn't get his due for a great show, so, I'm not mad at McCreary for ripping him a bit.Overall, kinda fun, just don't set your bar as high as original, and maybe don't see them close together."}, {"id": 339, "text": "I was not expecting to like this movie AT ALL but I have to say they really hit the mark with this one.

He says he's a junior but was 12 in the first film and it's been two years since that?) the infectious energy of this flick reels you in and the violence and plot become so outrageously cartoonish that you can't help but turn the brain off and lean into the fun. This flick is like a live action road runner cartoon at points and that is not a knock against the movie whatsoever.The returning cast is as good as they were the first go-round, and McG's flair for over-the-top style for styles sake keeps the film chugging along at a steady pace.At the end of the day, if you liked the first, you'll probably dig this follow up. Bonus points for a killer soundtrack!"}, {"id": 340, "text": "You probably won't watch 'Killer queen' unless you've already seen its predecessor, so you know what to expect.Indeed, the formula hasn't changed: It still tries to sell viewers on its blend of campy-Satanic cult-slasher-coming off age-teen comedy tropes, and it still doesn't work. The production remains noticeably slick, too much so for its own good, and it wouldn't be a 'Babysitter' movie without obnoxious inserts a la 'Scott Pilgrim' and pop culture references that substantially weigh down what it could otherwise be.Despite all those flaws, 'The Babysitter: Killer queen' actually is a better movie. Even apart from the narrative growth beyond the first film, there are enough differences here to make it distinct, in a good way.There's more of an actual plot--and character development!--with real exposition for all the characters. The latter is mostly seen in flashbacks, especially for the antagonists, but that bit of background is welcome even if it disrupts the flow a bit. While the cast returns from the first movie, the new cast members do even more to carry the picture; again, characters seem fleshed out much more than before. I think I'd rather enjoy seeing these actors in other things.One small paragraph to describe the positives may not seem like much, but it really does count for a lot. There was a demonstrable effort to make this more of a solid movie, and it pays off. 'Killer queen' gets 2 more stars from my rating than its predecessor because of the improvements it has made.Unfortunately, the growth from one film to the next doesn't mean the flaws have vanished.That blend of tropes and genres is much the same here, with the difference of the teen comedy angle being played up considerably. Imagine listening to a mix of your favorite record where very specific notes in each song were emphasized so much that they overwhelm the rest of the music. Teen comedies are lame, with very juvenile humor, and that aspect has also been elevated in 'Killer queen' compared to 'The babysitter.'The flashes on screen of graphics and other overlaid effects is turned down a lot by comparison. Yet when 'Killer queen' does go for that unfortunate choice of flair, it's even more prevalent on screen. It's the difference between only part of a shot being filled with post-production visuals, and entire scenes being devoted to the same disruptions. It's embarrassingly bad.I want to like 'The babysitter: Killer queen' more than I do, but like the first movie, it's not as clever as it thinks it is. If the film-makers did away with the stylistic choices of those graphics and visuals, and focused on just telling a story, this would be so much better.I gather there's a possibility of a third film. While I don't think it's especially likely, despite myself I'd probably watch it--I've already committed to two 'Babysitter' movies, after all.

I loved her so incredibly much in the first film, and her arc in this sequel is so incredibly satisfying.I don't want to spoil anything, but the movie does have a theme going on and I think the theme matches the film perfectly.If you watched the first movie, and loved Bee and Cole as much as I do, I don't care what anyone else is telling you. This movie is a must!"}, {"id": 342, "text": "While this film is inferior to the first, it does have its moments of fun. Much like the first film, one of the things that this movie does really well is comedy. There are some really funny jokes and scenes. However, the new bad guys that are introduced in this film do take away from the humor by being terribly unfunny. Luckily they are killed off fairly quick, so they don't end up being too much of a problem. Another thing that is pretty good, much like the first film, is the CGI and practical effects. Much of the gore and bloodshed in the movie is done through practical effects, and looks realistic for the most part. There is one scene however, where a character has their head ripped off, and it looks painfully fake, and sort of ruins what would have otherwise been a pretty good scene. There are a few glaring flaws with the film too, one of which is the overall plot and its execution. It basically recycles the exact same plot from the first film, and the only real difference is that there are more bad guys this time around. It really shows a lack of creativity, and it can also be really sloppy at times. The film is also directed by McG, who is notoriously known for taking interesting concepts and ideas, and making subpar films out of them."}, {"id": 343, "text": "What a wack movie. If I'm supposed to rate this based on the quality and film work, it is not good. But for a good time, maybe with a few drinks, having a good laugh with friends, yeah it wasn't bad. I watched the first one way back when, and that one wasn't bad at all, I actually liked it. This sequel was very wack, the plot was really vague and horrible, serious points would come out of nowhere and it was just all over the place. They basically just assumed you'd understand everything... which I didn't. If you didn't watch the first one you will know nothing throughout this movie. Good comedy though throughout, as long as you're like 18, you might get a few laughs. The acting surprising wasn't terrible, I've seen worse, but the good acting only came from like a few characters. Don't know if I'd watch again though, I'd watch the first one again, this one... not so much. However, some funny scenes mixed in with funny actors made this one not too bad as long as you are not sober. Try to ditch the fact that the plot is vague and that people are dying left and right for no reason. Just enjoy, try to have a few laughs, and have a good time."}, {"id": 344, "text": "The Babysitter: Killer Queen was a very pleasant surprise in that it might be better than the first one. Two years have passed from the events of the first film and Cole is now an outcast who no one believes about the events of that night. Cole takes up an invitation from his friend Melanie for a weekend party at the lake but once there he finds himself revisiting the nightmare from which he thought he'd escaped.The first The Babysitter was a flawed but entertaining comedy slasher that I thought was enjoyable for the most part, but never thought it balanced its horror elements and comedic elements as well as it could've. With Killer Queen any pretense at horror is pretty much abandoned from the outset and this time around the movie the movie is a dark comedy that while it does contain the gore and violence of the original never makes any attempt to be scary. That said, the humor is still very much on point and has actually been refined since the previous outing flowing more smoothly and creating a better sense of comic rhythm with proper setups and payoffs some of which had me laughing to the point of tears in my eyes.While the comedy is very well done, the heart that was in place in the first one is still very much a part of the movie as we see Cole trying to cope with the fact that no one believes his story. This time around Cole(Judah Lewis) is joined by Phoebe(Jane the Virgin's Jenna Ortega) who also runs afoul of Cole's satanic cultists and makes a nice pairing with enjoyable banter and character moments that make them a pleasure to be around. Both Lewis and Ortega are still just amazing actors and they show amazing chemistry in their scenes together.The Babysitter: Killer Queen may not be a strictly necessary sequel, but it is a lot of fun that doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie does hint at the possibility of another installment(though given the ending I'm not sure how it would look like) and while that one will be just as unnecessary as long as it's on par with this one make as many of these as they did Elm Street movies."}, {"id": 345, "text": "There is just so much in this film I can't get into it all in this review. The babysitter: killer queen one of the most dense, poyant and beautifully crafted films I have ever seen. I will be extremely disappointed if this doesn't at least get nominated for best picture at the oscars this year. Oh... Bella Thorne is in this, never mind then it sucks.When I say there is just so much in this film I can't get into it, I'm referring to the sheer amount of absolute bs. Everything makes zero sense and everything is very lazy. This movie is undeniably a cash grab. It has been realised at the perfect time though, the only way people will ever watch this is if they're stuck at home in quarantine.I'm my review of the first babysitter I wrote earlier today I mentioned how they somehow rubies queen. In the sequel they ruin them even more. Why did they need to put killer queen.Anyway here's some filmmaking and story complaints and stuff. How did Cole get away with driving Jaun's car into his house if nobody believes him about the blood cult stuff. No jail time, not even a fine, no nothing. Every single actor was awful and none of them had any chemistry. I'm an anxious, self-conscious person and I could have done a better job than everyone in this truly disgusting movie. The writing is awful, nothing makes sense, the romance is forced and most of all it's not funny in the slightest. I don't have a main issue or anything because everything is just bad, there is nothing to appreciate, even the gore was bad and that was the only saving grace of the first babysitter.Never ever watch this movie, it made me wanna slit my wrists but it also gave me hope that I could make a successful movie in about 20 minutes so that's good I guess."}, {"id": 346, "text": "Killer Queen is the sort of sequel that exists to just have fun with the formula established by the original. Unfortunately, while the cast are eager to get crazy once more, the writing and direction let them down. Also, rather unfortunately, Netflix's trailer clearly gives away the twists that are to come.Cole is now an awkward teen and not a single person believes his story of that night with Bee. Not even Melanie, his first kiss and now sexpot best friend will admit to the things she saw that night. Facing a stint in a mental asylum by his worried parents (Ken Marino and Leslie Bibb, hilariously returning), Cole runs off with Melanie and her friends to a lake side party. Sadly, someone has brought back the dead and signed their name in the book of the Devil, and now Cole must fight to save himself and his friends before the sun rises.The older kids all return to reprise their roles. Each clearly having fun before being bloodily killed. There's also absolutely no denying the star power of Samara Weaving; her blue eyes, blonde hair and gaunt features in the starlight both menacing and to die for. The young cast (especially newcomers Jenna Ortega and Juliocesar Chavez) do a good job balancing horror and slapstick comedy and have the same manic energy as the originals.Sadly, the movie just can not justify itself beyond brutally murdering teens. That's all fun for a minute but when characters have the teleporting skills of Walking Dead's zombies and hearing as bad as Helen Keller, it kills the tension - each dead teen just being lined up like a lemming to be killed again. Fun montages of the original five meeting Bee for the first time pump some energy into the proceedings but it doesn't save the messy script or direction. Cole is really the weaklink. He's just not interesting enough in his trauma, and the direction offered confuses his character with being either a cold blooded killer or hapless cuckold depending on how close the villains need to get to killing him.Not a bad shout for a party horror and fun if you've nothing else to do on a Friday night,but overall falls short on a lot of fronts."}, {"id": 347, "text": "The Babysitter was a fun teen-oriented horror film that actually made me feel vindicated for having defended McG in the past (I'm not ashamed to say that I like Charlie's Angels). Killer Queen makes me feel sorry that I ever said good things about the man.Set two years after the first film, this sorry-ass sequel sees Judah Lewis returning as Cole, who is now in high school, considered a weirdo for his outlandish tales of killer babysitters and blood cults (and for the fact that he wears a brown, three-piece corduroy suit with pin badges on the lapel). History repeats itself when his best friend Melanie (Emily Alyn Lind) also turns out to be evil, having made a pact from beyond the grave with the deceased psychos from the first film to complete their Satanic ritual using Cole's blood.If McG's music video style has rankled in the past, this film is guaranteed to annoy, the director going into overdrive with trendy stylisms that make Edgar Wright look positively reserved. As if the puerile script wasn't bad enough (lame humour and numerous pop culture references), the use of computer graphics, grainy VHS style flashbacks, and various other random nonsense is atrocious. A sex scene plays out through the use of obvious visual metaphors; a fight scene is done in the style of a beat-'em-up computer game; there's a pointless dance routine. None of this makes any sense within the context of the film; it's just there for the sake of it.To be honest, the only good thing about this whole dreadful mess is the excessive gore, which is cartoonish but fun.To add a final insult to injury, Samara Weaving (a BA_Harrison pet peeve) returns at the very end as babysitter Bee, who turns out to be good, saving Cole and his love interest Phoebe (Jenna Ortega) from the bad guys. At least she doesn't get to do one of her horrible warbling screams: I guess we should be thankful for small mercies."}, {"id": 348, "text": "Again, the same issues I have with the first film are the same issues I have with this one:Bella Thorne's horrendous, wooden and joke of an actingThe constant harmful dark comedy. This one was ableist as hell among some other jokes and it really took away some from the film.Excluding those, this film is just as funny, campy and feel good as the first one. The Babysitter films aren't afraid to make a mockery of themselves and mock horror tropes that are consistently seen and it's a good time. I really enjoyed a lot of this and, just like the first, this could have easily been a 5/5 for it's carefree nature and watching with friends for a good time. I just wish McG could quit with the harmful jokes; we've learned more than enough this - and previous - year(s) that these can be used harmfully and it just cuts a chunk of fun out of the film"}, {"id": 349, "text": "I'm not really a fan of this kind of film but the first one was alright and I was bored, so I took a look.As per usual these days male figures are either inadequate, irresponsible or stupid. Female characters strong and empowered or mysterious and empowered.You get the idea. The pink background on the poster should have been enough to warn me off but well, silly me.On the upside acting is reasonable, setting and cinematography fine, basic slasher story is alright.In short, if you can look past the woke horse manure, its almost passable. Personally I found it a little insulting and irritating but hey, I'm just a man, what do I know.4/10."}, {"id": 350, "text": "I am absolutely shocked to see the reviews of this film. I can only believe that people watched an entirely different movie, or took the first movie as anything more than a campy comedy satire.You can tell the script writers are absolute lovers of the Evil Dead series. In many ways, Babysitter: Killer Queen is the Evil Dead 2 of the franchise. Those that liked the horror aspect of the Evil Dead series more will always prefer the original and find the second to be a near identical comedy which is far inferior in every way. If you loved Evil Dead 2 more than you loved Evil Dead, it is my guess that you will actually like The Babysitter: Killer Queen better than the original.If you are a fan of Evil Dead 2, go into it knowing that it has shed its horror elements completely to go full on camp.I felt the exact same way about The Babysitter: Killer Queen as I did the Babysitter, for its first 20 minutes. I thought: This movie is going to suck. However, neither of those things are detriments to the movie. It makes the kick start of the film that much more random and absolutely hilarious. I got a pretty good chuckle when The Babysitter kicked off with its first death. This film outdoes that by 100,000. The single first death scene alone is worth watching this film. It is by all accounts the Ash bobbing with the lamp and laughing with the deer head scene from Evil Dead 2. And the laughs just keep on coming.It is almost essential to watch the first movie and then watch this, within a short time frame. If you barely remember the first movie, many of the jokes will fly over your head. It is an absolute laugh fest of the lowest brow.I rarely make reviews for films, usually when I feel the people have gotten it completely wrong. I have seen plenty of half baked praise attempts. There are lots of critiques written by individuals who do not understand the camp genre. This movie will be hated and then loved. This is a Cult Classic in the making. I will only say this: Give the film a chance, and watch both movies back to back.Forgive what feels like plot holes, too. Because, I dont think they actually are plot holes at all. This is the part where I will get into the sad truth of the world. Many do not believe that nobody would believe what happened to him happened to him. However, during the Satanic Panic in Europe, there were instances where there was so much evidence of something occurring, and yet people still did not believe it occurred. When people refer to satanic occultic stuff, it is absolutely dismissed, regardless of evidence. Not to mention, in this world, Satan is real, and if Satan is real, he controls the realm, thus cops werent found dead and stuff makes sense within the context. It is absolutely setting up for its Army of Darkness finale, and I absolutely hope that comes to fruition.A single point off for the cringeworthy cutaways. They are all but 10 seconds and there might be four of them, but when i own the film im definitely gonna personally cut those out for home views. Great film, perfect shlock camp, absolutely hilarious, 9/10"}, {"id": 351, "text": "This is a fun movie that is full of small LOL moments and gore aplenty. I stopped trying to make sense of the plot after 15 minutes, and to the film's credit, it didn't try to be something its not. The dialogue between the characters is the best part of this movie. I did also enjoy the female protagonist (starred in 2nd season of You) and the Dad (the always great Ken Marino). Besides that, there is not much else worth mentioning.The first movie was better for sure, and I thought it was funny that one of the characters mentioned that of all movies, there are only four sequels that are better than their original (this isn't one of them!).If you just want to experience a few laughs and light scares, then this is the movie for you.[5/10]"}, {"id": 352, "text": "It's been years since I saw the first film, but when I heard they were making a sequel, I knew I wanted to watch it. I even defended the trailer, saying it might not be that bad. I was wrong.Cons: The dialogue itself is awkward, mostly unnecessary, and simply unfunny. There was a scene or two with Robbie Amell's character that I can think of that were mildly funny for me.For some reason, the kills were almost all similar in nature (you'll get what I mean once you watch the movie). They were cool, but felt uninspired as well.The editing in a particular scene didn't make sense to me, and took away from the progression of the story. There was a voiceover of a previous scene taking place during an action sequence. That was, in my opinion, a big low point in the movie.Once Samara Weaving made a brief appearance, I had already mostly lost interest. I agree with other reviewers that said her character had basically become a hull of what she was, and that her role in the story really didn't make sense. Once she's there, it didn't really matter that much anyways to me.I didn't care for so many pop culture references. It took away from the humor for me.Pros: The acting wasn't bad. There was nothing exceptional about it, but it wasn't awful either.I think my favorite part about the film was the location. That's really the biggest redeeming quality for me.I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.Maybe I expected too much, but I ended up being disappointed in the end."}, {"id": 353, "text": "The Babysitter: Killer Queen: Two years after his clash with the Satanic Cult, Cole (Judah Lewis) is in High School.

I loved it for the ending, the interaction between the characters like Cole and the old minions of B which were always funny moments, I had to keep rewinding and watching parts over because they were so beautifully acted. I also liked that Cole's main storyline was a lot like Harry Potter from the OOTP -that no one believed him- and I enjoyed the twists that happened throughout the story.I will say I think the new minions were unnecessary overall, but then again they needed to be there to bring the old ones back at first and there wasn't much of them in the movie to take away from it, so it wasn't anything bad. Also the part where the old minions and new ones are arguing was funny so it was worth it.Phoebe was a great addition and really love-able.Cole and the original minions had really great chemistry. They played really well off each other. Their interactions felt really genuine. Amazing acting from all of them.I would definitely recommend. 10/10"}, {"id": 355, "text": "I only recently watched the first film, The Babysitter, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. There wasn't any spectacular filmmaking on show, but I thought it was thoroughly entertaining for what it was going for and I gave it a fairly high score.With that in mind, I was looking forward to the sequel, but it managed to set all a lot of records for me. It's the worst sequel ever made, it has one of the worst scripts ever written, and it's the second lowest score I have ever given out to a film. I hated The Babysitter: Killer Queen with a passion.I was never bored because of how laughably bad the film was, so I'm giving it some points for that and I did like the idea of someone living with a past trauma that no one believes. This brings a sense of isolation, but they didn't explore this element anywhere near enough as they should have.The film started and it immediately establishes that it takes place two years after the original film, but the characters were talking as if it only happened a couple of weeks ago and that made it feel off from the very beginning.It wasn't long until I saw how completely appalling the script for the film was. I had some issues with the screenplay in the first film, but they were nowhere near as bad as in The Babysitter: Killer Queen. The dialogue is completely terrible in every sense of the word, and the acting across the board was almost as bad.The narrative itself doesn't make any sense, with a twist part way through that came completely out of left field and I hated what they did. 'Hate' is a very strong word and I very rarely use it whilst describing a film, but I'm going to use it a lot here. I hated this film.Everything that goes in to making a film was very poor, including the cinematography, the editing, the effects, and especially the acting and the screenplay which I have already mentioned. I don't really like any films that McG has made, which is why I was amazed that the first film worked so well for me.If you can't tell, stay away from this film. I'm only giving it some points for one story element that I liked and the fact that I wasn't bored because I was laughing at it too much. Apart from that, it's abysmal. Oh, but there was a small appearance from someone at the end that made it a little better, even though it wasn't hard to see that she didn't want to be there.They left the film open for a sequel, and all I can say is that it can't be any worse than this steaming pile of manure.SCORE: 20%"}], "reviews_amount": 356}
