To me, it seems so obvious what needs to be done in terms of our agricultural methods. I get that people want to stick to their tried and true ways but if helping the planet means a healthier humanity, wouldn't you adjust and evolve your methods for that reason alone? The good news is that I believe that a new generation of farmers are coming up and are more interested in these planet/humanity saving methods than the good ole money making, government subsidized methods. Hope is still alive!"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Being surrounded with bad news for so long, and especially with what's been going on in 2020, it would be easy to give up, or, at least feel relatively powerless. This movie shows how powerful we can each actually be, literally, in our own backyard. Well paced with really interesting stories and fascinating NASA satellite imagery showing co2 emissions from space and how they are directly related to how much tillage is going on in the planet. So mind expanding! I'm so happy that a movie like this was made available on Netflix. Highly recommend!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "Exploring the damage caused to the earth through farming with a conservation agronomist et al and how a regenerative approach can reverse the catastrophic climate crisis that casts such a bleak shadow over our planet. Unsurprisingly the message, as is so often the case in all walks of life: let things do what they're good at and the problem can be resolved. In this case, let nature heal the damage, torture and torment our misguided agricultural practices have cursed the planets surface with, live in tune and synchronicity with nature, stop poisoning the lifeforms that maintain and perpetuate life. Probably preaching to the converted but there's no harm reemphasising the message in the hope that a few more pennies drop and habits evolve and ultimately change. That's if it's not too late already."}, {"id": 3, "text": "When I consider a film, one of my criteria is relevance. Reversing climate change has to be at the top of that list. Helping farmers, creating more nutritious food, and reversing chronic lifestyle diseases...also pretty damned relevant.But the story also has to be told well. Does it have flow, is it beautiful? Check!You will enjoy watching this, you will learn while you enjoy, and you will be motivated. All very difficult tasks, but this film was highly successful at accomplishing all of them."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This movie was so inspirational and inspiring! Great job!

I just might move to California so I can work for this incredible cause!"}, {"id": 7, "text": "I can't remember the last time I saw a film so absolutely breathtaking. The cinematography of Kiss the Ground does an amazing job at capturing the nature of our planet and showing the growth towards restoration. The images this documentary provides are incredibly powerful; even the very last scenes gave me goosebumps. Josh and Rebecca Tickell do a fantastic job at implementing a powerful message and showing that change is possible. I felt incredibly hopeful that we can come together to reverse climate change. After viewing the vivid imagery, data, and graphics in this film, it just motivates me even more to be a part of the movement. Something this beautiful deserves to be watched and appreciated."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This is a must see. It provides an attainable solution that everyone can take part in to help our planet. It is filled with gems of information and a passionate team behind the research. If not now, then when?"}, {"id": 9, "text": "As a livestock rancher, I am leery of documentaries with vegan spokespersons. But this one covers all the bases and gives livestock it's critical role in healing the environment. Excellent job in explaining the science and role of farming in making things right. Would have been nice to have given direction in how the average person can encourage change in farming."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Oh thank god! It's tough to see the state of our world broken down so clearly that there is no denying what is happening to our planet -- but this film shows us where we are and then, through great dialogue, beautiful footage and entertaining characters, walks us out of the depths of fear and into the freedom of YES WE CAN! Thank god this movie was made!"}, {"id": 11, "text": "Finally a movie that gives a solution, a real, unbiased and scientific solution to climate change! I'm so happy this has finally come out. It's explained perfectly so everyone can understand and realize exactly what is going on and what needs to be done in an entertaining and easy to watch way."}, {"id": 12, "text": "A nicely made documentary. First half is great, as it explains the importance of healthy soil. Stuff we all should know about, whether we own the land, a small green patch in the backyard, or we dwell in concrete jungles. But as the movie progresses, it starts to go in a direction I was feared it's going to go - animal farming. We hear phrases grass-fed, free-range, humane killing and other nonsense. It clearly shows the filmmakers don't know the reality of animal agriculture, if they allow those words to be captured. Did they really do their homework in environmentalism? I doesn't seem like it. Numerous studies show that animal agriculture is the most detrimental and destructive to the planet and its inhabitants. It's a shame it came out this way, because there was a chance to sell a positive message."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Kiss the Ground poignantly delivers on its mission to provide a positive and hopeful outlook on the future of our environment, while also keeping me engaged. This inspiring documentary conveys a compassionate drive behind saving the Earth while also breaking down the science behind the solution based approach to the issue at hand.The changes in perspective between Woody Harrelson's wonderful narration, environmental science experts, and other celebrity activists work in harmony to create a potent message that is accessible and informative for all audiences. The vibrant footage of Earth's landscapes effectively displays a stark contrast between environments that have implemented regenerative agriculture and those that have not, which beautifully illustrates the importance of the film's message. Overall, this film is perfectly balanced between an informative and entertaining tone that left me feeling inspired and hopeful for the future of our planet."}, {"id": 14, "text": "I have been learning about and advocating regenerative agriculture and permaculture for years, and seeing how beautifully presented and powerful the message in this movie is brought me to tears. This single film could be the catalyst for massive change, awakening the public to the deep-rooted problems in our agricultural system and demanding change. For the health of bodies, our minds, and our planet."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Where do i start ? Firsty amazing how much of an eye opener it is, the solution is simple yet so amazing and powerful !!

This film effortlessly highlights how biosequestration can help with climate change in such a way that absolutely every person on earth can understand. A great and important watch!"}, {"id": 21, "text": "Kiss the Ground truly redefines what it means to release a film surrounding climate change. While most documentaries like this leave its viewers weary and confused about mother earth, this film does the exact opposite. By the closing credits, I was smiling with inspiration about our world's future and the transition to regenerative agriculture. The film presents a feasible solution to overturn climate change by having CO2 emissions going back down into living plants. Through this process, we can regenerate our soil. Directors Rebecca and Josh Tickell's seven years of hard work on this cinematic piece is undeniable, and their unique approach to providing viewers with hope rather than distress made their message that much stronger. Through the beautiful and vibrant imagery and Woody Harrelson's warmth and authentic narration, I was instantaneously immersed in the film's purpose and now wholeheartedly support the Kiss the Ground movement!"}, {"id": 22, "text": "Kiss the Ground takes the viewer on a remarkable journey of environmental positivity and its explanation of why it's essential for humanity to take up the reigns of saving our planet. Long-time activist duo Josh and Rebecca Tickell use this detailed documentary to create a positive discussion around the effects of climate change by recruiting a global team of culturally significant farmers and well-known activists. The varied discission that comes from such team provides plenty of sustainable solutions that can be attainable to any type of person from around the world. Such solutions are amplified by the use of colorful imagery, like the depiction of regeneration through wide shots of greenery and intricate graphics showing the science behind the process. Kiss the Ground motivates me through the reminder that climate change is a global problem we can all come together to help solve it by practicing our individual efforts through a team connected through our humanity."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Movies are important to me because of their unique ability to act as a reflection of the human experience. Kiss the Ground is a moving documentary that helped me understand how important it is to find beauty in our differences and find strength in our similarities. As the film unfolds, there are appearances from people of various backgrounds: celebrities, scientists, farmers, and people who just want to help. I found myself able to connect with each of these perspectives on different levels, and was left feeling inspired because of how important it is we come together and create change. Overall, Kiss the Ground is a powerful movie that has created a space in my heart for compassion, and challenged me to find my role in protecting the planet we all call home."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Beautifully done. Its a film for each and every one of us. The problems of today pertain to and will effect everybody on this planet. I honestly had yet to watch a film on such a widely covered subject that was actually able to give solutions that ANYONE can do to help combat such a massive and deadly threat. The planet has seemed as of it was basically past the point of no return, and films on the subject seldom succeed in painting a full picture of it's true scale. Even more rare, this film could convince the worst skeptics and has the information to motivate all who watch. I'd recommend this be shown in classrooms of all ages. I think if more people saw this, it could actually change the way most people view the importance of our planets health. This begins a progressive conversation to take action, and do it now. And that we all have the ability to make it happen, no matter what challenges one may face. Its not just big organizations that have the power anymore, its me and its you. now go watch!"}, {"id": 25, "text": "Fantastic film. I think it's one of the most important films of my lifetime. I love how it used simple language to explain how regenerative agriculture works and its contribution (necessity, really) in reversing the problems that have led to climate change. It's reenergized me to Get involved in local efforts and I hope it can help bring about the needed mind shift in how we utilize waste, land, and animals."}, {"id": 26, "text": "This movie is life changing. This is a must to watch for everyone. The things you see in this movie should be taught at kindergarten and schools as much as every other lesson and even more.

This documentary is able to achieve this sense of hope by providing a feasible solution to one of gravest issues our planet faces, climate change. This solution is through our soil. Although it may seem simple, it is entirely effective, as the filmmakers show through before and after footage of the Loess Plateau in China. Once, this plateau was once completely barren; however, through regenerative growing methods that allow soil to grow and become healthy, the Plateau is now a thriving, green, and beautiful environment. This message of hope inspired me, as I believe that this solution can have a positive impact for our planet."}, {"id": 30, "text": "This is one of the most important films everyone should watch!

Excellent platform to use as well!"}, {"id": 36, "text": "I am aware of many of the issues addressed in the film but I was not aware of many of the solutions. Everything was explained so well &amp; in detail in a way that is simple to understand while impossible to argue with or find fault in. I know everyone involved is passionate about making a change, that shines through in every interview and presentation. I started out feeling anxious &amp; a little helpless to all of the conditions we are facing as they were explained but as I watched I became more and more hopeful while also being inspired to find more ways to help. Some simple changes can be implemented in my life right away and others will just take some effort, but I do know they must be done. I think this should be shown in schools too, to all ages. Very important they we really start to get it, because it will not get better on its own. The time to begin action is now, it's clear we cannot wait any longer."}, {"id": 37, "text": "The solution seems that it would be so obvious.

WE CAN SIT STILL AND NOT ACT NO LONGER!!!"}, {"id": 40, "text": "It misses a narrative coherence probably because it wants to speak to everyone but it doesn't know how to do it unanimously: sometimes it feels like a commercial, other times like a strong, detailed and committed manifesto; sometimes it's to confusing and ripetitive with too many numbers, charts or statistics at once other times it's too rushed, superficial and dull feeling like a kids show; some interviews are very interesting, well scripted and important, other, less useful, could definitely be avoided. So as a documentary it could have been made better especially because it's extremely important but at the end at least it's there and it inevitably makes you realize a lot of things and think about them, despite all the technical problems, and that's more important."}, {"id": 41, "text": "No where does the film say anything about the vast amounts of herbicides including Roundup, 2-4D, and Paraquat used in no-till agriculture."}, {"id": 42, "text": "For sure this inspired me to start my own small crop in the best way possible."}, {"id": 43, "text": "If you cut out of this movie all the nonsense with happy ranchers holding their hands and the need to breed and humanely kill animals to regenerate the land, then it is a pretty decent documentary about the importance of moving from conventional farming to a sustainable one."}, {"id": 44, "text": "This documentary was a breath of fresh air! The ideas this film discusses are so important to the modern conversation of climate change and how we can restore the planet and hope for all known species on this planet.

I feel so inspired to be a part of the solution now!"}, {"id": 53, "text": "Kiss the Ground does an excellent job of focusing attention on how important soil is to man's existence especially in regards to the role healthy soil can mitigate climate change. Though this means we have to stop treating soil like dirt by either tilling it or dousing it with chemicals. Thus agricultural practices have to drastically change for both how we grow plants and raise livestock.

Instead, environmental activist actors narrate and star into something that is painfully progressive and one sided. It felt political, somehow. How does one politicize dirt?! And it's too bad, because what they said was mostly correct: there are cheap ways of farming sustainably, protecting life, earth, the air, sequestering carbon and giving us tasty food. Decoupled agriculture, plowing and artificial fertilizers are the very opposite of that and only serve chemical manufacturers. But they way they said it. Ugh!Using science to determine the best way to handle soil, which is the base of everything which is alive on land, is something relatively new. Understanding the role of microorganisms in everything from farming to medicine is relatively new. These subjects deserve recognition and study. Alas, farmers will never connect to something so painfully Californian. My advice: read about the subject and do your own research and experiments.

What's more, If he is the only one that can achieve the carbon sequestration that hes claiming, then that doesn't provide a lot of hope. Especially when you consider this is the same guy who ordered 40,000 African elephants to slaughter because he incorrectly thought they were damaging the land.If they wanted to stay with the scientific consensus, such as oxford university's piece by Joseph Poore, showing the biggest positive impact an individual can have on the planet by analysing 40,000 farms across 119 countries. Or by just simply looking at the Drawdown' Report's outlined solutions, not cherry picking the lesser significant parts. Then they should have said eating a plant based diet is the single biggest thing an individual can do for the planet. This is because a plant based food system had the lowest greenhouse gas emissions, ocean acidification, ocean deadzones, land use , water use, deforestation, habitat destruction and both land and marine biodiversity loss. In the solutions of the Drawdown Report they say that the shift to a vegan diet is twice as powerful as a shift to silvopasture and 4 times as powerful compared as shifting to managed grazing - which are two types of regenerative agriculture involving livestock. Hawkens' of the report also concludes the two biggest effects an individual can have are switching to a plant based diet and reducing food waste.I hope this doc doesn't detriment the required transition to a plant based food system, a part of the climate solution which is supported by the science and not just some damaging celebritised misleading message of hope in the wrong direction."}, {"id": 355, "text": "This documentary will leave you feeling hopeful, is the takeaway of the trailer for Kiss The Ground, and it poignantly succeeds at conveying an environmental message of hope and positivity.

However, it doesn't show us how it would work in practice apart from a non-disruptive seeding machine.

However, the quality of the soil has declined so much that the nutritional value of those crops is also diminishing at a rapid rate. While chemical corporate giants out for profit alone, continue advocating for poor and unsustainable practices using their chemical fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides, they play the role of a far greater villian in hastening apocolypic changes in climate.

The Soil Food Web's ability to create a Soil Carbon Sponge can grow more nutrient dense foods because the nutrient cycle is in tact when regenerative principals are practiced. This means Farmers have a role to play in ecosystem restoration, human health, and climate change reversal. The Soil Food Web's ability to sequester carbon is enormous because Co2 is going back in the soil where it was when we had balanced climate and it does so by way of the carbon cycle when regenerative principals are practiced. The quickest way this happens is the adaptive management of grazing animals like cows and sheep. Ranchers and meat eaters have an important role in the regeneration of ecosystem function and the reversal of climate chaos. The Soil regulates hydrology(the water cycle). Hydrology governs 95% of the heat dynamics on the planet. The heat dynamics are what we humans experience from climate change. Floods-too much water, drought-too little water. But floods and drought are not weather conditions they are soil infiltration issues. A soil carbon sponge created by the soil food web when humans practice regenerative principals lessens and can even alleviate flooding and drought. EVERY person who owns or lives with a 4'x4' or more piece of land has a role to play by not allowing their land to go bare, but to grow a tree, food, or plants that will cool the surface and sequester carbon. Wildfires spread by wind too are created or at least made worse by bare soil or man made surfaces. Windstorms are created when there is neither trees nor vegetation to attract the precipitation in the atmosphere into a rain drop. Water vapor is the largest green house gas, not CO2. Hydrology governs the heat dynamics responsible for hurricanes. If we cool the surface of the planet by growing green longer, growing more green and treating bare soil as a sin, we as a species have a chance.
