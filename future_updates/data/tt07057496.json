Did not expect this film to be this good. The film is tragic beyond words. It's hard to talk much without spoiling anything. Performances, writing, direction were all great! Definitely a must see!"}, {"id": 1, "text": "I wasn't sure about watching this movie at first. Asian movies tend to have a higher rating in general. But I gave this movie a shot. The movie starts out as a cutesy family story. Then it turns into a mystery with the brother's kidnapping. Then it turns a little sinister horror-like with eerie sounds coming from the closed room. Then with the brother's return and strange ways, it gives it an action and crime drama twist. Then with the big reveal you discover it is actually a psychological thriller. You then notice that you have over half an hour more of the movie to go after what you think is the big reveal. And then when you start wondering what else is left to see in the movie, tragedy strikes and it is heartbreaking. Brilliant film making. Now I want to watch more South Korean movies!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "I would give this movie an 8 or 9, but since one reviewer here admitted to deliberately giving the movie a 1 instead of 5 or 6 because he wanted to lower the overall review score of the movie, I'm gonna counter that by giving this a 10, because unlike him I agree with most of the other people who reviewed this movie, and feel it deserves praise and a good score.I'm not going to talk about the plot at all, because this is the kind of movie where the less you know going in, the better. So beware of spoilers in other places! Anyway, it is a great mystery, and a great thriller. It has a few very mild horror moments as well. The music and the ambience sets the mood perfectly. Acting was good. Watch this on an evening with the lights dimmed, and enjoy."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I enjoyed this movie better than expected. You never know with Netflix movies if a movie will be good or bad. But this movie is worth watching for the performances and characters. The ending is emotionally gripping.

Some of those twists were unneccessary and didn't make much sense.Didn't understood the motive behind the action of one of the heroes in climax scene. (Not mentioning the 'action' because it might be a spoiler)Overall a one time watchable movie."}, {"id": 8, "text": "An intense gripping thriller no doubt. However the ending kinda ruined it for me.

Totally wasn't what I  expected going into it... UGH!  And the.... Love, love, love this.Just my opinion though."}, {"id": 12, "text": "The movie starts out with what is an obviously unreliable narrator. But then there are a couple of points in the story where we find out that regardless of the narrator's problems, there is something more going on. So that makes for some pretty good suspense.Midway through the movie there is a sort of race scene where one character has to get into a bedroom before the other one does in order to pretend to be asleep. It's a scene that's been done to death in a hundred other movies before and it was at that point that the movie starts to go downhill - instead of something innovative the writer went with an uninspired cliche.Unfortunately the climax of the movie relies on a suspension of disbelief that is beyond anything even remotely plausible. Without getting into spoilers the actual murders are just too dumb to be believed. The first one alone relies on a character making the stupidest possible choice at every single turn. But then the second murder happens exactly the same way. Puh-lease! I just couldn't get past how lazy, dumb and contrived it was. It really drags the entire movie down.And then the movie ends on a gratuitous flashback showing that the murderer met his victims in more innocent times. Its a cool idea but the execution was utterly lazy because the writer didn't bother to set up any explanation for it beyond pure coincidence, they just threw it in out of nowhere in order to be cute.In the end, this movie is a disappointment. The best korean thrillers stand above the best from all other countries. But this one has too many flaws due to contrived and lazy writing. Its 2nd tier at best."}, {"id": 13, "text": "You know how sometimes you think you have someone all figured and they totally flip the script, turn around and say B*t*h!! YOU DON'T KNOW ME!!? That is exactly what is going on in this film. You think you know what is happening and get cocky. It seems like a run of the mill dramatic thriller and then it just completely flips!  It is an excellent movie with a lot of twists that pull you in several directions and I personally love that. I love when I can't see what is coming. It was great!!"}, {"id": 14, "text": "This is a nice little thriller with an intricate plot that's almost impossible to outline without spoiling something. I suppose that in itself is a spoiler. But anyway.Kang Ha-neul plays a 20-something student, Jin-seok, who, along with his big brother and their parents, move into a new house. He's a hypersensitive guy, having nightmares and hearing strange sounds. One rainy night, his brother is shuffled into a van by unknown assailants, only to return 19 days later, having no memory of his disappearance. Jin-seok, however, begins to notice changes in his brother's behaviour. You know. Alarming ones. Enough for him to follow his brother out into the streets at night, and so on.The plot unravels from there, with time-tried things like scenes where Jin-seok approaches a door, while we see his feet, his fingers reaching for the doorknob, etc. This dates all the way back to thrillers like Hitchcock's Suspicion (1941), when Joan Fontaine wondered if Cary Grant was a murderer. Or a little like David Fincher's Gone Girl (2014) for that matter.The movie is well-made as a genre exercise with touches of horror. Korean productions usually have a very Korean flavour, steeped in Korean sentiments (for lack of a better word), but this movie should be more \u00abaccessible\u00bb to an international audience. I'm not surprised it was picked up by Netflix, with little and easy dialogue, and a focus on a strong plot. And even if you know that there will be twists and turns, there should be something unexpected along the way.PS: The Korean title translates as something like The Night to Remember or Remember the Night. It is definitely more fitting than the generic English title (Forgotten).PPS: A note on the touches of horror. One scene involves TV footage featuring US President Donald Trump (with Korean president Moon Jae-in). Sure looks like horror."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Since there are so many good korean thrillers it seems the director was trying to make this movie more wicked than all of them together. Unfortunately that's the downfall of this movie. The movie starts rather solid and I was hoping I'm in for maybe even a great movie. But as the movie moves on it get's more and more absurd. Too many dream sequences. You also can tell rather early that something is wrong with that family. There are just too many scenes that are unreliable and mistakes made that even a human with half a brain wouldn't make. In my opinion the director was just trying to do too much which hurts this movie. He should have sticked to a more conservative script. So overall this movie starts solid but as it moves on it's just all over the place. I would call it an average movie."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Just watched this on netflix. I don't think a movie has ever had me so confused about it's qualities; intriguing at first. obviously something was going on, but what. The worker's questioning concerning the brothers was brilliantly referred to later on.  the first let down was the wrong leg limp. Then there was the taxi mistake. The second one wasn't needed. as the pen nib was enough. Then there were the cliches of the phone going off, or somebody being called, or told to look somewhere place, so our nominal hero won't be discovered. There was also the mother talking on the phone, and saying more than she needed to.  QUESTION; Why didn't the mobther lock the window? But then there came the big reveal. which had me stunned. later, another big reveal made me question how realistic it was. But I went with it. After that the movie had me changing my mind at almost every turn.  My imdb rating veered between 10/9/8/7/6. i settled on 8.

Absolutely heartbreaking."}, {"id": 18, "text": "The reviews on IMDB amaze me. Someone was even daft enough to compare this rubbish to Old Boy. Seriously? Forgotten starts off ok, but then at the twist turns into a ridiculously stupid and unintentional comedy. Honestly, you really have to suspend disbelief for the stupid script as it get sillier and sillier.Korean movies are better than this, really they are. If this is in your favourite movies of the year list, it's time to pick a new hobby. Forgotten is awful."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I saw already a lot of Asian movies and most of the times they're just not my cup of soup. But every now and then you get a little gem. Like this one. And I'm not surprised it's a Korean one, because almost all the good Asian movies I saw before were Korean. I couldn't tell you if I saw those actors before because I just can't memorize their names. But these actors have definitely qualities. Forgotten or Gi-eok-ui-Bam is a very captivating story that will keep your attention from the beginning till the end. It's a very well made mystery movie with a lot of twists and turns. Twists that you don't see coming at all. To me Forgotten is one of the best if not the best Korean movie I saw until now."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Short and sweet; I love me my Korean thrillers. This was a good one. Great for the first hour, had no idea where it was going. The last hour became a little more convoluted than it needed to be.

A happy and well bonded family life. It also depicts a love of younger brother for his elder brother.

This movie kept you thinking and guessing till the end. One of great thing about this movie is that it always create dougt in your mind for the situations you are witnessing in the movie.Some movies are benchmark of their genre.

I was about to not rate or review it since there are already so many good, accurate reviews. However after reading one reviewers brilliant idea of giving the movie a 1 though in his opining it actually deserves a 5.5, just in order to tip the overall rating scales lower (wow what brilliant logic) ,I decided to counter this brilliant idea by giving the movie a 10, which it truly deserves. Another viewer mentioned that it over explains the plot assuming it's viewers aren't smart enough to figure it out. It's actually the opposite. Hollywood has for decades put out movies that totally dumb down every storyline and over explain everything to death, like its audience . This movie and most Korean thrillers in general assume that it's audience are intelligent, which is a welcome relief from the idiocy of most Hollywood movies.

Not just the ending was unexpected, but everything that happened throughout the entire movie.This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen.

It's unpredictable to say the least, and I often find psychological thrillers a bit disappointing in their predictability. So, if you're the kind of person who loves a mystery, this will be a good watch. The initial grab is quite interesting, and you're constantly wondering how the filmmakers will resolve everything.

The ending was satisfying, if a little dragged out (not to mention depressing, but not more so than the current reality).And remember (you'll get this if you've seen the movie), South Korea fixed their inadequate health care system and went to a single-payer system in 2004.

Certainly some decisions may feel akward or wrong that characters take, but that is just how things work. Also it will make sense (more or less) in the end. Keep guessing, keep trying to figure out where this goes - it's almost impossible I'd say.

He never swore before, now he does. He never smoked and now he smokes. The younger brother explains it all to his mother who looks very empathic but then he hears a conversation where she calls him names (I was not allowed to use here) and tells to the person on the phone (the older brother) that the younger brother found out everything.

In the first 10 minutes of the movie, we took bet about who was the weird one, and I bet for the main character (I said he was a serial killer or something), my first sister bet for the brother acting weird (he was a serial killer, or a gang boss), while my other sister, being contrary that she was, bet for the parents.At some point, it looked like the brother did act weird (which made my sister grinning smugly), and then the parents (now it was my other sister's turn to grin), but, at that point (around the middle of the movie), I blurted out 'Shutter Island', no doubt. Out of my sisters, only one had watched 'Shutter Island' with me before, so she immediately recognized the reference, while the other one didn't really understand what I was talking about, so she demanded me to explain what would happen to the main character based on Shutter Island's plot and they hit quite close to the mark, which surprised her later on.Honestly though, this movie is basically 'Shutter Island' wrapped in Korean drama cliches. The first half managed to make me curious, but then, it grew rather boring since the plot is really similar to 'Shutter Island', even the ending was quite similar, although, once again, got even more dramaticised by typical Korean movie/drama's flair. I'm not saying they copied 'Shutter Island' idea, but it wasn't any better that 'Shutter Island', so I wasn't really impressed.What I don't like the most was the acting of the brother and fake mother-father when they confronted Jin-Seok to tell him the truth in the room where he killed the women. They acted way too arrogant that it looked two dimensional, like an anime character. Jin-Seok's portrayal itself wasn't really convincing as someone who had dissociative fugue and in a really great shock after being told such revelation, so it was hard to connect with his desperation and all that (the flashback scene was rather moving though, but again, the acting--or maybe the dialogue--wasn't really convincing). They still had a lot to learn from the master of desperation like Leonardo DiCaprio, LOL. He had been desperate to get an Oscar, probably what drove him to deliver superb acting from time to time until he finally won one.Overall, it was a good watch for those who haven't watched 'Shutter Island', but this type of drama played by real human isn't really my cup of tea (I don't mind this kind of drama in anime, though).

This is one of those movies that keeps you interested just by the little details and the originality. This was inspired by a true story but also had a huge original touch to it.it starts off hinting that his nightmare in the beginning of the film is just a nightmare. Nothing out of the ordinary. And then the little details start to happen, such as the camera fixing on the year that is stated on the calender, then random noises that nobody else seems to hear, and then all of a sudden on a rainy night, Jin's brother gets kidnapped by these people, disappearing for 19 days.When he comes back, he's a totally different person but he can't seem to remember anything before acting all strange. This is one of those films that is hard to put into real words because of how well done it is. We never would have guessed that Jin was the one who was different. Hypnosis disguised as anxiety meds? That's just awesome. A great touch. Then all of a sudden the rest of the characters start acting different. Finally, we find out that his family is not his family, that Jin's brother Yu is actually the kid that Jin spared from murder.Not to mention the plot of the film takes place during the very real financial crisis of 1997 in Asia. That's something completely new, and different. I had no idea that was a historical event and was actually very interesting to read up more on.The ending when we see why Yu was spared as a kid poses two different perspectives if the viewer really pays attention. Does Jin spare him because he didn't scream or because he offered him his lollipop? Could even be a third perspective that is left unsaid. I think for me personally, the element that they were able to try and spark Jin's memory in Yu's childhood home is priceless. Not only that but going that elaborate as well is amazing.Like I said, it's really hard to put into words how this film is, but it's amazing and beautiful.

Forgotten is one of the most recent examples of why this evolution has taken place and why many of us are delighted with this type of cinema. The film focuses on the life of a boy who tries to discover the truth behind the kidnapping of his older brother, who returns as a different man after nineteen days of captivity, from which he claims to remember nothing. A film that mixes the psychological thriller with touches of atmospheric terror and plays excellently with the shadows and paranoia of the younger brother during the days of the disappearance. Jang Hang-jun, responsible for the script and direction, knows how to make us feel the anguish of the situation at all times, making the disinformation that we have as a spectator is the same as our protagonist and creating a situation where interest increases every minute that passes. I must also emphasize the excellent performance of both brothers, especially that of the older brother (Kim Mu-Yeol), because he manages to create an insecurity and concern that does not disappear throughout the film. What's happened to him? That is the question that will haunt us at all time, as the film progresses, because the closer we get to its end, the more disoriented and surprised we will find ourselves, making us goose bumps and hitting us with an unsuspected but tremendous outcome. But not only in the script we can check quality, because if we focus on the more technical sections, we will realize that both the sound and photography sections are really well constructed, being vital in the development of many of the scenes and giving an intensity to the set that is well above average. The mastery of rhythm and the steady pulse behind the camera of the whole team make Forgotten not just a thriller, but an example of what modern cinema should be like. With' Forgotten', the lovers of the best thriller are in congratulations and the South Korean country claims its good state of form, because in recent years we have seen many examples of great calibre as 'I Saw The Devil', ' New World' or 'The Wailing' among others. Those who look for a good mystery, disturbing settings and stories with ingenious plot twists, should not miss this film."}, {"id": 138, "text": "There's a South Korean psychological thriller on Netflix that deserves your attention: Forgotten.

Very simply put, it tells the story of a regular family moving to a new house, something feels odd from the very beginning and, as soon as the story starts to unfold, it's one twist after the other.

While the story as a whole holds its own, I think I especially liked this movie b/c I truly found myself experiencing all the emotions that the protagonist experiences. Yes, I know, (duh) that's the goal of every actor/director, right? It's not easy but if you can get the audience emotionally invested in the characters, they will genuinely care what happens to them next, all you need is a good story to go along with it.

All really great movies!But comparing this film with Oldboy is a little bit too much.It has a really nice setup, you have the family moving to the unsettling home, it keeps you to the edge of your seat during the first 30 minutes, wondering what's going to happen next. You wonder what's going on, what's really happening. But then, it happens, the plot-twist hurricane.Too many plot-twist, such amount that gets ridiculous. The first plot-twist happens more or less 30 minutes into the film, you watch it and you're like:-Okay, didn't see that coming, I guess that they are going to go deeper into this the rest of the film. And they do it, but there's a lot more of plot-twist, one after another, and you start thinking:-Okay why did they took so many troubles to do all this?. That, plus a couple of plot holes really trashed the film.Don't get me wrong, if you saw Oldboy you know that the plot-twist is a little bit exaggerated, but this is even more. More that I can bear to take a film seriously.The acting is really good, nothing clumsy, the actors did a really good job showing their emotions and making it believable. The filming is really good, really good shots adding to the thrills. But the plot, is such a shame. This is like a plot-twist driven movie.

Acting? flawless. Camerawork? Brilliant.But come on! I can't forgive a plotline that relies purely on a narrative that takes place in a vacuum where... the rest of the world doesn't exist, I guess. Well, not sensibly at least. The police and hospital workers are apparently completely incompetent and dismissive (I can forgive that to an extent, but when a very confused man covered in blood stumbles into a police station, surely no one would just laugh him back out?) and the main characters behaviour at the end once he knows the truth and can clear the air somewhat decides to maintain the confusion? Why?Why why why? It's like the idea for the climax came first, a great build up was written, and then they couldn't figure out how to resolve it in a way that justified how straight-up whack the situation had gotten. An unreliable narrator and traumatised nihilism doth not a satisfying resolution make. The ending was so ridiculously out there, trying way too hard to be clever and cool, that it just fell flat.

Watching movies or series by them, even though it is a drama, many substantial plot sequence were built by an unpredictable twist followed by even more shocking climax. This movie has an amazing job to do that, with many mysterious thing happened in the first part of the movie, you are dragged to follow a story that doesn't too complex in its nature, but the way the writer/director bends the plot is carrying all of the suspense until the last part.It is the sudden drama acts that change all the movie's pace stop me for giving this movie higher score. The drama, while quite good and intriguing, follows similar pattern you can find in almost all Korean drama. It is not bad, but after giving us a really good trip to the twist, the cliche let the tension down.Probably, if you could attached to the emotional scenes that probably intended so that the movie will be more impactful, this is one for you. However, seeing somebody hit by a vehicle, person of your past coming back in unprecedented way, or brothers giving bromance and cute scenes seem so dramatic it's restrict me to like this movie more.

But now, one verge of watching another fantastic work from the Korean film industry I just wanted to open up some of my views revolving around Korean movies. Forgotten is a great piece of creativity and it belts me to sit back in front of my laptop for this writing. Yes of course, I'm more fascinated and twisted about the movie, Forgotten.  As a film buff I do watch all kinds of films belong to any languages and I am very much pleased about some of the works from Korean. Korean films are actually a matter of wonder while I watch it for the first time I can remember the movie (I saw the Devil) and it haunts me days after days. Old boy is another epic work which I considered Korean films has their own identity and they laid a huge stone in the path way of the cinema field. It's hardly to remember the names accurately because their language is so complicated so subtitle must need to understand the movies wholly. I knew some names in the industry Choi Min Sik (the actor of Oldboy and I Saw the Devil), Park won chok (director) and other names are even harder to recollect. So writing about Korean movies is actually a great task for me because it is actually blend with their geographical and internal aspects and somehow their counterpart, North Korean ideologies and views. They have to deal with their neighbors because they are their greatest foe. Cultural mechanism is completely aligned with the South Korean aspects and at the same time North Korean is always go along with the Defensive mechanism. Through that cultural as well as the creative part South Korea always proclaims and marching a cold war towards North Korea. That's why films had had greater impact on the lives of Korean people and it rotates along with abnormality that lies around their world.  What I throw back around Korean films is Forgotten, which I watched recently and astonished by the movie that always resounds me to write something. That is the reason for me to jump into such a wonderful task of dealing with Korean movies. Let take a break and talk about Forgotten. Forgotten is a wonderful piece of cracking twists and turn plots which goes through an evident level of thinking and perception. The movie goes so smoothly at the beginning then there happens a incredible dimension throughout. When we finished the movie we just bang with the vibrating effect of the characterization and the subject that growling completely through our vision. This might be the congested writing about Forgotten.  The movie goes along with Jin Seok and his amnesiac condition in which all other characters just plays along with him to keep the momentum high. It can be somehow relate with the effective technique that followed by Christopher Nolan in Memento, or The Bourne Identity or somehow Mulholland Drive. The title correctly depicts the actual ambience of the movie but that lies only at the initial part. The mirror scene at the Police Station burst out our heads when the characterization got changed. We struck little bit at some point and then we regain when their planning works and step atop into another level. So the movie got the first deviation from the mirror scene. Then we enter into the thrilling part of the movie. In and out focus effects bang with a speedy accompanied background score arose at this part. The victim looks more anger towards the accused and he is out of control to kill him. There uses the fast movement of camera. One, who is on the way of escape and the other he is on the way of capturing. That's the nail biting sequence created by the director. When the thrilling side reach at the edge of ending portion there comes the dramatic impact of the movie. A drama, which was happened in the past, carried through by a voice-over and we find and realize the innocence of the accused.  The stages or the layers that we were talked about is simply represent the concurrent move of the film but actually it went across some kind of perception where the audience have the full authority to judge whether the protagonist is right or wrong. Anyway what I admire about the movie is the well encircled script and well managed direction. These two branches worked together for the fruitful ending of the movie. And I'm very much happy because both the department (writing and direction) were handled by the same person. He is the correct auteur in some way and he is a great technician also. Forgotten will be remembered not only in the Korean film field but also in the mind of entire film buffs around the world."}, {"id": 144, "text": "The movie was just well written, well directed and amazingly acted ...The plot itself was so mysterious and gave so little up until the end when things started to really untangle, and even then, they gave another shocking emotional scene ,, the screenplay was tight and so connected but aside from that it was quick and has absolutely no dull unnecessary lines,, everything had to mean something and it apparently does right when the truth comes out.Casting wise,, Mu-Yeol Kim and Ha-Neul Kang did a phenomenal job ,, the whole cast did ,, but the due just kept on swapping characters back and forth and maintaining mystery and emotional expressions especially at the end just topped everything.Final thought,, When i'm asked why i follow the Korean cinema in the last few years i just start naming movies and plot stories ,, but to be clear ,, back in the day 70's-90's the Japanese Drama and film industry had the lead in east Asia while Korea back then had a lot of other issues to deal with ,, I personally believe that this period is the time where Korean film industry rises ,, and we have seen that through TV first ,, and in the last 10 years in the film industry ,, It is not as big in the production area but it is getting there and more investors from Hollywood are now more interested.,., so let's just set back, bring the popcorn and enjoy this era."}, {"id": 145, "text": "I enjoyed the film i can't say otherwise. the characters are strong, mostly the two brothers. the narrative starts of very very well until they explain what's going on and when that happens you have two options: or you start wondering about narrative flaws or you just go with the flow and put suspension of disbelief pretty high. i kinda tried to do both at the same time. the film is very human on how portraits the characters. it also has good action sequences, and some of the plot turns are pretty good and effective, they made me feel genuinly surprised. i even had a jump scare which is very very rare for me.the main issue is with the main discovery and how the movie wants you to accept that. i actually have no problems with the other turns (even though one or two were pretty unnecessary), just with the main one. because i was very entertained with this movie and i do think it's stil a good one - that maybe needed a bit of polishing in the narrative. it's still emotive and even poetic at a certain time, and wans you think about contemporary issues. and let's face it, until the main plot point i was completely engaged!it's still amazing how korean directors and screenwriters put the focus on the characters and that they represent. let's hope with parasite hollywood finally learns something, but i'm not very confident about it. i would recommend it for people who love a good thriller and are more enthusiastic by being entertained than by cherry picking the plot. if you start doing that, you might get disappointed. but i don't think neither 4/10 or 0/10 reviews are correct: i think this is a good movie, but not in the lenghts of olboy, i saw the devil, memories of murder or even parasite. still at least better than 80% of modern american thrillers."}, {"id": 146, "text": "I am a big fan of South Korean cinema, and I usually jump at any chance I get to sit down and watch a movie to make it out of South Korea. As I did when I got the chance to watch Forgotten (aka Gi-eok-ui bam).I must admit that I didn't know what the movie was about, nor did I know who starred it in or even what kind of genre it was. It was Asian and from South Korea, that was all the persuasion I needed.The movie does start out great, and the events that take place in the movie really had me puzzled. I didn't figure out what was going on before it was revealed towards the end. So director and writer Hang-jun Jang managed to pull off a nice trick here, as I was kept in the dark throughout the course of the movie.However, I must admit that somewhere along the midway of the movie, give or take, I did feel like the movie was starting to lose some of its appeal and my interest started to ebb. So there was somewhat of a slump there that had to be overcome.The acting in the movie was quite good, and they had some nice actors and actresses on the cast list to perform these various different roles and characters.The ending of the movie was very, very anti-climatic, and it just wholeheartedly sent an abrupt blockade on what would otherwise have been a very entertaining movie. And the ending is the reason why I am lowering my score to a 6 out of 10 stars, whereas it was otherwise set to get a 7 out of 10 stars.While the events throughout the movie was somewhat confusing, but then started to make sense once you figure out what was going on, it just felt like the entire plot of the movie was so very implausible and just felt horribly staged and that also took away from the enjoyment of the movie.All in all, Forgotten is an entertaining enough movie, if you enjoy a mystery thriller, with emphasis on mystery. But this is hardly among the top of the line in entertainment to make it out of South Korean cinema, not even by a long shot."}, {"id": 147, "text": "Forgotten is the second South Korean film I've watched in as many months, and it's pretty clear that, at their best, these guys have very high standards for filmmaking. Superior creativity and attention to detail are on full display.This movie is tightly written, unpredictable, and doesn't cheat to achieve its twists. Every turn in its complex plot is supported, and the viewer can be surprised without ever feeling cheated. Add to that great production values and a strong cast, and you have two hours of entertainment that seems much shorter.The entire cast is very good, especially the two lead actors. They likely speak English, and I predict they'll do well in American films if they get the opportunity.Forgotten is a really good movie that delivered way more than I expected. Recommendation: Strong Watch"}, {"id": 148, "text": "This movie is basically an average quality Korean drama condensed down into 2 hours. The story line would have worked for a Korean drama because the twists and turns of the story line would have been presented slowly with more focus on character development but when it is presented all in one viewing the story is just too much to be believable. The character development is also important for a Korean drama because the viewer feels a connection with the characters (good and the bad) but this is lacking in the movie.The cinematography is also bland as well as it is just too colorful to fit the gritty story line. They could have started it out colorful and made it gradually gritty near the end reflecting the story line which would have been a much better artistic direction but they just kept it with the typical K-drama look.I personally would not recommend this movie as you don't really get much out of it. If you are unfamiliar with thriller movies/genre then you might be impressed by the story line but for most people it'll be a forgettable movie."}, {"id": 149, "text": "I voted the movie a 1 star because it sure didnt deserve a 7.1 rating thats for sure. its been awhile since i've reviewed a movie but an over-all rating here of 7.1 just made me plain mad. hence the 1 star vote to try to knock the rating down a little bit. i love korean movies by the way and i personally feel that they make the best thrillers in the world at this time. the true rating if i wasnt trying to knock down the score would be somewhere in the mid 5s' to maybe a 6.  5.5 would be a perfect score for the movie overall as a matter of fact. its a professionally done movie and the story actually starts of well and continue'd to be pretty good, it was fairly imaginative and will probably keep the majority of its audience interested and guessing up to the 1/2 point of the movie. the acting wasnt bad either. even up to 3/5ths of the movie it was still pretty good....but after that, i'm guessing the writer either just got lazy or ran out of ideas on how to end the movie. from a fairly good movie in the 6.5 range, after the 3/5ths point, the movie just falls apart. i mean ridiculous and just plain lazy how they finished the last 2/5ths of the movie...especially after the younger brother accepts the job and is in the house where he was suppose to do the job. it just totally falls of the cliff from there, normal or even unnormal people would not do the things that they did...meaning the 2 brothers but of course it would have been impossible to wrap up the movie and the writer just plain ran out of ideas. i pondered over the ending and admit it was hard to end the movie logically but try at least. so....for the majority of us movie lovers, the first 3/5ths was fairly good and then it loses all logic from there on out. you have been warned."}, {"id": 150, "text": "This movie really was a rollercoaster. The only Korean movie I had seen before this was Parasite, and even though I knew beforehand that this movie was not going to be as good as Parasite, I was seduced into expecting a fun and thrilling experience after reading some reviews. However, the experience ended up being rather confusing and very unsatisfying.The movie was introduced as a simple story about a family moving into a new home where a creepy adventure was waiting for them. To be honest, the first half of the movie was alright, the main character's brother was abducted while the both of them were out for a walk at 11:30 PM. He returned 19 days later but he couldn't remember anything. Also, there was a room in their new house which they were by any means not allowed to enter. The main character heard some loud noises coming out of this room so that was another huge mystery.The movie spent the second half of the movie revealing the mysteries and throwing in random plottwists that were supposed to astonish the audience. Whatever they were trying to do, I was not impressed. There was too much inexplicable drama and I am still trying to figure out why most of the plot happened. Also, this movie has perhaps the most unnecessary and cheesy ending I have ever witnessed.I rate this movie a 4/10"}], "reviews_amount": 151}
