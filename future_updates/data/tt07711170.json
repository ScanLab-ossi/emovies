It's also astounding how he managed to keep finding Jessica with ease in his car, almost as if she had a psycho homing device on her. At one point, he even manages to dump a body right where Jessica happens to have stopped to take a rest in the woods!Stupid decisions are, of course, a necessary evil in these types of movies, like Jessica failing to finish her attacker off after a car crash renders him temporarily unconscious.Was it worth the $6.99 I paid to watch it?

What would I do? This movie is very believable, especially from a female perspective. The heroine, Jessica, is not a superhero nor is she a victim. She isn't blond, buff &amp; twenty like most of victims portrayed these days. Instead, she is your sister, daughter, friend - just a regular youngish (30?) woman, moving from one place to another, pulling a U-haul behind her much used car. Same for the man. Average looking, even a little common looking - exactly the kind of guy you see everyday at the store or gas station. Their meeting, too, is an event that occurs a million times a day all over the world. As I watched this, I found myself thinking, I've done that... Don't get me wrong, this isn't a feminist film at all. The movie keeps your interest simply because it is so believably realistic - Jessica and the man act and react like one would expect - not like a character in a script. And the ending, though violent, dirty and degrading, was not how I expected this particular story to end. Definitely worth watching."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I didn't have any expectations coming to this.

This movie is a remake of a 2011 Swedish movie called 'Gone'. Jules plays a recently widowed woman that is moving away from the city to the country to help soothe her pain. She has a few run ins with Marc-innocently at first-but she soon decides that he is probably stalking her. Sure enough, he drugs and kidnaps her and she wakes up inside an isolated cabin in the woods. She escapes and is in the process of trying to get someone to help her when she runs into Anthony, a hunter. Can he save her? Does she trust him? Or should she just stay away from any strangers, altogether in the future, that is, if she survives this encounter? It's a pretty standard movie, which was made in 2018-I read the end credits-so it's 2 years old. Oh yeah, maybe it's just me but Marc Menchaca reminded me of Jason Sudeikis with a bushy mustache.

The simplicity in which the story is told has the viewer razor focused. The photography is really good and showcases Portland, Oregon's wilderness. I thought Marc Menchaca was beyond unnerving. I don't know that people realize how many women are abducted and how few escape with their lives. It's nice to see a strong woman character carry the film."}, {"id": 55, "text": "I think I'm being followed. Uh oh. I'm pretty sure I know what those words mean.Anyway, Jessica (played by Jules Willcox) is a widow who loads her stuff in a U-Haul and heads to an unknown destination. Along the way, she gradually gets tormented and kidnapped by a nameless psycho (played by Texan Marc Menchaca). That's the blueprinted rub of 2020's Alone. With ample enthusiasm and the need to write at 5 in the morning, it's my latest review.So yeah, we've seen films like Alone before and its title, well it's not too thought out. Still, Alone is one of this year's best. Feeling like Spielberg's Duel in which the antagonist actually talks, Alone's setting of lush, wet Oregon takes over as it becomes a swallowing co-star.The performances in Alone are as it seems, nerve-ending and calculated. Jules Willcox and Marc Menchaca share different sides of an acting coin. They exhibit decent vs. evil and damaged vs. non-empathetic. Menchaca reminded me of a mustached Jason Sudeikis while Willcox gave off a heroine, Winona Ryder type vibe. They are pretty much in every frame and carry Alone with superior aplomb.Directed by John Hyams (son of veteran helmer Peter Hyams) and nifty and compact in its 98-minute running time, Alone keeps you on your toes with devised, inching tension. It's a thriller mind you and it's done with careful skill despite feeling a little familiar (pale, cold-blooded killer stalks vulnerable female). Hyams using rack focusing, low angles, and teeming overhead shots, actually outdoes his pops here. Confidently committing to every shot, he is aided by rich, forestry cinematography from the seasoned Federico Verardi.Alone ends like other violent, heady rides but it doesn't cheat the audience. Every nuanced plot point, every grubby mano-a-mano, and every sense of foreboding shake up is assured. I hope I'm not alone in this inference."}, {"id": 56, "text": "I had no expectations of this movie. I heard somebody talking about it, saying it wasn't all that bad. So we ended up giving it a go.

He really does a great job at making you believe at first that this guy is harmless and fools you until it's too late. Menchaca goes from harmless to feared on a flick of a switch. Once he does that, he holds your suspense tight and doesn't let go as you have no idea what he's going to do next and how.

She's lost her fiance/boyfriend (not sure) and for some reason leaves a day early after her parents said they'd help her move, because she doesn't want to talk to her mom. This is NEVER explored but let's fast forward to the meat of it.She's driving across the country and eventually runs into a car that stays playing games on the road. Long story short the guy driving the car stalks her (how? He just knew where she'd go and what stops she'd make?), captures her, keeps her in his basement and plans on molesting her and killing her. She escapes, he notices, she runs off, and dives in a river.From this point this guy might as well have a honing beacon planted on her because he knows EXACTLY where she is at all times (despite her floating who knows how far down the river, she gets rescued by a hunter who is driving her and he sets up a trap on some dirt road a ways down the river)... like WTF? And he's a psycho with a family... not like some mountain man expert.Basically this was the Terminator without ANY logical sense of how the Terminator knows where to go.The acting by the lead actress was pretty good and production quality was decent (hence the 2) but this movie was absolute drivel. Don't waste your time.This movie kind of set it up like a Rust Creek type movie (girl trying to survive) but the survival was barely even there, and it was COMPLETELY illogical how the 'Terminator' found the main character. Rust Creek did a film like this SO much better and showed how the guys could track the protagonist which made the film logical.

Sure, the mortal fear of main character Jessica is palpable, the villain is creepy and menacing and there's a lot of running and panting so the pace is reasonably high, especially in the second half.But the point is, that apart from the premise, nothing much else happens, no sudden scares, spectacular twists or gruesome happenings, it's all about someone caught, on the loose again, chased and then: one of the two wins, the end. Even in the details everything is, for a meant-to-be horrifying thriller, rather lackluster. The villain for instance doesn't do anything nasty to Jessica when he has locked her in (his motives stay totally in the dark anyhow!) and Jessica succeeds in escaping in an almost ludicrously easy way.Marc Menchaca as the villain hasn't much to act besides looking creepy and threatening, but the acting by Jules Willcox is fine and very convincing.

This film should satisfy you, more or less, as a riveting thriller, but it's doubtful that it'll stay with you long after the credits have rolled.The story is, well, very simple--a classic cat-and-mouse thriller pulled from Serial Killer Plotting 101. There's a freshness to how the main character behaves quite realistically within every situation. She never falls for what's obviously a trap like many cinematic idiots often do; there's a sense that she's always doing what we would probably have done in the same situation rather than simply what the screenwriter thinks would be interesting. While such believability is, unfortunately, rather rare in movies, there's also nothing very surprising about it. From beginning to end, everything is quite predictable.Unfortunately, whatever the film succeeds at in terms of behavioral realism, it fails at in terms of making the situations unfold naturally. The woods of the Pacific Northwest are quite massive, but the number of serendipitous run-ins in this story makes it seem like they're a couple of acres at most. The plot depends upon the characters always being within about fifty yards from each other, which is rather frustrating by the end.What was more frustrating for me, however, was how weak the characterization was. The film never succeeds at making the two characters anything other than superficial ciphers in a very cliched serial killer plot, however realistic their behaviors and the actors' performances might be. The screenplay hints at some possible thematic meanings that a very generous viewer could possibly mine--likening the abduction to grief; comparing the will to survive with suicidal depression; the hint that you never truly know what's going on in another person's mind, whether that's suicidal urges or serial killer urges--but in the end none of these interpretations really resonate.In the end, there's nothing to really recommend this film--nothing that really stands out--despite it being perfectly competent."}, {"id": 123, "text": "A recently widowed woman is trying to relocate and escape her old life, find herself being stalked on the road and kidnapped by a demented stranger, after she escapes her kidnapper and into the wilderness battling both nature and the chances of her recapture in a last attempt of survival.The movie is over all a mindless thriller, that doesn't stand out from the stalker/kidnapper sub-genre in anyway balanced paced at moments yet very dull and stretched at others due to the lack of a strong story to support it.The plot is basically revolves around a random woman who's being hunted by a random man! No presence of any back story to make us care for the lead character and her survival.With the number of wrong and stupid choices that every character do in this movie (the widow, the killer or even the guy haunting in the woods) along with the fact that this movie is 1 hour and 38 mins long and lacks an interesting dialogue, you'll find yourself forced to fast forward almost third of this movie in various parts just to escape the various awkward dialogue pauses that lasts for minutes during the endless chase scenes."}, {"id": 124, "text": "REVIEW - ALONENot another!YepWe have seen so many of these films recently where a female gets either kidnapped or chased by a nutter what could possibly make this stand out from all of the rest to make this your choice to watch?Well actually it was rather good with the suspense building nicely throughput the film, yes predictable in places and slow in others but what made this for me was 2 very simple things.1st, It's set in the real wild so rather than having an actor pretend to be in a forest in the middle of the sun shine this was actually filmed during one of the biggest rain storms so added that realistic element.2nd, as we see in so many films the complete back story of every character is told just rushing what could have been a great film, answering every question by the end of the film but this film doesn't, you don't know why he is doing what he is doing, you don't know his back story and you are only briefly told the main female characters back story which is relevant to what is happening in the film so this film could concentrate on the story without rushing or explaining everything, keeping you guessing as to his motive or not.So yes this does stand out from the other films of this genre and is one to see if you get the opportunity.Rating 7 out of 10"}, {"id": 125, "text": "This movie is for fans who really love edge of your seat suspense. Yes, the plot has been used before. Yes, the genre is an old one. Nothing new under the sun in any film. Hitch made at least two of his movies twice, and used the same theme of innocent man pursued by both the police and the bad guys multiple times.Yet when you add good production values, good writing, good direction, and good acting, even an old plot device becomes new and thoroughly entertaining. And that all rings true in this more than adequate suspense movie. It's doubtful that one could even count the number of films about an innocent woman confronted with acute danger. Yet the suspense here is so strong it all becomes rather new and exciting.Here, the woman is alone, with only her own wits, determination to survive, and some Hollywood luck to aid her. The only thing I found slightly distracting were the drone or helicopter shots taken from the sky. Since none of the characters are up in the sky to see these views, such camera work tends to mar the suspension of disbelief.

Oddly, this film is almost an exact remake of the Gone, even using a Jeep in both films.If it wasn't for this film's great performances, directing and cinematography, this would've been a flop, just like Gone. It's time Olsson expands his writing repertoire beyond Gone and this film.

With a 98 minute run time the film is self aware of what it is and fully succeeded in accomplishing that result. Alone is fantastic at rollercoasting the tension while presenting stunning cinematography and superb performances.While Alone features many creative takes on the genre there are two specific clishies that occur for the sake of progressing the story. These will be self-apparent but are very brief moments that understandably serve as story shortcuts given the budget. The film features a fight scene that is better chrographed than most studio films due to its proper editing and use of longer takes.Marc Menchaca as the disturbed antagonist is a standout. His body language oozes dred and tension. The choice of Menchaca to just be disturbed amplifies the tension in that you never know who you could actually bump into. Alone is a memorable film that walks the line of what genre needs to be but adds just enough new to feel fresh."}, {"id": 128, "text": "Usually when I don't know any of the cast for a film, and I've heard nothing about it before seeing it, the film doesn't turn out to be all that great.

I kept thinking to myself, there has to be a weak segment of this movie coming up - surely? Nope, it never came. This is a hidden gem of a film.I loved the lead character 'Jessica'. She was likeable, smart, never did dumb things, had great instincts and was easy to root for. A perfect lead for a horror/thriller film. Marc Menchaca as 'Man' was also brilliant in this film. He never overdid anything, but was extremely watchable when he was on screen. He and Jules Willcox are a large part of making this film as good as it is.This is also a very well directed film. A lot of the action sequences are perfectly filmed to create maximum suspense. I was on the edge of my seat from go to whoa in this one. The film finds a perfect balance between keeping the action going, and never making things unbelievable or far-fetched. I had a great time with 'Alone' and would highly recommend people check it out."}, {"id": 129, "text": "This was a movie that I was looking for a Featured Review over on Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast and saw this was playing at the Gateway Film Center. I checked up a bit to confirm it was horror and from what I read, it fit the bill for me. Jaime and I decided to give this a viewing that night as well. The synopsis here is a recently widowed traveler is kidnapped by a cold blooded killer, only to escape into the wilderness where she is forced to battle against the elements as her pursuer closes in on her.To just build on what the synopsis is stating, we're following Jessica (Jules Willcox). She is packing up her life into a mini-trailer that she can tow with her car. There is the feeling that she is running from something and isn't until later we learn what that actually is. I did notice early on that she is wearing two rings around her neck, her engagement and wedding ring. Before moving on, it should be established this is taking place in Oregon.While on the road, she gets behind an SUV that is going slow. She tries to pass, but when she does it speeds up. There is a near-miss with a semi-truck. The driver then decides to tailgate Jessica, honking and flashing lights. This causes her to go more into a panic and she pulls off the side of the road, allowing them to pass.She calms down and later gets gas. Jessica finally calls her dad, which he is voiced by Shelly Lipkin. She reveals what she is doing and he is shocked. Things get a bit weird though while she is talking to him and she sees the SUV from the highway go by. Speaking that is a bit off the highway in a small town, this spooks her where she struggles to go to sleep that night.The next morning as she goes to hit the road, a man knocks on her window. He is Marc Menchaca and he is the driver of the SUV. He apologizes for what happened and although Jessica accepts it, she is weirded out by what is happening here. She takes off and continues her journey. Later, she comes to the same SUV blocking most of the road and the guy is in a sling. He asks her to help him push it off to the side of the road and give him a ride to the next gas station. She offers to help in other ways, but he is insistent. She finally drives off, leaving him.During all of this, Jessica keeps avoiding answering calls from her mother. She finally calls her back when she stops off at a rest area. This is cut short when the SUV pulls up. Jessica panics as the guy walks toward her vehicle. It gets tenser when a van stops, blocking her progress and she panics. He catches up and knocks on her window, stating that she almost hit him when he was going to the bathroom.It all culminates when she loses control. There's a flat on the U-Haul trailer and the SUV isn't far behind. The man gets out and attacks her, where she wakes up in the basement of a cabin. We get to learn more about this guy as Jessica does what we can to escape and survive.There's where I want to leave this recap of the movie. This is definitely an interesting film, but I will say, we are getting some tropes that we've seen quite a bit of. That's something that I'm not going to say ruins the movie though. To really get into this, Jessica is dealing with the death of her husband. It appears that she wants to start over so she just packs up and leaves for a fresh start. This is really the worst decision that she makes as it puts her on the path of the man who is after her.Now I state it that way, because what makes this scary for me is the fact that she does a lot of things right and it still goes wrong. The writer of Mattias Olsson and director John Hyams know the history of abductors like this. I noticed when we first met the man that he only had one arm. He does actually have, but one is in sling, much like what Ted Bundy would do. It is disarming toward people to see them hurt like they are and shows vulnerability. Despite this though, Jessica knows something is off. She doesn't help him or get out of her car when he stops on her on the highway. She flees immediately when he comes into the rest area. She even calls 911 when a van comes up on her very fast. I just love even though it scares me with the idea that she is making the right decisions, but no matter what she still gets put into a bad situation.For this movie, we really get two different types of movies meshed together. The first part is a road horror akin to a Duel or Joy Ride. I'd put it closer to the former in how it all starts with the man following her, but we get personality of our villain like in latter. It then changes into a lost in the woods to survive movie. This is why I say it is tropes we've seen before, but I do like the conventions that they're playing with.Much like you'd get in a slasher film, I like that we have a broken character of Jessica who needs to find her strength. This is something closer to a rape/revenge film, taking out the rape aspect. I do like seeing that. Jaime told me this is something that really scared her and made her uncomfortable, as this is a big fear for her. I do want to give credit to Willcox for her performance. To bring this full circle, she is broken when we meet her and through this survival, she has to find her strength. We know its there as she is moving to take back control of her life.I really do need to go over Menchaca and Anthony Heald, the other two actors we really get to see. Menchaca I don't think I've seen before. I like the idea that we're getting real aspects pulled from kidnappers and killers to make this character. It makes him feel clinched, but his performance in the role I think helps. His look is just creepy. Heald is an actor that I normally despise the character he plays, but his performance fits well. Here he is Robert, a hunter that Jessica encounters. I like how things play out and I will admit he frustrates me. I can't fault him though as the logic is there. Aside from these two, the rest are mostly just hearing their voice and they do well for what was needed.The last thing for me to go over would be effects of the movie. This is one where we don't get a lot, but what we do is really good. The bit of blood and the bruising on characters looks realistic. There's also a scene where a stick gets lodged in a foot. This made me cringe and squirm. If you can do that, you got me for sure. The cinematography though is amazing. They do some really long shots and takes where they play with focus to where you can see only the foreground or background. This is effective in building tension for sure in my opinion. This is probably my favorite aspect is how well it is used.Now with that said, this movie was one that just popped up on my radar and I'm glad that I got the chance to see it. The concepts aren't new, but I like that they combine a couple of types of films I enjoy and have two great performances to drive it. The movie is intense and really does a great job at building tension as well. Something I didn't really go over would be the soundtrack and how that helps to drive it as well. There aren't a lot in the way of effects, but it doesn't need them either. What we get are practical and work really well. The cinematography is also amazing in my opinion. For this, I'd rate it as an above average movie, just bordering on good and one that I would definitely revisit to see how it holds up.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10"}, {"id": 130, "text": "Starting my first wide release of the summer in a theater with Russell Crowe's bad boy in Unhinged menacing a single female in her car, I thought I had my mindless thrill about road rage. No, I found one even more thrilling and more mindful: Alone.This action thriller has all the tropes a genre buff could hope for, only more. Not only is Jessica (Jules Wilcox) pursued by car by at first a nice but strange Man (Mark Menchaca), who in not nice at all it turns out. He ends up pursuing Jess by car and then foot in a forest of the Pacific Northwest in an unexpected conclusion with a twist new to the genre.In both films, the heroines are smart, tough, but still believably endangered by bigger and ruthless males. In both cases the smart phone promises to make the heroines smarter than the men. Alone should satisfy feminists who like their women to be survivors, but not easily so.In both films the women are single, with Jess having lost her husband to suicide, a point the villain plays on to Hannibal Lecter effect.That reminds me: A victim along the way is played by Anthony Heald, who played the hospital head in The Silence of the Lambs (as I write about psychos like Hannibal).Alone is not so much bloody or jump-scarish as it is about survival in a jungle of wackos like the Man. Although the photography is sublime (nothing photographs as lush and dense as the Northwest), the real action is seeing a gender we used to think vulnerable to men now going nose to nose and doing males better by thinking better.Now muscular can be applied to a thriller with an intelligent, attractive woman heading the film. It's still best not to give in to road rage. It will come back at you."}, {"id": 131, "text": "A tense, fast-paced serial killer story that stuck to the basics and succeeded as an entertaining movie. The plot was simple, the dialogue basic, and the acting realistic- all of which made the movie more convincing. There was no need to rely on jump scares, overt gore, or a hyper-active plot. Just the meat and potatoes of what makes a serial killer film successful.Bonus points for the cinematography giving the movie a gritty nature vibe. I felt like I could feel the sharp branches, river, mud, rain, cold, etc. that the protagonist experienced.We all have seen these types of movies before, but what makes this one higher quality is it was simple without trying too hard to stand out.Highly Recommend [7/10]"}, {"id": 132, "text": "The movie was very close to be one of the best serial killer, cat-mouse thrillers. The story was good, the acting was really good from both the main characters,the location of Oregon, the West Coast wooded area was good, the picturization was great. The good things about the movie was not adhering to the cliche script, there are dozens of these kind of movies come and go almost every couple of weeks and almost 99% flop because of same treatment of damsel in distress cliche scenes when main character make one after the other stupid after stupid moves, scream, run naked through the wood and unnecessary gore, violence and sexually pervertness. This movie didn't even go that route which was the positive thing and probably the only positive thing which is the reason I gave 5 stars and I could end up giving 7 stars easily if it's not for the following negative points. There was hardly any character development. Whether its West Coast, East Coast Canadian wooded and forest areas, it's really, really difficult to locate anyone so quickly in thick woods. But, in this movie, the serial killer was always within a few yards from the victim at any given instance, it was almost like he inserted the GPS chip and following her with GPS device, at one stage I thought when he knocked out the main character, he might have put a gps locator inside, or at least they should have showed that to make it more practical the way he was keep locating her, even after 7-8 hours. At one instance, she passed out for the entire night and next morning he was just there? It's almost frustrating and all the real things about movie been varnished with this unrealistic within yards chased. The second most negative thing about the movie was the motive of a serial killer. Majority serial killers catch their prey for sexual gratification, or make them feel powerful. When the serial killer kidnapped her, he didn't abuse her sexually or physically, also the holding chamber didn't show any past victims were there or any other evidence. Overall, the movie was one time watch, but it could be a really good movie if it's not for above items."}], "reviews_amount": 133}
