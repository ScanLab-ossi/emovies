Seriously guys, this movie had no quality plot, writing, thought, or direction. The characters were exceptionally bad and unlikable and had no depth. The scares were clich\u00e9 and very unoriginal. It's a total introvert to the 1974 cult classic. The original actually had suspense, a creepy atmosphere, scary scenes, and an effective direction. This one had none of those things... I'm very surprised because Blumhouse usually makes quality films, from my experience. Very disappointed.DO NOT ruin your holidays and see Black Christmas! The original is great, but not this one!"}, {"id": 3, "text": "First off, this film has no connection with the other two Black Christmass in no way, shape, or form so do not going into this thinking anything about those movies.

Absolute trash. Someone should be arrested for this dribble."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Given that the 1974 Bob Clark's Black Christmas is my favorite Christmas movie, I was hoping that this would live up to it. Watching the remake, I kept asking myself: is this even Black Christmas?After watching the previews, it's pretty obvious who dies, who lives, and whose the killer. The real killer for this film is Director/writer Sophia Takal. She brutally slashes this classic into something that's not Black Christmas. She uses the #MeToo movement in a horror film, which clearly doesn't work, or needs a different writer. As for Blumhouse, this is by far their worst film they produced. How can you go from 2018's Halloween reboot to this? Shame on Blumhouse.The story is simple. Sorority girls being killed off one by one by an unknown killer. If you've seen the original, along with first 2006 remake, then you know killer is the killer. Wrong! I'm not going to say who the killer is. Just watch the previews. As for fans hoping to see Billy in the film, guess again. There's no Billy. How can you make Black Christmas without Billy? That's like making Halloween without Michael Myers.As mentioned, the script is brutal, the acting is so-so. The scares are YAWN. There's nothing scary about this film at all. If they wanted to make this movie scary, they should have given it an R rating. Instead they wanted to attract younger audiences to see it. But also because as I read online, the writers felt that the girls in the film couldn't handle the gorey violence, as was depicted in the first 2006 remake. You say this film is all about feminism when you're against women fighting back in an R rated movie. Look back at Laurie Strode in Halloween. She's destructible like Myers was. For this film, you're hoping all the sisters die because there's no character development, and wanting the movie to finally be over.I'm giving this film 1/10. The only thing done right about this movie is that it's only an hour and 32 minutes. Short enough for it to not waste too much of our time.All in all, stick with the original 1974 classic. If you want something with more violence and gore, the 2006 remake is for you. As for this movie, let's leave in 2019 to be forgotten and not remembered.Thanks Sophia Takal for ruining a classic. Word from advice, leave this film out of your resume if you ever want to direct a horror film again."}, {"id": 7, "text": "From the trailer, we could already expect that this has nothing to do with the original one or even the 2006 remake but... While I was watching this in the cinema I couldn't stop thinking but whyyyy, why did they call this Black Christmas and why is this considered a remake???If this movie would have a different name I wouldn't be this bothered and upset with it. While watching it I was even hoping that it would have a little connection, even like... The cult being related to Billy, or this being in the future and they were just all serial killers obsessed with what Billy did...This is not a remake, and this shouldn't be called Black Christmas, that's all."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This is horrible!!!

There was nothing redeeming about this movie. It's a horror movie based around how men are being kept down by women and they are using black magic to take the power back. Power that they never actually lost, of course. It's just now their actions have consequences and they don't like it. The lesson was muddled anyway, the characters all suck, the kills happen off camera and by the end you don't care anyway because you've been defeated completely and you just want to go home.

The characters are annoying, the story is really different than the original, and the whole concept about how all women are good and all men are bad is really stupid (that's not feminism because feminism is about gender equality, and we all know there are good men and good women as well there are bad men and bad women). I would hate even if they wrote an opposite story about good men killing bad women because both ways are so generic, boring and wrong.I advise you to save your money and watch the original or the remake (yes, that one looks a masterpiece if compared with this new version... And even the female characters are more interesting and iconic than the new ones)."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Black Christmas title in pink letters should have been another warning to stay away from this movie. Terrible movie. Disappointed"}, {"id": 12, "text": "When I found out they were remaking Black Christmas, I was indeed excited as I sometimes like a reimagining of older movies, however this movie takes out Black Christmas out of the original Black Christmas. This isn't Black Christmas. I feel Blumhouse have got the rights of the title and just used it to cash in - another important comment to make is that Jason Blum (CEO of Blumhouse) had previously insulted females for being directors and there isn't any female horror directors that want to direct horror and this caused huge backlash.The movie begins with its typical opening horror movie sequence ending in disaster, from the first 10 minutes of the movie I could sense what route this was going down and it wasn't a likeable route. The acting was strange and cheesy and was not well presented in certain scenes (for example when a female character kicks out her boyfriend of the house) and two other female actresses who were arguing two seconds before just follow and stand and watch her. (The whole scene is awkward)The tense build ups for the jump scares are so obvious that you don't jump and expect it and they conclude stupid happenings, for example a female actress try's to find working Christmas lights and the outcome is a expected jump-scare. The killer is another aspect that just doesn't make this Black Christmas, this is Black Cult. There is no Billy and there is no one - killer.The supernatural element of this was just STUPID. It was unneeded, Black Christmas is a slasher alone and didn't need to have any supernatural elements added to it and the outcome of this being added, made the movie more of a disaster. They built the movie up for such a big ending, that it ends with disappointment and anger. They could of spread out the tense scenes at the end and make it more appearing, however the death scenes alone were awful and rushed.If somebody just killed my friends, I'll be stabbing them multiple times (this was obviously changed to keep a lower rating) however I can't seem to understand where the age rating was cut from as this movie has little gore or blood and I have seen many PG13 movies with a higher level of gore.The end aspect now which I haven't mentioned, the feminism, I am all for everyone being treated equal and fairly, however this did NOT do that. It basically said All men are evil, let's make them kill women and if they don't listen to us we kill them - This shoves feminist down your throat and actually makes you start to dislike the characters for that reason (even though they are all pretty unlikeable already).Going back to what I said about Jason earlier, this was obviously to prove to fans and public that he isn't anti woman from my opinion as this was green-lit, shot and released in a space of 6 months from when he said it.Avoid this movie this Christmas and stick to the other remake and original."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Genuinely wish I'd followed the advice of some of the reviews I've seen and given this one a miss - it's essentially a feminist advertisement with a few slasher moments thrown in to make the trailer seem half appealing.

I saw this film on the second day of its release and it was a very low turnout which was not a good sign for a start.

It is also classed as a horror movie but is not scary in the slightest. Black christmas us also set on Christmas but there is very little Christmas elements in the film apart from a women getting choked with Christmas lights and a Christmas song apart from that there is not alot of Christmas elements which is weird as it is called black Christmas, and if that is not enough as soon as they are at the Christmas event you know who the killer is and it turns out it is everyone they hate who are killers which makes it pretty rubbish. The film is also very predictable, makes absolutely no sense and is very far fetched. For example the film makes no sense because of a few things. First the killler is just all of a sudden holding a bow, also the film makes no sense as it is not explained where some of the girls dead bodies and what happened are and the peoples are dead do not look very dead and sometimes you wonder are they dead?

Riley has been struggling ever since she was sexually assaulted by one of the fellow fraternity members, but they all deny the incident. Right before break her and the rest of her sorority sisters take a stand against sexual assault and call out the guy who did it. One by one the girls begin to get killed in honor of an ancient ritual created by the founding fathers of the school unleashing a paranormal presence possessing the fraternity and giving them even more of an advantage.I'm a fan of the classic Black Christmas and even a bigger fan of the 2006 remake. I will start off by saying the reason I love the first remake is that I was eleven when it released and got to see it in theaters and thought it was terrifying. I've seen it every other Christmas since and it never gets old. I respect the classic and for its time would've praised it just as many other fans of the slasher genre should. I was intrigued once another remake was announced and even excited to hear Blumhouse was releasing it. Like many other people after the trailer dropped and the rating I was ultimately disappointed. I'm all here for a female protagonist in a film and love when the final girl gets her chance at survival but this was some crap. I feel as if Blumhouse is trying to monopolize the Horror genre by remaking all sorts of classics and dropping movies left and right but haven't taken the time out to read the scripts. While the budget on this was 5 Million it's easy to make a profit on it around this time of the year since it's a holiday film, and they took advantage of that. I can understand a reimagining but to take out Billy is disrespectful to Bob Clark and fans of the franchise. The PG-13 route was a smart idea since they could bring in a younger audience to rake in the cash after the backlash on the trailer in attempts to make this production a success. Blumhouse this past year has become greedy and doesn't seem to care about taking a classic horror film and running it into the ground. The kills were just as disappointing as the acting and the dialogue is all over the place. There were some lines in the film I looked over at my friend and said You've got to be joking when I knew they were completely serious. The supernatural cult was one big joke and not needed whatsoever. This surprisingly isn't the worst film I've seen this month but it sure is close to the bottom of the list.

Basically, while walking home, Hawthorne College student Lindsey (Lucy Currey) is impaled with an icicle by three masked figures. The rest of Hawthorne College is preparing for the Christmas holiday break. Student Riley Stone (Imogen Poots) struggles to move on after being raped by AKO fraternity president Brian Huntley (Ryan McIntyre), only her close friends believe her. Her sorority sisters Kris Presley (Aleyse Shannon), Marty (Lily Donoghue), Jesse Bradford (Brittany O'Grady), and Helena Ritterhouse (Madeleine Adams) are taking part in the AKO talent show with a dance choreographed by Riley. Meanwhile, university founder Calvin Hawthorne is now considered by many as a notorious misogynist, there is a petition for his bust to be removed from the main building. Following another petition, lecturer Professor Gelson (Cary Elwes) is fired due to his refusal to teach books written by women. These decisions have caused anger from the AKO fraternity towards Kris who orchestrated these petitions. Riley learns that Brian will be back in town, she is supported by friendly boy Landon (Caleb Eberhardt) from the AKO fraternity who takes a liking to her. At the AKO fraternity, Riley catches a glimpse of a strange ritual involving new pledges for AKO and a black goo leaking out of the Calvin Hawthorne bust. Riley then intervenes when a tipsy Helena is about to be sexually assaulted by one of the frat boys, she sends her home. Riley takes Helena's place in the talent show and seeing Brian they perform a song with her sorority sisters outing him as a rapist. The girls leave in high spirits and Riley bonds with Landon. Meanwhile back at the MKE house, Helena is abducted by Lindsey's attacker. The next day the girls start to receive threatening direct messages from a Calvin Hawthorne account. Meanwhile, sorority sister Fran (Nathalie Morris) is also killed by the masked man. Riley alerts campus security concerned about Helena when she disappears. After a strange encounter with Gelson outside the AKO fraternity, Riley bumps into him, and spots a list of the MKE girls among some papers he dropped. Marty and her boyfriend Nate (Simon Mead) have an argument and kick him out of the house. While Riley and Kris argue about Kris uploading the talent show video online and Riley now fears retaliation from members of the fraternity. Jesse goes to the attic to get some Christmas lights and is murdered, her body left in the attic. Riley, Kris, and Marty receive more threatening messages before being attacked by an assailant with a bow and arrow who injures Marty. The girls lock themselves in a room and Riley goes to retrieve her phone, while Kris goes to the attic to warn Jesse and discovers her body. Nate returns to the house and is promptly murdered. Riley uses a car to kill the masked attacker, but then two other masked men attacker her, Kris and Marty. Riley and Kris are given time to hide, while a gravely wounded Marty dies from her injuries. The pair overpower and kill the attacker, they are alarmed at the fact they are covered in black goo and not blood. Riley identifies that she saw at the ritual and is alarmed by a strange look in the pledge's eyes. Riley and Kris escape the house in Nate's car and Riley theorises that Hawthorne dabbled in black magic, she thinks she is responsible for the killings via his bust and the black goo it emitted. Riley demands they go to the AKO fraternity to fight rather than go to the police, and she meets with Landon who joins her. Many sorority sisters are also being attacked by other AKO pledges and need rescuing. At the AKO house, Riley witnesses the Hawthrone bust leak the black goo before finding Helena, alive and held captive. She rescues Helena before Riley is betrayed by her and knocked unconscious by an AKO member. Riley awakens to be confronted by Gelson, Brian, and the AKO frat boys who have hypnotised Landon into becoming part of their cult. Gelson explains that after Kris forced the bust's relocation to the fraternity, they discovered Hawthorne's plan, involving a spell and the black goo, to keep unruly women in check. The goo allows the spirit of Hawthorne to possess the fraternity's pledges and send them out to murder any women that step out of line. It is also revealed that Helena has been secretly working with the fraternity and stole several items from her sisters, allowing those possessed to easily locate their targets. One of the pledges murders Helena despite her willingness to be a good woman. Riley plans to attack Brian, who is part of the cult, at this moment Kris and Lindsey's surviving sorority sisters enter and fight the fraternity. Riley overpowers and kills Brian, and then smashes the Hawthorne bust. Kris sets Gelson on fire and the women and Landon escape, the other frat brothers are locked inside and left to burn to death. Riley and the traumatised group watch the frat house burn down. Also starring Ben Black as Phil McIllaney and Zo\u00eb Robins as Oona. The performances are cliched, especially Elwes who is a ridiculously naff misogynistic tutor villain, the only thing that remains loyal to the original is a character suffocated with a plastic bag, but sinister phone calls are replaced with texts. The kills are reasonably violent, but come too slowly, the attempts to create tension and jump scares do not work, and the addition of a fraternity cult killing the young women is really stupid, I definitely preferred the 2006 version to this rubbish, a boring and uninteresting slasher horror.

However, this film misfires badly. Loosely based on the 1976 film of the same name, it is a straight-forward slasher movie that is never scary. Unless of course your idea of scary is a character jumping out of the dark, accompanied by the necessary loud scary music. Not helping matter for the no-name ensemble cast is the lightweight script. This was quite disappointing. I had hoped for something like Happy Death Day, which at least had some original moments and didn't take itself too serious. Amazingly, this movie was filmed this summer (in New Zealand) and now just 4 months later is already in the theaters.Black Christmas opened wide last weekend. I went to see it in its second weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this here in Cincinnati was not attended well (8 people to be exact). If you are in the mood for a scary movie with a Christmas team, you may want to check out something different (say Krampus or Silent Night, Deadly Night just to name those). Of course I invite you to check out Black Christmas, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu=ray, and draw your own conclusion."}, {"id": 57, "text": "This film made the 'Prom Night' remake look Oscar worthy.

All the other females roles were more strong, why is it lately that these female writers are making the female lead pathetic with no brain and weak. It is as if someone or something has to continue reminding them what to do. It is so annoying and me being guy I'm like what the hell. I am giving a rating of a 5 because the suspense and the action was decent and the fact that this was not a remake of the original it was a new movie with a new story line with bbn it's own take on the classic and the remake of 2006. Just a warning if you want to get angry and yell at the screen or TV because you are annoyed with the female lead character then by all means it's worth it but otherwise good luck to oversee that because throughout the whole movie I was hoping she would get killed off of how PATHETIC they made her be.

Writer &amp; director Sophia Takal and first-time scribe April Wolfe have given Black Christmas a makeover and reimagined it as supernatural showdown between the sexes. The sinister looking s wear hoods and wield bows &amp; arrows. Indeed, Takal and Wolfe have changed the villain from one deranged psycho to an entire fraternity of psycho pledges. In the original Black Christmas, whose claim to fame is being the first stalker movie, a mentally unbalanced but homicidal man sneaked into the sorority house and used the attic as his refuge while he slaughtered the girls. The unbelievable but atmospheric Black Christmas sequel Black X-Mass (2006) dutifully picked up the original storyline where the first film left off and added a extra villain. The villains in the Takal and Wolfe version are thin-skinned guys who argue that women are not equal to men. After the women shame them on their own turf, the guys retaliate with execution squads of archers. Indeed, the image of a hooded figure in a robe is exotic, but these archers are far from scary."}, {"id": 158, "text": "To female and female identifying horror fans, go see this movie it's a delight.

In this one you won't find any humour as you do in Scream (wich I like btw), and it is not even really exciting."}, {"id": 160, "text": "The original Black Christmas, directed by Bob Clark, was released in 1974, two years after Title IX, a federal civil rights law that protected women from sexual discrimination, went into effect, like it or not. Misunderstood by a good majority as strictly a matter of leveling the playing field for female athletes, Title IX is more than that; Title IX allows women their due process when reporting sexual misconduct to the people in charge on college campuses all across the country. Since none of the sorority girls at this nondescript college are subjected to violence or harassment by a male student, the audience can only guess how a complaint to university officials would be handled. That's because Black Christmas is politically unaware. Most incidents go unreported, as documented by a variety of studies, but the reason for a woman's silence differs from the Sophia Takal remake and Black Christmas, as written by Roy Moore, a man.The presence of Title IX is unfelt, to say the least, in Bob Clark's Black Christmas. The social mores, however, were different in the seventies; nobody cared, or even understood, that the system was rigged.for the perpetuation of male dominance. Despite Black Christmas being a Canadian production, there are no apparent Canuck signifiers, a sure bet that the fictional university and adjoining sorority house are meant to be read as American. These young women, miles apart, both ideologically and socially from their 21st century counterparts, albeit not objectified in the slasher flicks it would inspire, do share the same retrograde opinions as men about their own victimhood. An obscene phone caller menaces the coeds who live on 6 Belmont Street. His telephone scatologia intimidates Jess(Olivia Hussey), being called pig and worse, but it amuses Barb(Margot Kidder), a city sophisticate who rolls with the punches instead of questioning her gender's debasement. Times change. The pig is a man now.Last semester, Riley(Imogen Poots) was drugged and raped at a fraternity house party. Her decision to forego the filing of a complaint against her attacker came from an innate understanding of the patriarchal construct in place at Hawthorne College, whose administrative brass, former fraternity house members themselves, would undoubtedly side with Brian Huntley(Ryan McIntyre), the former outgoing AKO student-president. All of her sorority sisters, even Kris(Aleyse Shannon), the woman's right crusader and Riley's best friend, knew that this was one fight in which the victim had no chance of prevailing victorious. I know that. I watch documentaries, the titular character says in Noah Baumbach's Frances Ha, which functions as a filmic subtext that Black Christmas only half-explores. For a major studio film, halfway there is enough, because a smart audience will know the other half to complete the picture. Riley is written as somebody whose backstory consists of having watched Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering's The Hunting Ground, the 2015 documentary about rape culture in college fraternities, perhaps, the strongest indictment against capitalism put on film, yet. How can a parent argue? If you speak out against the status quo, you put the big business of running a university at risk with donors, and parents who want to believe that your college is a safe environment for their daughters. They want tuition money, room and board money, money money money, by any means necessary.Two murders in, as of yet undiscovered, Riley runs into Professor Gelson(Cary Elwes), still smarting over the removal of the Hawthorne founder's bust, when Kris and ilk lobbied successful for an incremental reversal of the pervading rape culture that infests their campus. The classic literature professor drops a list of names, all girls, while he hunts for the right classroom key to unlock the English department door. It's a kill list; a literalization of how schools conduct investigations between the accused and accuser, in which the latter, as is custom, subjected to a whole character assassination by both faculty and student body alike. Kris, more than anybody else, got caught in the professor's crosshairs after she started a petition calling for his immediate removal, due in part to a curriculum designed to negate any mention of women or minority writers. The reading list consists of nothing but books, albeit classics, by dead white men. Now it's Riley, who has the gall to fight back; to embarrass her attacker in a Christmas skit with three other Santa-clad girls, when she helps perform a barbed song about rape culture. Up in the Frathouse alarms Professor Gelson because his student outs Brian, when the survivor unexpectedly takes center stage as the lead, and sullies the good name of this young, upstanding man; his protege, whose political future has the potentiality of being jeopardized by a momentary lapse in judgement that only allegedly may have happened. And if it did. Who cares? All women want it, anyway.No means yes! Yes means ****! No means yes! Yes means ****!He was the most famous person on campus, the starting QB who was going to take home college football's most prestigious award and lead his team to a national championship. She was just another coed, just another pretty face at an alcohol-soaked fraternity party, where girls should have been looking out for other girls. But she did come with a friend; they got separated, probably by design, as one ex-fraternity brother, pixelated to conceal his identity: We hunt the pretty ones as soon as they walk through the door. Alone and made vulnerable by a a drink spiked with roofies, she encountered the most famous person on campus in the bathroom. He raped her, and then, bizarrely, gave the victim a ride home on his moped, as if what transpired at the party was nothing atypical for a Friday night to the assailant. Nobody believed her, or rather, nobody cared. Her testimony, regarding the state of college campus safety, and most importantly, the bitter hereafter once a violent sex crime gets reported to school officials, proves to be the tragic centerpiece of The Hunting Ground. College sports, football, in particular, can sometimes resemble a cult, and your star player, the cult leader. Black Christmas doesn't have just one killer, it has enough guys wielding knives to fill a starting lineup on one side of the ball. Since they're on the attack, these guys, you could say, are on offense. Frat brother/athlete, they comprise one binary, put in opposition of the lesser binary, a sorority sister/general female population, because although females are athletes, too, the sportswoman, inevitably, will be judge on her looks and body, uniform or no uniform, just like any garden variety coed. In what can only be described as a clarion call in protestation of the rollbacks made to Title IX, Kris comes to her best friend's rescue, bringing along some reinforcements, young women from other sorority houses, who send the frat brother/athlete reeling on defense. Eyes on the prize, Riley gets a hold of the Hawthorne founder's bust and, using football terminology, spikes the marble head, as if she reached the end zone and won one for the girls. An inky black substance oozes from the bust's eyes. What the heck is that? The oozing indigo could be construed as eye black, the substance that football players use to absorb the glare that impairs their vision. No woman wants to be violated. You need their consent. They can see that now.Come on, this is a sorority house, not a convent. That's a guy's line. And, true enough, a guy wrote it, but the politically incorrect words come out of a woman's mouth. Barb(Margot Kidder), playing provocateur with comments intended to shock, confuses liberation with victimhood. She shares the same attitude about the female libido as the house mother, Mrs. Mac(Anne Waldman); the attitude that all women are complicit. The house mother questions the girls' morals, not the men, like in the original Straw Dogs, directed by Sam Peckinpah, which links the way Amy(Susan George) flaunts herself by walking braless down a crowded street in broad daylight with an assault that, inexplicably, turn her on, midway through. These broads would h*** the Leaning Tower of Pisa, she claims. Mrs. Mac sounds like a college president. Barb sounds like one, too, downplaying the crime, when she tells Claire: You can't rape a townie, after her sorority sister expresses concern about an attack two weeks prior. What goes unsaid from Barb is a reactionary belief that the townie was asking for it. That townie was leading the guy on with her provocative clothing; all the oldies but goodies, the hits of yesteryear, supposedly. Alas, the song remains the same. Nobody says such thing in polite company, ****-shaming goes on behind closed doors. Documentary filmmakers Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering blow the doors open. Wide open; off its hinges. The Hunting Ground proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that while mum's the word among the gatekeepers, their deafening silence is the silence of obscene phone callers, circa 1974In 2019, these beliefs still prevail.

Most of the reviews seem to have a problem with the feminism. In my opinion this is done quite well actually, it isn't constant and adds to the characters. This mainly stems from the main character, Riley, who was raped, and her friends defending her and generally being modern, independent women.

This is the 3rd time this movie has been made and either one of the other two are better-the 1974 version is the best with the 2006 being ok. Another reason they were better? Maybe because they were rated R and this one is a PG-13. This one is also obviously a 'Woke Slasher Film' with a feminist slant but it's not done very well-it's a bad woke slasher film with the girls acting just as bad as the guys do. Imogen is a college girl that has been raped by a former college student that returns to the campus for some Christmas partying. Nobody except a few of her friends believed her story of being attacked so Imogen is kind of introverted and shy. Her friend Aleyse is just the opposite; she is a feminist trying to get a sexist teacher, Cary, banned from their school-she has lots of signatures on her petitions-and is not afraid of anyone.

Without the feminist messages it's at WORST a mediocre slasher film, definitely not warranting a 3.2/10. The film as a whole I found pretty good. Not the greatest but good nonetheless. I genuinely liked the main duo of girls, and I thought Riley's character and subsequent struggles were depicted in an important yet sensitive way. I loved the dynamic between her and her best friend Kris-Kris is a very very stark feminist and she's not afraid to be open about it-but Riley, and in turn the filmmakers are trying to tell the audience that that's not ALWAYS how things should be done. The speech Kris gives Riley about her assault and how it's changed her was very poignant and relatable as someone who has been through something similar. The kills weren't gory but I appreciated the Christmas-themed creativity of them all, especially the icicle (which was a missed opportunity in the 2006 remake with how it played out). The twist was fine, although I would've preferred for it to have stayed within the realm of reality and not supernatural. However, I understand the reasoning behind their choice so it doesn't bother me as much as it seems to bother everyone else. Finally, I thought the dialogue was very good and very realistic, being a college student with many female friends. The women's interactions felt real and genuine and I loved how easily you could feel the bond between some of them just through a few words of dialogue. The dialogue really helped paint Riley as a broken yet genuinely kind person and I appreciated that a lot.

I do think the director did a pretty decent job with some of the issues that alot of colleges today face. The whole feminist thing, the date rape and campus crusading occur everywhere.

I said dumb but very fun... Reveal made me eat those words! As soon as girls uncover the freaky killer and Riley says This is not blood I was freaking out! This were zombies!!!! Wow This was leading to some interesting stalker creepy movie but Black magic element really took me out of it. I like supernatural when done right but this wasn't done right. Moreover the final act was weird ! Riley somehow overpowers a well-built guy FROM CAPTURED POSITION! There's some rape victim empowerment that is great but there's no explanation. Acting is bland especially the Helena Actress is just plain bad! There's so many questions too. And weird how they killed her when what she did was just to obey they men. Wasn't it what they wanted? Landon stuff of him being captured, turned and then being un-turned is not explained either. In conclusion I despised the Black magic reveal and hoped the killing madness had a better reasoning. Visuals were okay and had some impressive diversions where we expect to see the police to come to our protagonist's sorority house but it is in reality a different house.

Critically speaking, the slasher film is probably the most reviled of all genres. However, even when compared to the reception of other slasher films, the new remake of Black Christmas has received an abysmal reception. The reviews for Black Christmas, both amongst professional film critics and online users, are amongst the worst I've ever read for a horror movie, so I expected a dismal product going into the theater. Maybe it was lowered expectations or maybe it's my love for all holiday horror movies, but I'm one of the few that found this new version fairly entertaining and not quite deserving of the hate it's been getting.The 2019 version of Black Christmas is no better or worse than most of the slasher remakes released over the past fifteen years or so. In fact, this version of Black Christmas is about on par with the previous remake from 2006. It's not particularly groundbreaking, nor is it a paint-by-the numbers remake. While it's true this is more of a feminist take on the slasher genre, which allows a somewhat unique perspective that makes it interesting to watch, it also contains a lot of problems that plague almost all slashers: underdeveloped characters, characters that make super illogical decisions just to serve the plot, and a few unnecessary, dumb plot twists (in this case, the twists are supernatural). These flaws didn't destroy the movie for me, but they are ones that seem like they easily could have been avoided had a bit more time and thought been put into the story. The film was supposedly shot and edited within six months. Perhaps if there was a longer post-production period, some of these problems could have been worked out.Despite the annoying slasher clich\u00e9s, Black Christmas gets a lot right through its talented, mostly unknown cast. Other than Cary Elwes and Imogen Poots, everyone else in the cast has little to no feature film work to their names. Slashers are notorious for horrible, flat acting but Black Christmas has an all-around likeable cast that give fine performances. Its essential in horror to care about the characters, and even if the characters here are somewhat undeveloped, the audience is at least sympathetic to them.Takal had a low budget to work with here, so Black Christmas doesn't look quite as polished or slick as the previous 2006 remake, but it also doesn't look as cheap as other movies released under the Blumhouse banner. The camera work is mostly well done, with care taken to pay homage to some of the stylistic touches of the original 1974 film. Thankfully, the film is devoid of the obvious CGI and quick editing that have become commonplace in the genre the last decade and a half. Overall, the direction is pretty solid and Takal proves to have an eye for horror.Time will tell if Black Christmas will be looked at more fondly in the future. The 2006 remake initially had a chilly reception upon its release, which seems to have become more favorable in recent years. I wouldn't be surprised if this version follows has a similar fate. For a film that has been so brutally received by both critics and audiences, Black Christmas was better than I expected. I can't call it a misunderstood masterpiece, but it's a fun Christmas horror film that definitely better than its current reputation. 6/10"}, {"id": 239, "text": "I admit, I have never seen the 1970's version of this movie.

The setting of both movies are the same dealing with someone/something killing sisters in a sorority house around christmas vacation. However, that's about it.

The pacing of the film is absolutely terrible, and the sorority girls spent over half of the film just screwing around before any of the action and scares actually start. Speaking of the scares, it was not scary at all. None of the jump scares work, and the film lacked anything creepy or disturbing.

I just think that if that is the route that you are going to take in a film, you should make sure that the movie is actually good, otherwise you're not really doing yourself any favors.

I fully enjoyed it and so did everyone else in that cinema. It's a slasher film - not a philosophical one so just do not expect too much from it. Also, embrace women trying to have their voice heard, it's almost 2020! I recommend it fully. Go with an open mind and enjoy it.

My MAIN problem is it shouldn't, much like the new Child's Play, call itself a remake. It has it's own unique story and is nothing like the far superior original. Also I feel like the movie played it too safe with the PG-13 rating. Do they give away too much in the trailer? Yes, but there's more to it. Does it villianize men? No, not at all! Is the ending a little cheesey and bonkers? Absolutely! If you do choose to watch the movie don't go in expecting a remake and maybe you'll like it.

Too stupid to be taken seriously, but not to the point you'd ignore its stupidity to make it fun. The movies apparently tries to take itself seriously, and one simply doesn't buy it. So, I wouldn't call it bad, because bad can be fun. It's stupid. Take it from a person who normally likes movies that get a lot of hate, such as Star Wars I, Ghostbusters, the forgotten sequel of Carrie. Black Christmas is definitely not worth your time. Look up the story online, with spoilers, and you'll see what I mean. If you really want to watch Black Christmas, go for the 2006 version. It's bad, but not stupid bad, it's kinda fun bad.

In light of this I am going to mention some positives, you know, to kind of like hand out a participation trophy for the effort...To start, Caleb Eberhardt did a masterful job in his role as the docile non threatening effeminate male. He completely nailed it! And what can I say about Imogen Poots? She was cast as the lesbian victim and was so convincing I had to pinch myself just in case I was dreaming. Others like Kris, Marty, and Jesse were the typical window dressing these types of movies often provide and they were absolutely perfect.

Plus, the cutting for a PG-13 rating means we probably lost some great scenes that would've given the film more kick. For these reasons, it loses two stars.On the upside: there's a core to the film's message about how women are viewed and treated, especially in certain areas of society like higher education, that ring true. Anyone who went to a US university in the past thirty years would have at least heard of sexual assualt on their campus, and without fail, 90% or more went without investigation and villainizing the victim. This true life story core aspect turns the film from the 1974 trash slasher to a contemporary revenge horror. It's clear from the reviews that a lot of people are incapable of grasping this. Everything about the trailers indicated this would be an avenging lens film. It delivers on that promise. Of course, those who have glorified the 1974 film for it's view of women as trash are going to hate this and be the loudest voices on the internet because we all know that's what the internet is for now: a wild west for trolls to spew their hate of women and minorities.Getting back to the film, the emotional delivery of the leads is fully believable. Every aspect of the Riley's PTSD triggered responses are like watching someone in real time reliving their trauma. Never seen that? Well, you probably won't appreciate the delivery the same.The sisterhood over self mentality is what almost gets Riley killed, which made me mad, but it further drives the point that compassionate, protector personalities are driven first by the need to protect the herd, even at their own expense.The black magic use is a stretch and probably wasn't necessary, except to pose the question of how even a good man like Landon could be turned into a monster, although he did continue to resist. It further drives home the question of whether the pledges fully knew what they were doing and deserved to die alongside the fraternity brothers who used the pledges as weapons.If you roll your eyes as Me Too and any other movement intended to bring justice for victim's and survivors of violence, this isn't for you. The trailer made it perfectly clear that this is women standing up and fighting back. If you honestly weren't smart enough to grasp that, that's no one else's fault except possibly your parents.

That's just the outline of 2019's PG-13 rated, Black Christmas (uh oh on the neutered, PG-13 rating).Christmas starts out like just another terror fest until frat boy mumbo jumbo and pledge manipulation take over. Hazing, possession, the Me Too movement, harassing DMs, and the smearing of black goo are also mainstays (hence the movie's title).Black Christmas, while released on Friday the 13th, is the second remake of a 1974 film of the same name. And it's also just another horror flick in which you know who's gonna survive, who is not gonna survive, and who's dumb enough to think the authorities could ever be useful.Christmas is directed by New Jersey native and third time helmer, Sophia Takal. Also an actress of various independent films, Takal shoots Black Christmas like a 70's snuff pic cloaked in contemporary social media. There's some zoom in shots, some zoom out shots, a lot of dark hues, and plenty of earthiness. I've never actually seen the original Black Christmas but I've viewed various clips. Takal with similar opening credit titles and a need for present day nostalgia, tries to recreate the look of a cult vehicle that came out forty-plus years ago.Black Christmas, which features a likable cast including Cary Elwes and Imogen Poots (Poots might be a little too old to play a college student), is like The Skulls meets Urban Legend meets Scream. All you gotta do is dress it up holiday-style. What Christmas lacks is scares, some actual gore, some visible kills, and a need to be indispensable.

Some women form a singing group and play a prank on the Alpha Male students of a fraternity, outing their abusive culture.

Some good horror scenes especially when the arrows start flying and an icicle is used as a deadly weapon.

And the reviews saying it didn't have a plot are incorrect, to a degree. There was a plot, a paper thin BS plot, but it was plot nonetheless. I understand this is meant to be a female empowerment movie, and that's great. I love strong female characters. One of my favorite movies is the Descent. However, the antagonists in this movie are a fraternity of men who feel that women are gaining too much ground, fighting for their rights and messages to such an extent, and need to be taken down a peg. They feel women's rightful place is at men's beck and call. That, to me, is the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen in cinema in the last ten years, at least. I can't believe that this even got greenlit. I see on social media about women's strength, their quest for equality, and I think how far we have come from the archaic thoughts of long ago. Then, I go see Black Christmas, and I leave the movie ashamed I spent money on it. To put this into perspective, I'm a Regal theater goer on the unlimited movie plan, so I spent a whopping 50 cents to see it and I almost asked for my money back. The only reason I didn't ask for a refund was the performances were ok. The acting is not going to win awards but the cast worked alright with the POS they were given. Oh and not only was women's equality peed on, but there was a subplot about the lead character getting raped by one of the frat guys, cuz why not? I guess they figured they were already getting their licks in, so why not go for broke. I hope that guys will walk out of there as insulted and disappointed as I did, realizing that this picture and it's ideas belong in the 1950s or something. But I know there are still small-minded individuals who will watch this and think it's the right idea. Now maybe the intent to show the women rising up at the end to fight back their oppressors was supposed to be poignant and uplifting, but the delivery was not good enough for this to be represented. What it showed at the end was nothing more than payback or vengeance. There was no empowerment or positive message here.

Horror movies are few and far between, if you're like me and love movies so much you'll watch anything decent. Watch this movie! I am not a movie snob so be warned, of course I love amazing movies like There Will Be Blood, but I also like movies like the roommate and Pet sematary (all of them).So all in all, these negative reviews are for die hard fans. But if you need a decent horror movie to watch you've never seen, give it a go. Definitely not a 3.5 out of 10 lol that's so ridiculous.

There's no mystique. There's no mystery. Considering its namesake, it doesn't even seem to attempt to try and retain any of the key components that makes the original film such a classic.For starters, the film is incredibly flat. The direction and cinematography is dull and uninspired, and the film feels completely lifeless as a result, lacking in any mood and suspense almost entirely, and substituting with way too many cheap jump scares.The script is just as awkward, with unbelievably cringeworthy dialogue, unlikeable characters, with them making too many questionable decisions, and frankly, it asks a little too much for suspension of disbelief.As a remake, it misses the mark horrendously. As a horror film, it leaves a lot to be desired. It may not be a bad film, but it's an incredibly boring one."}, {"id": 313, "text": "The original Black Christmas is a cult favorite, if only because of Olivia Hussey and the little well-known anecdote that it inspired John Carpenter to write Halloween. Sadly, since the 70's the teen slasher genre has been done to death (no pun intended), and whilst films like You're Next and Happy Death Day attempt to breathe life into a stale formula, we haven't really seen a great slasher film this side of the noughties.This brings us to 2019 and the latest Black Christmas remake, which desperately wants you to take notice of its existence. It wants you to know that it's sincere, and hip and cool because it taps into the feminist movement. The first remake of Black Christmas was torn apart by critics in 2006 for its gratuitous violence and paper-thin female characters. The latest remake, helmed by Sophia Takal (who also contributed to the screenplay) fixes that by giving the female characters empowerment and an agenda. Think Charlies Angels with a bit of When a Stranger Calls and half a dozen fairy lights thrown into a slop bucket and you sort of get the idea. I am all for strong female characters. Laurie Rhodes from the aforementioned Halloween and Ripley from Alien are just two classic examples of empowered female leads in a horror franchise. Both of these characters are constantly one step ahead of the (usually male) antagonist and it reminds us that female characters are not only equal to their counterparts, but they often become a force to be reckoned with.Black Christmas (2019) spends so much time telling us that the female characters are awesome that it forgets to develop any of their actual character. Most of the female characters might as well be referred to as Girl 1 and Girl 2 because their sole reason for being on screen is to be quickly bumped off in festive fashion. In a film that is clearly influenced heavily by the MeToo movement, to have such weak characters is detrimental to the whole saccharine message the film wants to convey.The male characters, most of whom are Fraternity Jocks are presented as either creepy, misogynistic or both. This film wants us to root for the female characters by forcing us to swallow the idea that the male characters are all wicked and degrading jerks. There is even a jolly festive song about sexual assault thrown in for good measure. This all makes no sense when a film about empowerment of the gender resorts to doing the very thing it is supposedly criticizing to get its point across.Of the film itself, Black Christmas (2019) is decidedly dull. The original was a creepy little penny-dreadful type chiller. The remake was gratuitous fluff but it at least gave gore-hounds something to lap up. This one is both bloodless (physically and metaphorically) and is about as scary as a Christmas candy cane. The script feels like something out of a high school amateur production and most of the cast overact and chew the scenery. To achieve a PG-13 rating the violence was toned down so much that this feels like something off The Haunting Hour. All of the kills are off screen and so much time is spent with long and drawn out conversations between the female leads that even the short running time seems to drag on, and on and on. The film takes itself far too seriously, but then pulls the rug from under our feet right at the end when the twist is revealed. I won't spoil what happens, but the supernatural element that they tacked on did not make any sense and just made the whole thing even more ridiculous.Watch the original. Heck, even go back to the 2006 remake, but skip this turkey."}, {"id": 314, "text": "No one was expecting a remake of Black Christmas, nor was anyone asking for it. And its sudden announcement in June was like snow on one's head. What kind of interest can there be in the cult proto-slasher of 1974? Especially after the notorious 2006s remake, which many still either recall as a nightmare or consider it a comedy because of its torture, plot holes, and the ridiculous killer's background? These two Black Christmases would remain a typical tandem of the 80s original / XXI century studio alteration, but...The rights to the concept were bought by Blumhouse with director Sophia Takal and screenwriter April Wolfe to lead the newest incarnation. Takal had previously shot some lazy indie thriller about mean female friendship and a full-length episode of the anthology series Into the Dark ...also about mean female friendship. And with New Year's entourage. Obviously, everything starts there. These two saw the opportunity to depict all of their modern ideas, only with some snow and toothless scrimers.Don't try to find any tribute to the original (kitty Claudette instead of 1974s cat Claude) and an attempt to strangle one of the villains with polyethylene. Instead, there's a bunch of blank college girls, one of whom, Riley (Imogen Poots), suffers from emotional trauma after being raped by one of the frat bros (Ryan McIntire), who escaped punishment and even dared to return to college. But the girls have worse problems: the tough student Chris (Aleyse Shannon) demands the dismissal of one of the old-school professor for his boomer-ish way of teaching. While Professor Gelson (Cary Elwes) is trolling the suffragists of the 21st century by quoting the well-known anti-feminist Camille Paglia, female students begin to disappear. And if nobody gave a crap about the horribly acting blonde girl from literally every BC trailer (Lucy Curry), the further disappearances begin to slowly alarm. The police shrugs and isn't eager to do anything (by the way, another curtsy to the original), so Riley begins her own investigation.Takal and Wolfe are as humble as a jackhammer when it's about the man which are either evil or stupid. An malicious cultist professor with his toxic bloodhound on a chain, annoying boyfriends who can either start a fight out of nothing or stutter while talking to a girl. The authors' ideas ends so quickly that they even use supernatural power, led by the late founder of the college - a white privileged slaver man of his 1800s, who was sure that women would occupy his stronghold of knowledge one day, and then the males must be able to defend... defend what? Oh, sorry, they never explain it anyway. They just hate women, that's all, bite it. No Billy, no Agnes, no real freedom from male opinion. Somewhere in 1974, Jess Bradford sighs heavily while firmly announcing to her boyfriend the decision to have an abortion. Turns out that women's rights aren't about freedom of choice, but about driving away the white men science from universities.Black Christmas doesn't want to be a horror movie. In fact, it doesn't want to be a film. But it wants to be an essay, which for whatever reason was wrapped in Christmas light. An essay, albeit with a budget of $ 5,000,000, is not capable of being exciting and thrilling. Even in others negative reviews, only Imogen Poots can be praised for the role of the emotionally injured, but strong by her spirit, but she is underestimated by the scriptwriters that did not want to give her character some decent development. Cary Elves wasn't told this isn't another Saw, and therefore something like game over is about to burst from his terribly taut smile. The rest of the cast is a typical cannon fodder, as one of the characters (Lily Donoghue, who deserves more screen time tbh) behaves so cringy while interacting with the intruder as if she wanted to end all of this as soon as possible. It's also hilarious that there are two sorority houses, and the second one is shown briefly in the midst of their own attack. All for the sake of the final fight, so that there could me more female combat extras.The film is mostly praised for showing certain socially disturbing topics familiar to many... well, feminists. Campus abuse and rapes were described in the great The Hunting Ground, and the pointless gory gender violence was shown in epic Assassination Nation. What do we get in Black Christmas for millennials? The fear of walking down the street alone at night, the keys compressed in a shaking fist, and the unexplained progressive ladies' annoyance with the not all men.Black Christmas is a boring, bloodless thriller that is radical in its beliefs and incapable of accepting a bit of a different opinion, shot for the fun of snowflakes and all kinds of warriors for the rights of all disenfranchised. Fortunately, this movie ceases to be associated with its predecessors as soon as it changes its name."}, {"id": 315, "text": "Bob Clark's underrated 1974 masterpiece, Black Christmas, was a shining example of how to make a horror movie with a deep message attached to it. Sophia Takal's remake is a political message with a terrible horror movie attached to it.This is a film with the subtlety of a man being run over by a pink Greyhound bus. Characters in this film talk entirely in buzzwords and taglines, and if you make the mistake of going to see this then you better get used to it, because the filmmakers were far more concerned with getting their agenda across than making a horror movie. Large chunks of time pass where it feels like the film is far too focused on beating the audience over the head with its message that it forgets to be scary, and once it actually tries, it falls flat on its face. Of course, it doesn't help that this movie clearly got axed hard in the editing room to get a PG-13 rating, leaving very minimal onscreen bloodshed to make the final cut. The plot is also so wildly different from the original (a simple look at the trailer gives that away) that aside from a wink or two here and there, this really is just a remake in name alone. For that, the 2006 remake of Black Christmas at least deserves a touch of credit in retrospect for trying to show some respect for the source material. Sure, it's still a very flawed film in its own right, but at least it actually resembled a film.Imogen Poots and Cary Elwes are the only reasons why I'm even giving this a 2/10 instead of 1, because bless their hearts, they were trying."}, {"id": 316, "text": "We live in an age where even remakes get remakes. That is the case with Black Christmas. I liked the original enough for an aged slasher from the 70s. Even the remake, which I re-watched a few years back was mildly entertaining. So I thought, another update while wildly unnecessary, would still be a good watch. Boy, was I wrong. This film is so boring and all around terrible that is very much so the worst movie I've seen in 2019. The film is about a group of sorority sisters who want to bond over the holidays and also spend time to uncover the men in a local frat who have committed crimes against them. However, it turns out members of the sorority start getting murdered right after receiving texts from someone impersonating the controversial founder of the college that they attend. This film stars Imogen Poots, Cary Elwes, and a bunch of terrible actors no one cares about. Not only is this film mind numbingly boring for an hour, its overbearing theme of modern feminist and touching on modern women v men issues completely takes away from anything the film wants to build up. It was so off putting, the dialogue ludicrously bad. I feel like this script was written by a high school student who likes to go to parties, and goes on Twitter to glaze over whatever people are outraged about.The acting is no good, although Poots tried her very best. The scares are so predictable, there's no interest in who the killer is because I was so far removed from interested. You can make a good film that is strong on feminsm without being so on the nose about it! These characters are all so shallow and blend into one another.Also, the plot gets so horrendously bad as it goes along holy cow.

When 2006's unnecessary trashy remake got critically slammed, it was a big surprise producer Jason Blum announced another remake to be in development with a more modern twist. Let's just say, this version is nothing like the previous two and could easily have been released under an original title instead of relying on some sort of legacy the '70s film has built throughout the decades.Everything starts off with a pretty basic premise we're all familiar with. A group of female students are stalked by a stranger during their Christmas break. That is until the young sorority pledges discover that the killer is part of an underground college conspiracy. But as the trailer kind of spoiled to whomever watched it, there's not just one killer, it's most of the young men that are part of this fraternity as some sort of hazing ritual.Vibrators for secret Santa and one too many threatening texts coming from the long gone Hawthorne college founder later, girls are being killed offscreen - because this film is being released in Australia with an M-rating - and thus no blood shall be spilled. Unlike some mysterious black goo that appears everywhere the stalkers pay a visit.While Kris (Aleyse Shannon) pisses people, excuse me, boys, off by going around campus with a petition to fire professor Gelson (Cary Elwes) for his misogynistic literary choices in class, Riley (Imogen Poots) is dealing with her own personal demons. When the cause of all this revisits campus for the annual Christmas talent show, it's up to Riley to face her fears and stand up for what's right and call out the issues this school has been facing for far too long. With the help of her other sorority sisters Marty (Lily Donoghue) and Jess (Brittany O'Grady) she will have to fight off a horde of angry, blood thirsty, wannabe alphas and show this college how girls, I mean WOMEN, really fight.Sophia Takal's (Always Shine) take on the slasher genre is both unique and ballsy. Blum producing a project with such a loud voice, is not only promising, but also shows that the big screen is a place for original stories to be told. The execution however is lacking something more. Takal and fellow screenwriter April Wolfe (Widower) have a lot to say and aren't subtle about it, which is incredible in every way of the word. But Black Christmas doesn't deliver on any other level. It promises a slasher survival film and what we get is a social commentary on white supremacist patriarchy and smart women fighting against racism and sexism. Hands down one of the strangest and empowering things you'll see this year, yet it's forgettable and mostly disappointing because there's nothing else to support those important words. A missed opportunity in what could've made Black Christmas the new standard in horror filmmaking. The horror genre struggles as it is. If Takal and Wolfe gave the horror aspect of their story more attention, so it could be just as strong as its feminist standpoint, the film would've been that puppy under the Christmas tree you've always dreamt of.It's also important to note that this film shows how awful women are treated by men that don't understand the issue of sexual assault, consent and concerns. Kris' passion for equality in the film is engrossingly fascinating. It's also Aleyse Shannon (Charmed) who surprises and jumps in front of lead actress Imogen Poots (I Kill Giants), to steal the spotlight, and deservedly so. She brings a natural charisma and dominating energy to her character, while everyone else is barely present to even care if they'll make it to the end or not.This remake would definitely have benefitted from an MA15-rating to amp everything up and raise the stakes. It's all just a bit too tame for a film of this genre and although Takal's efforts don't go unnoticed, I sure hope she gets to direct and write something with just as much freedom as she clearly had on this project. Despite the absurdness of everything else that happens on screen, unfortunately Black Christmas is nothing more than a bag of coal on a sad Christmas morning."}, {"id": 320, "text": "I don't hate this film because it's a tasteless remake.

Imogen Poots is a great actress but she needs to be in great horror films like 28 Weels Later, Green Room and Fright Night. Everyone else is just meh especially the chacrater of Kris who just makes my blood boil.There are few good moments here and there but after the opening it just gets worse. Its rather tame. It lacks the thrills and the scares.The director says this is a fiercely feminist film and that's not a bad thing but in this case it is. It should be story first, message second. There is a difference between being left-wing and being woke. I hate talking about things like that but sometimes I have to. It destroys films.It's a bad film.

Female revenge and empowerment are satisfying themes, and basing a horror film on campus rape and toxic frats touches on a very real, frightening, and topical nerve. However, this loose reboot takes it too far, and goes quickly from feminist to just plain sexist, thereby destroying the intended effect. (Feminist movies are great. This is SEXIST.)Kris is by far the most annoying character I have seen for some time. I'm fairly certain I heard her advocating that there should be more TRANS AUTHORS in the CLASSIC LITERATURE curriculum. It's the earliest indication that the writers are creating straw men to make their points. Speaking of men, the only two good male characters are shown to be easy victims of brainwashing into their true natures as men, which of course involves aggression and violence towards women.The director has stated she wants the audience to feel seen. I didn't feel seen. I just felt misrepresented by two-dimensional women. The characters are so insufferable that their plight means nothing. Obviously they're meant to be the heroines, and we're supposed to root for them because they're outspoken against white men and they STAND UP FOR THEIR SISTERS. That is literally where the characterization ends; no one bothered to give them personalities. They are all slightly different shades of the same person. At one point, one girl apologizes to her friend for dragging her boyfriend along everywhere and says I like it best when it's just us four girls. I must not be a feminist if I enjoy hanging out with my boyfriend!(Side note: in the trivia section, it's stated the stage performance in this film was intended to be the feminist answer to the misogynistic Mean Girls. You know, Mean Girls -- the movie about women becoming comfortable with their true selves and learning to love one another as they are, instead of competing and hating. Again, point: missed.)But let's get into this movie's most egregious offence, which is that it's not even high quality horror. I love horror and watch it almost exclusively. This is bad horror. Dollar store bad. It's cheap with the scares, and for all its attempted subversions, it's really bland and basic. Filmmakers like Jordan Peele have proven recently that it's possible to address serious social themes while terrifying your audience. To do this, the writing needs to be strong, the acting emotive, and the directing creative. This movie has none of those elements.So, yeah. I hated this movie. I'm glad others hate it as well.

The movie is clearly sending an anti-abuse message, but their inclusion of rape as a plotpoint was incredibly tasteless and seemingly only included to have a clear message. Sexual abuse and rape especially is extremely hard to write. This movie failed on a pretty huge level. Everyone knows that sexual abuse is horrible. Rape should be handled carefully in stories specifically focused on the suffering and healing process of victims, not as a tacky add-on to a slasher which uses it as shock factor to make the culty bad guys extra evil.This movie left me uncomfortable on all the wrong ways.

No. But is it the atrocious mess that people who haven't even seen it are claiming? No, not at all.The truth is that Black Christmas is a very topical film that was clearly made by women, for women. And there's nothing wrong with that. Yes, in a few parts the social commentary felt a bit heavy handed. But guess what? The original Black Christmas also contains content regarding women being women that shocked audiences at the time with its frank, in your face nature.This modern reimagining of Black Christmas has many nods to the original while still telling an original story. There's much social commentary to uncover about toxic masculinity, women sticking together instead of tearing each other down, etc.It starts a bit slow, but the tension increases around the halfway point. Once the killer gets into the house, the movie kicks into high gear.I saw this in a packed theater with people of all ages, genders, and ethnicities. What I observed was that most of the men looked uncomfortable several times. Meanwhile, most of the women were so into this revenge fantasy that they cheered numerous times.Overall, the audience was engaged. People screamed. People laughed. People shouted at the characters. Many, many viewers walked out humming, whistling, or singing the movie's catchy rendition of a classic Christmas song.Those who feel threatened by a movie for calling out rape culture need to take a good long look at why they're upset. Those who've been hating on this movie just for being rated PG-13 are showcasing a completely disingenuous take on the genre as a whole. There have been many beloved horror films that were rated PG-13.Yes, a few scenes were cut short to get a PG-13 rating. But the movie is still ultimately satisfying and a lot of fun. And those who demand an R-rated film will almost certainly get the original cut when the movie comes out on DVD.Purists who are mad that this isn't a direct remake of the original need to give themselves permission to view this movie on its own merits.

This movie might has well have put the words all men are bad across the screen in flashing lights. There were a couple moments that I really liked, such as the main character's relationship with her creepy old professor, and someone being killed with a plastic bag over their head (great callback to the original). Other than that though, this movie was so forced, and even included a previously well liked male character starting an argument with his girlfriend and yelling NOT ALL MEN. It's just so heavy handed. They could have made the very same points more subtly &amp; used it to further the story of the characters, but instead it just turns into this random cult story that made me instantly not take it seriously. For me to say a movie is too man-hating says a lot, but I'm glad I got this movie with a free Redbox code instead of paying for it."}, {"id": 328, "text": "The trailer made it look like this would be a fun, sorority girls, slasher, kicking butt movie. The minute I rented it I felt I'd been tricked by the trailer's slick editing and I was in for a super low budget film in the hands of an amateur. Why remake a super low budget movie with another super low budget movie? That makes no sense. I though this would be a fun upgrade of a fun '70s? '80s? slasher. Nope. It's just a bad student film.Like, was there even a cinematographer on this film? A set designer? Who did hair and makeup? The actresses? It was very hard to find any production value whatsoever other than there are actors, a script, sets, a director...and, I don't know, I'm not sure if there was any other crew on this film. They didn't even have music for the girl's Christmas musical number even though there was a guy, Landon, who was clearly supposed to be a DJ. It says it was a $5 million budget but my guess is the director embezzled that money or was so incompetent she blew it...who knows, but it wasn't on the film. $5 million is not a lot but it's not a little, and it can certainly do a lot more than is shown on screen. And given Blumouse gives a set budget everyone must adhere to, plenty have managed to make good films on a small amount. Like, this wasn't even as good as a low budget SyFy movie that revolves around mutant animals.I was mostly confused by how bad it was. I've come to expect more from Blumhouse. The Hunt, Happy Death Day, Ready or Not, Fantasy Island, Get Out, Truth or Dare, all very entertaining films by Blumhouse of varying levels. I thought wrongly this would be on the same level. Imogen Poots was fine, everyone else was fairly terrible. I felt more like they pulled people out of an acting class, said there would be no pay but they would at least get Kind bars and water from craft service, and a credit on a film. The script is bad as is the directing, or lack there of. Did they have lights? It's the flattest film I've ever seen and the colors just all mashed together. I simply don't know how this woman was allowed to direct a film. It was basically, an embarrassing step for women. Clearly she's somebody's niece 'cause I don't know how else she was allowed to direct or even write a film.Blumhouse seemed to be on a roll until this film. A major disappointment."}, {"id": 329, "text": "This version of Black Christmas is the third film with the same name and same BASIC plot. The first came out in 1994, another in 2006 and now this one. However, I really am not sure how much this new film is a remake...it's more a massive reworking of the old plots. So, instead of a mindless film with lot of females being killed, this time it's a lot of politically correct feminist women being killed. And, I honestly think this strong woke feminist theme in the movie is why the film is now on the infamous IMDB Bottom 100 List.This infamous list SHOULD represent movies which are horribly made...films which are amateurish, with horrid acting and inept direction. Films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Robot Monster, Birdemic and The Room easily fit this bill. Oddly, the only one of these four that DID make the list is The Room.Instead, many of the films on the list simply made it there because they were featured on MSTK3000 or have an offensive and irritating message or irritating people (such as Paris Hilton). Some films clearly deserve inclusion for this reason...such as the Human Centipede films..which feature some bad acting but mostly are gross murder porn films with no socially redeeming values. But many don't deserve the inclusion and a worst of list should NOT be because you disagree with the philosophy or politics of a film or hate an actor or actress....and I think this is exactly why the 2019 version of Black Christmas made the list.Because Black Christmas is on the Bottom 100, I initially assumed it would technically be a mess and I was ready to hate it. It wasn't and I didn't. The cinematography was actually exceptional...with a moving camera that WASN'T the god-awful 'shaky cam' but which made it look as if the camera was organic...a part of the scenery. It was lovely and showed a lot of skill. The acting also was pretty good...and the direction was also very good.Now I am NOT saying it's a great film. Much of it does seem heavy-handed and the feminist message hits you over the head like a sledgehammer. But does this mean the film should be flooded with 1 votes as well as one to two sentence reviews that say, essentially, that 'it sucked'?! Of course not...this is slamming a film because you don't like the message or messenger. This would be like me giving 1s to all the films of a few actors simply because they are people I don't like. Too many, apparently, hated the heavy-handed feminist message of Black Christmas and decided, en masse, to attack the movie. As I said, technically, the film IS well made.,,but I've seen such attacks before on IMDB. Chances are, as a result of my review, I'll receive 1001 'not helpfuls'.So apart from being technically well made, I do agree that the writing certainly could be better. Most viewers simply go to movies to be entertained...and this is especially true of the slasher films which are notorious for being rather mindless. So I could imagine MANY folks going to the theaters to see a Freddy Kruger or Jason sort of film being mad because they felt they didn't get what they expected. For some, this could be a positive selling point...but for many they probably just wanted to see mindless violence. Or, they wanted to see a real remake of Black Christmas. For me, none of this is something I particularly want....I hate mindless violence and preachy plots and non-remakes. I just saw the film because of the controversy about it and because, oddly, I try to see all the Bottom 100 I can (95 and counting as of today!).I also occasionally hated the writing because some scenes didn't make a lot of sense. A great example is the initial killing, as an icicle is plunged through a woman's rib cage...which is impossible, as the icicle would simply shatter since the rib cage is so much stronger and harder than a piece of ice. I think the only way this MIGHT happen is if an icicle is shot at a person at several hundred miles per hour....and even then, I am doubtful. Or, if it's inserted between the ribs. Additionally, the whole 'Satanic-like possession' and black blood angle in the film also was dumb...and actually diluted the feminist message of the film and was also just silly. Apparently such Satanic-like plot devices are common in the genre...but it really worked poorly here.The bottom line is that this film isn't great and has some problems but is certainly NOT worthy of the dubious distinction of inclusion on the IMDB list."}, {"id": 330, "text": "2019 Black Christmas, directed by Sophia Takal, was a very bad, predictable reboot of a reboot (if you will), with CRYSTAL CLEAR messages, that they jam it down your throat every twenty minutes; it gets so damn frustrating! This movie screams Team Feminism.There really was no definite story here; it played off of the few messages they kept mentioning as often as possible, and the boring, one dimensional characters, that lead me to keep looking at my watch to see how long was left. The screenplay by Sophia Takal &amp; April Wolfe was bone dry, to where it became hard to keep my eyes on the screen. Takal spent so much time developing these pointless characters! They all might as well have been cut out of an oak tree, that's how wooden they were; On top of that, there wasn't even an exciting villain, or really a villain at that!The action was so cheesy, I could've slapped two pieces of bread in between it, and put it in the toaster oven and called it a grilled cheese. The kills were so boring and unoriginal, and for the most part, absent from the flick. There was no real build up for anything. Everything just happened out of spite.The cinematography by Mark Schwartzbard was too dark and dreary. I actually had to squint a few times to try to get a better look at what was going on.The only few good things about this movie, was the release date, and the duration. I couldn't have sat there for another minute. I am genuinely mad that I gave this movie eight dollars, of my hard earned money. I sincerely hated this movie to where I'd consider starting a boycott.

I should have listened to them. Yeah, this movie is pretty bad. It's the ultimate exercise in Girls vs Boys with less than satisfactory results. Why, oh why, do movies like this even have to be made in the first place? I guess if we didn't have underachieving movies, we wouldn't appreciate the truly good ones as much.The story centers around our main character, Riley Stone (Imogen Poots), the silent type ... a recluse who would rather sit in the corner unnoticed than take any chances. As the story develops, we find out that Riley wasn't always this way. In fact, she was quite the opposite until she fell victim to a local frat boy, who took advantage of her in the worst possible way. While this is going on, a killer begins to pick off sorority girls one by one until it becomes obvious that there is some sort of strange conspiracy going on. Riley and her sorority sisters are all in danger and need to find out the reasons before it's too late.Well, where do I start? To begin with, the production values are very low here. It felt like someone was walking around filming the scenes with their smart phone and then it was cut later with no success. This, in turn, gave us below par cinematography and editing. The direction was okay, but the acting didn't measure up - except for Imogen Poots, who really seemed to care about her part in the movie. Even Cary Elwes drops the ball here. And the premise behind it all was absurd.This movie is an atrocity. The only reason it gets a 2 star rating instead of the lowest 1 star, is because of Imogen Poots. She made a few scenes interesting and worth watching - but seriously, that's it. This is a pass. Believe me, if you never see this movie, you aren't missing out on anything. It was a waste of my time. 2 stars out of 10."}, {"id": 332, "text": "The scariest thing about this movie is that someone in Hollywood green lit the script for it instead of asking the question why is it called Black Christmas when it has nothing to do with the 1974 original or the 2006 remake the movie was doomed the second the title was set in stone I judged it as a remake and so did everyone else the movie could of just been called (A night on Sorority Row) and no one would of cared.The movie itself follows a group of sorority girls who when a killer threatens to kill them decide to stop playing the vitims and start becoming the final girls that every classic horror movie has just a little smarter and a little more collected.I am all for a movie that has a strong smart and capable female cast that people can root for and show that women can be just as bad ass in horror movies than any man can be but sadly this just isn't the right movie to do it in Black Christmas is an already well known and much loved horror classic and rule number one in any horror movie sequel or remake is don't mess with the original.The cast do a great job and try there best in this movie which they deserve recognition and respect for doing it's just a shame the movie was doomed from the start with a different name the same cast and some script re-writing it might of been looked at differently.I don't recommend watching this movie in theatre's it's not worth the price of a ticket as it will soon be available on streaming services and on DVD but if you have never seen the original or the 2006 remake and your of that new generation you might enjoy it but for anyone who loves the original steer clear of it you won't enjoy it."}, {"id": 333, "text": "I wish 'Black Christmas (2019)' was better than it is. It has so much untapped potential, often teetering on greatness, and its unashamedly feminist message is fantastic. Sadly, though its heart is in the right place, it's rather flawed, skimping on the scares and being marked with several clear signs of some sort of studio interference. It feels like it's been cut down for its PG-13 rating (which is apparently what actually happened), with its quickly-cut-away-from violence being shaky and its dialogue often being obviously dubbed ('jerking off' becomes 'junking off', for example). A lot of the storytelling is also conveyed via audio looping, which is one of the classic traits of post-production rejigging. The end result is poorly paced and has a strange structure. It also features a few nearly nonsensical sequences that must've made sense in an earlier cut and takes a bizarre turn towards its finale that threatens to derail the whole endeavour. At one point, it seems to posit that sexism is the form of some sort of supernatural intervention, which would kind of ruin the entire point of the piece; there should be no excuse for sexism, no it wasn't really me, I was possessed. Thankfully, the flick manages to sidestep this possible issue and is, ultimately, wholly on the right side of history. It isn't subtle, but it's about time someone literally smashed the patriarchy on screen. It's nearly satirical at times, with its villains earnestly complaining about the supposed marginalisation of straight white men, but it's played straight for the most part. It's at its best when focusing on the strong sisterhood between its leads, which feels genuine and celebratory. Sometimes, it bites off slightly more than it can chew and struggles to know what to do with the excess. Perhaps its biggest issue is that it isn't scary (at least there are no 'false' jump scares, though). It's not boring but it isn't particularly entertaining, either. It's not bad, by any means. It is underwhelming, however. It has a good message and feels so close to being a great vehicle for it. It's refreshingly bold and it knows exactly what it's doing when it comes to its feminism. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem quite as confident in its filmmaking. It's a decent effort, but not much more.

It is a fast paced little flick with a little bit of subverted tropes to keep it feeling a little fresh. This is by no means a top-notch horror film either. But just like the 80s when the classics that are now being remade or deemed as terrible, these are their modern-day equivalent. if one goes and trying to over analyze every little aspect of the movie and compare it to the original 1974 film, you are obviously going to have a bad time.Horror fans are honestly the most spoiled of all genre fans. They scream they want content like the old days, and when they get it, they throw it aside like a petulant little child. Then when they ask for original content and somebody puts something of substance out, it gets dissected unnecessarily into the most my new pieces so that I can be compared to other cinema and rendered derivative or copying something else. Viewers need to make up their minds and simply take what is happening at face value...People just like you love and appreciate the same films that you watched, but they wanna bring it to the modern age. If that doesn't show a sincere love for the art of filmmaking that they would imitate another artists work-which is the sincerest form of flattery-they need a reality check.In all honesty this is a fun little flick with a little bit of a nasty little twist thrown on it. It has some fun, sick little moments with genuine flair, if you're willing to look past the simplicity of the plot, save for one big change as to the origin of the villain, you will have an exciting time that's by no means going to break the barrier of new age horror, but usher in a sort of love letter to the craft of slasher film creation. Keep it simple, keep it fun, keep it rolling, and just keep it entertaining.In the end, that's all we want isn't it? To be entertained? If one goes into this movie expecting absolutely nothing they will get their moneys worth for a little adrenaline kicking feminist themed horror that throws modern fears of girls who this time around aren't going to grovel and plead to not die; they're going to fight back and show they aren't going to submit to death just yet."}, {"id": 335, "text": "Don't watch this trash.

Feminist ideologies empower women to reclaim their power and assert their worth. Unfortunately, most of the ideas in Black Christmas are half-baked. The feminism is mostly shallow and reduces several of the characters to man-haters, when the reality of feminism is much more than that. The sisterhood between the characters is also weak.The biggest disappointments about the film: poor pacing and lame kills - the first half of the film was particularly slow. There was also little tension, and most of the characters were undeveloped. The film also features one of my most aggravating horror cliches: a villain with a mask being incapacitated and no one bothering to remove the mask. The film loses 3 points for that alone.Strengths: the movie showed some promise during the sorority house invasion scene, when the women banded together and fought back, but that was short lived.

Written by Sophia Takal and April Wolfe Oh boy... Let me start off by saying that I really don't like PG-13 horror movies. You have to cut the suspense at the knees. Horror is about expecting the unexpecting. PG-13 puts a cap on what can be shown or even implied. It is especially devastating to a slasher film. It neuters the film.So this movie is already off to a weak start. The opening kill of the movie was a bloodless affair. Girl gets stabbed in the chest with the flimsiest looking icicle. No blood. Killer drags her away and the camera is trained on the entire time. No blood. I don't understand the point of neutering a slasher film to this degree. Extravagant kills are one of the backbones of the slasher picture.The other problem is strapping this story to the baggage that comes from calling it Black Christmas. Black Christmas is one of the original slasher films. It has a certain villain and certain expectations that come with it. Why bother calling it a remake if you're basically grafting a brand new story onto the corpse of the name?I don't understand why they just didn't create an original film. There's a story here that could work. Building the framework of college rape culture into a supernatural story could have worked. Imogen Poots is amazing. Between this and The Art of Self Defense, I'm a fan. There is more going on there than the thin script gives her. She deserved to be in a horror film that was going to celebrate the cerebral work that was going on in her eyes. The trauma and pain of living in a place that is filled with haunting reminders of her attack. Her friend wanting to push back against her attackers and the culture of the campus that allowed her attacker to go free only rattled her more. But there's more to it than that. There is a force lurking within the college that is unleashing the worst traits buried in the men. The worst aspects of toxic masculinity if you will border on downright misogyny.So there is a nugget of an idea inside this neutered horror flick. I could tell what they were trying to accomplish and honestly the ending bothered me a bit. It was not earned or built up. It just comes out of nowhere. It doesn't work as a horror film. Even with the good performances, it still feels silly. Much like The Hunt, this also felt like a Facebook comment section came to life. It lacks some of the nuance that could have brought to life. The characters needed it for us to feel anything for them. And for God's sake, don't call this movie Black Christmas!!!

After the stunt is done, Riley and her friends are inundated with threatening texts and DMs, and many of their friends vanish without a trace. The tensions build until they find themselves trying to survive the night.Black Christmas is the 2nd remake of Bob Clark's 1974 slasher classic, following a mostly forgotten 2006 remake that was critically and commercially panned. The new Black Christmas has been met with mixed reviews from critics and extremely negative reviews from audiences, but while I don't think the movie is good, it's not nearly as bad as people have been saying.The movie does have a decent lead performance with Imogen Poots as Riley Stone, and she does a good job of serving as an emotional core for the movie by creating a sympathetic character. The movie does also try to address rape culture and toxic masculinity (even if this is clumsily done), and I respect that it tries to go a different direction from the original Black Christmas, but it's so far removed from the original it has no business being called Black Christmas down to the fact it's not a slasher movie.The movie instead of being a slasher film feels more like a combination of the 2006 Wicker Man, Meangirls, and very watered down elements of You're Next and Ready or Not. The movie also adds a supernatural twist which I supposed is supposed to be serve as a metaphor for the toxic nature of tradition, but it's yet another element that divorces this movie from its source material. The movie doesn't have an awful premise (for the most part) and there is fertile ground that is touched upon. One scene towards the middle of the movie I liked was where Riley calls out Kris for exploiting her assault to spread awareness which was a nice moment of complexity that could've lead to an interesting discussion, but not only does the movie drop this point, it let's Kris off the hook in the process.Black Christmas 2019 isn't an awful movie, but it's not a good movie either. It's well intentioned and has a decent lead performance with Imogen Poots as Riley Stone, but it's also ham fisted with its approach to the material and its themes, not scary, and doesn't even have any decent shock moments thanks to a PG-13 rating.

The cuts are too abrupt during the kills and take you out of it. What would have been a pretty amusing retort in the climax was just left hanging as a suck my (total silence), that was a dud. You couldn't have the actress come in and dub over the word *ss if the assumed cl*t was too much for PG13?? I think they censored themselves too much fearing combined with the rape themes the MPAA would still give them an R??Yes the message was heavy handed but it's the horror genre your allowed to be over the top.Imogen was amazing as usual some of the other characters didn't really have time to develop. I appreciate a tight old school hour and a half but this needed some room to breathe and perhaps everything wouldn't have felt so crammed down your throat.

The Godfather of Soul was right, of course, and one only needs to turn on the evening news to have that position put on full display. So, then, it's a breath of fresh air to see the suspenseful, sly, and sharp 'Black Christmas' use the slasher genre as an opportunity to call this out and even preemptively lampshade some of its most vocal critics. Camille Paglia fans, you are warned.To go into this 'Black Christmas' expecting a beat-for-beat remake of the original would be a mistake, and one that is unfair to either film (or to filmgoers.) There are nods to the 1974 'Christmas' for those who know their stuff, but this film finds its own voice and is superior to most remakes for that reason.The basic plot elements are there: murders in a sorority house during the Christmas season, a twist involving the mystery of who's carrying out the grisly crimes, and such. However, director Sophia Takal and her co-writer, April Wolfe, make the choice to give the film a point of view that is its own. Audiences are given a movie with that dares them to engage with it rather than replay other films' beats, and it's a better film for that reason.The sisters speak truth to power and, in return, face the rage of a certain kind of entitled male figure. To some, that may be more stomach-churning than the shot of car keys to the jugular, but I suspect that is the point. While the film exists in its own celluloid world, it acknowledges that there are monsters who walk our earth and enjoy a certain degree of privilege not afforded to all, and that's as chilling a thought as any monster under the bed.Some of the film's best bits, in fact, come from smaller transgressions against that status quo - the Up in the Frat House song and dance that the sisters perform early in the film is hilarious even as its narrative is supremely uncomfortable, and there's a running gag about a missing Diva Cup that is smartly turned into an aha moment in the third act.The sisters put a nice twist to the final girl trope. Characters have as much of Cady Herron from 'Mean Girls' in their DNA as they do Laurie Strode. When decisions are made based on their own agency and initiative, they are rewarded. Riley (Imogen Poots), in particular, has to overcome past trauma in order to not just survive, but to triumph. History informs actions, characters have distinct perspectives, and motives are clear and understandable.I went into 'Black Christmas' with an open mind and was rewarded with a wickedly fun trip to the movies. That it made me consider perspectives other than my own was a sign of good storytelling and refreshing in a time when remakes often feel the need to timidly toe a reverential line.

It makes enough fun of everyone so as to cleverly never take a side, it just lets the left &amp; right have their say, and then they fight it out. Overall, its the body count, uniquely bizarre ways to murder victims, and the final twist along with top quality acting that really keep it fresh. In a good way, its not like anything I've ever seen. I sincerely look forward to more horror from this creator."}, {"id": 344, "text": "2 out of 5 stars (Has some good moments, but is overall bad)Note: Black Christmas is about sexual assault on college campuses. If that subject is uncomfortable for you, I advise skipping this film. Black Christmas is the 2nd remake of a cult classic 1970's slasher about a group of sorority sisters surviving masked assailants. I haven't seen the original film or its 2006 remake, so I figured I could analyze the new Black Christmas on its own terms. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm vanished faster than toasters on Black Friday as I watched a movie with solid acting, several good jokes, and isolated moments of tension be drowned out by a bafflingly mishandled message. Black Christmas is a giant lump of coal that fails both as a fun horror film and topical commentary.College girl Riley (Imogen Poots) is looking forward to celebrating winter break with her interchangeable sorority sisters (Aleyse Shannon, Lily Donoghue, Brittany O'Grady, and Madeleine Adams). A victim of sexual assault by the head of the campus fraternity (Ryan McInTyre), Riley and the girls call out the frat's actions via a Christmas performance (an admittedly satisfying sequence). However, the sisters soon find themselves cyber-stalked and chased by a mysterious hooded figure, putting them in the fight for their lives.Black Christmas is well-cast and hits its comedic marks, but lacks effective scares. Imogen Poots and newcomer Aleyse Shannon are standouts, with the former providing a grounded performance and the latter (despite playing a wholly unlikable character) possessing a strong screen presence. According to my college-age sister, everyone looks and talks their age. Also, the presence of Cary Elwes, the heartthrob from the children's classic The Princess Bride, hints at the cheesy fun that could have been. Unfortunately, the kills are more obvious than the unhealthiness of a Big Mac, the supporting sisters have less depth than a slice of bologna, and 2 narratively critical scenes occur offscreen, yet the film is written as though we saw them.However, the biggest sin of Black Christmas is its attempt to marry sexual assault with fun popcorn thrills. It feels like chunks of 2 radically different movies were smashed together rather than one cohesive vision, offering a simplistic, one-size-fits-all nonsolution for real-world victims while also failing as a horror film. Skip Black Christmas.Rated PG-13 for Violence, Terror, Thematic Content Involving Sexual Assault, Sexual Material, And Drinking"}, {"id": 345, "text": "The original Black Christmas was a masterpiece of subtle terror that refused to give anyone any answers even as the credits rolled. This new Black Christmas gives us all the answers, but gives us a few of them a bit too soon, which leaves the film without a lot of suspense or tension. Subtlety is not the word of the day for the filmmakers of this new take on the slasher story and its attempts to be political lack nuance and make the entire endeavor feel more like a preachy student film or a very special episode of Saved By the Bell where the entire goal is to stand on a soap box and lecture you for 90 minutes instead of tell an interesting story with timely, political themes.At a certain point, Black Christmas completely forgets it's a horror film altogether. In fact, it's obvious that telling an interesting, suspenseful, and scary story is the last thing on the creators' minds, which is a shame, because there are some good ideas that could have been explored involving sexual assault, rape culture, and men vs. women.Imogen Poots is the clear star here and she does what she can with the material she's been given, but her main story arc involving a frat party sexual assault might have been better served in a more serious minded film that's more interested in nuance and real human truths."}, {"id": 346, "text": "I just saw this movie after reading a bunch of snowflake men's activists on IMDB giving it 1 star and deciding I'd actually watch the movie and rate it myself. The verdict? This was a fun movie, that wasn't perfect, but had a lot to offer fans of the original and slasher films overall. Not every movie is out to reinvent the wheel, and this one doesn't. But it does enough things well with a different and clever spirit, more than enough to warrant its existence. How so?Let's start with my favorite aspect of this movie, the mise-en-scene. There were just a lot of really interesting shots in this movie. It was kind of beautiful in the way that people and props were placed on screen. The best example is the opening kill where the woman is made into a snow angel in the snow. Another great example is a complex stairway scene zooming out to show the chaotic nature of the holidays.Another great aspect of this movie was the characters. It had a likable lead with an interesting back story. She was date raped on campus three years prior and the police didn't believe her. However, unlike the men's rights activist reviews on here, she is more three dimensional than just an angry feminist. In fact, all the characters are, even the one that is an angry feminist. That character receives push back from the other women, showing how nuanced feminism and women's attitudes towards fighting patriarchy can be.None of the characters come across as one dimensional and there are some great male characters, including a pair of fun love interests (because women can fight for equality and date men, duh). Any men's rights activist who says this movie is about all men being bad obviously haven't seen the movie. It IS a movie about how awful rape culture is, and that's a real thing that should be exposed.Now to address the elephant in the room: does it respect the legacy of the original. I'd say yes. There are some great call backs, and while the original story isn't used, it lives up to the spirit of the original much more than the earlier remake. What the men's rights activists who trash this movie but glorify the original are forgetting is that the original was about a strong woman who makes the choice to have an abortion. It was kind of feminist itself. Also, just in terms of the tone it hits the mark (minus some supernatural schinanigans that is actually kind of fun). This movie isn't overly gory, which neither was the original, but it is creepy. Back to that mise-en-scene, the shots of the characters being watched through a window on campus or the creepy attic piece are all artfully done.One last thing that the men's rights activist are ignoring. While the writing/directing team are two women, this movie has the backing of one of the most powerful men in Hollywood right now, Jason Blum. The production values really show. It also has horror legend Cary Elwes in a scene chewing role that is gleefully fun. Additionally, if the men's rights activists even saw the movie, they probably walked out before noticing that the film was dedicated to a man named Victor (not the MO of a bunch of men).So is this a 1 star trash of a film about how all men are bad? Absolutely not! You might be one step ahead of the plot the whole time, but this is a well done and fun movie that has a lot to offer slasher fans. You don't have to reinvent the wheel to deliver a fun and clever take down of rape culture, which this movie absolutely succeeds at."}, {"id": 347, "text": "It's Christmas break at Hawthorne College and someone in a mask and robe has been knocking off the girls (ahem! Beg your pardon - WOMEN) in a sorority house. Is it tied in to the creepy fraternity that's been harassing them?This new version of Black Christmas has a lot of big ideas and many of them are pretty exciting. It can't seem to get them all on one side, though, and it's obvious that being a horror film is one of the ideas the creators aren't the most interested in. Scenes of terror and suspense are tossed off as a minor footnote to 90-something minutes of sorority/frat drama that's executed with the subtlety of a drum solo.Some of this drama is good such as the backstory for Riley, played by Imogen Poots. Most of her material is handled in a more subtle fashion - it's the secondary characters who feel like brash cartoons. From annoying social justice crusader to drunken ditz, all the other characters feel like they're made out of cardboard.If you're going to have such disposable characters, at least make the death scenes count, but this movie is chaste even by PG-13 standards - usually cutting away before there's even an attack. At least the 2006 remake, after realizing it couldn't compete with the original film's creep factor, loaded up on the gore and sleaze, turning it into a campy disaster of a movie that could still be enjoyed by bad movie fans. This new Black Christmas feels more like a student film thesis that's more to be admired for trying something different than enjoyed as entertainment."}, {"id": 348, "text": "This new version of Black Christmas is not bad, but far from being a high-end slasher/thriller. For example, we are far from the quality of the last Halloween, also produced by Blumhouse. And in the end, the story is completely different from the other 2 films, they could even have given a different name. I particularly appreciated the last 30 minutes thanks to its atmosphere, but the big defect is the lack of gore, it is TOO censored. And knowing that the film was shot like an R movie, but that they censored it for its release in PG-13, it's disappointing for fans of horror movies and slashers. We see that they cut the scenes, and suddenly the tension does not work. We come to see a slasher and they hide absolutely everything, and do not even serve the minimum of hemoglobin... But otherwise, it is not the stew criticized by frail people who feel offended by the feminist and progressive side. The films that instrumentalize women and idolize men, there are hundreds, but no, it just cries because for once it is not they who are highlighted... It is true that the aspect feminist is less subtle than last Halloween (for example), but it's still a teen movie (a genre that is not known to be subtle), so it didn't come as a surprise. And in the end, I have already seen 10 times worse as a slasher, so this Black Christmas is pretty good overall."}, {"id": 349, "text": "The movie felt like it was going to be a throwback from the golden age of slasher flicks, but the let down is it was far too tame for that tone. Every time they had the chance to show us some blood and gore they would cut away with just the illusion of it, and this was consistent from beginning to end which may have watered down the suspenfulness of it all. I'll admit, at one point I was even like oh come on as I watched it. Pretty sure that this was the point of the movie, but i honestly did not connect with it. It's one of those situation where I was expecting one thing that I like, got something different, but the different did not replace what I came for. I did like the feminist concepts of the film. I thought this set up help to heighten the fear and made in scary. So it was scary. A little too obvious at some points that they were trying to scare us. Almost a few points in which they were poking fun at the genre but forgot to make us laugh. It was a good attempt. Maybe history would look founder on this film then I did today. Maybe you have to break a few eggs to make that omelet, but overall I wanted to like this movie once I fully understood the premise but I possibly got turned off the same way any women would get turned off of watching a naked dumb blonde being stalked by a slasher."}, {"id": 350, "text": "I never saw any of the other Black Christmas films, and it is overt in its political tone/message, and it does have some convoluted fantasy elements a LiL' bit as it approaches its final\u00e9, BUT...All things considered, as its own stand-alone film, it is entertaining and unique and interesting and fun to watch and eat popcorn to for an hour and a half!!Whenever you approach something from a fresh, new or different approach to refresh it for a new generation, you're always gonna have the purists who will hate anything that's not the original, and you will always risk alienating your audience if you try to make it relatable or socially aware (or, political #GetOut) for a different audience.I'd rather have a film stick to its guns in the name of originality/vision than pander to a mainstream audience, however. Personally, I don't have to agree with every movie I see in order to enjoy/appreciate it for escape and entertainment's sake, and I am hard to offend but get that nowadays many get off on being constantly offended (not pointing fingers to specific individuals, just generally speaking, tho I get the feeling that those who couldn't handle the female Ghostbusters or Charlie's Angels (2019) or this Black Christmas and just enjoy an entertaining movie for entertainment's sake because they get their political feelings/feathers ruffled easily prob won't like this film).But YES, I LOVED and appreciated it for its originality, for being DiFFERENT and for its effort in being contemporary and relatable to a modern audience and for NOT just being cookie-cutter with its approach as a slasher.HALLOWEEN (2018) could've been more original and less cookie-cutter than it's predecessors in my opinion (we've seen them all before and, its throwbacks to the originals and its approach to the script are carbon-copy ripoffs of what Scream 4 already did in the name of originality in back in 2011 with Scream (1996)) and, Black Christmas (2019) took some great risks that ultimately didn't pay off with the mainstream audiences but, like I said, I can appreciate that it sticks with its guns and brought originality and relatability instead of regurgitating what's already been done a million times - and YES, entertaining regardless in my opinion, but can respect that we all have our own tastes.I def think it was unnecessarily hated and if you are an open-minded person who can appreciate originality it's at least worth a view in my opinion."}, {"id": 351, "text": "The movie is overall a typical slasher, it has a simple premise and a deeper meaning, albeit a meaning forced down your throat. Note that the movie is tailored to a teenage female audience, hence the heavy theme of girl power and bringing attention to the terrors of rape, the underlying theme provides more horror than the actual movie. Most of these reviews are just men complaining about it, when the men are not the target audience. The characters are like able but sadly are hardly developed with the exception of Kris and Riley. The movie definitely could have done with a better pacing and bring more light to Jesse and Marty who were definitely strong actresses with not prominent enough of roles to real develop what are otherwise like able people. (Especially Marty who's actress, Lily Donoghue, has great charisma and charm that I hope to see later in her acting career.) People constantly beg in the horror community for something classic and simple, which this movie delivers, but still have to find a way to complain. Overall, Black Christmas is a great addition to the series of remakes but given its name, is burdened with living up to the previous films which were tailored to different audiences. The movie is a good slasher and despite its PG-13 rating is able to still provide a quality time."}, {"id": 352, "text": "I won't go out on a limb and say this is a masterpiece or even remotely a great film. However I do feel as though it's getting some undeserving hate. Yes it has plenty of propaganda that is being shoved in our faces as of lately. And I suppose if you want to be offended by it then you may immediately down vote this movie to oblivion. But I honestly enjoyed this movie as much if not more than the last Ghostbusters. It has plenty of flaws. Does not have anything to do with the previous Black Christmas's. But once you see the film then you understand why they used the name and I think it fits quite well. The story reminds of a mix of a several different movies and shows that are centered around cults and secret society's. Is it super original? No. But it still offers a compelling and semi unique setting.As for the acting I wouldn't say there is anything to write home about here but at the same time it wasn't that bad either. Other than the dj kid who I would argue wasn't as strong of a choice in comparison to the others. Some of his line deliveries were forced and not natural.If you are just looking for a slasher film that entertains but isn't trying to shake up the genre too much then you will certainly find it here. Keep your sexism and political agenda out of it and you will probably enjoy it a bit more. However considering the name it shares I would hoped to have been given a bit more. It certainly leaves things to be desired for but overall it is worth a watch. And for those who want to find a fairly clean movie. This doesn't have much swearing and no nudity so that can be a plus or minus depending on the situation. Something that is getting harder and harder to find."}, {"id": 353, "text": "This movie would likely receive less negative criticism had it not adopted the Black Christmas label. I'll admit the plot is weak and feels like it the screenplay was written in a day while simultaneously watching a marathon of cheesy 80's slasher films and the Oxygen network.The twist reveal in the final act was tough to swallow and really drags the final moments of the movie down. That said, if you can look past the comically bad twist, the final act isn't terrible.Sure, the majority of the movie plays out like a PSA for female empowerment, but it's 2019, heroins are commonplace and I have no complaints about that.The real crime is the misuse of Cary Elwes whose better days in Hollywood have come and gone."}, {"id": 354, "text": "This movie continues to get unjustly attacked because of mostly sexist reasons. And the truth is that despite its Slay Girls marketing campaign the film is perfectly serviceable genre movie. In fact very few things actually separate it from its group. Basically a group of sorority girls is targeted by a fraternity with insidious intentions. Its really nothing new especially if you've seen the tv show Buffy the Vampire Slayer which this actually feels like an extended episode of. And I say that with admiration because that's my favorite show. As the film goes on the woke gets to be a touch too much towards the finale but it is entertaining and the points that are made in this genre themed battle of the sexes is really quite intriguing. The kills happen mostly off screen and because the killers are quite menacing some pay off gore would have been appreciated with an R rating. That being said I appreciated all the clever bits to the exorcist 3 homage to the rakes on mistletoe and women rougeing their cheeks. It all leads up to a girl power finale that's cheer worthy.

It had some interesting kills (eg when a girl was murdered with Christmas lights) I liked this, was a festive way of slashing I just would of liked to see longer scenes of this, they were over in seconds.There are several homages to the original classic such as the infamous bag killing scene. The character of Marty reminded me of Jess from the original, her look and mannerism mirrored each other. The film had a 70s vibe to it, with the styling and shooting. If you took out the phones, you wouldn't be able to tell which era it was.My biggest 2 gripes with this movie are: 1: there are no creepy calls, the girls get a text just before they get murdered. They lead you on with one scene and you think yes here it is, but it was a red herring. 2: the supernatural element was bloody ridiculous, it wasn't needed and the inclusion of a cult wasn't needed.Given this, it was a tense watch at time's and it had several good scenes. I thought it was better than the 2006 remake which was a bad bad bad movie but they had a better cast.If you any a fun watch, I'd give it a go but go in with a clear mind and try not to compere it to the original.

This new take is much more political and has sacrificed so much to cram the beliefs of the production heads of this movie in that it was more infuriating than enjoyable. Again, the issues are not the problem, it's the presentation, and we've seen plenty of popular culture films handle political issues with much more class.

I am a huge fan of the original 1974 classic, so I knew this wouldn't come close to touching that one. But I did expect a better result compared to the 2006 remake. In some ways this is a better film, but it doesn't feel like a Black Christmas movie which the '06 attempt at least gave fans. In this one the director has completely veered away from the Billy storyline all together. Outside of a few cute Easter eggs (Claudette the cat and a murder scene via plastic bag), there is no connection at all to Bob Clark's masterpieceThe acting is very good by all involved. Imogen Poots leads the way as Riley and does a fine job as the films lead. I really enjoyed the work done by Aleyse Shannon who in my eyes was the strongest character in Black Christmas. She brought a lot of fight to the role and it was fun watching her character.There were definitely a few scares that got me. I found the killers costume/mask to be very intimidating and creepy enough. It lacked the tension that the original gave viewers with the man in the attic, but a few moments showed glimpses of hope. The message of female empowerment and mysogny on film is strong in this movie of course which has been well documented. I think it's a good thing to be told especially in a horror film. That's not the problem with this remake. My issue is having the Black Christmas name and not following the story in any way. Another flaw was the identity of what has caused the holiday massacre and the supernatural twist the movie took. Thats not scary to me which is why the ending fell a tad flat for me.Overall, I enjoyed Black Christmas way more than I thought I would have. It isn't the terrible movie a lot of people have painted it to be, yet at the same time is not an excellent horror movie by any means. It's better quality film/script/direction than the 2006 remake, yet I enjoyed that one more for at least trying to stick to the 1974 storyline.

Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it one of the worst films ever made justifying the the 3.1/10? Absolutely not either. Like most horror movies there is some good stuff and some not so good stuff. I'd even suggest there is a lot more good stuff in this one than your average horror movie made today. I think a lot of people have jumped on giving this a 1/10 without even seeing it based on the fact that it's a remake, the fact that the original trailer gave away far too much information and because the film was rated PG-13. Very unfair and unjustified.The thing about being a PG-13 horror movie is that you have to be really smart to get away with it. You have to have an edge in your story-telling, an X-factor if you will, that can drive the horror and make people forget that what they're actually witnessing isn't as violent as we have become accustomed to seeing. 'Black Christmas' tries really hard to have this, but ultimately comes up short. It has tried to reinvent itself into a Girl-Power film, and actually has some moments that were well thought out, but the ending leaves a bit of a sour taste in your mouth in that respect.If you broke the film down into thirds the final one would be by far the weakest. It undoes almost all of the good work put forward in the first two. The film sets itself up in a way where we are focused on a group of girls who have some things going on, and some conflict with the boys yada yada, and inter-spliced with that are random kill scenes of various girls. It sets itself up in a way to be a whodunnit (I haven't seen the original or the first remake to know whether that was the same in those films). Then along the way we meet various characters who could or could not be behind these killings. That was the element of the story I liked the most by a long way.Then the final third rolls around and some characters make some unbelievably stupid decisions (what else is new right?) and the movie becomes something else. It's still a horror movie, but also it's kind of not anymore. The Girl-Power side of things suddenly becomes overwhelming and instead of invigorating the movie, it drains all the energy out of it.I was really excited when I heard another 'Black Christmas' movie was coming out because I had never seen the original or remake and I thought this was the version I will actually get around to seeing. It was filmed in New Zealand too which was an added bonus. Then came the news about it being PG-13 which was admittedly disappointing, and then came the news that it was no longer going to be released in New Zealand due to poor quality and then the poster came out and was incredibly bland - and with each bit of news like that my excitement levels depleted. I'm glad I did get around to seeing it in the end though because it is nowhere near as bad as people are making out. It may not be to everyone's liking, but I would implore you to at least make up your own mind on it and not be deterred by the unwarranted hate this film has succumb to."}, {"id": 361, "text": "Sigh, I really tried to like this film.

This film takes a very weird approach into retelling the classic film, with it being hardly anything like either film before it, but really vague interpretations of some of the settings throughout. There is a weird social commentary and overabundance of political correctness and feministic views- its not that I mind these things in any sort of way, but it just feels so incredibly out of place, and so forced that I can't help but lack the concern to take any of it seriously. It often incredibly overdramatic, dull, and far too serious for a film of this nature.

Which noone believes the victim.Imogen Poots is a beautiful actress. But her character is bad and cliche. The cast is decent but the performances are terrible. The direction lacks the scares and thrills. This film does cut away the gory kills. The twist is campy which tries to be fun. But it fails with its boring direction.Overall, Black Christmas is a pretty bad film. It is a dull slasher movie with no thrills. Characters make dumb decisions. The plot and concept tries to add something different but falls short and forgettable."}, {"id": 364, "text": "Yes, Black Christmas (2019) is very feminist (I personally didn't mind as I didn't find it too distracting/offensive to me, considering I am a male). Yes, Black Christmas (2019) has a lot of the #MeToo movement type-of-messages within it.However, I can easily look past all of this because the film tended to have a lot to it that helped it not be annoying to me.The writing I found to be great. The characters I found to be extremely likable. The chemistry between the leads is good, The twists are unexpected and shocking. While some of the dialogue has a lot of cringe within it, I found the film/writing to be mostly realistic enough that the dialogue blended in because in the end, Everyday we say a lot of cringe, and this film does it well.People kept complaining about jumpscares, but I found there were probably under 10, and even then, Most of them weren't too annoying for me (and I hate jumpscares too). To me though, The jumpscares somewhat helped the films creepy vibe, I don't know.The direction is average. Not amazing, but certainly not anything below OKAY. The direction is good enough, and the cinematography is fine. I don't look for amazing cinematography in the films I watch and if you're like me in that sense, You'll be just fine.(If you do look for exceptional cinematography though, Go watch Little Women or The Lighthouse.)Now, It is time to address the elephant in the room.THIS IS A REMAKE.A second remake. Now, Here's where everyone reading this review questions me. I have never seen the previous films. I watched this due to the fact I love slashers, and this one was the newest to release to DVD (and during this pandemic, Walmart is still open, and I got money I wanted to buy a new release with!). I also loved the cast (the acting is great also) so I bought it to watch. From what I've heard, This film is nothing like the previous two, and I suppose if you're looking for a true Black Christmas It seems you won't get that (why is it called Black Christmas though? I question that slightly).Overall rating: 6.5/10. I personally loved it but find that a 6 fits it best. THE GOOD: Cast is great. Great characters/character development. Never boring. Writing is better than most BLUMHOUSE productions. Creepy vibes that might just scare you. Great soundtrack/score (For the few seconds you heard it THAT IS). Great twists/Awesome ending. Decent-enough tone. Somewhat funny at times (intentional I'm assuming). Cast shares great chemistry. THE BAD: The feminism might divide viewers (me personally, I had no problem with it and if anything, kinda enjoyed the added feminism purely because it made the film feel more unique, which is what I freaking love in fun horror flicks like this). Somewhat bland direction despite the great pacing. Film leaves a lot to be desired due to all the quote unquote cuts made to make the film PG-13 (which I didn't mind personally). Has barely anything to due with the originals (once again, I DO NOT MIND THIS). Cinematography might just be too average for some viewers (not me though). Jumpscares might annoy some."}, {"id": 365, "text": "Black Christmas is a 2019 Holiday Slasher film directed by Sophia Takal and written by Takal and April Wolfe. It's the second remake of the original 1974 film of the same name but is a fundamentally different movie in a lot of ways. It has a more fast paced style and a completely different story it's trying to tell. Only a few things tie the three films together, the Christmas theme and the fact that it takes place in a sorority house where people get murdered. The film was written and shot with an R rating in mind but was changed after test screenings to be PG-13, and it shows. A lot of the kill scenes are cut abruptly short in a way that's extremely distracting taking away from the film makers intended vision. Slasher films don't need to be gory to work, Halloween (1978) and the original Black Christmas are great examples of that, but when a film is re-edited to become something that it's not it because of committee think, it comes off cynical and ruins the impact the creators wanted it to have. The writing of this film is completely bonkers, it goes to places that border on schlock and come off comical, which I wasn't expecting due to the serious subject matter. It takes on rape culture in fraternities and toxic masculinity in general which is a real issue that can fit well into a horror movie like this, but it was handled so broadly to the point where it felt like a parody of itself. One thing I really liked about the film was the way it looked; some of the later scenes are bathed in green or red as Christmas lights illuminate character's faces and the environment, and it looked great. There we're probably some good things in there, but its buried by re-edits and a ridiculous plot that doesn't take its subject matter as seriously as it should. Imogen Poots is great as always and does her best to keep this movie afloat along with the pretty cinematography, but sadly, it's just another remake."}, {"id": 366, "text": "Other reviewers have called this movie predictably boring. What slasher flick isn't predictable? Yes the audience learns early on who the slasher is, so to speak, but that hardly makes it predictable. We know Michael Meyers is the murdered in Halloween-are the same reviewers ranting against that? I didn't think the acting and writing was terrible either. Yes, some characters make stupid decisions-again not unusual for a horror film so why have beef with this one? I'll tell you why. Because this movie also has a message against the patriarchy. It's a movie with feminist characters who are fighting back against violence against women and male supremacy. The horror is not that women are being murdered. The horror is that there are still men who are threatened by women finding their voices and power. I also saw some complaints about the PG-13 rating and lack of blood and gore in this movie. I actually appreciated the lack of blood and gore that is so gratuitous in other horror films. I have an imagination, so I can use it and don't need to see blood, brains, and guts everywhere. Overall I wasn't at all disappointed by Black Christmas. It was what I expected, maybe corny here and there, but a decent slasher flick."}, {"id": 367, "text": "One of horror's biggest horrors in this current age is the updating of classic material to fit modern social issues, or to reflect new processes in storytelling. It has produced some decent material (Halloween, Child's Play), some excellent material (The Invisible Man,) and some absolute tosh (Pet Sematary). You can add this update of Black Christmas to the latter. In the original Black Christmas, an unseen menace called the vulnerable sisters of a sorority, and as the calls increased in frequency and madness, girls began disappearing. The denouement and climax wherein Jess finds herself alone in the house with the madman is a short orgy of horror, a classic build up of tension and a twist that has since been repeated all too often. In 2006, Glenn Morgan took on the legend of Black Christmas and created a messy, silly confection that took the premise and turned it into a throwaway, fun horror with eyes being popped, icicles falling indiscriminately and a hilariously tasteless backstory for the killer. It was not liked by critics at all. But history might look fondly upon that addition when comparing it to the 2019 addition.As a girl struggles with her masked assailant in the snow, her efforts result in a snow angel being created as she is stabbed to death. Dragged away, the camera stays on the remnants of an angel murdered. Can you say basic?In Black Christmas 2019, college girls are still receiving text messages from an anonymous source threatening death, but it's given a feminist twist (and a trailer that gives it all away). It manages to reference the original, remake (along with blatantly stealing one of cinema's biggest scares from Exorcist 3) without any of the tension of the original or fun of the first remake. The makers also made the confounding choice to remove all gore to ensure young girls can see it. The hubris is astounding.When taken alone, some moments do pop - the first home invasion is a fun bit of female violence and one attic scene does manage to drum up some menace - but it collapses under its pompousness as it tries to re-balance the scales of horrors that have befallen helpless women over the past 40 years in slashers. Perhaps had this been released without the connections, the creators could have found a fun quasi Your're Next/Girls with Balls with the same message but instead it just comes across as a humorless bit of tripe."}, {"id": 368, "text": "Maybe Black Christmas is just one of those movies that's impossible to remake considering both remakes have missed the mark in major ways. Whereas that 2006 remake felt like a candy-colored, studio re-tooled fever dream of nothing but gore scenes and poorly drawn characters, this new stab at the story feels disjointed and in the middle of an identity crisis.There are scenes in this film that work when isolated from the film itself, but the film's biggest issue is that it has no idea if it wants to be a serious-minded film about sexual assault and toxic masculinity or an over the top parody of social justice warriors and cults that worship the bust of a racist old white guy that drip black goo which brainwashes young men into hating women. Somewhere in the middle of these two are about 5 cursory minutes worth of scenes trying to remind us we're watching a slasher movie.One could easily see both variations of this film working in their own ways, but together, it's like watching The War of the Roses as the mismatched couple realizes they just can't live with each other and are completely incompatible together.I couldn't help but picture a film where sexual assault is still addressed and toxic frat boys still hold a sorority under its grip of terror for naming one of their own as a sexual abuser, but without all the silly cult stuff and poor attempts to be woke with that awful friend of Riley's who bristles every time a man walks by her or opens his mouth."}], "reviews_amount": 369}
