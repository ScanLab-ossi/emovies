Even his amazing draw and enthusiasm could not save this awful script with a $10k budget. Story is about drug war with a victim caught in the middle who seeks refuge with Crews and his dad. Pretty straight forward but just a bad script. Wouldn't recommend it."}, {"id": 2, "text": "You would think that Ludacris and Terry Crews are established enough that they would no longer participate in substandard movies. It had to have been evident at the time that they read the script that no matter what editing was done, it could not produce any level of quality work.No back story, but a young Honduran brother and sister manage to illegally cross into the US, fine. Sister is kidnapped and rescued, however the brother is shot. How was he alive at the end of the movie with no visible sign of injury.Terry Crews acting was idk, was his intention to be depressed, lonely, sedated?The screenplay music was terrible and didn't fit with the sequences.The action was horrible.How did the cousin charge a cop who had his pistol drawn escape?The dialogue with the cop at the house was garbage.I could keep mentioning different sequences from the movie that all are just as bad as what I have done already but I am not spending another moment with this terribly written, filmed, and acted out movie.Guys, do better next time."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Everyone involved in this film should be embarrassed. It has a terrible story line, unnecessary extreme profanity, and is overall a two-thumbs-down candidate for worst film ever made. It is an atrocious assault and assassination of the character of John Henry who was deemed a legendary hero and this movie is so awful it seems like it is a deliberate attempt to do so.Terry Crews should be much more selective about the movie roles he chooses in the future or his career is going in the toilet where this movie belongs."}, {"id": 4, "text": "I never once could figure out what this movie was really about. Didnt get the theme. Didnt get any of my questions answered like the woman who helped him buy tampons and danced in the store. Who are these random Hispanic kids. Why are they jumping from scene to scene. Cant understand why we are being shown videos from Feb of 1994, they never explain it. Some lady at the end decided to help john. I'm just confused. It turned from a movie of all dialogue to straight gore and western music. The music never once fit the scene, the music over powered the dialogue. I kept having to turn up the volume to hear what they were saying then turn it down because some loud obnoxious music came on. I want my money back. That was dumb."}, {"id": 5, "text": "30 minutes into the film and I am on IMDB for a plot because I don't know what I have just watched the half an hour. Even after reading the plot, it doesn't relate to what I have been trying to watch. The camera work is terrible, some footage is obviously from a mobile phone! The editing is atrocious, the editor should have been clued up on the plot! Thankfully I did not have to watch this in a cinema. Let me try get through the last hour!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "Quite Posse the dumbest and most incoherent movie ever made. Not sure how anyone could have read this script and said yeah this seems good, I'm in?"}, {"id": 7, "text": "Was like a music video and wannabe Tarantino movie rolled into one. Pacing was awful. The scene with the two gang members talking about The Human Centipede was an attempt at the Royal with Cheese dialogue from Pulp Fiction. Just a waste of Terry Crews and Chris Bridges' talents."}, {"id": 8, "text": "The plot of this film moves at a snail's pace, and ultimately doesn't go anywhere. It really makes very little sense. The concept isn't a terrible idea, but what really confuses me is that the writer also directed this film, and couldn't bring it together any better than this. Confusing flashbacks that are uninteresting at best, and gunfights with people standing around, looking down gun barrels just waiting to get shot. The only excitement came from my anger at the wasted potential of this film."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Don't even attempt it! I loveTerry but this movie shouldn't even be on Netflix. The plot is ridiculous, the movie is just all round horrible! Some scenes were surely shot on a low budget flip cellphone! It's not good!"}, {"id": 10, "text": "The whole movie is a complete mess.

How desperate can you be to act in such a terrible low budget movie? I'm sure they don't NEED the money.( Which was probably very little). So why??? I don't get it. This movie was so crappy. I feel like I could have directed it better and written better lines. Good grief:((I love Terry Crews ....but this??!!"}, {"id": 14, "text": "Terry Crews as folklore hero, John Henry. Unfortunately, this film is far from a steel driving man character type. A silly story, with silly characters. It felt like an 8 year old wrote this story, and script. Lousy dialogue, lousy characters, and lacking a cohesive story. I did enjoy Ken Foree's performance, but it wasn't enough to save this crappy film. Anything for a buck filmmaking."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Im sorry to say this but it was awfully week and bad. Bad movie.

The under motivated writing was drowned out by the soundtrack, which seemed to have a new tune every 5 lines or two minutes. I couldn't tell if this was a movie or a music video, noting the overwhelming music. The audio didn't help either. I spent 90 minutes with the volume controller in my hand between the ominous music tones and the low muttering lines spit. Just because something is in the top 10 on Netflix doesn't mean it's good, it's trending and those props go to the two aforementioned actors alone. Without Terry and Chris, no one would have watched this film. Disappointed to say the least. There are no spoilers to report because the movie itself is spoiled."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Movie tries to copy the style of a classic revenge tarantino film... but, fails completely in every aspect. very corny script and terrible writing. i feel like this script wouldnt even do well in an 8th grade english class.terry crews needs to stop taking whatever roll lands in front of him. and as for ludacris i expect nothing less!don't waste ur time folks."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Where did the Hispanic girl come from? What about the old school mate what happens between them? Why is the music so loud you can't hear them speak? Why is there videos from 1994 popping up here and there?

In the end, he uses the sledgehammer you see on the DVD cover because he does not like guns.Would have been better as the graphic novel they showed during the credits. Lots of blood. You knew where it was going and who cared? Never got to know the characters as half spoke Spanish and John didn't speak much.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Let get this straight onky reason I've rented this cz of Terry Crews, Ken Foree and Luda. With this kind of decent starcast you ought to make a decent John Henry adaptation. But it went downhill from the very start. Bad acting, horrendous screenplay and mediocre script. 15mins into the movie you will loose interest and after 30mins you are not missing anything. Its just plain boring. By the time they introduced Hell ( Luda ) you are not invested anymore. Only if you are a Terry Crews or Ken Foree fan you can give it a watch."}, {"id": 22, "text": "&amp; I don't mean this in a good way. Acting wasn't terrible b/ the script was craptacular! I can't even imagine the actors were paid a lot to make this sulfuric poot of a rotten egg!

The actors did well, but they would have done so much better with a good plot. There's so many switch ups to the plot that it really just doesn't make any sense! I'm black and puerto rican and it was still not good. Has nothing to do about race or where you're from..... Uh... this was just blatantly bad..... Have I mentioned that it was bad? What a let down."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Seriously, this is simply not worth your time! This was one boring flick, was hoping there was atleast something decent, guess only place hope is ment to be is in church."}, {"id": 25, "text": "I think it's understandable why many people might think John Henry might deliver the goods - there is its title, the setting being gang territory in Los Angeles, and the fact that Terry Crews is the central protagonist. However, I think just about anyone who sits down to watch this movie will be very disappointed. If you think that there would be non-stop brutal action, think again - after the opening action sequence, there isn't another action sequence for about an hour. And when the action does come, it isn't particularly well done, mainly due to the fact that it's pretty poorly directed and edited at times. The overall amateurish feel of this movie no doubt comes from the limited budget; while the movie never becomes incredibly cheap and tacky, it's obvious that the filmmakers were working with some severe limitations. Terry Crews can't do much with his role, possibly because of a screenplay that doesn't explore his character much, as well as making a number of other characters and plot details murky. This could have been a great update to the blaxploitation movies of the 1970s, but it's pretty much a misfire."}, {"id": 26, "text": "I really wanted to like this movie. The movie was so boring &amp; dumb Throughout it I had a urge to just turn it off but I didn't and tried to give it a chance but it was terrible! The whole story line was stupid! The acting was bad! The music was annoying! Tge music was terrible &amp; it would play the spanish music at the wrong time! Whoever made this movie need to quit!"}, {"id": 27, "text": "At some point, I thought like I was watching Luke Cage. Not much action beside the scene at the beginning of the movie.

Whomever the director, writer or producer was - shame on you!. I' so glad I didn't pay no more than $7 to see this movie. #Backyardmovie"}, {"id": 30, "text": "That was just terrible.Watch the first five minutes for a laugh at how bad a movie can be."}, {"id": 31, "text": "That is if you are some film critic looking for the top 10 worst films"}, {"id": 32, "text": "Storyline vague and inconsistent. Over acted, corny and a terrible waste of time. Music didn't fit, none of the characters had any depth and massive continuity issues. Storyline was only surprising in that i couldn't believe it was quite as bad is it was. Everything about the film is low budget and poorly thought out."}, {"id": 33, "text": "Omg, what is up with that tampon purchasing scene?? The acting was so bad and the CGI bullet strikes were proven low budget effects. Let's not forget to mention the amateur acting, I expected more out of Crews and Luda....my bad."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Nothing in this movie is sensible, it's all over the place and just corny. From the dry acting to every single song/score choice, its just utter garbage..... not one redeeming quality in this film, not to mention the horrific effects, i get it they spent all their budget on terry crews and ludacris, but really a student can produce better vfx then whoever edited this film........"}, {"id": 35, "text": "1. This is what happens when you have producers, writers and directors trying to tell a story that doesn't culturally belong to/ resonate with them AT ALL .2.

This was excruciating to watch all the way around"}, {"id": 36, "text": "Ok, like everyone else, I saw Terry Crews and Luda. So I say to myself, This is great quarantine tv. Holy. Sh*+. This movie is plotless, erratic, Needlessly loud, full of random characters with no backstory, and to top if off, creepy dancing in front of panty liners in a local pharmacy. This is a 7th grade mocking of a Tarantino movie on a $4000 budget. I swear to God, i was waiting for the credits to say Shot on my iphone 5. The big names in this movie had to have lost a bet, or had some strange clause in a studio contract they had to follow. I finished it, only as a shear test of mental toughness. Which provided the only entertainment for the 90 minute playtime. Id rather be in a NY subway 4 weeks ago while getting coughed on and licking hand rails, before I watched this again. DONT DO IT. But at least I can say, I have a new worst movie Ive ever seen."}, {"id": 37, "text": "It isn't terrible but far from good as well. I think the director may have watched too many Tarantino and John Wick movies, And old western movies.It's a weird movie to review, the whole 1 and a half hours went by quickly without any boredom induced as such, it's just there seemed to be nothing really done in that 1 and a half hours. Even the cast were fine, the D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu felt throughout is clearly been overdone with John Wick and as said Tarantino as a whole."}, {"id": 38, "text": "What they should have done in this movie was use the N word a few times more, as it would have contributed immensely to it's less than mediocrity. Absolutely disgusting, between both the dialogue and the sound track. But, I watched it to the end so I could honestly say this. Riots have been created over using that word, and the director THREW it out there like it was OK. IT'S NOT!"}, {"id": 39, "text": "There have been more interesting music videos than this"}, {"id": 40, "text": "I decided to watch this after a few drinks one Sunday and I was entertained. It's a decent direct to video release which offers an interesting take on the John Henry story. Terry plays the role fairly straightforward but it works well and there are a few decent comedic moments in the film. Overall it works well for a direct to video movie."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Awful movie, i will never recover from this!Crikets most of the movie, very easy to figure out that they produced this movie on a very small budget."}, {"id": 42, "text": "I'm a big Terry Crews fan and went into this wanting to like it even if it was a b-grade action. Sadly this was terrible from the opening credits, I persisted for about 10mins of the movie but it was unwatchable. Honestly hope Crews didn't loose to much money on this one."}, {"id": 43, "text": "It soaks it at the end but I totally love this film. It's a perfect homage to the black exploitation era. Very slow drive but worth it. Terry Crews gets to play a super hero from the streets. Makes me feel like he needs to get in one of those comic book costumes and get real with the superhero thing. Lucdaris plays the perfect street villains. Just really perfect. The music perfectly fit the vibe and the tone of the film. I think I actually was expecting Terry Crews to play the actually John Henry but what I got here was just as good. If you are a fan of 1970s black cinema get yourself in that headset to watch."}, {"id": 44, "text": "I always thought Under the Cherry Moon was the worst movie ever!!!!

The entire movie makes no sense... confusing, just stupid, and horrible end!! Don't waste your time! I would give 0 stars if I could!!!"}, {"id": 48, "text": "Funny when I told one of my friends about this movie they told me they can't imagine terry in a role that's not comedy. His acting wasn't good at all along with the other casts who look like this might have been their first movie. Who would risk their life for kids they don't know? How he got shot in the head and shot then shot like 2 times in the body and still survive? Some of the scenes made no sense.

The story that can only be loosely termed a story is the usual about drugs, hoods and poverty. There are whole parts of the movie that don't do anything but play some sort of pointless scenes that add nothing. I can only think that the director was consuming large amounts of illicit chemicals and that in his haze the whole movie made sense to him and was a masterpiece , that any audience would also have to be out of their box to enjoy it or to make any sense of it is apparent."}, {"id": 52, "text": "Trying to think of one redeeming factor - and nope, I've got nothing - truly awful movie."}, {"id": 53, "text": "This garbage tries hard to be some kind of spaghetti Western with a bit of tarrantino chucked in for good measure.

This one just stays dire, with no comic relief to temporarily avail the awfulness. Shocking in every department (special mention goes to the tone-deaf sound crew) it's hard to believe that somebody approved this excrement before it was released, as surely if they had done, it would have tossed it in the bin, or the project restarted from scratch. We live in a world where too many things are rushed, with little thought. Let this pitiful excuse for a movie serve as a warning of what can happen as a result of this."}, {"id": 56, "text": "Sometimes before you even start a film,you just already know what am I doing? This was painful, the acting was garbage. The plot non existent. The soundtrack was confusing and not up to scratch.

Then that's a form of self harm"}, {"id": 57, "text": "I love Terry but this film is diabolical, like all other reviews (which I wished I'd read prior to watching) I cant understand what the movie wants to be, its more confusing with the added clips from 1994.

You end up with comic book esque story, gangster crime drama and over the top action that just don't go together. With each style clashing horribly. Here is what I mean, most crime dramas have to feel realistic to appreciate it's impact emotionally, that tone is undermined by goofy comic book style action that's smashes realism into bits......In the end it's a disconnected mess and writers and directors take note of how NOT to make a movie."}, {"id": 71, "text": "I decided to watch this movie because Joseph Julian Soria and Terry Crews was in it.

This movie turned out to be a ton of filler. It feels like this movie is 75% shots of palm trees. It's about 25 minutes worth of movie dragged out by slow-mo shots and long breaks where they try to showcase the rather mediocre soundtrack. Terry Crews barely even acts in it.

The soundtrack wasn't really in synch with the action, another poor choice in my opinion. Not that the songs were bad, they just didn't fit in the action sometimes. As for the acting, that was to me the weakest point, with a lot of actors that normally do better. I think Terry Crews is better in comedies like Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

I did like the old Camcorder scenes that were thrown in. It just felt like there were different directors. I think all the actors tried their hardest given the circumstances.

I loved every second of it."}, {"id": 122, "text": "Life isn't fair for anybody in first-time writer &amp; director Will Forbes' John Henry, a simple but savage thug-life thriller with brawny Terry Crews tangling with Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges. Clocking in at 91-minutes, this predictable but entertaining, R-rated melodrama concerns an interesting relationship between the heroic Crews and the utterly depraved Bridges set against the real-life setting of contemporary Los Angeles. As much a character study about the titular titan as it is a bullet-blasting B-movie, John Henry delivers exactly what its audience yearns for without being cheated with ridiculous lectures about morality. An undocumented Hispanic brother and sister, who have escaped the devastating terror of Honduras for the freedom of America discover that nothing is perfect in the land of Uncle Sam. No sooner have these Central American refugees crossed the border than surprising complications separate them. An African-American gang with its tentacles deep in the sexual slavery racket abducts the na\u00efve heroine Berta (Jamila Velazquez) when she and her brother Oscar (Tyler Alvarez) are walking the mean streets of Los Angeles.During its opening fifteen minutes, John Henry introduces us to its hero and villain and depicts how these two cousins have drifted apart as adults during the intervening years. One emerges as a ruthless gangster chieftain desperate for 'respect,' while the other resides in apparent anonymity after he had committed an act of violence that traumatized him. Little about John Henry has anything to do with the legendary, steel-driving African-American folk hero, except for Terry Crews' mesomorphic physique and a sledgehammer. Just when you think you have this modest, low-budget thriller figured out, Forbes and freshman writer Doug Skinner sling in some surprises which will catch you off-guard.John Henry opens at a gangster hideout where four African-Americans garbed in white outfits, like the villains in the recent SuperFly remake, are bragging about their exploits over a friendly game of cards. Gangster slang and profuse profanity riddle the dialogue as these three hard-boiled goons and one tough gal gamble away the evening. Suddenly, one of the four gets the shock of his short life when a slug smashes into his stomach. Four Central American females that the primary villain, Hell (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges of Gamer), has ordered kidnapped dive for the floor. Two masked Hispanics burst into the house, their bullets punching holes in the walls as they shoot at anybody who moves. Emilo (Joseph Julian Soria of The Purge: Election Year) and Oscar storm into the house with automatic pistols and rescue Berta and her friends. Police sirens are howling as the Hispanics flee from the house. Berta scrambles over a fence, into a yard, and crawls under the wheelchair ramp at the front door which effectively conceals her from the uniformed L.A.P.D. patrolman who rattles the front door with his fist. The homeowner, John Henry (Terry Crews), refuses to let the black cop search hid premises for the runaway illegal immigrants. Reluctantly, the cop relents then leaves John Henry alone. No sooner has the patrolman left than John Henry stares down through a gash in the ramp and asks if the terrified girl is hungry.Writer &amp; director Will Forbes intersperses VHS flashbacks of our title character as a teen as well as straightforward dramatic flashbacks later that suggest why our hero shuns guns. During a scuffle outside a convenience store, our youthful protagonist clobbers a pistol-packing hood with a pile-driving swing that puts his opponent face down on the pavement for the count. John Henry's cousin Hellen stole the surveillance tape that recorded the memorable event. Unlike everybody else in his neighborhood, John Henry doesn't rely on a locked and loaded 9mm automatic. Meantime, John's old-time gangster father, B.J. Henry (Ken Foree of Brotherhood of Blood), insists that he himself is God's gift to women. Unfortunately, life hasn't been fair to B.J. since a stroke landed him in a wheelchair. Nevertheless, confined as he is to a wheelchair, B.J. still packs his pistol and lives with his adult son. Indeed, the wheelchair ramp saved Berta from being taken into custody by the cops. Although John Henry invites Berta to dine with them, he realizes that communication between the two of them is strained by his lack of Spanish as a second language. B.J. salvages this predicament because he can understand and converse with her. Berta is upset because she escaped from captivity without a scratch, but Emilo left her brother behind. Later, Emilo tracks Berta down to John Henry's abode.Terry Crews delivers a laid-back, low-key performance as the sympathetic protagonist. He is nothing like his happy-go-luck mercenary in The Expendables franchise. John Henry lives a simple, easy-going life until a gangsta hits his pet dog with his vehicle and gripes about the dent the dog put into his ride. The bragging thugster brandishes a pistol to intimidate John Henry, but our grief-stricken hero ignores the gunman's threats and cradles his dead pet in his arms. Sadly, we're neither told enough about John Henry's reclusive life nor how he pays his bills. The saving grace of John Henry is Forbes never lets anything interfere with the plot and the inevitable showdown between the two cousins. Ludacris's demented villain presents an interesting contrast to John Henry, particularly about his weapon of choice. Rather than wield an automatic like his trigger-happy hoodlums, Ludacris prefers a blow-torch to maintain discipline within the ranks of his henchmen. Furthermore, he wears a gold-plated jaw that genuinely sets him apart from any other character.The violence in John Henry isn't extreme enough to qualify as gratuitous, but its verbose profanity landed it an R-rating. Our hero bashes the brains out of his opponents with a sledgehammer, but Forbes never depicts the impact of that hammer on flesh and bone. Largely, we see only splashes of gore when John Henry's sinks his hammer off-camera into somebody's noggin. Any way you look at it, Will Forbes makes a slam-bang directorial debut with John Henry."}, {"id": 123, "text": "It was a little slow at the beginning &amp; music a little loud.

When two immigrants flee the clutches of a street gang and wind up on his doorstep, John tries to protect them in any way he can (you gotta love the power of a good old sledgehammer). That's the gist of 2020's bloodstained and callous, John Henry. At a running time of 91 small-scale minutes that teeter into art film territory, it's my latest review.Distributed by Saban Films, referencing The Human Centipede, and shot almost two years ago in palm treed LA, John Henry comes off as a sort of B-movie with a torrid, grindhouse effect. It's also like watching a lowly commercialized version of Menace II Society (or Baby Boy) mixed with a little Taxi Driver (I'm God's lonely man).John Henry has rookie director Will Forbes using various camera angles (and POV shots) with an over-stylized flavor. He's ambitious, he's a bit of a show-off, and he commits his whole, mannered shtick to the background sounds of basement tape rap songs (which I kinda liked).Will's editor (Joe Rosenbloom of 2018's Monster Party) fashions John Henry as choppy, random, and askew. Characters you think are dead wind up alive, various shootouts seemed squeamish yet ill-choreographed, and I didn't quite comprehend the use of VHS recorded flashbacks circa 1994.Oh well. John Henry has some decent casting (I liked the villain named Hell with part of his face cut off) and despite its shortcomings, possesses an effective way of making the viewer feel unsafe. Henry is overly violent, overly mean-spirited, slang-ed in dialogue, and bruised to the gills. I just wish helmer Forbes had tried to settle down and tell his story more systematically. Oh Henry!

Instead of the popcorn, glamorous gangster/revenge tale this appeared to be something quite different. So I gave it a go and I'm so glad I did. This was a very grown up movie. The violence was brief and to the point, just like in most real life situations. It acted as a punctuation mark throughout the film (in flashback and present day). This is a story of redemption, not revenge. It played out like a spaghetti western but had a bit of a dragged across concrete vibe.

So, it's average film for one time."}, {"id": 162, "text": "I have to say I just finished this movie and when I saw the ratings to this film I couldnt believe it.

It's full of creativity and this is a team that we will see a lot more of, and with significantly bigger budgets. I particularly love the bringing together of Black and Latino cultures in L.A. And some revisions of cliches and tropes we are used to seeing in gangster movies and Westerns which is what this turns out to be.

I loved it. Terry Crews really showed us some acting on this one."}, {"id": 166, "text": "This film had a lot of potential, we know that because it's an idea we've seen executed well many times before. It could have been so much more, it wanted to be so much more. Unfortunately amateur camera work/blocking, poor script and horrendous sound design really rob this film.When will sound designers learn, if you make the score significantly louder than the delivery of the script, foley, etc, through volume, pitch or otherwise, you destroy the film. In John Henry the score which pops up regularly and randomly (often out of context) is at least double the loudness of everything else going on. That means you either listen at a volume that makes speech inaudible or you blow out your ear drums when trumpets suddenly start blasting.That leads to much of the speech being inaudible. Not that it really matters with such a basic plot, but it definitely is frustrating. The John Wick dead dog scene is ridiculous, and at no point is there emotional attachment to any of the characters. Heck, for most of the movie you won't even really know who the characters even really are.Better to save your money and watch Shaft or John Wick instead."}, {"id": 167, "text": "Where to even begin with a movie like this. Between the absolutely nonsensical plot, lack of action, cringe worthy line delivery, and just pure boredom, this move really doesn't have anything going for it. We have terry cruz somehow being blackmailed into starring in this, and he plays a ptsd-ridden ex gang member who is currently living in Compton with his wheelchair bound father. So aside from watching an emotionless terry cruz do nothing except talk with caveman-like speach, you'd hope to at least see some action right? Nope. Pretty much goreless movie aside from some cgi blood splatter during the 3 minutes of actual action in this. Don't even get me started on the plot which is so nonsensical that you will be constantly questioning what is even going on. Literally so many plot holes coupled with random dream sequences make for a story that really does go nowhere. So don't be fooled by Terry and Ludicrous being in this. Seriously wondering what compelled them to even make this movie. It really is a The Room situation where the making of this would be more interesting than the actual movie itself. The worst part is, it's not even fun or action packed. And not only that, I can't even tell if this is paying homage to classic exploitation movies or what exactly. It's just an utter mess, unfortunately."}, {"id": 168, "text": "I've seen some bad movies in my time. Battlefield: Earth; Natural Born Killers; Any movie Uwe Boll directs, but nothing comes remotely close to the atrocity that is John Henry.It started off ok, a flashback to a simpler time. However, it quickly devolved into an attempt at a Tarantino flick, John Woo action, to just a jumbled mess that was more comedy than serious.The characters are reading scripts, they don't believe in their roles. Terry Crews has never done anything as bad as this, not even Damon in Friday After Next was this bad.The character development was so scattered I've seen confetti fall from rafters that was more organized.There were times, I kid you not, where the musical score (which was also overly emotional for the sort of film this was) was louder than the dialogue.The redeeming factor of this movie was it was only 90 minutes. Other than that, I swear I should sue Netflix for pain and suffering."}, {"id": 169, "text": "This movie is not complete garbage but it is far from great.I am a Terry Crews fan since 2001 unlike most of the people reviewing this movie that only know him from Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It is nice to see Terry outside of comedy which has been most of his recent career. I miss the old Terry from Gamer, Expendables, and Street Kings. It also has Gerald 'Slink' Johnson from Black Jesus...if you don't know, look it up. Ludacris has always been a hit or miss in movies, this movie being one of his worst acting jobs ever plus his character is super weak talking about his empire. Joseph Julian Soria always does a good job (Crank, Purge, and Gentefied on Netflix) and Jamila Velazquez was also good in the movie.The story itself is just rough, dragging on in some scenes while still feeling overall rushed as a movie. I see complaints about the music being too loud overpowering scenes and it does in some of them. However, I did overall enjoy the older west coast sound from DJ Quik.Simply put, I didn't hate the movie just can't rave about it either. I think with better writers, a bigger budget, and a better actor to replace Luda it would be a much better movie."}, {"id": 170, "text": "I saw this movie on sale to buy for 7$ digitally on Xbox and pass, then i regreted it. I like Terry Crews, i enjoy low budget action flick most of the time... Couple weeks later i see it in a rental sale for 2$. I jump on it and rent. Well... glad i only paid 2$.The synopsis is simple. A kid on the run take refuge at John Henry's (Crews) house and he decide to protect that kid even tough the person's who's after her is someone he has a pass with. This has been done a million time before but hey i like these simple stories.The issue is here its done very badly. First the score that pop up of nowhere all the time over padding scenes do not fit. Speaking of padding scenes, oh my is there a lot of them involving unimportant side characters (using the term lousely). Its either a combo of music/imagery or random unimportant characters speaking while using ghetto profanities that is really not needed for the advancement of the plot.The built between the main characters is fine at first but there is not enough of a payoff (action) to justify it so the movie end up very slow pace and well...boring.I get that this is no John Wick and the budget is very small but even with that in mind it could had been a very simple protector's flick and be fun. Crews and his father's character BJ actor do a very decent acting job but its the only bright spot in the movie.Maybe i was expecting more of an action flick based on the trailer and the artwork of Terry Crews with a sledgehammer but since it turned out some kind of artistic drama more than anything else it just left me disapointed.I hesitated between 3 and 4 out of 10. I ultimately decided to go with 3 because it did bored/disapointed me and i sure know i don't want to watch it again. But its not an horrendous movie by any means. 35% would had been apropriate of a score."}, {"id": 171, "text": "I'm a big TC fan, so when I saw this pop up on Netflix, I was intrigued, especially since I hadn't heard anything about the film. The brief synopsis lead me to think it was going to be a gang-themed movie, and while the deep plot involves gangs, it was definitely not what i would consider a gang movie. If you're looking for a gang movie (a la Boyz In The Hood, Menace II Society, etc), look elsewhere. This is more a drama than anything, and the pace is painfully slow.The acting wasn't bad, but OMG...the script is terrible. Using the name John Henry felt like a stretch too, and almost felt like an insult to the folk hero John Henry, especially with a few loose and unsuccessful references to the namesake.More than anything, the dialog between actual plot points drags on for minutes at a time, with nothing to add to the plot, the characters, or the film. I'm not sure when this story was submitted for funding, or how long the script took to develop, but everything about this movie felt like a rough draft, with no attention to flow or story.Sadly, this movie is a complete bust. Had it not been for the fact that I like TC, and a couple other actors, it would have ranked even lower. It's certainly not the worst movie in the world, but I can not find a single reason to recommend it. Even for fans of TC, it's just a bust. Bummer."}, {"id": 172, "text": "Let me mention I made an account after watching the movie and seeing that many people gave poor reviews, after hearing it was low budget movie, I was definitely more interested.Yes the story is slow to build, it made mad sense midway through when it finally made the connection between characters played by luda and Terry.No there isn't 99 minutes of straight gangster action, why should there be? Characters were introduced and interacted each other well, (although I shoulda watched with subtitles I don't know Spanish -_- )It was a slow building movie, it ultimately built up to the ending, it was awesome, it was awesome to wait for.Was it over dramatic sometimes? Yes, was it worth it? YES. I just don't understand why people are downvoting a movie that 2 big hearted people made to entertain folk, a lot of these reviewers are probably really shallow people cause this was a heart felt movie, I really felt the scenes and anguish between the characters, and it diddnt take $100,000 to do it, and if that doesn't please you, you probably shouldn't be online reviewing movies.If anything im certain most of these *critics* are just mad cause of the sign in the bathroom, (I thought it was funny)I really loved this movie, yes it was a slow build, but if you actually watch movies and not peanut scan see them than you will find a good heartfelt movie in this of a triumph over a younger aged dispute between two friends who were brought face to face by random chance.and if luda or terry see this. THANK YOU! it doesn't take ridiculous comedy or over the top scenes to appeal to people, mfers are just dense!"}], "reviews_amount": 173}
