I watched this at the Sitges Film Festival, expecting to see just another slasher, but this is something else. The comedy is just right, the violence is too good, and Vince Vaughn just kills it, quite literally. Overall, a great flick to have some laughs and to watch some great gore scenes."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Vince Vaughn's acting is top notch. His pancy way of running around n his girly act is what made this film entertaining. The film starts off with a bang, lots of brutal killings n then maintains the entertaining value cos of Vaughn's top notch acting. The film has good humor n moves at a decent pace. The professor with the handle bar moustache looks like Edward Norton."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This movie was a blast. It's not an academy award winning film lol. It's exactly what I was looking for, a fun Friday night. It made me laugh, had some gory kills, and the acting was good. I never understand the whole it's not original argument. Give me a break. It's a good movie."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I loved it. Vince knocks it out of the park as a teenage girl and all the characters really pulled off their scripts. The point of movies is to entertain and I was so entertained during this film. The issue is you can't take this movie seriously. It is not meant to be a realistic slasher. It's just an entertaining fun teenage horror comedy and a damn good one! Not to forget, the very talented, very beautiful and very great Kathryn Newton who made a great serial killer Barbie. Top work from her and her co stars!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "Was I the only one that found this stupid and unoriginal. I went in hyped about this movie but sadly is disappointed.

Vince Vaughn is going to get made fun off by his peers for years for doing this film. I understand that it's 2020 and he may need the work....but come on ! Just take a year off and enjoy yer money man. Don't ruin your career by taking gigs like this. Absolutely cheesy and stupid movie.

Do they even read the scripts anymore before agreeing to turn them into movies?It's all so very clich\u00e9d and not even in a fun or ironic way. Everyone is cruel to her for no apparent reason, there's the typical gay friend, etc. The actors aren't believable in their roles, it's a such a cringefest. And worst of all, it's not even funny when it's supposed to be. Nor does it feel like a horror movie. And there is so much dumb stuff going on it's also annoying.At least the effects aren't too shabby which is why I haven't rated it any lower."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I thought Vince Vaughn's perfromance was incredible! Another BlumHouse movie that turned out to be creepy and funny. Its like Jason Voorhees meets Rob's Schneiders Hot Chick.

Vince Vaughn has never been funnier and Kathryn Newton makes for a very likable heroine and also manages to pull off the sociopathic serial killer stuff once she's switched bodies. It's well paced with just enough laughs, gore, and even heartfelt moments to make for a memorable ride."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Believe it or not, i sense that plot is what i think it was and it did like i expected. some laughs here and there. typical slasher , a popcorn generic."}, {"id": 16, "text": "A good watch with the right company.

Actors are quite good, it is funny and gory with some emotional scenes thrown every now and then. Gotta give it to the lead actors, they did a great job. Storyline is straightforward, but the cinematography, acting and script keeps you hooked to the screen. I would add that this movie is quite bold in a good way, and challenges some norms but I loved it. I wouldn't be surprised if it was trashed by conservatives.In summary it is a must watch."}, {"id": 18, "text": "I wasn't expecting much, but surprisingly enough, we all laughed and enjoyed this. Vince Vaughn was his usual amazing self, and Kathryn Newton was excellent in her 180-turn characters. The writing was awesome with some great LOL moments. The directing, sound and score were also on point. The 102 runtime felt a little long for the story, even though the pacing was decent. Nevertheless, entertaining and fun."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Borrowing generously from several genres and altogether wholly unoriginal as a result, this teen slasheresque horror gore body swap flick delivers and entertains due to two excellent performances provided by Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton.

It's not risky and it does not add anything you have watched before. The storyline is OK, acting is Ok and deaths are Ok. Probably the most original here is watching Vince Vaughn as a serial killer/girl. But, overall some of the sceneces/CGI are embarrassing. So, be ready. Could have been far better with a risky script instead a cheesy one."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Freaky is one film that you might call a horror comedy parody like film still even for all of it's fun and joy it's pretty good entertainment. The story is simple as a local serial killer is on the loose known as the Butcher(in a role that Vince Vaughn hams up) killing young girls. Only something strange and different happens when he tries young and popular high school student Millie(Kathryn Newton). A change happens it's like a body switch a transformation happens between the two. The film is filled with plenty of slapstick it's like horror comedy at it's best still the blood and gore is present making a viewer feel like they are watching a classic teen slasher flick. Overall not the best type of film to be made still it's fun and tasty entertainment to dine on with the horror and comedy mix making it the ideal party feast!"}, {"id": 23, "text": "The movie was bad and a waste of time. It didnot add anything new. Its wasnot funny at all. Kathrine newton's acting was so bad that I couldnot complete the movie till the end. I have no idea what happens in the last 20 mins and I dont need to cuz it's probably predictable and boring. I watched the trailer and I honestly was looking forward to watching the movie but how the trailer described kathrine's character wasnot at all what we saw in the movie. Maybe giving the movie a rating of 1 is exaggerating but I really hated he movie. It has a very bad writing. I mean by now u think characters will at least be a little smart to know what to do and what not to do in a freaky friday situation. Ohhh my GOD kathrine's acting was soooooo bad. It was literally the worst acting I have ever seen in my whole life. Maybe not the worst but it was so bad."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I wasn't expecting much &amp; usually avoid these types of comedic horror movies. But, it surprised me &amp; I liked it.

I'm glad I took a chance on this movie, it was worth it."}, {"id": 25, "text": "This movie is not good at all. It's basically a horror version of Freaky Friday the movie where daughter Lindsay Lohan switches places with the mother Jamie Lee Curtis. It's about as lame also."}, {"id": 26, "text": "I feel the movie was a big let down. There was so much potential as the premise was interesting (though not original). While the performances of the actors were good (Vince Vaughan, in particular), the story seemed rushed as more time was dedicated towards mindless action (last scene was unnecessary) rather than developing the characters by showcasing their struggles to adjust to their new bodies."}, {"id": 27, "text": "A serial killer steals an ancient magical dagger during one of his murder sprees and plunges it into the wrong teenage girl, causing them to switch bodies and it's up to her to convince her friends that she's now in the body of a man and that they have 24 hours to switch them back before they're trapped in each other's bodies forever.Freaky might go more for the goofy than the truly funny at times, but there's an infectious sense of fun throughout and the performances are excellent across the board with Vine Vaughn and Kathryn Newton being given the most to work with and making the most of it. It's similar in tone to Christopher Landon's other horror comedies, so if you enjoy those, you're probably going to enjoy this one as well. If you didn't like this then this might not be for you, but there's an added bonus of this one being rated R which means it comes with a lot more gore than the Happy Death Day movies."}, {"id": 28, "text": "I stopped watching when I saw how badly acted it was 10 min. That clich\u00e9 scene at breakfast with the bacon eating, who eats their mouth like that? Even the eating is badly acted.

Vince Vaughn is hilarious. If you like Dale and Tucker you'll like this."}, {"id": 31, "text": "This was a fun watch.

Vince Vaughn is hilarious and at times scary, depending on who he is at the time. The director, Christopher Landon has a real knack for this usually very difficult genre of horror comedy- he really is able to check all the important boxes for each genre without losing tempo. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the genre. One note- the death scenes are not for the squeamish. They are, at times absurd, but grounded, making them feel realistic. They are also very creative, graphic and at times, elaborate. So, you know, 'viewer discretion advise'..."}, {"id": 35, "text": "After a long hiatus from seeing new movies in theaters due to Covid, this wasn't a bad movie to see.

Very poor redundant plot, dull performances and a clich\u00e9."}, {"id": 38, "text": "Freaky is by far, one of the most entertaining slasher films of the 21st century. The plot is very simple, and has been done in many films, but to have the body swap premise in a horror film keeps things very interesting. Unlike most body swap films, the acting is very consistent between the two actors. Vince Vaughn is hysterical as a shy teen girl, and Katherine Newton was very convincing as a crazed killer, she definitely had the more impressive performance out of the two. The movie delivers a pretty good amount of humor and the kills are nice and gory. For fans of the genre, Freaky is definitely a refreshing and enjoyable film."}, {"id": 39, "text": "The guy who directed Happy Death Day directed this pile of cringe? Wow.

Kathryn &amp; especially Vince did amazing jobs!"}, {"id": 41, "text": "There's alot to say about this film. I just want to start by saying Vince Vaughn was great cannot fault him he can go from acting like a teenage girl to a psychopathic killer in seconds and that was great. What wasn't great was the rest of this film.The dialogue was probably the biggest issue, they crammed the script with so much un-needed swearing ( don't get me wrong i don't mind a film with swear words but that's only when it fits) in this film the swearing does NOT fit AT ALL. There were multiple scenes that gave off lots of unnecessary rape energy and by teenage characters too nonetheless.My other biggest issue is the forced character development. There are parts of the film where it's high tension then it's all of a sudden slowed down to fit in a stupid scene where Millie talks to her mum about her father's death in the killers body so the mum doesn't know it's Millie. Or the scene where Vince Vaughn literally kisses a teenage boy.The other problem is the obvious Cliches in this movie too, the main character has a dead parent, she can't move on, her other parent is just as absent, there's a teenage Boy crush and he's a jock but she's a dork and you wouldn't guess he likes her too.This is only a little of what is on offer in this bad bad film and I don't even mention how unlikeable all the characters are and their forced actions to move the story along.The one good things about this film is the kills and Vince Vaughn that's pretty much it.I would not suggest this film."}, {"id": 42, "text": "Best horror comedy I've seen in a long time. Vince Vaughn playing a teenage girl in this Freaky Friday scenario was the best part of the movie. The kills are and inventive and full of gore. The beginning plays tribute to Friday the 13th as well as Halloween in the way Vince Vaughn kills and chases his prey. There seemed to be two endings to this movie and I thought the second was unnecessary. But over all it's a great mix of funny and scary which most movies like this seem to miss."}, {"id": 43, "text": "There was a bathroom scene that no girl needs to live through rated R or not.

Yes, because the acting is so good by all involved, especially Vince Vaughn, who is a hoot here, and Kathryn Newton, who is very engaging.

Vince Vaughn in his best comedic role since Wedding Crashers plays a campy serial killer with a wooden mask and a bunch of weapons that likes to murder teens in increasingly goretastic ways. The movie is fun but and I mean this in the best way it feels like a Disney horror flick. It has a big heart and a bunch of comedy that mostly hits. Katherine Newton is okay in the lead. She's engaging when she's Millie but as the killer she's just not believable. That being said the film is filled with colorful characters, stylish cinematography and a sense of fun. It never quite reaches the potential it promises but it's a bloody good time nonetheless.****/5 Eric: 4.5/5"}, {"id": 62, "text": "Refreshing, smart, and entertaining.

The title is clearly homage to Freaky Friday.I liked the plot and the acting and it appears the actors had fun with the role reversals. I didn't like the ending of the home invasion.

In my opinion, it would have been better without that aspect, as its a rather competent modern slasher flick on its own.Still, it's something different and the final girl is pretty likeable, along with the rest of its decent cast providing some comic relief. It's somewhat satirical of the genre, yet you never feel as though it doesn't take itself seriously, which I think it does. 6/10."}, {"id": 71, "text": "Freaky tells the story of a teenage girl who wakes up one morning to find her consciousness stuck inside the body of the man who tried to murder her the night before. She quickly realizes that this must mean that the killer's consciousness is in her body, and she spends the rest of the film trying to mitigate consequences and get her body back.On paper, this is a firecracker of an idea. It's simple, straightforward, but also creative and promising. It is Freaky Friday meets Friday the 13th, a fun but spooky body-swapping teen slasher film. And surely, when the credits roll, Freaky's finest accomplishment is that it does good service to this idea. Writers Christopher Landon and Michael Kennedy spend their 101 minutes with the concept leaving hardly any conceptual stone unturned, managing to wring humour, tension and heart from the story in all of the right ways, while always keeping good pace and never forgetting what kind of movie it is: a fun one.The trouble with Freaky, however, is that it's greatest strength is also it's weakness. In servicing it's central idea, this Freaky Friday the 13th, the film does manage to hit the right notes. But what notes are those? Well, they are the notes, the themes, the plot devices, the characters and the twists laid out by the film's inspirations. That is to say, in trying to be Freaky Friday and in trying to be Friday the 13th, Freaky more or less is those movies. It does an admirable job at mashing the two, but at the end of the day, it is never more than the sum of its parts. And so, as a viewer, you spend only so much of Freaky enjoying the idea before you realize that you have seen this movie before. You know where it goes. You know how it ends. The movie shies away from subverting expectations in any way, obviously frightened that it will veer to far from it's predecessors, but then it becomes it's predecessors.This quality becomes even more egregious as the film the progresses. Near the end of the film, when the clock is ticking and the stakes are high, the viewer never feels any real sense of threat because they have seen a slasher before. The killer always escapes their confines. The killer always appears to have the upper hand. The final girl always comes out on top. And then there are body-swapping movies. The protagonist always gets her body back. The protagonist always learns a heartfelt lesson. Things always workout. And Freaky never grows self-aware here, as it attempts to throw twists and turns into the final few minutes that cause the audience's eyes to glaze over. By this point, they has seen the film spend over an hour setting itself into a specific mold. They know that it's not going to veer from that, and it doesn't.And so, while I would recommend seeing Freaky with some friends, popping some popcorn, and enjoying the hijinks, never expect to be on the edge of your seat with Freaky. Enjoy it for what it is, and try to forget what it isn't."}, {"id": 72, "text": "Was entertaining enough, but not enough to keep a viewers feel attention, didn't know what sort of film it was ment to be, bit of a Heinz varieties.Watchable but nothing memorable.Now, if it was a full horror movie with no comedy, I think it would have worked, especially seeing more of Vince Vaughn as the evil guy.. didn't show enough of that, to me that would have been the highlight, Vince in his own body as the killer etc."}, {"id": 73, "text": "2020 was worst for horror genre , that's why I loved this movie , I loved the atmosphere of slasher classic , I loved the Easter Eggs and homages for classic horror like Halloween ( hadonfield = blissfield / Carrie white I /Michael myers kills/ Jason voorhees ) if u didn't see any homages how u call urself horror fan?

It's sort of a slasher 'Cinderella' where the protagonist Millie has 24 hours to stab the butcher back with his own dagger, or else she stays The Blissfield Butcher forever!The story begins with Millie, the unpopular girl at her school organizing a boring evening with her mom instead of getting ready for the prom. That's what her sister thinks anyway, who plays the local deputy with her own struggles; such as distancing herself from the family since their father is no longer in the picture and their mother is an alcoholic.Millie's mother works at the local discount outlet in her town; and this is pretty much the fodder for the torment she receives from Ryler, the mean girl at school. Millie does however have a few friends at school, Nyla and Josh, who seem to be cooler than Millie and come to her defense against her tormenter.However, her friends can't save her all the time; especially from her mean shop teacher and being constantly humiliated on the football field while posing as the team's mascot. One night when Millie's mom has one too many drinks and forgets to pick up her daughter, Millie is stalked by the Blissfield Butcher, and ends up being stabbed with his dagger. Millie's sister comes and saves the day, but it's too late, as Millie transitions from geeky nerdy unpopular girl, to brutal and sexy serial killer seductress!Truthfully, I wasn't sure about seeing Freaky so quickly as I have a disdain for horror comedy. I find that sub genre to be almost a parody of itself; overly meta and self aware. I will give Freaky credit for knowing what it is from the beginning; with the advertising of the film gearing towards a female and gay male audience.As a slasher film, Freaky may even get some horror fans excited, with its somewhat shocking opening and the many references to the classic films that inspired it: such as Friday the 13th, Halloween and Candyman. But just like any horror slasher comedy, Freaky comes with its inherit flaws.Although individually, Millie and The Blissfield Butcher have their own personalities and qualities, this seems to be lost during the transition. Instead of acting shy and awkward, The Blissfield Butcher (as Millie) comes out swinging with a new wardrobe and hairstyle; as she slow-mo walks into school in a wonderful nod to the 80s film Heathers.This definitely treads into the geek to chic sub-genre; as now the football players want to date her, and even Ryler tries to befriend her, which... let's just say Millie gives her the cold shoulder. Besides some of the kills which are already given away in the trailers such as Ryler freezing to death and the shop teacher's run in with a buzzsaw, Millie does not get all Blissfield Butcher on our ass.The Blissfield Butcher, when portrayed by Vince Vaughn, seemed like an interesting, brutal, demented serial killer. Unfortunately, Millie is never really given a chance to become him in that way. The same goes for Vince Vaughn as Millie. When he becomes her, he is no longer awkward but conventional and ready to kiss boys.Freaky is not perfect, but at least somewhat takes itself seriously. The concept could be interesting if really approached with darker material. Sort of like if Chucky really did possess Andy, and then Andy started killing. Still, it says a lot when one of the more interesting moments of the film is a clip from The Real Housewives of New York City."}, {"id": 79, "text": "This would be a great replacemant for Netflix's The Babysitter, since the camerawork and the overall theme of this movie just suits their agenda for horror comedy more than their own inferior counterpart.What could one really expect from a horror comedy such as this one other than the fact to just have fun, and fun did it deliver.

It's not a drama, it's not a thriller, it's not a horror and there isn't much action OR comedy at all... so I've got no idea what this movie is supposed to be, except 1hr30mins of mindless teenage pandering.

It seemed different, but a part of me was a little worried at the beginning when it seemed to basically be another slasher flick. Well, it is sort of, but after the intro, I realised that this may not be the case. I guess it has something to do with the way the film is set up.It opens with four friends having a get together and all of the sudden they are killed one by one. This is why I was a little worried, though when I think about it, slasher flicks don't tend to open this way (though since I haven't watched many of them, namely because I don't like them, I can't say that I'm an expert). Anyway, it then cuts to this high-school girl who happens to be quite daggy, and hangs around with a couple of friends who are also quite daggy. We then follow her through a typical day and learn of the people that she has problems with.This sort of gave me the idea of who was actually going to die in the film, because yeah, it happens to be one of those films. Slasher flicks tend to have them killed one by one, however in this one we have three friends who are sort of outcasts, and when we are introduced to the bullies, we suddenly get an idea of where it is going. Oh, and they also have the bodyswap scene, which is the main motivator for the film - the serial killer becomes the girl, and the girl lands up in the body of the serial killer, and of course they only have a limited amount of time to switch back.Yeah, it's sort of different, though I'd have to say that it probably isn't the only bodyswap film out there. In fact I believe I have seen similar films previously, especially where we have a body swap (and I believe it is Hot Chick that I'm thinking of here). I do have to admit that swapping with a serial killer is sort of something different.Mind you, the thing that sort of got me was how this serial killer, once he landed up in the woman's body, somehow realised how to dress cool. Sure, it is a major factor in the film that overnight she goes from being a dag to being, well, this pretty awesome chick, however when you discover how the serial killer actually lives, it is sort of puzzling how he somehow knew how to make the woman look pretty awesome. In a way it sort of doesn't make sense, but then again this is a black comedy, and it sort of needed it to be like that for it to work.Yeah, it's actually pretty funny in parts, and I guess that I why I liked it. It is certainly a different take on your typical slasher film, and it certainly kept me entertained. Yeah, the scene in the car was pretty awesome, and the few people that were in the cinema found it pretty entertaining as well. Yeah, I liked it."}, {"id": 90, "text": "Heartfelt and funny horror comedy in the tradition of Landon's previous two films. It's either a style you'll love or one that'll annoy you.

Vince Vaughn actually really excels in this role where he switches bodies with a teenage girl, it was too funny. I absolutely enjoyed the crap out of this movie so much I've seen it 5 times already, and I honestly wish that more movies would balance their horror with their comedy as well as this movie managed to do, which I have not seen since Scream, but that is my opinion.

This is a horror/comedy based on the 1972 Freaky Friday book written by Mary Rodgers-and also the Disney movies-and the movie is written &amp; directed by Christopher Landon, who also did the Happy Death Day movies, Paranormal Activity:The Marked Ones and The Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. Vince plays a serial killer in the vein of Jason-he has a similar hockey style mask-that is terrorizing a town. Kathryn is a shy high school girl-no boyfriend, she dresses drably, doesn't comb her hair, but you can tell that she could be a popular girl if she worked at it-that is the latest target for Vince. In his latest kill_a_thon, Vince finds a knife that just happens to be cursed and he uses it on Kathryn. But, instead of killing her, it swaps their bodies, with him in her body and vice versa-that's where most of the comedy comes from. Through diligent research-and the help of a couple of her friends-Kathryn discovers that there is a time limit on when they can switch back or it becomes permanent. Uriah plays the boy that Kathryn likes-but she doesn't think he knows she exists-and Alan plays one of her teachers. It's not all fun and games though, the violence is pretty graphic-there is one scene in particular that shows her cutting a person in half with a table saw. It's rated R for strong bloody violence, sexual content-no nudity-and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 41 minutes. If you like these types of movies-horror/comedy-you should enjoy it.

Millie the timid girl waits for her mom in front of the school but she fell asleep drunk. The butcher shows up and stabs her and the bodies swap. Both woke up startled.

Millie killed the bully teacher by a electric saw and froze to death the gossip girl. She was somehow taking revenge on the bullies. Then they captured her and tied up in a chair in the house of josh. And goes out to steal the dagger from the station. Josh's mom comes back home earlier and the scene was really fun when he said he was straight and the mom was doubting that more than anything. And the butcher untied herself and came after them. They then escaped home and met at the police station. Millie takes the police car and heads for the old mill where the party's taking place. He kills 3 bullies there and again with a chainsaw one of them. And a boy hitting on josh and bullying him. They somehow capture Millie before it's too late and stab him to get her body back. The police shot the killer after that but he wasn't dead and at this point I was hopeful about a sequel. But at the last scene the butcher came after Millie to her house and fought three of them until Millie gets to stab him with a log right in the chest like he were a vampire.

If you liked those, well, this will definitely give you more of what those movies offered, this is set in the same universe - Landon said that, They definitely share the same DNA and there's a good chance Millie and Tree will bump into each other someday - and was originally titled Freaky Friday the 13th.Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton, Big Little Lies) is a teenager who has been tormented by bullies, both of the teenager and teacher* varieties. Meanwhile, the urban legend of the Blissfield Butcher continues, as he keeps killing her classmates. Now that he possesses a McGuffin called La Dola - an ancient Mayan sacrificial dagger - he looks to gain even more power. But when he runs into our heroine - her mother (Katie Finneran, who is great in this) has left her behind at a football game where all she gets to do is wear a beaver mascot costume - she battles the Butcher and when he stabs her, they end up switching bodies.So yeah - this turns into a body swap comedy and you'd think, after the gory as hell open, this is where they lose you. But no - if anything, this gets way more fun.Millie's friends make for some of the best scenes in the film. Nyla (Celeste O'Connor) and Josh (Misha Osherovich) have been with her through the worst parts of high school, so having their best friend in the body of a killing machine is just another trial to be endured.Speaking of that killer, Vince Vaughn shines in this. There's plenty of silly physical comedy, but also some really nice scenes like when he admits to the love interest that she left the note he treasures (body swap pronouns are a little hard) or when he has a moment with her mother while hiding in a changing room.Landon - who wrote the movie along with Michael Kennedy - said that the film was influenced by the Scream series, along with Cherry Falls, Fright Night, Jennifer's Body, The Blob and Urban Legend. There's also a fair bit of Halloween in here, particularly the opening series of murders, and references to Heathers, Child's Play, Creepshow, Galaxy Quest, Carrie, The Faculty, The Craft and Supernatural. There's also a bottle down the throat kill that came directly from the 2009 slasher remake Sorority Row.I had fun with this.

I also really liked his sci-fi approach in Happy Death Day 2U which is an unpopular opinion apparently.BUT this. I don't know what Christopher Landon was going for here unless he was told by Universal to cut half of the movie out of the finished film because this is my first and only explanation as to what I just watched. It went no where. Mediocre. It was predictable. I thought that the knife (yeah the one on display right at the beginning of the film it still triggers me) would have been a better plot device if we got a story of why it was created and how it was used. As I saw the knife I thought to myself maybe the knife was used for eternal youth by switching bodies with a younger person think The Skeleton Key. EVEN I had a better idea than this films did. I really do hope there's a better version of this film out there because I know Landon can do better than this. Newton's performance was the only thing I throughly enjoyed about this movie.

And to my surprise, this was way more fun than I thought it would be.Just when you think it's another generic, teen angst, alcohol-drinking, sex-thirsting movie, the kills start happening. Not only were they gory, but they were also quite creative. The movie just knows exactly what it is and never takes itself too seriously. Plus, watching mean bullies die in horrific ways was just so satisfying to watch. (Hopefully, I'm not the only one...)More importantly, Vince Vaughn is the reason you should watch this. You have this 6-foot-5 giant of a man running around as a teenage girl. From the way he speaks to his subtle mannerisms, it was just plain funny. He's the man-- or the woman, I mean.As for the negatives, it mostly has to do with the writing. Basically, everything with the family was boring and predictable. It was probably the most generic part of the movie. They lazily tell you everything you need to know as soon as they're introduced.I also hate it when movies portray a character as ugly or undesirable and the actress is anything but. In other words, they want you to believe that Kathryn Newton's Millie is some kind of weirdo loser, but I just never bought it.There's also a disconnect between Newton's Millie, who is shy, timid and quiet, and Vince Vaughn's Millie, who is girly-girl, talkative and fun. They just felt like different people. There's also, sort of, two endings. There was the natural conclusion, and everything was good, but then it goes on for another 10 minutes, and it was just unnecessary.Despite some annoying tropes and poor writing, this was a fun, self-aware movie with some horrific kills and really funny body swap moments.Score: 7 out of 10 Overall: GoodRecommended for: Fans of Vince Vaughn, fans of Freaky Friday with a slasher twist, or fans of watching scumbag bullies get what's coming to them.Thanks for reading!"}, {"id": 183, "text": "When I saw the trailer firbthis I was cautiously optimistic that it could be ok.

The performances are adequate, even fun at times with Vince Vaughn going all in on his portrayal of a shy teenage girl.The biggest problem with the movie is it's inconsistent tone... it feels like a made for Disney TV movie with 30 seconds of inappropriate language and phenomenal gore shoehorned in, resulting in a film too mature for viewers under 14 and too juvenile for adult entertainment.

However, this fresh take on Freaky Friday was most welcome. It was a vibrant display of kill or be killed with comedy being a side note throughout, and not in the absolute classic, cheesy way that older slashers offer. My initial reservations were with Vince Vaughn knowing that he was a comedic actor. Those reservations were unnecessary as Vaughn playing a teenage girl was hilarious throughout as he tries to convince those around him that he's not the Butcher. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Kathryn Newton who played Millie, did a fantastic job of carrying the ominous presence of the Butcher to high school where the killing continues. By the end you'll be left laughing one moment and in the same scene cringing at the acts of violence.Overall, a really great slasher/comedy that I would recommend seeing in theatres on any given night.

After the fun (and quite gory!) stereotypical teen slasher film opening sequence we are introduced to Kathryn Newton's Millie Kessler, a student at Blissfield High who though some body swap magic gets put into the body of Vince Vaughn's aptly named serial killer, The Blissfield Butcher.This is where both Newton and Vaughn really start to have some fun, with Newton now a menacing serial killer in a teen body and Vaughn gleefully acting as a teen student in a comparatively massive and hilariously overpowered body.There isn't anything absolutely groundbreaking going on here but that's kind of what makes this film a whole lot of fun, It let's the focus stay on the great two performances and is honestly a perfect film to get away from 2020 for a while.FREAKY excels in every way you'd want it to, it fits perfectly into Landon's filmography and style with two great performances at the centre.Highly recommended if you enjoyed Landon's earlier Happy Death Day films or even if you're just a slasher fan, you won't be disappointed.FREAKY slashes into cinemas this Thursday the 12th November Australia wide! (Yes even Melbourne!!)Thanks to Universal Pictures Australia for providing the screener for review."}, {"id": 194, "text": "4 out of 5 stars.Freaky is a good comedy horror film which has lots of fun for a killer thriller. I think Christopher Landon may be on a roll with making killer thrillers and having lots of fun with the concepts. Like Happy Death Day having the main girl die in so many ways while attempting to stop the killer. Freaky being a freaky friday concept with a high school girl Millie (Kathryn Newton) who is struggling with a past in the family. And lacks the confidence in her social life. But when she comes across a killer known as the Butcher (Vince Vaughn). He uses some ancient artifact knife to stab Millie. And they both awaken the next day with swapped bodies. Millie being in Vince Vaughns body. And Butcher being in Kathryn Newtons body. Both actors had fun with there characters. Kathryn having a dark and sexy side. Which she lures her victims in. While Vince Vaughn enjoys playing as a high school girl. And on the fun side. Butcher is on the wanted list. So Millie and her friends are on the run from police. While trying to find Butcher and that knife to switch there bodies back.Fun concept and plot. It does add a little emotional connection with Millie. Who had a rough past and struggling emotionally. While she sees life in a different perspective as the Butchers body. It does lack the scares for a horror movie. But it does have some bloody fun thrills. The movie does have some humor added as well which has a few laughs.Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton did a great job. Celeste O Connor and Misha Osherovich were also great playing Millies closest friends.Overall, it is a thriller with lots of bloody fun. Great cast. Humor and fast energy for a killer thriller."}, {"id": 195, "text": "'Freaky' is exactly what you would expect it to be. Hip, slick, and contemporary. It has inventive kills, solid production value and a likable lead. It is similar in tone and style to Happy Death Day. And a cameo by Alan Ruck (Cameron from Ferris Beuller's Day Off) was an added bonus.Tons of praise has been given to Vince Vaughan but I feel the film belongs to Kathyrn Newton's Millie. (The same was true of 2003's Freaky Friday. Curtis got all the praise, but Lindsay's performance was the anchor of the film). Aside from Millie and The Butcher, the supporting characters are all stock, although Misha Osherovich does bring a certain whimsy and spunk to his role as the standard gay sidekick.Newton has a lovable presence and she plays the role of a serial killer with a lot of conviction and focus. I was surprised at how seriously she took the role, considering the type of film. Vaughan, on the other hand didn't possess the same nuance or energy, and I was never convinced he was inhabiting the body of a teenage girl. His mannerisms were stereotypically female but were not specific to the character of Millie-or at least the version of her we are introduced to in the beginning of the film. His performance seemed very dialed-in to me.The film suffers considerably by including the parent died last year and main character is still grieving clich\u00e9- one that is so over-used the writers should know better. Is there no other back story one can think of to provide the requisite heart these types of films require? Had the film developed a stronger backstory, it could have been far more rewarding.In any case the film provides 104 minutes of passable, mildly entertaining fare."}, {"id": 196, "text": "A fiendishly funny &amp; gleefully violent fusion of horror, heart &amp; humour, Freaky deftly balances elements of comedy, slasher &amp; coming-of-age into a fresh, lighthearted &amp; entertaining delight that gets plenty of mileage out of its outlandish concept despite the familiar beats and is all the more uplifted by Vince Vaughn's hilarious showcase.Co-written &amp; directed by Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day &amp; Happy Death Day 2U), the simple &amp; ludicrous premise may sound like a recipe for disaster on paper but Landon makes it work rather seamlessly on screen. Packing a healthy dose of thrills &amp; kills in the opening scene, the film only gets weird &amp; wicked from there on yet the momentum is never lost.There are several nods to slasher classics of the past, not all gags are effective but most do land on mark, yet what makes the ride so amusing is Vaughn behaving like a teenage girl for most of the picture, and it is easy to tell that he was having a blast playing this part. Kathryn Newton also chips in with a good input in this role reversal but Vaughn is the real highlight here and easily steals the show.Overall, Freaky is a slick, swift &amp; snappy comedy slasher that's brought to life with verve &amp; vibrance and delivers exactly what the premise promised. A fun, thrilling &amp; entertaining extravaganza that doesn't aim for much other than offering its viewers an enjoyable &amp; pleasant cinematic fare, Christopher Landon's latest doesn't bother itself with where its limitations lie and instead just takes its crazy idea &amp; runs with it. Definitely worth a shot."}, {"id": 197, "text": "I'm a fan of Happy Death Day, so when I saw that Christopher Landon was returning to make another comedic slasher, and this time it was rated R and starring Vince Vaughn, I could barely contain my excitement. COVID has us all spending the majority of our time in the safety of our own homes, but I gladly risked infection to watch this movie in a semi-full theatre (and yes, one member of my audience happened to be coughing at an intermittent basis). Now, a few days after my showing, I'm happy to report that not only do I not have the coronavirus, but Freaky is one fine film.I had a smile on my face for about 90% of this films running time. From its bloody start that's reminiscent of the best of 80s slashers to its very funny second act that leads to a tense final 20 minutes, Freaky delivers one hour and forty minutes of flat out fun. Let's talk about the horror: Filled to the brim with ridiculously horrific kills and geysers of gushing blood, if you enjoy slasher films, you will 100% like this movie. Christopher Landon didn't skimp on the violence, or the tension. With a cat-and-mouse game in someone's giant mansion and a fight in a high school woodshop classroom, Freaky has enough blood and gore to satisfy even the most diehard slasher fans.In terms of comedy, Freaky delivers in spades. Vince Vaughn is pitch perfect in the role he was born to play: that of a teenaged girl. There are so many hilarious set pieces that will have you squirming and laughing at the same (just wait for the already infamous car sequence - you'll know it when you see it). It also helps that Vince is a genuinely good actor, and when paired with the fantastic and utterly gorgeous Kathryn Newton, this film becomes elevated to new heights. A silly horror-comedy has no right employing actors as good as these, but Christopher Landon seems to realize that grade-A actors improve grade-B material; and that's not to say that the story here is bad, because it isn't. In fact, the basic premise of a high school girl switching bodies with a serial killer is so unique that even the most jaded movie-goer will find themselves entertained at the concept.Freaky is fun - if you're looking for a good time at the movies, 2020 didn't have much to offer you, until now. I would highly recommend this movie to comedy and horror lovers alike; if you happen to enjoy both genres, you just found your perfect cup of tea."}, {"id": 198, "text": "It's a lot of horror elements to it like Scream, but it never shy away from the fact it's also a comedy.

And now have 24 hours to swap back before it become permanent. Vince Vaughn plays his part quite we'll, one when where he is the killer, he got inspired a little off of Michael Myers(Halloween) and Jason Voorhees(Friday The 13th), and then when he's a teenage girl in a 6'5 mans body, then he shifts from scary to funny like no problem,. Kathryn Newton is also great has the shy Millie, and also goes into a great shift when the killer enters her body, she sells it well with a cold eye stare. Supporting actors also really shine in there roles, the movie never tries to be something that it's not, if you loved both Happy Death Days, then I hope ya'll will give Freaky a look."}, {"id": 199, "text": "I really like where Vince Vaughan's career has gone in later years. He was undoubtedly one of the funniest actors working in the business in his earlier years, but these days he's more than happy to show his versatility. Films like 'Hacksaw Ridge', 'Brawl in Cell Block 99' and 'Arkansas' have benefitted so much because of his presence. Now a film like 'Freaky' comes along where he gets to play two characters, and does both masterfully. As a giant, menacing serial killer his is highly credible, and then playing a teenage girl in a giant's body he is hilarious to watch. This was a fun ride.The film starts with a truly great opening sequence. It was tense, funny, smart and creative. Not enough horror movies - or any genre of films to be fair - remember the importance of starting their films off with a bang. There are some extremely dumb characters decisions that are going to annoy some people, although at times the decisions almost seemed so dumb that the movie may have been parodying the genre. I'm not entirely sure about that one.'Freaky' is 'The Hot Chick' meets 'Freaky Friday' meets... pick any slasher horror movie you like. The concept was a lot of fun and the movie itself worked pretty well due to some smart writing and good casting. There's a lot to like here. My advice would be just sit back and enjoy the ride."}, {"id": 200, "text": "Freaky is to Freaky Friday what Happy Death Day was to Groundhog Day. Essentially a horror comedy spin on the body-swap genre of movies, Freaky tells the story of a young insecure high school senior swapping bodies with a deranged serial killer, and has 24 hours to undo it before the swap is permenant.The biggest standout is the performances of Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton, especially when they play the 'swapped' versions of the characters. Vince Vaughn does a fantastic job playing a funny, awkward and nerdy teenage girl, similar to Jack Black's performance in Jumanji, and Kathryn is incredible as a serial killer in the body of a teen, especially as she tries to figure out how to effectively kill without the strength of her original body.This movie certainly isn't perfect, but I honestly can't think of any specific issues I have with it. Freaky knows exactly what it wants to be, and does that very well. I'm very happy I got to see this in cinemas. This is certainly a dumb fun crowd pleaser, but not quite as 'dumb' as you might expect from the premise.Definitely worth the watch. I personally think it's better than Happy Death Day, but with the pandemic, I don't think it'll be as successful as that film. I was all by myself in the theatre (albeit for a matinee showing) so not sure if it'll get the recognition it deserves. I personally am a big fan of this recent Horror Comedy trend coming from Blumhouse. Looking forward to seeing what they do next."}, {"id": 201, "text": "As I sat down to watch the 2020 movie titled Freaky, I must admit that I wasn't really expecting the movie to be very outstanding or memorable. But still, it had Vince Vaughn in it, so chances were that it would be watchable.Turns out that Freaky was surprisingly good. This movie totally surprised me. I will say that the movie started out by having me thinking it was just a senseless rip-off of the Friday the 13th movies, but that all changed - and for the better.The movie's storyline turned out to be one that brought suspense, comedy and thrills along with it, mixing the elements in a very enjoyable manner. I was genuinely entertained by what writers Michael Kennedy and Christopher Landon managed to deliver for Freaky.Now, if you think Freaky Friday meets Friday the 13th, then you actually have the result that is Freaky. I kid you not! And it works out so very, very well. And yeah, a body-swap horror comedy done the way that director Christopher Landon did with Freaky just worked marvelously.I will say that Vince Vaughn definitely had nailed some iconic and classic Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees moves and mannerisms in the beginning of the movie, and he pulled it off so very well. But when the story progressed and The Butcher (played by Vince Vaughn) switched bodies with Millie (played by Kathryn Newton) the movie took a turn for the better, and it become absolutely splendid.And it should be said that there were so many nods towards established and well-known horror movies throughout the course of Freaky, and that was just so much fun to pick up on.Freaky was made so enjoyable and entertaining mostly by Vince Vaughn's performance as a teenage girl trapped in a hulking body of a mass murdered. There were just so many laughs to be had there, and his ways of delivering the dialogue, his expressions, his mannerisms and behavior all just came together so well for a very, very funny outcome.This was definitely a very good movie, and I can highly recommend that you sit down to watch it if you have the chance. My rating of Freaky is a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.

He takes this concept we have seen so often - echoes of the obvious Freaky Friday, sure, and even for a couple of minutes Big, but I see a lot more of Face/Off once this teenage girl is embodied by a serial killer and that's as high a compliment I could think to grant - and uses his R rating for hilarious bloodshed, and then some (body parts do come apart at points) while taking the poss out of what it means to be a somewhat neglected/bullied teen girl... Or Vince Vaughn.Vaughn hasn't been this funny in (checks calendar, holy sheet man) 15 years, which is when Wedding Crashers gave him that opening ten minutes of raucous insanity with some other moments of inspired dialog. Here he commits completely to embodying this type, but also makes her human as well. And when Catherine Newton is swapped with this Blissfield Butcher (and of course the town is called Blissfield), she especially goes to town, perfects the Kubrick stare and gets to have fun being the violent psychotic type (who, you know, can get knocked around a lot being a teenage girl). Where Landon falters is with the casting and writing of Millie's co-patriots, who are (Patton Oswalt voice) GAY BEST FRIEEEND and sorta woke black girl, and in those brief but notable moments when it means to be more heartfelt (a scene between Butcher/Millie and the mother in a dressing room between doors is exoected) doesn't work as well as it should, which is where Death Day has the edge.Where it excels is as a self-conscious and knowing horror comedy, which occasionally goes for drawing out suspense and shocks and is by no means bad at it but nothing we haven't seen before (keen lighting for that, uh, haunted indoor mini-golf set, I think) and draws out giant belly laughs at the kinds of jokes and dialog and even physical comedy that logically has been done but is executed with enthusiasm and two very game performers. It'll be an ideal party movie for the teens of many stripes for a while and gives me more of what I'd want out of a Scream sequelboot than I know Ill get when the time comes."}, {"id": 204, "text": "For those who enjoyed Jack Black getting to role-play as a hilariously sassy teenage girl stuck in a man's body in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, you'll get to see the same schtick here in Freaky- Vince Vaughn's soul is swapped with an outcast teenage girl. He's more hilarious than the film has the right to be, but also frightening as the Blissfield Butcher. Kathryn Newton in her two roles also have considerable effect, switching from the typical outcast student girl next door to the hot serial killer next door. Of course it's essentially Freaky Friday the 13th, but it also harkens to Face/Off (of which I now want to see an official Horror equivalent to).In brass tacs, this is a one-and-done effort built mostly of spare parts and every high school screenplay cliche in the book. Early on in the film, every student and teacher has that Netflix syndrome where they talk 30-60 overly clever words a minute. There's the jagoff jocks that turn into wannabe murderers, snarky mean girls, a stereotypical gay token sidekick. Add in a sibling rivalry (the sister is a police officer which is cool), a dead family member and alcoholic parent that serves some pretense for an arc that weaves in and out; but nothing of major impact comes of it and especially with the somewhat abrupt ending.Freaky can serve as a nice pitstop for those wanting to visit the theater, but if you're looking for another true quality picture worth the cash and travel- that will have to wait. Grade- C+. 2.5 out of 4 stars."}, {"id": 205, "text": "A high-concept film combining elements of films like Freaky Friday, Friday the 13th and Scream, Freaky is entertaining enough for people who don't mind the mingling of disparate genres. If you don't like taking liberties with genres, well, then, for a family friendly comedic Disney film, see the original Freaky Friday, which starred a very young Jodie Foster (15 years old). For a straight horror film see Friday the 13th. Scream is a self-aware slasher film which had fun with the genre and its tropes.For fans of slasher slash horror films, Freaky is par for the course as far as the gore goes for MA 15+ films. The plot involves two people unintentionally swapping bodies: a middle-aged man who is a serial killer (played by Vince Vaughn) and a teenage high school girl (Millie, played by Kathryn Newton). I can't say that Freaky Friday started off that genre of story but it's where I first came across it as a child, watching rental videos. Now, obviously, you're wondering how on Earth two people can swap bodies. You're overthinking things! Just go with it!The film is amusing enough in the comedy department. Can you imagine a cute teenage girl trying to be a serial killer? Absurd, right? Well...not as sublimely ridiculous as an even younger Hit-Girl (played by Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz when she was 12 years old) in the gloriously violent superhero film Kick-Ass. When Freaky is not being bloody or sexual (sex scenes are minimal in this film but there is sexual talk and moments of sexual menace), it does later come across as a comedic Disney action film.The only person whose name I knew in the cast was Vince Vaughn, which I knew for his work in comedy films (right now I can't think of a film that I've seen with him in it but I'm not a film nerd). I can't say that I could have come up with his name to star in a film in which he plays a serial killer whose body is inhabited by a teenage girl. However, if someone had mentioned his name I'm sure that I would gone along with it as an appropriate choice. It's hard to say what names that I would have come up with for this role. Steve Carrell, perhaps, though he is terminally short and one scene would have been weakened with a short man doing it (the scene with Vince and a teenage boy in a shower room at high school).Whilst you get scenes of bloody horror, you do get meta humour and sociological satire. Millie is not a stereotypical teenage girl like you see in Hollywood films. She's attractive but bland, like her female best friend, Nyla (played by Celeste O'Connor). Her male best friend, Josh (played by Misher Osherovich) is gay and sassy and is the most interesting of the three of them. He comes up with some of the meta humour and sociological observations in the film.Freaky is not a film that takes itself seriously but that being said, it does its mocking with a straight face. Vince Vaughn perhaps best exemplifies that. Playing a teenage girl, he is almost subtle with it. He doesn't over-egg the pudding of his performance. In fact, there is a really 'interesting' scene with his character in the back seat of a car with a teenage boy who Millie has a crush on. The two actors in this scene must know how absurd the film is at this point but they bravely push on. Vince could quite possibly earn an Academy Award for Best Actor just for this scene!I don't know if there are plans for any sequels to this film, turning it into a franchise. That being said, if they do plan sequels, I'd be surprised if they surprised me with what direction they wanted to take things. I've seen the first few Friday the 13th films and I've casually read about some of the further sequels its spawned. It's hard to imagine any sequels to Freaky breaking new ground, whatever direction they wanted to take things. On the topic of being predictable and I don't mean this in a negative sense, I could tell what was going to happen at the climax of a scene where Millie is trying to regain her body from the serial killer. I feel pleased with myself for having being able to recall the scene which presaged that moment. Maybe I should rewatch that scene though to make sure that it makes sense and there are no plot holes in it.Before I forget, there must be some dark wish-fulfilment occurring in this film. I don't have a degree in English Literature, so I can't posit in detailed terms Freudian notions of transference or whatever but I do have to observe that the choice of murder victims is well set up and you could theorise notions of dark desires, displacement, transference or schizophrenia in these choices. To be more transparent about what I'm saying, I'm suggesting that these are the kind of everyday choices that ordinary people might fantasise about after a bad experience with someone.Lastly, I do have to mention some plot holes...or just self-aware absurdities created for the film. Firstly, the first murder committed by the serial killer in their new guise...and what, exactly, was that device doing in a high school changing room? Secondly, how, exactly, was the serial killer able to continue on, after the 'resolution' to the body swap issue after they'd been......with regards to that second plot hole, that pretty much seems a bog standard scenario for those slasher films where the killer is like the ones in Friday the 13th and Halloween.Oh, the score for the end credits reminded me of the theme from the film Jaws."}, {"id": 206, "text": "Blum House has successfully refreshed the horror genre several times with good ideas and more irreverent tone. The recent box office success like Happy Death Day, its follow up or Invisible Man shows that you still get good mileage of the classics with some imagination. Freaky is basically a version of Freaky Friday but this time the body exchange is between a very insecure and shy student and a violent serial killer. The prologue of the movie is quite promising for slasher films fans. Four young persons are killed in very violent way. The killer gets away with a sacrificial dagger by mistake with some magic characteristics. Vince Vaughn is the killer and is really terrifying in those first scenes. Then enters Kathryn Newton; the shy adolescent who after a failed attempt by the psycho swaps bodies with the killer. Sounds interesting ? And funny ?. Well it really is; and Vaughn is excellent as the killer and is even better and lots of fun as the adolescent girl. Sadly Newton is not near as convincing and/or good in any of the parts. The rest of the cast is decent but cliched. The gay and the black friend, the controlling mother, the school bullies, etc. While the first four death are fine, set setup and the middle of the movie lags with unnecessary sentimental dialogs and stupid actions/decisions. The third act and epilogue recover the pace; but you keep waiting for more deaths and / or more comedy or perhaps both. In brief; entertaining but not as fun as Happy Death Day"}, {"id": 207, "text": "I guessed I enjoyed Freaky more than I was supposed to. And that's mostly due to Vince Vaughn, who rises above the mundane script, adding little comedic touches of his own. Otherwise, this is a straightforward teen slasher that comes bundled with its modern clich\u00e9s. Vince Vaughn is an actor who has played tougher roles of late (especially in the Craig S Zahler films), but one who hasn't forgotten what he's incredibly good at. He plays serial killer 'The Butcher' (\u00e0 la Jason Voorhees, minus the texture) who switches bodies with a reserved 17-year-old high-schooler named Millie (Kathryn Newton).Millie's backstory is a complete 'seen-that-before', replete with a dead dad angle, a cop sister and a mostly drunk but caring mother. Her friends, one black and the other gay, round up the character sketches. Things only get interesting when Millie and The Butcher switch bodies. For more than half the film, Vince plays a teenage girl and generates the loudest laughs. Newton, on the other hand, doesn't have much to do except alternating between foxy and vicious. So, this clearly isn't her film (performance-wise) though she's compensated with some pretty fun kill-scenes.This is as good a throwback teen slasher as it can get - nonsensical, entertaining, and downright gory. However, Freaky also feels like this toned down high-school romance hiding quietly under its slasher layers. Yes, there are jarring tonal disparities but if there's one thing holding it all together, it's the sheer delight of seeing Vince prance around like a teenager. Also, Vince's version of Millie is a lot more buoyant and chatty. I'd say this is a good thing even if it slightly messes with film's continuity. The extended climax is what made me cut half a star because it felt completely unnecessary. Nonetheless, you'll certainly be entertained by most of what Freaky has to offer."}, {"id": 208, "text": "If I'm being honest I was expecting another Disney type PG13 horror version of the classic body swap movies. Wrong! Four people die brutally before the opening credits roll on Freaky. There is genuine horror on the screen that might make you squirm and look away. Like all good horror movies it mixes both the terror with comedy and a self awareness that's been apparent in this genre since the 90's. Blumhouse have produced some of the scariest movies of this century and now you can add this slasher. Try if you will to picture 6 footer Vince Vaughan as a teenage girl in the backseat of a car kissing her boyfriend. OK too scary. Vince puts in an outstanding performance as The Blissfield Butcher and its not the first time we've seen his scary or effeminate side. Who remembers the remake of Psycho? Kathryn Newton stands her ground brilliantly leaping from bullied schoolgirl to deranged serial killer. Freaky is a mash of Halloween, Carrie&amp; Friday the 13th plus a few other classic fright movies get a nod in this comedy, horror, thriller.

First off, Vince Vaughn is fantastic in this film, in both parts. He provides a hilarious depiction of his female co-star, as well as proving to be an interesting and frightening killer. He is by far the films standout, and although the other actors are rather good as well, there is no doubt that Vaugn certainly had more to work with, there for more to do. It's a nice, fun change of pace from the typical oh so serious horror films we have received recently, an is truly entertaining all throughout. The beginning is a bit average, nothing too special, but I found myself kind of amazed at how well this plot worked in this film, and how well it was executed. The kills are creative and gruesome, the cinematography is often excellent, and the music is often rather fun as well- if not a bit expected. In the end, Freaky is a creepy little delight, that proves to be rather funny, as well as somewhat thrilling to watch at times. It has familiar moments, weaker moments, but it's a delightfully eccentric twist that is executed properly and very well. Certainly one I would be willing to watch again.

In the beginning horror movie section, the film practically holds a clipboard and just proceeds to check everything off before you get to say hello, That's our villain. That's the girl. That's her problem. This is her family and their recent tragedy. These are her friends. Happy Death Day director Christopher Landon executed in an intentionally cheesy self-aware meta fashion. Vince Vaughn's serial killer wears an Incan mask that resembles Jason Voorhees. The tongue-in-cheekiness is intentionally cheesy and funny at times, other times it is just cheesy and formula.At the point of the body switch, the genre shifts to being a straight-up situation comedy. The irony and the jokes are in place but they are not tight enough nor pushing its clever premise far enough to get maximum laughs. Vince Vaughn is hilarious playing out the body swap gag but isn't given enough to do because he is always hurried along to the next scene. I laughed a few times but didn't leave with a full stomach of seeing Vince Vaughn acting like a high school girl.Originally titled Freaky Friday the 13th, which is actually a better title, the film never tonally reconciles the meta-horror and the Freaky Friday family comedy elements together. At times, when Millie as Vince Vaughn is running around the high school with her friends searching for the killer while hiding from the adults, it feels like a Goosebumps movie. When there are brutal killings, it is R-rated graphic to an extent of where I feel like I am supposed to laugh at the violence. I can't quite give an R-rated dark comedic belly laugh at a brutal killing cause of the PG-13 nature embedded into the context.If director Christopher Landon said the point was to have both the PG-13 and R-rated elements together, I would say fine, but the script and the jokes have to be clever enough to make that meta tone consistent. It is as if the speed of how fast they made this movie has compromised the potential of its own premise. There is a great premise here. I do think the humor and the tone could have been drafted some more and chisel the dialogue.I know there's a better version of this that could have been made."}, {"id": 212, "text": "Being 40+ one of my biggest fun slasher movie was Scream at the theatre in 1996. I can also add Urban Legend and I Know What You Did Last Summer. This is almost kind of like a wannabe Scream for todays kids. And I get it, it's fun, has some good kills and it is with and about teenagers. If I were 16 being at the theatre with my friends messing around, I would love this, I think.It's not at all a bad movie, it's just the wrong decade, or even millennium, for me. I had my teenager slasher moment back in the day. I will admit that Vince did a really good job here. I had to laugh here and there.If I should compare it to some other movies, it would be a mashup with Scream, Child's Play and Friday The 13th and maybe a bit of Trading Places, with Eddie Murphy. That should almost cover all the bases. I will admit, it was quite fun at times.I liked Happy Death Day 1 &amp; 2 better, with the complication of time and space.I can't go higher than 6.5/10 on this. But hey, you could have more fun than me!"}, {"id": 213, "text": "This is pretty good. A few laughs, an interesting concept, good acting, and overall a good watch. But this could have been a lot better, and it is not nearly as funny as 'happy death day'.The negatives: First of all Kathryn Newton is gorgeous, sexy and pretty far from being a weirdo hanging out with losers and playing an undesirable girl. It is impossible to buy into that premiss. She also looks like her age i.e. 23yo, so not really high school. The writing and directing is also a bit off. They could have made this more creepy, less peppy, and darker but still put in a couple of better jokes, but they did not. I also think they should have taken the concept a bit further and had the killer in Millie's body explore the sexual bits more. The writing about Millie's family with a dead husband, how they act towards each other, who they are, and what they do is all very generic, very boring, very lazy writing. I suppose that was sort of the point, but it does not work. And finally, with better writing, better directing, and perhaps a few changes to characters they should have also draged it out a bit more and really hammer in the creepy-ness and stalking feel of normal slasher movies. Due to the above this almost feels pretentious, almost too much of here we are! We are twisting the slasher genre and we want you to laugh and this is a great movie! - vibe from this.With that said, and almost contradictory to what I just said, this movie also don't take itself too serious. This is gory, but also creative. This is fun and good watch. I just wish they put in a little bit more effort into making the movie and it would have been great.The good stuff is about the actors - they all do a great job. The premiss of Freaky Friday with a slasher twist is fun and interesting. Kathryn is very good as a killer, perhaps she has found her calling? Set design and music is used very well and there are a lot of fun good moments.I really recommend this, especially if you have nothing else to watch. I give this a 7/10, a pretty weak 7 though, but I had fun watching this and I love the idea. The movie is sadly not as funny and great as it wants to be, but this is still a very good watch. Check it out!"}, {"id": 214, "text": "Freaky is a fun horror-comedy where you don't have to think too hard and can sit back and enjoy the ride. It has all the gore someone would want in a slasher flick with some creative kills filled with cartoonish reactions. It mashes the genres up in a fun and interesting way while staying completely true to itself.From Director Christopher Landon, Freaky is a fun-filled blood galore. While not perfect, it's still a great entertainer joined together by amazing performances and a decent script. Both the horror and comedic aspects of the film are established well with graphic kills and actual moments of suspense while the characters, especially the leads, react to the absurdity of the situation. The main thing I didn't like was that not too much backstory is given for the killers origins or the ancient knife responsible for the body swap. It's a bit cartoonish as well and that works both in favor and against it at moments. For example, the lead is a despised girl who is constantly bullied in school because she doesn't look like other girls. One day, she ties her hair, puts on a leather coat together with red lipstick, and now she a hot chick who grabs everyone's attention. Though, those are minor things that do not drag down the immensely fun and well-crafted story.Acting-wise, Vince Vaughn is just too good in both his characters and so is Kathryn Newton. They both completely own their characters. Though, as mentioned previously, the lack of development with Vince Vaughn's character is a major drawback. Celeste O'Connor is good as Nyla and so is Misha Osherovich as Josh (Millie's friends). The rest of the cast also do the required decent enough job.A major asset of the film is the brilliantly executed set-pieces when it comes to killing. The Cinematography by Lorie Rose is also decent though it had some lighting issues. The Production Design team also did a decent job in creating the high school set up together with the aftermath's of the killings even if it had to look cartoonish in some instances. Another asset was the Editing which showed great pace in build-up to the story carried all the way to the finish, though, as mentioned before, it could not pick up the exclusion of The Butcher's or the knives back story. The music from Bear McCreary was disappointing, though, as it never gave you the chills of a horror-comedy.Overall, Freaky is surprisingly a really good film filled with a fun rollercoaster of events and thrilling kills. Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton both play their roles excellently, and it could not have been as good without them. It's really recommended. Please Hollywood make more mindless (not dumb), entertaining, movies."}, {"id": 215, "text": "Mashing up genres and recalling mean teen cinema's finest moments, Freaky delivers a fun new take on the slasher, but fails to embed itself as anything more.Millie gets attacked one night by mythical madman, The Blissfield Butcher, while waiting to be picked up from school. She survives the attack but wakes up the next morning in his room of horrors, and he wakes up in what looks exactly like his idea of a room of horrors (Pitch Perfect posters, cutesy pajamas and a mum that just made banana french toast). Millie finds power in being a hulking monster of a man, and the Butcher finds it much easier to lure kids to their death (though, frustratingly, with the strength of a 17 year old girl who is not an athlete). Unlike the film it apes most of its material from, not many lessons are learned and so the film has to rely on its hyper gory kill scenes and cast chemistry to do the heavy lifting.The main attraction here is Vince Vaughan. Having disappeared from mainstream cinema for a while, he's back in fine action as both a sadistic killer of horny teens and as a shy, nice girl. Any scene that lets him (as Millie) rediscover her new body is just hilarious. Unfortunately, for Kathryne Newton, the job is much harder. She has to play both the shy, nice girl, and the hulking masked killer, without the mask. The latter is never consistent enough despite some times being funny and menacing. This is probably because the Butcher is not at all defined before the swap, so Newton has to create a new character within a new character, and stick to it.The film has to juggle its existence as a genre flick while also working within the confines of both a Teen coming of age/ school sucks frame. Unfortunately, it doesn't succeed fully to find interesting angles, and, while direction is tight, there's some inconsistencies in the delivery of so many references. Still, it is worth the watch, for Vaughn alone, and I can't wait to see how any sequels will play out!"}, {"id": 216, "text": "\ud83d\udd2a FREAKY (2020) REVIEW\ud83d\udd30 Streaming : Amazon Prime (US)If you have a liking for slasher flicks, then freaky will definitely quench your thirst in that genre.
