I was sort of excited to see a well filmed horror piece as I hit play, but honestly I knew the ending before the first 20 minutes. Yes it's been done, no it wasn't that great, if you're looking for a better version, try The Game, if you're looking to waste time and be a little entertained, try this."}, {"id": 1, "text": "At the end the main character thinks all his friends have been killed by a sadistic gang so when he runs into the boss of that gang he batters him, naturally. He kills him all while his friends, whose deaths were just part of a big ruse to prank the main character, just stands there watching with their mouths open. At least fifteen people just stands watching while their best friend is in the process of killing an innocent guy. And it is totally their fault that he kills him.Up until the end the movie was quite alright, an ok hostel rip off with a bit of social media thrown in there. Perfectly fine. But oh my god what a stupid ending. They planned this prank so meticulously and yet they didn't think about having someone else than the main antagonist doing the big reveal?? Perhaps one of his best friends would have been a better choice.. Maybe? The ending brought the movie from approx 6/10 down to 3/10.By the way, I recognize the main arc of the story from a great episode of Twilight Zone I saw 30 years ago. It's the one where a woman is secretly planning her husbands birthday party and he thinks she is cheating on him (because of all the secret phone calls and hush-hush). And so he kills her on the day of the celebration and drags her body into a room where all his friends are just waiting to get the party started. Haha. Exactly the same ending. But that episode was so much better than this movie. Thank you for reading this far. All the best /Leif."}, {"id": 2, "text": "The film starts slowly and is not very interesting. Well copied at hostel, saw and escape room. Not a good film, although the film does have some nice moments"}, {"id": 3, "text": "What a friggin bore !!!!!! Do not waste your time. Was so boring &amp; predictable !! You can see whats coming from the start. Badly written &amp; even worst acting. None of the characters are likeable. Keegan Allen can't act his way out of a paper bag. Give this one a big pass !!!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "This movie is nothing worth remembering. I enjoy Holland Rosen as an actress; so I gave it a go. The story is been there, done that 100% nothing new.The lead is absolutely horrible at acting; but that's nothing new either as he was when he had part in Pretty Little Liars as Toby also. 5 years later and zero improvement on acting skills.The story is predictable and the ending is absolutely trash. A whole room of friends that weren't really killed standing around in the dark as they watch their best friend murder the man he thought had killed them all- only top pop up after all surprise; you were pranked only to gasp at the dead man on the ground and then cut to credits.It was a brainless way to fill time but made entirely unbearable by the ending."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I pay to see this crap so you don't have to. I'm doing you a solid on this sequel to Escape Club by saving you both money and precious time. That movie had some merits, but none of these characters have redeemable features and you hope they all die a horrible death. The build up prelude character building for the first 20 minutes is a complete waste of time, just start at the Escape Room and dial it up a notch. Lousy acting, aimed at 12 year olds &amp; predictable script...that sums it up in a nutshell. I'd be surprised if you don't guess the ending in the first half hour. It's a wannabe Saw and Hostel torture fest set in Moscow, Russia with a mindless, selfish Social Media Influencer as the hero. He doesn't get it, but he would if he'd watched Michael Douglas in The Game, because this movie is a bad xerox copy....but the printer ink ran low. Please give me some brain food 'cos this ain't it. First movie I've seen on the big screen since World War C started and cinemas reopened was very disappointing."}, {"id": 6, "text": "The highlight of this film is Keegan Allen's performance. Playing an obnoxious Logan Paul social media influencer type character you can't help but hope he gets killed first. However he ends up being one of the few redeeming qualities of this film.The film takes a while to get going trying to get you to care about the characters but you won't. Once it finally does - you find yourself watching a crossover of Escape Room, Saw and Hostel. All far superior films.My partner was bored and predicted the ending however I was still entertained and was very intrigued as to how it would all end. Once it finally does - you're kind of glad it has. It is not a terrible film though and is still worth a watch for any fan of the horror genre."}, {"id": 7, "text": "A mashup of different horror/thriller movies. Not real expensive to rent, but probably only worth it if you're completely new to watching horror movies. Otherwise you've probably seen similar movies that you might like even more. As far as the movie it got a lot of suspense. I liked the characters and I thought the Russia environment was creepy. I only thought the ending was rushed. It was the opportunity to give some depth and meaning to the story as social media played a big role in the movie. Overall the movie is a bit flat but does have a certain charm to it."}, {"id": 8, "text": "I saw the movie last week.

None of The Game's finesse, pacing, storytelling, cinematography, camerawork, scripting, dialogue, acting, etc. Nothing.The pitch was literally hey studio guy, wanna re-make 1997's 'The Game' except with an additional twist where he kills a dude?Utterly disgraceful."}, {"id": 12, "text": "It's oretty fun.

Just a fun little movie. The ending though...."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Actually, the first half of this movie is better than the second half. The second half just wants to be a poor remake of Hostel and Saw. I don't want there to be any spoilers in my review, but let's just say the ending could REALLY have been better. As for the acting, it was mediocre at best. If you're like me, though, and you've absolutely run out of movies to watch, I gave it 5 stars only because everything else that's new sucks worse than this."}, {"id": 15, "text": "The movie starts off a bit hopeful, with a nice suspicious setting and a likeable cast of characters going to the event in Russia.

Not recommended for anyone."}, {"id": 16, "text": "I told my friends from the first 10 minutes what was going on. What would happened. He asked me how I could know that?! It's easy really, I have seen them all, movies since before 40 years ago. Seen them all. How the angles of the scenes were presented, the layout and all that. It's not a bad movie, it's fun in a way, just a bit to obvious and really lack of terror and mad gore.Nothing surprised me in this movie and the end I saw coming for a looong time. Too bad, could have been more fun with a better cast and budget. But all in all an OK Sunday night movie to watch in the rain. I have seen much worse.Me and my griends agreed on 6.2/10 Give it a go if you get it for free"}, {"id": 17, "text": "And not in a good way.

I watched the trailer and nothing really intrigued me about it except the two well known actors in it. And that is why I went to see it honestly, gave it the benefit of the doubt. If you are here, looking for an honest review to determine whether to watch this movie or not, I HIGHLY ADVISE FOR YOU TO SKIP THIS TRASH and watch another movie or do something else. This film was absolute trash, a waste of my time and money. Dont believe me ?

Second half of the film ensures it's not just a repeat of Escape Room and you start to wonder where the story is going. But the final twist is a little too obvious from quite early on.Nevertheless it still has some fun, thrilling moments and is better than most of the movies in this genre.Some questionable Russian accents that make you think the casting director got lazy."}, {"id": 22, "text": "This movie was entertaining; it really was. But in this case I never believed that the group was in any real danger. Usually my wife catches on to this kind of stuff, but in this case it was the other way around. Up to the end she was sceptical about my assumption but in the end I seemed to be right.The conclusion (where Cole kills Aleski) could have been a little different as far as I am concerned, I think a light-hearted fun ending would have done it more good than this ending, but judge for yourself. You will most likely be entertained for 90 minutes or so. I would have liked a Punk'd ending more that this Punk'd gone wrong ending. Why didn't anyone stop him?All in all an fun movie but when you see the ending coming after the first 15 minutes, it takes away the suspense..."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Well i've got to admit beforehand, I only went to see this movie to still my hunger for the new saw movie. And believe me; it did succeed! Even though the first half of the movie is really (and i mean REALLY) boring, it makes up for it afterwards. This movie is just a mix between Escape room, Saw and Hostel, nothing more nothing less. The only thing they added is the 'influencer' part, but it doesn't add much and you'll probably forget it during the movie. The ending is f- up and makes the movie 'better', but you'll probably see it coming from miles away.One of the most annoying things is that this movie is filled with things left unanswered or unexplained, in a way that the whole thing just doesn't maken sense in the end. Saw fans might be used to it but I can believe anyone else will be a bit frustrated afterwards.In the end; a fun movie to watch for a night out with your friends!"}, {"id": 24, "text": "Like a cross between Saw and Catacombs.

None of the characters are worth caring enough about to invest any emotion like you would a good movie."}, {"id": 26, "text": "What are the haters expecting when they watch a film like this. To me this Hostel-inspired horror film delivers on all levels. The acting is above expectation in a low budget with no-name-actors and the story works well a through.Sure the main character makes some questionable decisions, but that is kind of a part of the concept. Plus, the character isn't portrayed as the smartest kid on the block which makes it even more plausible.I like it a lot and recommend it to anyone who likes the genre."}, {"id": 27, "text": "This super low budget movie is just another imitation of a real horror flick that fails miserably. The main character is so incredibly annoying he made me want to turn it off after the first 10 minutes...but against better judgement I stayed till the end. The movie never gets off the ground. The premise is laughable and the characters have zero depth to them. 92 minutes felt like 300."}, {"id": 28, "text": "I think some of the comments here are too harsh.

There is not one original idea in the entire film.It actually gets to the point where you lose all empathy for these characters and don't really care if they make it or not.I'd recommend watching one of the original movies it rips off than waste your time here."}, {"id": 33, "text": "Follow Me turned out to be a highly derivative survival thriller that doesn't boast the chills, thrills, or even the gore. The lead character here is a vlogger, so expect all the baloney that comes with it. The film plays out like a mish-mash of Saw, Hostel, The Game and several other superior thrillers. The familiarity of the traps, dares, and torture chambers put me off. The lack of a strong protagonist (or antagonist, for that matter) can be felt throughout the film. The final twist (which I saw coming a mile away) wasn't good enough to call this perfectly serviceable piece of trash entertaining. Leave your expectations in the bin!"}, {"id": 34, "text": "World class crappy acting with a story that could have been something but unfortunately, it has not. It's a terrible version of a mix of Hostel, Saw, Escape Room, and The Game. Seriously, if you don't get the ending from the very 1st 15 minutes maximum of the movie, then you deserve to watch it! I am very generous for giving it 2, just because I have seen worst movies."}, {"id": 35, "text": "The spirit of Escape Room has risen but this time it is darker and more gruesome.

First, it's not original and extremely predictable to Horror fans. Second, acting is pretty weak. Not credible and amateurish. Last, if you're going to copy a movie (The Game) just do it better. So, overall a missed attempt to create something different. Looks like we are living on the era of coly and pasting everything. This means same old script with just a new few likes. Terrible."}, {"id": 39, "text": "I like to think I have decent taste in horror- I really liked Hereditary, Get Out was pretty good, I loved the first 3 Saw movies, The Ring (or Ringu, really was superior), The first Grudge, and I may be in the minority when I say I enjoyed Hostel (mostly). This will definitely make you think it's a lower budget Hostel take off in some parts. That said, it is NOT the 4-or-less star movie most are rating it. I even found the first act engaging enough to keep my attention. The lead was really very good, though I really only found him annoying in the first 10 minutes but after that I forgot I was supposed to consider him a one dimensional influencer vlogger etc-type. The real deal versions of these people are much more soul-sucking. You may find the gore was just right especially if you're like me and don't need much to appreciate horror &amp; some movies just overdo the gore to make up for substance- this movie has enough substance they didn't need to. I won't spoil it. You may understand what's going on but it's worth the watch anyway.

Originally titled Follow me, No Escape is like a mixture of Escape Room and Hostel as a group of youtubers find themselves in a horrific escape room in Moscow.

I really thought it was well done; very entertaining!"}, {"id": 44, "text": "The main reason for why I watched this movie was for George Jankos appearance, although it was definitely an interesting concept for the main protagonist being a big social media star. The movie was slightly underwhelming, but had a great plot twist for an ending. The movie itself is definitely heavily influenced by classic and popular horror movies.

His reaction in the end though, is understandable. They needed to think of a better way to explain him first that this wasn't real before he met the guilty man. Didn't like the ending though. Or Alexey should have stay alive or, at least, one post-credit scene with consequences of unintended murder for Cole. The idea that he should have think from time to time what he cares more about: his girl or cool content for the followers; his friends or his own life; can he make decisions by himself, without followers etc. - is great stuff to think about, as bloggers/vloggers are usually even more addictive to followers opinion than it's showed here. At the same time most of them don't even express their opinions anymore, as they need to please their followers or companies paying for ads.Accent of policemen in airport was funny, I mean too obvious it's not Russian people. Nice effort of actors though, Russian was fully understandable.

The theme was great. The traps were enteresting and even though I kinda toyed with an idea for a twist before it came to pass, you still don't really know until you do.

The difference is that the writers of The Game had a higher IQ than that of a spud, so when everything came together it was an actual surprise ending. This one is so poorly executed and clearly telegraphed that my eyes rolled so hard I nearly snapped my optic nerve. There's even (and I quote) a line in the movie that says hey, what if this is still part of the escape room and it's not over? I guess this movie either thought it was being so clever that nobody would get it or that it's audience is braindead.In any case, the movie is actually not too bad until you get to the ending. Where the audience is supposed to believe that the people who were capable of putting together a scheme so perfect that they can predict where everyone would go, tie up all loose ends, have contingency plans for all possible options...and yet they would not see that putting the main culprit, unarmed, within an arm's reach of a man pushed to the brink of his sanity...could lead to an injury to say the least. After the protagonist has been lead to believe he is in the hands of a sadistic Russian mob who have just dismembered all of his closest friends and now his own life is forfeit, they decide to put the guy who lured them into this mess next to him with just a phone and a smile. Oddly enough during the moment of righteous anger nobody tries to stop him or is near enough to yell something, and yet a few seconds later the room is filled with all the cast of the escape room, alive and well.

Sadly, they weren't creative enough to come up with any ideas of their own and even took from Die Hard 3 and Saw, which were much more creative on all counts. The first movie to come up with the same ending back in the 1970's was seen as clever, but unfortunately it's so over done at this point, that it just seems boring by 2020.If you don't mind rewatching the same ideas from many other movies, just done a little more boring, then you may enjoy this film."}, {"id": 60, "text": "You know a film is going to be bad when you hope the main protagonist will be killed as soon as possible.

We really liked/appreciated the current/topical over-the-top Instagram-celebrity thing and how that's kind of turned on our protags.

I had a feeling of fakeness during the movie and I thought to myself: no way this is actually happening.

The ending of No Escape is almost a copy of that films final few minutes. WTF. Crap acting, a horrible script and and just an all around unoriginal film, makes this one nearly unwatchable.

The film has ample amt of tension n suspense throughout, some beautiful chicks n vibrant locations of Russia. The twist is solid.

In his vlogs he undertakes exciting activities that give him and his followers an adrenaline rush. As a surprise, his friends take him to Moscow where they go to a special escape room together. Here he and his friends expect to capture one of his best vlogs. Once in the escape room, Cole and his friends learn that the challenges of the escape room seem to become life-threatening. They must all escape now before it kills them.This movie can be entertaining for people who like horror survival movies, but after a while in the movie, many situations may seem familiar. Many moments like the dangerous tasks the characters have to undergo to stay alive are much like the various traps from the Saw film series. For a better and more creative movie you better watch one of the Saw movies. If you want to see a new kind of similar movie, this movie can be entertaining if you don't go there with high expectations.The acting is done nicely by the cast, but no one else really comes to the fore in the film. Most of the cast are actually more TV actors, which can be seen in some of their acting."}, {"id": 123, "text": "Someone sat down and thought of a bunch of horror movies and ripped off ideas from 3 that I can think of. Hostel and Escape Room being two. A low budget to stick to, which really was painfully apparent.Throw in some extremely egotistical dislikeable characters who most of I really didn't care if they lived or died. I actually zoned out for a good 5 minutes through boredom and thinking about my to do list. Yes, the prospect of housework was more exciting than this movie. Despite zoning out I didn't miss anything.4 stars is being generous, but I'll give the extra star for the twist which was quite good, but didn't make up for the 90 minutes I'd already endured.Go watch Haunt 2019 instead for an exciting and good escape horror movie. Which incidentally is produced by the director of Hostel."}, {"id": 124, "text": "Honestly, I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I've seen a lot of bad horror movies, and I didn't think the writer/director's previous movie Escape Room was all that strong in the script department. I also read almost nothing but negative reviews for this movie and just wasn't expecting much. But I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.The cinematography looks nice, and the acting is really solid all around. Keegan Allen gives a great performance as the lead. That last scene - chills. You can really feel for his character.The dialogue is also good. There were actually a few moments where the dialogue was surprisingly organic, and you really got the sense that these characters have been good friends for a long time. There's a couple of cheesy vlogger lines that are generic and played up, but that's kind of the point, and for the most part those few vlogging scenes work well. The social media overlay was also well done, clean, and easy to digest. Additionally, there are some Easter Eggs if you know what you're looking for. Cole is following several people from the production of the movie like Will Wernick and Jeff and Kelly Delson. I thought that was a fun touch.I saw some critique of the lack of subtitles. There was a significant amount of Russian in this film and not a word is captioned. Personally, I didn't mind. You can basically understand what they're saying just through context - or so it seems at least. I admittedly don't speak Russian.I've also seen people say that the plot is unoriginal and a bad rip off of Saw, Hostel, etc. While some of the escape room torture puzzles are familiar, there's a lot from this movie that I haven't seen done in exactly the same way before. I actually thought the plot for this movie was fairly strong, much better than Wernick's previous Escape Room (to which this movie bears little resemblance, despite involving escape rooms and previously in production being titled Escape Room: Moscow). There's some good twists, and the plot keeps its suspense through most of the movie. The pacing was fine for me.I won't get into spoilers, but there are some logistical plot holes that end up not making much sense. By the end of the movie, you spend a lot of time reflecting and going Wait, how did they know/do/expect that? and that brings my review down a couple stars. But it's nothing egregious as I've seen some people complain about. It's your standard horror movie bad logic, which is seen enough to be tolerable by people who spend a lot of time watching the genre.Overall, this is actually a solid movie. It's not my movie of the year or anything, but it's a decent thriller that put a new spin on the genre and did it pretty well. I'd recommend it."}, {"id": 125, "text": "The start of 'Follow Me' is going to put a lot of people off, and that's a shame because the second half of this movie is brilliant. The first half didn't even bother me that much, but I know it will some other people. We meet our set of characters and the main one is a VLOGGER. So of course he has to turn his camera on and turn into this over the top, unbearable person like so many real-life VLOGGERs are. It's pretty cringey to watch. It didn't bother me because I know that those people are out there in big numbers these days and this is legitimately what they do. The character build-up in this film does go on for a while though and if you don't like these characters then that could be a struggle for you. I would implore you to stick through that though because the second half more than makes up for it.I knew nothing about the plot of this film before seeing it, so when a character mentioned a personalised Escape Room I thought hell yes that sounds like a lot of fun. Then I had to wait patiently another 20-30 minutes before the characters finally get there. But that's fine I'm okay with some character development. When they arrive at the Escape Room though the movie really kicks into life. From that moment on the movie is a non-stop action/horror/thrill fest. It's actually a really well put together sequence that I suspect won't get as much love from critics as it deserves.The final few minutes of the film blew my mind. I won't go anywhere near spoilers, I'll only say I loved it. Only a couple of issues I could really come up with for the film. There is a lot of talk in Russian without subtitles. I understand we are seeing this from the American character's perspective, so the no subtitles makes sense, however there were some quite lengthy conversations that we have to sit and watch with no idea what is being said. That was a little frustrating. Also in hindsight a few things don't entirely make sense. With a film like this that is likely always going to be the case though to be fair. Nevertheless I had a terrific time with 'Follow Me' and couldn't recommend it highly enough. A great horror flick."}, {"id": 126, "text": "Except for the scenario of the ending (not its outcome), the movie is almost perfect. I found the acting decent, and while the characters, especially the main character, are not very likeable, I found them very true-life. There is the main Vlogger, then his sidekick, and then his secondary sidekicks, it's a well-oiled machinery that generates money with needless waste of time. Behind that there are more or less normal people with the right nose for their business. To deliver more thrills, the protagonists agree to an ultimate escape room experience in Moscow, and this seemingly goes very very wrong. I will not spoil the movie, but one who pays attention always gets a little hint what's going on. The pacing after a rather slow but entertaining introduction of what a Vlogger's life would be (I liked this part very much), the thrilling game changes into, what we wcould call it, a Russian version of what was to be expected. Fast and brutal. There is no flaw of any kind to be found until the very end. Which is, as I mentioned, not as carefully arranged as it should be, but aside from that, it is very reasonable, as any other reaction and decision during the whole scenario. Put yourself into such a situation and you may understand some reactions easily. I have a theory that many reviewers here did not really follow or did not want to understand the movie, as it (intentionally) mimics (partially) some mainstream Horror movie series of the near past and makes its own story from their origin, in a way like One Cut of the Dead (which was a bit more funny, I have to concede)."}, {"id": 127, "text": "Thought it was gonna he 1 of those hand held movies &amp; thought about that &amp; a social media star didn't sit well &amp; was so close to turning it off but glad I didn't.

Matter of fact after a few minutes I didn't even think about the acting so that's my judge of whether it's bad acting or not. Go watch troll 2 if u wanna see bad acting. And even that movie has became 1 of my all time favs for the very fact that they just cast bad actors like they used to sadly. Even tho bad ones can't easily be found if ya look hard enough. The story I thought was good. Idk, u can do a lot worst. The horror genre ain't exactly busting outta the seam with gems. This is about par for the course of your average 2010-2020 horror movie.

I would watch other movies first if u have a list but if your searching for a movie without 1 in mind &amp; like the genre &amp; enjoyed movies like hostel or 1 of the many escape room movies made in the last 5 yrs. give it a shot.
