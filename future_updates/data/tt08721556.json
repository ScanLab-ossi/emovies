Audiences will rush into the theatres for movies made by him without a star cast or big budget just like Hollywood directors Quentin Tarantino or Christopher Nolan. We all know he won't disappoint and it will be worth watching in theatres. Jallikattu is the most anticipated movie in his career so far on par with Double Barrell. We all waited for Double Barrell mainly because of the stellar cast and big budget. But for Jallikkattu, all the expectations are for LJP. The film screened in various film festivals and received applauds. Jallilattu is a 91 minute roller-coaster. The movie never slows down. The pacing of the movie increases more and more from start to end. A big salute for Girish Ganagadharan. His cinematography is simply the best in Indian movies in recent times. The bgm was also very good. As for the performances, every cast did an excellent job. Jallikattu proves that LJP is getting more and more good by his every next movies. Highly waiting for his next release."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Its purely fiction made flick from lijo, Not a realistic in nature to catch a Buffalo it don't need 200 people moreover its just a domestic animal not wild animal like lion, tiger or elephant.

Taking his leaf out of Kamal Hassan who went from brilliance to self-glorifcation. Man turning to savage over his need was the motto, good enough. But the way he has portrayed is where the problem lies. Unnecessary loud music and some nonsensical camera angles reminded me of the downfall of RGV. The brilliance of Lijo Jose lies in his witty/ironical dialogues and characters that he builds which we witnessed in Angamaly n ee ma yo. There is no relevant/strong character here in this movie, no sensitive dialogues and a very forgettable plot. I thought of leaving the theatre during the interval but only stayed with the hope that Lijo will come up with something before the climax. But I was utterly disappointed. At the end, I was wondering why I allowed myself to go through this ordeal all the way through. I am sorry to myself."}, {"id": 14, "text": "LJP s' directing in the film was outstanding.

One of the best cinematic experience. And I'm sure film like this, can't be produced by hindi film industry. Girish Gangadharan, the cinematographer of the film is the main hero of the film. Long takes by director Lijo Jose Pellissery is brilliant. The final sequence of the film provides some of the most haunting and bone - chilling visuals that I've not seen in Indian film. The music by Prashant Pillai and sound design by Renganaath Ravee is the music that will stay with me for a long period of time. I'm highly recommending everyone to catch it on amazon prime."}, {"id": 18, "text": "This film's title is misleading with its content. Tamils never eat or kill Cow meat after Jallikattu Sport. When a foriegner watches this movie they will think Jallikattu is a sport to kill and eat Buffalo meat, which is completely wrong. Jallikattu sport is to find the Healthiest and Strongest Bull, later cows are allowed to mate with the strongest Bull, so that the future cow/bull species will be healthier and stronger."}, {"id": 19, "text": "The title Jallikattu is exemplary Misleading and how on earth a Buffalo is related to Jallikattu... It is no way reflects or relevant to the Tamil's traditional Bull chasing sport which actually helps to preserve and save the variety of country bulls and to select the strong and healthy ones for breeding and most primarily for the milk which contains A2 protein which is super essential for babies and children. A2 protein milk cannot be produced by cross breed or Jersey cows. We Tamils feed the bulls with food which have proteins and carbs all the year, it will grow as our family member, we shower love on it as we do to our children, Whole family erupts in joy and celebrate if it won in jallikattu festival, when it dies we cry as as if our family member dies....We conduct funeral and bury it in our own land with full respect. Tamils never see Jallikattu Bull as a food or animal."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Lijo unleashes a guileful pandemonium. Jallikattu is one of the year's biggest discoveries. The movie is an incredible visceral and sensational journey spanning over 90 minutes which also deals with politics, religion, humanity, morality, revenge, nemesis and basic human emotions.

It gets you hooked with very tight screenplay and so much going on at the same time. it doesn't gives you any time to catchup with the characters and event, it just expects you to just jump right into the action.

Its really a roller coaster ride for me especially its storytelling through visuals make me feel I'm inside that 3d atmosphere. If you are watching the movie in phone suggesting to wear headset as the exhilarating energy comes to you."}, {"id": 24, "text": "There are so many symbolisms and metophors and inner meaning in this film! The butcher's name is Kalan Varky, In Malayalam, Kalan mean's Yamaraj (He is the lord of death and justice, Buffalo is his vehicle), So basically, the people running behind the buffalo symbolises, the men running towards death. In most of the first half (Daylight is prominent through out the scenes), the buffalo tramples things like fire, vegetation, wheeled cart, bank, and even interfere the politics created by humans, in all these we can see the unity of the people. All these sequences can be a reference to man's Evolution as a Social being The Second half (mostly shows night time) represents the spiralling down of man's unity and his path towards his real inner being that is beast with all his selfish interests, lust, pride, toxic masculinity, machismo, cheating, fighting (mainly shown by the character called Antony), Even law and orders become useless. All these scenes depicts that, man's basic behaviors haven't changed a bit since the olden times, remember that our ancestors were Hunter gatherers, the males of the tribe would do anything to protect their families and children from wild animals, females used to consider the best males are the one who brings meat/ food to their home, Macho behavior in males, competition between other males to become the Alfa male of the tribe, and much more. And finally when they found the buffalo, they literally turns blind and selfish and tries to claim their part , here due to crowd's mob mentality, they starts to behave like sheeps (or like flies who blindly follows each other towards the light and gets killed ). The final scene where the old man meets the buffalo (Yamaraj's buffalo m), may symbolises that it's time for his death, In the film, rope has an important role! The rope is like a paradox, In life on Earth, the rope represents freedom to the old man and confinement to the Buffalo. But in that scene, they both realize that they were wrong about their notions of freedom while they were living on Earth. Towards the end of the movie, you can hear the breath of the old man's and the buffalo's breath merging into one last breath, showing us that there is no difference between humans and animals, And no matter how we see ourselves as civilized and superior to other animals, we still are the same in front of Nature. The last primitive men scene and the tribal theme sound through out the movie, were the Clues for this message. The director in one interview says that The line between man and the beast dissolves throughout the movie. That last primitive men scene turned the whole movie into a completely different perspective and it is that simple scene which explains the whole movie. The animation part showed us how the primitive man, slowly engulfed in flames, the same flames he used to cook other animals,his invention, is now burning his body after his death (as in Hindu funeral) and slowly he disappears back into nothingness! (screen turns into complete black, The End) If you can keep all these in mind and re watch the movie, I bet it's going to be a completely different experience and you may find many more symbolisms which I haven't mentioned here ! This film simultaneously keep you entertained and force us to think, that's what art films like this and Parasite does to you. This is not a normal masala movie that spoon feed you the take away message, that's why most people didn't like this movie. But for critiques and film buffs this movie delivers everything from good cinematography, sound effects, casting, acting, realism, technical aspects to clear public message,which I think is universal!, that's why I think this movie is nothing but a Masterpiece and deserves a shot at the Oscars\ud83d\udc4c"}, {"id": 25, "text": "A little village where eating beef is a daily priority, one morning the buffalo which was to be butchered ran away and what follows is 90 minutes of awe-inducing pandemonium. From the visionary director Lijo Jose Pellissery comes a technical masterpiece which has a strong message about the animalistic traits of us humans &amp; also the herd mentality &amp; devolution of human beings. This film is not plot driven, instead it deals with events &amp; an army of characters constanty moving from one place to another. The sound design &amp; cinematography is on another level.

For an indie movie (something which is first of its kind in India) the cinematography, plot and acting looks fine behind a rustic setting. However, since the movie sends out certain message(s) and links up to the actual Tamil Nadu (TN) festival of Jallikattu, one can raise eyebrows about a no. of issues.Firstly, associating the name Jallikattu with animal slaughter is misleading and gives the impression that the makers are deliberately trying to malign the TN festival of Jallikattu which has nothing to do with animal slaughter or parading animals to kill them eventually for meat. This is negative stereotyping of local Indian culture which is unexpected from the makers who happens to hail from South India.Secondly, the movie is centered around the theme of chasing a buffalo for meat which sends the signal that people in Kerala (Indian state where the story unfolds in the movie) are voracious meat-eaters and reduces their eating habits to exclusive meat-eating. It appears from the movie that Keralites are only worried about what to eat during the entire day and are everyday just planning for that from morning to evening, which is of course not the reality. Again, this appears to be an insidious attack on local culture under the pretext of cinematic liberty and creative thinking.Lastly, the exaggerated display of violence and peoples' obsession for killing the buffalo, especially towards the end, reaches a disproportionate amount and doesn't fit into the setting of this movie and it gives the impression that this theme is forced into the movie. The end feels like an anti-climax instead of climax and fails to deliver the message that there is a devil lurking inside every man in a cinematic way.The above POV in watching the movie is important as it displays indigenous culture, which warrants some responsible movie-making which the makers conspicuously fail to deliver. This view becomes more important as the movie is India's entry into this year's Oscar and no Indian will ever want to negatively portray their society that brings bad name for our culture in world arena."}, {"id": 139, "text": "Jallikattu has an interesting theme, is somewhat realistic and reasonably written, and some of its technical aspects like cinematography are praiseworthy. But why didn't the director find better actors among the 30 million+ Malayalam speakers? Most actors come across as first-time amateurs who haven't stepped into an acting studio even once. Some of these actors seem to think that over-the-top shouting and histrionics is what makes actors good. And what's with not using sync sound in the 21st century? I bet among all the films that have been submitted for Oscar consideration this year, Jallikkattu is the only film that doesn't use sync sound.

Last year I had seen his another movie Angamaly Diaries, and could not sit through it - because it kept on showing graphic violence of mutton, chicken, meat, beaf cutting and hanging scenes. It was too much for my weak heart.This movie Jallikattu is based on a short story Maoist written by Malayalam Sahitya Academy Award winning author S.Hareesh - from the book Adam -collection of 8 short stories.It was in 2016, Lijo read the story Maoist and met Hareesh with the idea of making a movie.The story is about a capitalist butcher in a small village who serves the rich with best cut of buffalo with envy of other villagers. A newly purchased buffalo runs away and creates havoc in villagers life, who chase to kill him, whereas the butcher wants to catch and save the buffalo for his shop. The one night story and incident brings out the worst of people, in their frenzy in chasing, catching and killing the buffalo - so much so that internal animosity and politics comes into play between different village groups.The original story had two buffaloes but for the movie only one buffalo is used. The screenplay story was developed by S.Hareesh along with R.Jayakumar. The movie was shot in 38 days at night in rubber plantation of Nilgiri forests, with an assembled cast of more than 200 villagers and a budget of INR 40 million.The basic theme of the movie is how human beings becomes beast, worse than an animal.It seems that Lijo made deliberate attempt to make all the ticks on things people may object to - like: showing violation of human rights, animal rights (brutally killing of buffalo, graphic detail of culling chicken by twisting neck and putting in boiling water), women's rights (though only one scene where a girl is forcibly and fiercely kissed on lips), environmental rights (trees are cut, forest is set on fire), plus graphic and violent scenes of cutting mutton, beaf and chicken, and men running with weapons in a mob frenzy to kill each other. mobs torching police jeep on fire etc. etc.Some people have talked of what is the intent to make such a movie - and the intent is clear - to show how human beings are beasts worse than animals.The movie is to rub wrongly to everyone who stands for something or the other. The story, the landscape and the setting gives Lijo liberty and cinematic freedom to depict rural village mob frenzy - shown in ultra exaggerated way just to convey a point across.Does Lijo succeed? Yes, he does to a great extend, by superb camera work and amazing shots.This movie is not for the faint-heart and ends in a grim reminder to our times - where the author of the short story S.Hareesh says something likeThose who live a life of optimism today Have internalized corruption &amp; aggressiveness Into a rationalized sense of impotence They are the real pessimist of doomed futureSpecial mention of breathtaking beautifully cinematography by Gireesh GangadharanThe movie does make a mark of its own with unique story telling.I would go with 7.5 out of 10"}, {"id": 198, "text": "The caveman and us are just separated by the time frame.

However it is not possible to control Nature, and when she runs riot, the result is mayhem. In their eagerness to control and consume the beast, the menfolk of the village are themselves reduced to a primal state of savagery symbolized by the human mound that engulfs the buffalo in the end.Are the villagers eating buffalo meat (which I believe is called buff or carabeef) due to the ban on beef? This is not apparent from watching the film, or perhaps I am missing something.That the villagers love meat in their daily diet is established when they incongruously hang their morning meat purchase to a tree before entering the place of worship. When the buffalo runs amok, the villagers' reaction is sharp, which is reflected in their over-the-top acting, and a farcical chase across the village and the forest.Therefore I also see this as a commentary against non-vegetarianism wherein a free-spirited buffalo refuses to be reduced to becoming somebody's meal, and decides to take its fate in its own hands - or hooves, in this case.Either way, in the end, the men appear beastlier and ghastlier than the beast itself.This is a short film that moves at a rapid pace, thanks to the crisp editing and great sound effects.Not easily 'digestible' by all."}, {"id": 213, "text": "9/10Plot: A buffalo escapes from a butcher and all the villagers band together to hunt it.I liked the trailer.

So, the mainstream follows the rules - invest, gather a professional technical crew, get bankable and saleable stars, make them entertain the audience and, in the process, ensure that a story, albeit old and hackneyed, is told to the satisfaction of the spectators. A cardinal rule remains not to be violated - Never, ever, disgust the audience or make them uncomfortable. In an interview, one of his many PR exercises, Hindi film superstar Shahrukh Khan told that he is bound by the song and dance routine of the industry as the audience expects him to do it. In the same interview, a few sentences down the line, he said that streaming services provide opportunity to the filmmakers to let go of all the constrains and expectations and be free to make the kind of films they wish to make. OF course, he was promoting Netflix, but somewhere, sitting next to Brad Pitt, he seemed embarrassed to have tried not hard enough to be a memorable part of the world cinema. Jallikattu, a Malayalam film that made its online debut in Amazon Prime, is in that league of Indian films which do not hesitate to make its audience cringe and yet, be at the edge of his seat throughout its 94 minutes. It is a masculine film with no pretext or apology. It's so acutely masculine that it is almost primordial in its depiction of greed, lust, anger and acute apathy. From the opening sequence, in which exaggerated sound of a clock ticking introduces the characters in a close-up, till the last where the hunting masses are shown to have turned Neandarthal, the movie doesn't let you take your eyes off the screen. The close-up visuals of meat being sliced and the satisfaction of the customers forming a queue to buy their share is debilitating. It is a film that after a very long got me mesmerized, as if the storyteller is making me angry, happy or even laugh at his choice. It is a film in which I went back to the credits and found the names who have done Sound, not only the music, and Cinematography (Music: Prashant Pillai, Sound: a bunch of gifted technicians, Cinematography: Gireesh and Gangadharan). It is a film where the credits start with the name of the storywriter (S Hareesh, who has partnered the screenplay as well). It is a film that is apparently about a buffalo running amok in a remote village and the villagers trying to catch it (Hence, Jallikattu, the Tamil tradition in controversy some time back), but juxtaposes with minimal effort and maximum \u00e9lan unravelling of layers of trained civility that contain humans. It ends with the unnerving show of what happens with those layers have been peeled off. The lead actors (Anthony, Chemban, Sabumon, Santhy) look and act too real to be called actors. But the captain (Director: Lijo Jose Pellissery) ensures that even his tenth and eleventh players are match-winners. The shopkeeper who writes the letter for Paul, Paul himself in the aftermath of his herbal garden being ravaged by the buffalo and the chasing men, the drunk, old man who points out that the beasts often have two feet and not four - one can say that there are no side characters in this film. They are all central. The buffalo's rage is breathtaking and its chase, for the humans and by the humans, leave scars on the audience's complacent sensibility. The scenes are quite gripping and realistic, and one struggles to comprehend the calmness with which the team might have approached the film-making, especially when the disclaimer says, 'No animals were harmed'. Overall, to feel proud and get high on India cinema, please watch more and more of the so-called regional, off-beat ones. That's where the pearls are formed under pressing layers of mainstream mediocrity."}, {"id": 217, "text": "Jallikattu Malayalam movie.

The chaos starts as a buffalo escapes from the butcher house of 'Kaalan Varkey'- the butcher and his assistant Antony. The whole village gets involved as the escapee destroys crops and damages properties. Then follows the confusion and frenzy scenes ... leading to the inevitable climax.Each and every character has be measured to perfection and pasted on the presentation by the director. As the chaos starts, audience is introduced to every character in depth and the symbolisation begins. The unity during commotions and the diversification in the name of 'petty sects' is the projection from the community itself. Every character has their own egoistic self interest, to be worked out during the time of confusion.The 'beat' of the presentation is established in the opening shots of the movie itself. That keeps the audience, on the edge of their seats, through the tense moments. Camera work is superb, taking the audience into the depths of the movie. 'Mission impossible, Sahoo' are movies made to thrill us, with car chases and action sequences... Here, similar thrill is presented with the buffalo loose in the village... Action sequences and chases are vividly exposed by the observant camera work.9.5 on 10 for this 'Bull in a China shop'The theme represents the society and it's chaotic life. The characters lose their human nature, bringing out the beast in themselves. Hats off to the director for this chaotic extravaganza, managing his team and battalion of villagers, to give the audience a spell-binding thriller.

Though the movie is not about the bull-taming event that is popular in Tamilnadu, where the animal is provoked or even drugged (illegally), here a mere buffalo creates rampage by destructing crops and vegetation on its way. It might sound stupid but the way this stupidity was treated is just surreal.Focusing on the mob-mentality, Jallikattu explores the human nature of dominance and establishing the authority. Though it might sound philosophical, the movie tries to extrapolate our cultured aspect to its breaking point; we, humans, are civilised only to a certain extent until some tyranny is unleashed upon us.Lijo transformed this local feature into something universal with such diverse themes. The people from nearby villages adds fuel to the burning rage, leading to the climatic pyramid formation and this makes one think that we are primitives after all - with tamed beasts within each one of us, ready to be unleashed anytime.Overall, the team of Jallikattu should be appreciated in making such a treat for cinema lovers like me; it was such an intense viewing experience with several orgasmic moments that one fails to notice the tiny pitfalls.

Jallikattu like the other two movies in the trilogy focuses on humans and their emotions under extrodinary ordinary circumstances.Jallikattu is based on a short story, titled Maoist, However, Jallikattu is less of a story and more a situation. With very little dialogues throughout, it works in some places, but also leaves the rest for the audience to decide themselves.

Jallijattu is not about one individual human, it's about the entire village (or mankind) and of course only all Men (no women, why? No comments) are involved in the crazy, wild manimal fairytale. A buffalo escapes from slaughterhouse and creates a village-wide hysteria in which we see all men turning even wilder and brutal than animals. So this was the basic idea behind the storyline but was focused occasionally while rest of the time it was about anything but nothing useful and related to the main story. In the runtime of about 95 minutes Jallikattu gets to the main content only when the beast appears, otherwise it has some useless small small segments to tell such as a lady having affairs, politicians thinking about thier future, casteism, a police officer's quarrels with his wife and bla bla. All of it got nothing to do with the storyline yet covers 90% of runtime and the reason and logic behind is still pending. The climax of the film is so unrealistic that it looks like mythological story from a novel or as if we are watching a fantasy action film set in stone-age. How was those man supposed to climb on each other on so high just to kill one man in realistic proportions? Leaving it aside and coming to the positives of the film the first one is, the direction style is different and modern. The use background score is fascinating and innovative. It gives a feel of watching something really new and fresh to eyes. Jallikattu was humanly a very tough film to make yet it delivers spectacular visuals shot amazingly by cinematographer and brilliantly directed by the director. Apart from these three things there is nothing in the film that can be termed Great. The chaotic aspirations of the team to make something different deserves one time viewing.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest"}, {"id": 229, "text": "A wild buffalo escapes a butcher's shop and runs amok, disrupting the routine and dynamics of a bunch of quirky villagers.Now, this storyline in itself is unconventional and at the hands of a brilliant director, becomes the stuff of festival premieres. However, it seems to me that it worked better in the writer's imagination than it finally did on screen. For starters, none of the actors' characters is established well enough. Even though the entire village is running amok, one feels the need to identify and want to follow at least a bunch of people, but there's no one to anchor our curiosity in this film. Even the bull doesn't seem that fierce tbh.Second, there are passing references to various themes like naxalism, women's rights, social hierarchy, etc. but they fail to strike a chord and deliver any impact. Mostly because they are inaptly placed in superficial dialogues or are devoted just a few seconds without any context. Further, the acting is average at best. True, everyone has tried to act natural, but somehow it comes across forced and unconvincing.Overall, it just seems like they tried to force fit an entire screenplay just based on a single promising premise and that shows."}, {"id": 230, "text": "In a village near Idukki, Kerala, at daybreak, a buffalo which is about to be slaughtered escapes and runs amok creating sundry destruction.Thus begins a 90 minute plunge into a seemingly absurd, yet absolutely riveting set of events.Director Lijo Jose Pelissery, with his unique handling of this simple premise, concocts a visual and aural adventure that is a deeply visceral.What appears, on the surface level, as a preposterous, albeit straightforward narrative of a communal chase behind a gentle bovine, there is a subtext of multiple layers which throw a light on toxic masculinity, strong undercurrent of animal spirit that lurks under the thin veneer of thousands of years of civilization and how it could be unleashed at the slightest of provocations, with vignettes of political and social landscape and a healthy sprinkling of dark humour.Director Lijo Jose Pelissery has marshalled technically top notch talents in the form of cinematography by Girish Gangadharan, Prashant Pillai's background score and crisp editing by Deepu Joseph to mount brilliant setpieces suffused with manic energy.Kudos to the director that he could cook up a tense thriller, that is also an one of a kind immersive experience."}, {"id": 231, "text": "Jallikattu is a film about Mallu rednecks - people who live in the hilly regions. But too much style and shouting over character development ruins the film to an extent. It is nowhere as good as Agamaly Diaries.Worth a watch for the crowd scenes. But zero character development and strange background score ruins it a little. A bit of a miss for Lijo. And the final oooh message ..... We might wear clothes and all but we are just animals at the end of the day. Lijo is someone who loves the masculine men and the fight for territory. Here he tried to show it's dark side and sort of fell flat.The supporting cast is full of unremarkable nobodies unlike in Angamay Diaries where every bit player made an impression.A subplot involving an alcoholic Christian patriarch organizing a function and being scared of not getting enough meat was entertaining.So many lost opportunities in Malayalam cinema to capture the lives of the people who live in the hilly regions. Either the director gets carried away with style like in the case of Jallikattu or is some boring blowhard.I wonder whether the final scene is an allegory for overpopulation."}, {"id": 232, "text": "Not the weirdest film I have watched, but maybe the creepiest.The colour and lighting in the film are unique and gives it a scary touch. Dark colours with red shade gives a feeling of uncomfort. Lijo Jose Pellissery took his ability to take long shots to extreme. Infact, I think he made this film only to test his own ability. Many scenes were over 2 minute long without a cut. Background score was poor.It's not what I expected. The focus keeps shifting to it's many sub plots. I feel the connection between them and the real story is missing. I expected it to be almost silent. However, there is a lot of talking in it.It's obvious that there's a commentry on cannibalism. It's more of a propoganda film. Themes are not kept hidden, they are as clear as they can be.It's unique but not truly great. Most of the time is spent in talking and useless fights. Characters are not any good. If you remove one scene and put it somewhere else, it makes no difference."}, {"id": 233, "text": "First, all malayam director s plz do research and put name or write a script. Without knowing nothing u kept the name #JALLIKATTU.And movie name have been given as intentionally by the mindless director Lijo. To promote and getting Monet back, Malayalis are doing this Tamil ppl culture emotion.... This will lead to disaster anyhow.... Its purely fiction made flick from lijo, Not a realistic in nature to catch a Buffalo it don't need 200 people moreover its just a domestic animal not wild animal like lion, tiger or elephant. You are trying to spoil the name of tamil culture &amp; paving way to an extinct of village bulls an animal species used in jallikattu. In jallikattu people don't run to eat the flesh of the bull, Even after the death , cremation process will be done with due respect as of human beings. But here you have shown many illegal affairs like bgrade films and trying to relate with tamil people You should not choose jallikattu as your movie name, u Can take name from your own tradition from kerala where real behaviour of ur people are screened in your movie, not tamil people or tamil culture #Jallikattu should not work @ #Oscars."}, {"id": 234, "text": "The film is set in a remote village surrounded by hills and forests. It looks idyllic enough on the surface. But what lies beneath is anything but conducive. The buffalo flees before it can be slaughtered to provide meat for a feast to mark the engagement of a hard-drinking rubber estate owner's daughter (who, on her part, is not averse to attempting an elopement) The runaway animal sparks absolute bedlam, the magnitude of which is captured by the propulsive original musical score by Prashant Pillai and director of photography Gireesh Gangadharan's phenomenally fluid camerawork. The mayhem unleashed by the beast is, however, no worse than the chaos that is whipped up by the teams of men hurriedly put together to recapture the buffalo.They cannot see eye to eye. Old animosities come to the fore when Kuttachan, a man who has served time for sandalwood smuggling and believes he was betrayed, is summoned to shoot the buffalo dead. Antony the butcher is dead against the use of a firearm to kill the animal. The entire village jumps into the fray, but the animal proves elusive. The race against time sends anger soaring. Overall in my view the film is totally misleading the people who have no idea about the cultural sport Jallikattu, to make them think the sport to be brutal one and being played by uneducated."}, {"id": 235, "text": "To be honest, I had high hopes from this movie after I heard a lot of great reviews. But this movie fails to deliver in all aspects, except the cinematography, which is outstanding and the only saving grace for this unending bull run.The movie's premise is simple. A buffalo has gone rogue, destroying everything in its path. The entire village is after it, with their own reasons for it, some personal, some collective. The villagers try to catch it, but it keeps getting away from them at every moment, with the damage caused increasing multifold from losing crops to losing lives. Finally, they are able to get a hold of it, with the weirdest movie ending I have ever seen. The End.The movie tries to highlight the mob psychology and other factors such as the true nature of humans as beings (read Animals) shown predominantly by the ancient/tribal people. But it lacks conviction. Taking it element by element, the movie manages to score high in the cinematography area, with beautiful shots everywhere from the sunrise scene at the start to amazing visuals in the dark, and who can forget the well scene? It's well-shot, through and through. The background score is interesting, mainly made up of tick-tock or other such sounds on top of cut scenes, setting up the stage for the next scenes. But this is where the positives end, and the downhill journey starts. First up, character-development has completely gone for a toss, with no focus at actually giving time and attention to the characters, to let them grow on you. A few characters have been given small story arcs or a back story told through flashbacks, but the efforts seem shallow. The females are heavily underutilized, with the so-called female lead's most dominant on-screen appearance being an overextended scene in which she is seen standing at the door. What a pity. This is followed by the storyline, which, at first, seems to be somewhat thrilling, but ends up being ultra-simple. And finally, the human pyramid scene! This happens to be the weirdest movie ending I have ever scene, with no words to describe it. Rather go ahead and get a feel of it for yourself.Overall : 4/10."}, {"id": 236, "text": "I expected more from the movie after watching the trailer.I loved the concept a lot and the director's experiments with dialogues and casting of non prime actors. even though at some places the dialogue delivery was mediocore.I liked the touches used the by the crowd of people, but the light setting was very very imperfect that the viewer could feel that the location was lit up.... it never gave a feel of night.. the shadows of the light setup gave a very funny look... that you could easily spot out the placement of lights..The sound design was very very cliche, as if the designer just want to push the fact that he has more than two channels to play with.Leaving off all the unrealistic feel, its a decent entertainer."}, {"id": 237, "text": "An interesting take on exploring the socio-political state of affairs in a small village using the device of a buffalo gone wild and creating chaos. The premise is promising and so is the device. To an extent, the film also does justice to what it intends to.But after a point, the film does get stretched and drags with the repeated attempts to catch the buffalo and moreover by almost similar methods or setups. It starts upfront with the focus on catching the buffalo but soon more layers are explored with the focus shifting from the beast to human side. That essentially is the core of the film which you enjoy. But then the narrative shifts so erratically between the beast and human side that you lose perspective. Also some subplots of human exploration like the police angle or the love angle seem half-baked and hence fall flat.At times the director does shift gears from storytelling to showcasing his technical prowess esp with the background score, sound design and camera angles. No doubt that the film excels in all these departments. But since, at times, the technicalities do not take the story forward, it seems forced and reminds of such shallow attempts by Ram Gopal Varma that seem more gimmicky.Though the film opens with a disclaimer that no animals were harmed and dummies were used instead, the portions with buffalo (which are ample in the second half) look as good as with a real animal. The makers don't shy away to visually explore the manhandling of the beast on hands of human - the climax and end credits are not for the squeamish. The climax sequence certainly goes a little fantastical were the director intends to highlight that humans can be worse than animals. And the epilogue quite literally emphasizes that humans haven't evolved much in their basic instincts since the stone age era."}, {"id": 238, "text": "Allegory, some dilemma, rage, aggression, ethics and more.This movie will construct doubts on believe and instincts. With such aggression on screen this movie became its own enemy. An overcooked masterpiece, delivers an utterly different taste.Name of the movie is Jallikattu, which comes from this popular spectacle in South India. It's a tradition where humans fight the bull to publicize masculinity. And the movie itself falls into the same discipline. Well, not actually. Instead of advertising masculinity it highlights the vulgar and wild caveman side of human beings and the movie does that in such a profound way that it becomes so obvious after a certain time. Like I said before, the movie itself is its own enemy.Now let's talk about some of the technical parts of the movie. For an Indian movie standard it's definitely something. It will even challenge some of the best movies ever made. I like how the movie really coordinates with the Indian weather and produces some of the best scenes with some of the very best lighting. But again if you want to do something out of the box, you have to do it in a certain way to achieve the results you want. And in this process a tiny mistake can derail the whole thing. In Jallikattu, they made a lot of these mistakes which results some amateur works and it's not so pleasing in the eyes of the viewer.Now let's talk about another obvious course i.e. sound. The background score of this movie is amazing and that is also one of the foremost enemies of this movie. The loud nature as the background score was not so natural. It created this mood which is good for a live action theatre, maybe but for a movie it's over dramatic. It created the essence of this wild nature so vividly. But, on the other hand, it's the only thing that killed the same essence, many times.The strongest part of the movie is the acting. Antony Varghese has been just perfect and gave an outspelled performance if not best. This movie had to cast for an entire village and everyone just gave their best performance in the given screen time. The acting is so strong in this movie, it will definitely push this one high on the leaderboard.Rating: 7.2/10."}, {"id": 239, "text": "I am very particular about my sound Remember Lijo Jose Pellissery mention so in an interview. Best recommended to watch in a theatre with well-equipped sound system. Prashanth Pillai's background score is world class. Diegetic sounds were just as sharp as the score.Night visuals were striking. Many extremely difficult looking scenes have been taken really well.Editing work is very impressive.Towards the end, the movie went a bit overboard I felt. The scenes were exceptional and stunning but the narrative did not place it coherently.End Credits presented pretty horrifying animation against horrifying background score. Quite impressive.Antony has acted ok. Sabu seemed to have faltered a bit here and there. There are sprinkles of imperfections as lot of the movie is done using non-professional actors.Animatronix is pretty good. Buffalo is quite convincing.Direction is excellent. World class. Pushing the limits of cinema. Lijo is all in. This is his most challenging work so far."}, {"id": 240, "text": "#JalliKattuDefined the thin line between Man and Beast. He explained Very brilliantly by using the Buffaloes (Threat Living Sympathy). Complete movie (2hrs narration) explores How things are changed and not changed from the decades (He narrated through the old man).Certifiably insane final 15 minutes, As lavish as the execution.It's not that much easy to write and make this kind of art films. Needs full of patience and great passion towards Cinema without that we can't.May you people some where uncomfortable, need bit patience I promise you guy's wait till to the end #Lijo Will Surprise you with his command in crafts (Film making style ). I think writer's and Director job is easy in this case when compared to DOP work. So wanna give Whole credits to #GirishGangadharan will appreciate what he done for the film. He's not able to stay calm and quiet least 3 min....Just Chasing Hunting and Running besides those rivels and Buffalo. Off course #PrashanthPillai sound too He also deserves for the applause and appreciation. And Finally the beast #AV did well !!"}], "reviews_amount": 241}
