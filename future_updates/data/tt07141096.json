This is Woody Allen in Manhattan. A rainy day in New York came to me as a rather naive and refreshing way of doing what W Allen does. Gastby and Ashleigh question what they are and what they are becoming. They do that - to my perception - through the eyes of someone of their age. They think but do not overthink. Action immediately follows. They do not get lost in doubts and do not have to deal with an ego bigger than them. They act, they feel, they learn and repeat. They have so much to learn from that one day. I found all three young characters likeable and empowered, and the actors on top of their game (Timothee Chalamet, Elle Fanning and Selena Gomez). I would have loved to spend that day by their side The rain never bothered me anyways."}, {"id": 2, "text": "As soon as I heard about this latst movie we went, I am from Amsterdam, Holland, it is playing in 4 cinemas, in Amsterdam alone and most were sold out out this afternoon ( rainy sunday in Amsterdam) to say I enjoyed the movie is putting it milldly, I absolutely loved it, it was well translated, I ampractically bilingueal, born Dutch but psnet many years in England.

I'm going to watch it again tomorrow."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Yet another masterpiece by Woody Allen. No matter how many movies he makes, never fails to give a perfect blend of nostalgia, euphoria and diff aspects of love. I loved how this movie has the finest ingredients one can offer. It features an incredible piano background score which seemingly connects with the rainy view of Manhattan. Chalamet did an obvious Oscar worthy performance and the supporting cast (Jude Law, Selena Gomez) didn't felt like excluded. Another treat is def the film's wonderful setting of New York City and the way art, culture and romance is depicted is fascinating. It's a shame that these type of movies are wiping away with time."}, {"id": 6, "text": "1. Excellent music. 2. Beautiful city. 3. Intelligent story. 4. Oscar winning acting.. 4. An happy ending.Who could ask for anything more?"}, {"id": 7, "text": "A classic Woody Allen, loved this all the way. It has al the familiar ingredients: New York in the rain, a neurotic young man, openly struggling with his thoughts and love life, the pretty young girl, the object of his affection.Some of Allen's recent work has been rather lightweight, but here is is in true form again."}, {"id": 8, "text": "The movie has quite a strange period feeling and maybe this artistic tool was intentional. Everybody uses smartphones already, but for conversations only. No Twitter, no other social media... Some jokes were actually a bit tasteless, very atypical for Woody Allen. A couple of chuckles throughout the movie, typical Woody Allen. Ellen Fanning had the best lines and she was the best overall. Liev Schreiber was very good also with the material he was given. Cinematography is beautiful and perfect for a rom-com - warm, bright, sparkling and full of colours. Chalamet was just wooden and dull. That was the first performance by him I've seen and I don't want to judge him too early or too harsh but he seems to be extremely overrated. Maybe the right lead for a late Woody Allen film."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I love Woody, and I lived with some of his movies. I cannot say how I felt the first time I saw some of his masterpieces, such as, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Annie Hall, Bananas, Hollywood Ending, Deconstructing Harry and so on..... I am also not one of those who judge him because of the late accusations..... But this movie, wow, it hit me in the balls.I went to theater and just wished that it gets good at some point, and it got worse and worse. To be honest, It didn't get worse, it was just all bad from the beginning. The acting, the camera, the lighting, the editing, and even the screenplay, all were subnormal. I was surprised and still think it was a nightmare. Only a couple of good lines, and some references to older works, and nothing else. Maybe my expectation is too high about this master filmmaker, or maybe he is going through extremely hard times. Anyway, I wish him all the best, and hope that we see some great works again in the future...."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Woody Allen at his best, a nostalgic look at his Manhattan. A delightful romantic, witty comedy, wishing there were more of these."}, {"id": 11, "text": "A milquetoast Holden Caufield is uncomfortably out of place in this rehash of masterpiece Manhattan. The characters play purposefully phony. Piano plays, mild witticisms are traded, rain falls. Oscar Wilde turns in his grave. This doddery film suffers from the 84 year old director's male gaze. There is no place for it. No charm, cinematography uneven. Selena Gomez stands out."}, {"id": 12, "text": "It is really sad such a great cast got wasted on this film. I've seen both Elle Fanning and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet play characters with immense depth, and yet these roles striped them of all that with poor dialogue and such a soulless story. It was really disappointing to say the least, I was excited to see this cast work together, but a story really does matter."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Lacks any depth, fails to be funny, the dialogues are artificial, and Elle Fanning plays unbearably irritable character.

Such a disappointment."}, {"id": 15, "text": "'A rainy day in New York' is your classic Woody Allen ... adapted to the needs &amp; tastes of the 21st century. A remarkable transition from a filmmaker over 80 years of age, surely showing his genius.For once Woody Allen keeps his face out of his film -- we see a young guy acting as his 21st century stand-in. Around this guy develops a true whirlwind drama, reminding us of Allen's best work.The rainy picturing of wealthy New York of 2018 is fine, and the piano-music surely adds an extra -- even including Eroll Garner (1921-1977), a very famous American jazz pianist.My only doubt: our guy meets his girl in Central Park at the end of this film. I think their characters are too different to make their relation work."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Any film that features the music of jazz legend, ERROL GARNER, gets a 10 from me- with no questions asked.The is a classic, romantic and delightful Woody Allen romp, so there's no need to delve into cinematic details.And like the Coen's Llewyn Davis and, Oh, Brother, Garner's incomparable piano is the defining characterist here- Jazzy, Smart, Poignant and very New York City."}, {"id": 17, "text": "After all the poor reviews by the critics I was delighted! This is a sweet and funny entry in the Allen canon, and Elle Fanning is wonderful. She is worth the price of admission just to enjoy her performance.

It has a full and rich story. Lots of interesting drama and Woody's decades long patented sardonic comedic formula still does exactly as it is supposed to - make a nice romantic comedy with a happy ending. It works wonderfully. Thank you Woody."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This movie is an oasis in today's super-paced, zero-plotted, super-powered, highly cgi-ed cinematic desert. The dialogues are fun, characters are good, New York is always beautiful.The only downside of the movie is Selena Gomez - destroying every scene she's in with a dry and plane acting. Woody Allen might naturally give her role to a log - and it wouldnt make any difference for the scenes she's in.Overall a very nice experience, an oasis to breathe for sincere movie goers."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Woody Allen give us a great Woody Allen movie. A splendid look of New york, good performances, especially Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet who I find perfect ( He really shines in this type of register ). Some references in literature that Woody Allen like to make us discover. A fresh comedy, bright and charming."}, {"id": 21, "text": "As a fan of his work, I went to the cinema with an open mind - but oh boy is this a stinker. The plot - what there is of it - is like a 1970's Brian Rix farce. I was expecting people to appear out of wardrobes with their trousers around their ankles. The jokes are tepid and sparse - and I wonder is he trying to take the mickey out of wealthy spoilt brats or rub less well off peoples noses in it? Not clear.

It is just so light, charming and funny with two great leads. At the same time the dialogue is witty and natural. Obviously we will not have a deep dive into today's problems, social commentary and the seriousness we have to have now in everything because this is not that kind of movie. It is a lighthearted comedy with an unbelievably charismatic Elle Fanning (who could have been written a little less naive) and an also convincing Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. There is not head-heavyness, people don't ponder about the way their day goes so much. They just go on for the ride and see what happens next. It is a breath of fresh air. I also liked the way the lighting is used here. The music adds to the great experience. Thumbs up!"}, {"id": 26, "text": "This so so bad.

The cinematography and acting were great."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I just saw A Rainy Day in New York and I think that everyone who is fond of NYC, Woody's movies, rain, autumn and Chet Baker MUST SEE IT."}, {"id": 31, "text": "As usual, the new Woody Allen film - his 48th feature in 51 years! - is a disturbing departure from the last few. What disturbs is its newness. We're disappointed when our expectations are denied. So an adjustment is necessary if we are to take it on its own, proper terms. The plot is familiar: when a small town hick comes to New York, her relationship with a city guy is challenged by the Big City. It's Neil Simon country but Allen infuses it with an uncommon density of personal inflection. That goes beyond What's sexy about short-term memory loss? And Time flies....Unfortunately, it flies coach.... It's not always a comfortable trip. Specifically the film responds to the time and circumstance of its making. When Mia Farrow's questionable allegations of Allen's alleged abuse of her daughter resurfaced, Amazon broke their agreement to fund and distribute the film. So here: The world is full of tragic little deal-breakers. And There are no newspapers that are not tabloids. Not since Manhattan has Allen delivered such an encomium to New York City: You are here or you are nowhere. You cannot achieve another level of anxiety, hostility or paranoia anywhere else. Instead of the usual star-studded Allen cast, here Jude Law is the film's one big star. As his name suggests, Gatsby Welles is a cultural construct. Gatsby signifies the illusion of old wealth and social stature. Welles connotes a maverick individuality. The hero's wealthy family propel him into the arts, the responsibilities of high society, the mixed blessings of the privileged. But at that privilege he bristles. This Gatsby took classical piano but yearns to play romantic ballads in a bar. He doesn't have to be able to sing well to enjoy singing a classic ballad. Instead of college studies he prefers high stakes gambling (at which he succeeds uncommonly, like Woody the filmmaker). Ultimately Gatsby breaks out of his romantic rut, unlike brother Hunter, doomed to marry a woman with an emasculating laugh. Gatsby's girlfriend Ashleigh comes from a wealthy Tucson banking family. A journalism student at Yardley College, she takes him to New York to interview the famously serious film director Roland Pollard. You're too original to have mass appeal, the awed Ashleigh assures him. Gatsby's old schoolmate dismisses his work with Never a decent toilet joke. When Ashleigh quotes Pollard's line Love and death are two sides of the same coin she doesn't understand it, but has evoked an early (funny) Allen title. The R.P. director's nominal echo of Roman Polanski sets up Ashleigh's NYC adventure. While in real life Farrow persists in her discounted allegations against Allen, she publicly defends Polanski against the sex charges to which he pled guilty. Here Pollard, his writer Ted Davidoff and actor Francisco Vega personify the predatory film industry that feeds off the star-struck, helpless naifs. Pollard uses his artistic suffering, Davidoff his unfaithful wife and Vega his star power to seduce the relatively innocent Ashleigh. Only the early return of Vega's girlfriend preserves Ashleigh's relative chastity. Implicitly Allen places Farrow's persistent allegations in the larger context that undermines her. Seeing Ashleigh on TV with Vega, the heartbroken Gatsby hires a hooker to represent his fiancee at his mother's classy dinner As Gatsby describes his mother's literary circle: It's rich housewives who have the leisure to pursue esoteric culture. The out of work, discussing the out of print. After his mother sees through the ploy and sends the woman home she tells Gatsby that she had herself been a hooker. Indeed that's how she met his father. Indeed she used her savings to set up his eventually successful business. This candour opens Gatsby's relationship with his mother: She's a lot more than I gave her credit for. With that knowledge he can accept himself as well as her and he can follow his desire to stay in New York and live the life he prefers. There is not such a gaping gap between the respectable and the pragmatic after all. There is non shame in honesty. The film ripples with allusions. Its sentimental core starts with the opening song: I got lucky in the rain. The singer sadly needs a song, then You came along, the love of his life. Relationships begin and end in the rain here, climactically over Misty, because the rain signifies the melancholy chill from which we seek love for shelter. What I really need, Gatsby avers, is a Berlin ballad. In the converse call to social realism, Gatsby is supposed to see the Weegee exhibition at MOMA, but he abandons that to follow his new interest, Chan, the grown-up kid sister of his old flame Amy, into the older histories in the Met. This relationship begins with the Benedick-Beatrice sparring on a student film set, where they meet and have to act a passionate kiss. Eventually their life will follow that art. They meet on that film set, have that museum date then meet again under the Central Park clock reliving a favourite romantic film. Chan's home is full of Old Master paintings and antiques. She reads Gatsby as an exotic searching for a romantic dream from a vanished age. That becomes her. Chan wins out over Ashleigh because she knows Allen's familiar dependency upon art for a meaning and consolation otherwise rarely available: Real life is fine for people who can't do any better. That's a film-romance re-write of Gatsby's mother's career. Unfortunately, to cleanse themselves of the old Allen scandal Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Hall announced they were donating their salaries to charity. They make themselves victims of the slander and misrepresentation Allen has suffered and survived for so many years. This is a film they should be proud of having served."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Woody Allen repeating himself but in a very unsuccessful way.

As per usual, a Woody Allen's film features lengthy, rich, clever dialogues that are just to die for, utilizing an extremely talented cast that just takes to another level, Chalamet and Fanning complement each other quite nicely and I have to say that I was a bit surprised by Selena Gomez's performance as she delivered wonderfully.This has Woody Allen written all over it and I found it charming and delightful, An amazing movie."}, {"id": 39, "text": "Its hard to explain why this movie is so good. ITS simply geniously how cinema should be done. You come to enjoy,to laugh ,to see good acting ,no need of any violence ,special effects.

If you want to watch a film that is exactly like prime Woody Allen definitely consider giving this a go."}, {"id": 41, "text": "I thought it would be best to take notes as I watched it, so here they are:unrealistic characters who talk past each otherbad camerawork, just back and forthcolor is distracting, clashes; lighting is harshjokes are not funny and often it just sounds like Woody Allen, circa 1970first key scene is girlfriend (Ashleigh) telling protagonist (named Gatsby) she wants to go to screening rather than with him to a Weegee exhibit that is important to him, but that is left hanging (interestingly, Weegee's film, though not especially good, seems to have been an influence on Allen's early films)dialogue is often uninteresting, purposeless, disjointed, and at least somewhat offensive at timesit has the feel of Woody Allen imagining what he would be like if he was 21 years old in 2018 or whenever it was filmedcharacters just pop up randomly to discuss something that moves things forward, but it feels forced and intended to tell rather than show - it would be amusing if done to be purposely sillythe director of Love and Death gives us Love and Boredom all these years laterprotagonist sings and plays piano after telling a cancer joke, in a meandering scene that is meant, apparently, to show chemistry between protagonist and different young woman - the dialogue seems to be more consistent with people 20+ years older who have been in a long relationship and come to dislike each other (does Woody see successful relationships this way? if so that's rather sad)basic premise certainly could work but most of the characters are drenched in narcissism, who only seem to be interested in proving that they are worthy, which of course comes across as trying to compensate for low self-esteem if not demonstrativve of their self- loathingAshleigh seems to be trying to do an impersonation of Annie Hall at times (as Gatsby acts like the same character Woody Allen has played) - why not do something original? in Annie Hall we get a sense of why she acts the way she does, and we see her change significantly during the course of the film, but that doesn't happen hereone reviewer said, An old man's movie played by young actors, but do old people enjoy this sort of thing? instead, I'd say these characters are reminiscent of ones that were mocked in earlier Woody Allen movies, but now he wants us to sympathize with them, care about their decisions, etc., though they are unsympathetic for different reasonsanother reviewer's statement was funnier than this entire movie: ...oh boy is this a stinker. The plot - what there is of it - is like a 1970's Brian Rix farce. I was expecting people to appear out of wardrobes with their trousers around their ankles.on some level, it feels like the director is saying, see, this is what the super-wealthy are like, and they are just like us, aren't they? but if you are like one of these people, I doubt you have the self-awareness to realize how unappealing your self-centered, insulated life is!overall, it feels like a jumble, things thrown together randomly - there's the general premise, but that feels contrived (the way it gets played out) and there are unnecessary distractions, which lessen any tension that might begin to build upit has a nearly absurdist quality, and perhaps if there was some sort of apocalyptic development and they all had to confront their imminent mortality, perhaps there would be a way to salvage this hilariously terrible messGatsby goes to a poker game while thinking Ashleigh might be in great danger - so the super wealthy don't have smart phones in 2018?TV news report that makes Gatsby jealous is quite contrivedWoody's amateurish devices, which sometimes come across as charming to many viewers, come across here as just poorly renderedtowards the end, the film changes focus, from Gatsby questioning his relationship with Ashleigh to Ashleigh fending off much older males who view her as a potential sexual conquest, then we get a family drama with Gatsby; it seems like filler was needed because Woody couldn't figure out how to articulate the central dramaending is ridiculous, with inverted cinematic values!the main premise changed more than once, with none of them being at all satisfying. the protagonist decides to choose a different woman to be his romantic partner, yet he doesn't change or recognize that his view of himself was inaccurate. instead, we see Gatsby chose the better woman, which I find distasteful, at the very least (in some ways it was like the ending of Manhattan reversed); at the very least the story was flaccid and lazy.the ending makes us question if Woody has normal human feelings, because Gatsy doesn't seem to exhibit any normal attachment to Ashleigh, but rather possessiveness. if this was the case, there should have been at least one scene where Gatsby recognizes his flaws and treats Ashleigh with the respect she deserves."}, {"id": 42, "text": "Since this film is not being screened in the US, I drove to Tijuana Mexico to see it. Of Allen's films over the last ten years I would rank only Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine above this one. it shares some elements that have appeared in his other films over the past decade, but he puts them all together this time in an exceptionally elegant way. In the hands of a less masterful storyteller this movie would have been a mess. But Allen makes it look easy. Not a single word or scene is unnecessary, nothing is missing, I always knew exactly what was going on, and the movie never, for one single second, lost its momentum. As always the performances he drew out of his actors was astonishing. Every single one of them moved me. Even one actress who was only on screen for like two minutes. This is brilliant story-telling. Of the last ten films I would tie it for third place with Wonder Wheel. Wonder Wheel had a more dramatic effect on me, but the arc of this film felt more natural.

I have to agree.

After all this I can now report it was worth the wait as this wonderfully light and whimsical film set in New York (obviously) is an absolute delight. The story follows a young couple (Timothy Chalamet, Elle Fanning) who arrive in New York for a weekend where they are met with bad weather and a series of adventures and misadventures. It is a well paced film with a lot of interesting characters along the way. I have seen more visually stunning Allen films but this one does look good and have a few beautifully framed scenes that will stay with me. All the actors bring a lot of charm to this story and I would say this is my favourite Woody Allen film since Blue Jasmine (2013).

Everything - from the protagonist's name, to his girlfriend's gonzo journalism quest and the ultimate mother-son heart-to-heart - is ridiculous, yet the writing is smart without being pretentious, the actors are having a blast (whoever discovered Chalamet deserves a prize, as is becoming clear by now) and the movie works. Allen's stand-in protagonists ever since he stopped playing them himself have been hit-and-miss - but Chalamet is spot on, New York is gorgeous, and spending 90 minutes in the company of the city's pampered elite and their creative and coming-of-age-woes is neither annoying nor distasteful, but charming and sweet.

I am worried that Woody's age is slowly catching up on him and it is not flying Coach."}, {"id": 59, "text": "Each movie by Woody Allen (good or bad) has always some sort of layered thought about cinema and the process of writing. All of them are meta-films, in each we find tokens and signs to follow. In Annie Hall it was the idea to approach a narrative from multiple points of view, and that's why we have Alvey speaking directly to the camera, his childhood in flashbacks, tv shows (inside the movie) and even an animated sequence. In Stardust Memories we have the idea (Fellini style) of wiping out the line between the reality and fiction of the character inside the greater fiction that is the film itself. And so on... In each film we can look for and find ideas of this kind. The interesting thing about this Rainy Day... is that these issues are specially explicit. There is a narrative split between two characters, each searching for their own film:The boy enters a genre movie (thus the literal references to films that belong to a certain collective cinematic memory). The first thing that he does when he finds himself alone is to act in a movie! The romance between his and Selena G\u00f3mez's character literally starts at a movie set (a set inside the set of the film we are watching). His character's name is Gatsby Welles - two direct references to a writer and a director. This character IS an actor even if he denies it - he builds his role as the negative of the role his mother pretends him to play. He even buys props like the cigarette holder. He is a pianist, who dreams of playing jazz.The girl, on the other hand, searches for and writes (quite literally also) her own film, through the meetings (more or less accidental) with, no more no less, than a director, a (script) writer and an actor. She enters their stories, and becomes their center. She feeds on them and writes her own story, as she rewrites everyone else's. The joke is not on her, but on the three men with whom she crosses paths. Each one is a clich\u00e9, a stock character like those Woody so many times uses (a probably unintentional wink is that Liev Schreiber, who plays the director, already played Orson Welles in another movie).There's a poignant scene, near the end, when the apparently frigid and superficial Mother reveals a past that completely overwhelms the idea that the had on the obscurity of his life versus the shallowness of the University where his parents have him studying. The dramatic twist is the idea that the mother has walked down the road the sun wants to trail, she has had the life that he wishes. The mother is the most powerful character. She lived what he can only act.The end, that Chamalet and G\u00f3mez's characters admit to be taken out of a (well known) romantic movie, is so obviously artificial that we know that it can only belong to a movie, not to a real life. It closes the story of the two main characters in a dramatic way, where he will live his movie and she goes on to, presumably, write others'."}, {"id": 60, "text": "Bad main actors.

When the story took THAT turn I was already done with this film, but then he had to go there with his own MOTHER. Does W Allen hate women that much?

But in 2019, journalists are in retreat, we need even a bit of it."}, {"id": 74, "text": "A Rainy Day in New York is a new American movie from 2019 and the most recent filmmaking effort by writer and director Woody Allen, who is gonna turn 85 already next year. It runs for slightly over 90 minutes and that includes credits already, so not a too long film. And Woody Allen is still a really big name in the industry, so no surprise the cast includes many really famous actors. I don't want to make a list of the names as you can check these out for yourself, but let me say that Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Elle Fanning play the two central characters. Rebecca Hall I really like and she is always a welcome addition, even if she only has one scene like in this one here. She worked with Woody already in the Oscar-winning Vicky Cristina Barcelona where by the way she was as good as the actress who won the Oscar for that film in my opinion, maybe even better. Okay but now back to this one. Woody making films in which cities play quite a role is not an exception at all. And this is by far not his first tribute to New York. Think of Manhattan obviously or pretty recently also of the Coney-Island-set film starring Kate Winslet. Still I must say that this one here felt really much more about the characters than about New York and it could have played in other areas of the world too. It is basically set in the now. I wondered a bit about that honestly with mentions of legendary directors and the way they were mentioned felt a bit as if they were currently active still, but later on we find out about mobile phones being used and there is also a brief climate change reference in here. I mean not in the sense where it is in any way trying to make a political statement, but you know it is a film that takes place in the 21st century.Okay now about the plot and characters: Chalamet is Gatsby and Fanning is Ashleigh. I thought for quite a while that Gatsby was just his nickname really because his lifestyle and general approach to life were similar to the famous literary character's but no it is his real name. I wonder what the parents were thinking naming him like that. Anyway, we have a young couple travelling to New York for a weekend because the girl is working on a journal article for her university and she gets a chance to interview a really renowned director. This turns out to be a massive challenge to and chance for her, so eventually she just won't find any way to spend quality time with her boyfriend whatsoever. And that results basically in both of them spending a lot of time with attractive people from the opposite gender. For Ashleigh, it is not just the director, but also his regular screen writer that she is a huge fan of and eventually a really popular Hispanic actor. For the boy, it is the younger sister of a former girlfriend and a lady he meets at a restaurant. Don't want to go particularly into detail what she does because then maybe she would not fit the description anymore. But she becomes his date when they go to a party organized by his mother. I must say all these meetings were fine, but the great attention to detail was not offered in the scenes that included them, so at some point for me it basically just turned into a guessing game who's gonna end up with whom. And Woody sure enjoyed toying with us here because first it seemed as if Ashleigh could start something with the director (Schreiber), then that Gatsby could start something with Gomez' character and that Ash stays faithful, then that Ash starts something with Law's character and so on. Eventually, she is really ready to have sex with Luna's character and it would have happened if his wife had not interrupted that very moment, so it puts Ashleigh not really into the best light, also not when she says to Gatsby near the end that the actor only wanted her body and that she is happy to be with her boyfriend again, the one who she basically not only neglected all weekend, but she even denied him pretty much when being asked if she has a boyfriend, so certainly not a likable character, even if that is not too easy to say for me because I think Elle is really one of the most adorable actresses on the planet and I am sure she will have a great career for decades to come. I still must say hiccups on her I expected to be the cutest thing ever which they were not and maybe with an actress I like less I would have hated that little inclusion, even if it really only a minor addition.Now rain actually plays a crucial role in this film somewhat. There is a lot of talk about it how Chalamet's character finds it romantic, but Fanning's not at all. This is basically the key explanation why they do not really fit together. At the end, it becomes obvious too when the last words by Ashleigh in the carriage are basically an instruction to the driver to hurry up because it rains and at the same time Gatsby enjoys his time in the rain and he meets the girl he really wants there because she feels the same like him, about rain and about mutual attraction you can say. The photo here on imdb is really a bit of a spoiler, but admittedly you really could have guessed with the first (no third) kiss between these two. And how it starts raining this very moment. Or how they through coincidence meet again in the rain in the taxi and they go on the vehicle trip that Gatsby wanted to go on with his girlfriend initially. On the one hand, I am a bit surprised that Woody really cast Selena Gomez for such a crucial part, but then again nothing should really surprise me when it comes to Woody. He does what he wants and not what the media tell him and obviously he himself is controversial enough as a character that he should not really give any credibility to people saying Gomez may not be good enough an actress for the part. And I thought she was good enough anyway. As for Woody, many people still refuse to watch his films because of his romantic affairs, but I think that is not any of my business and I won't strip myself of a quality watch because of that, especially because I have a permanent ticket anyway, so I did not pay any money specifically for this showing, i.e. into the filmmaker's pocket. These criticisms are like the ones about Polanski, another very old and successful filmmaker, although maybe slightly less serious for Woody. But I don't want to write a lot about that here and return to the film instead. How much I consider it worth watching is already described in the title of my review. I don't think it is as bad as many say, but also not a truly great achievement. People who like Chalamet (and Fanning) should watch it as basically one of them is always seen and it is a bit split between these two as they don't share too many scenes like Allen already did it in another recent film with Stewart and Eisenberg. But this one here also has many nice moments and examples of smart writing. I liked the beginning with the song. And how we are thrown right into the action, which is not too surprising though because like I said it is not a long movie. As always, Woody will definitely get a smile on your lips here and there. I will mention some moments when he did with me. For example, that was when near the end all the guys want to get away with Ashleigh and leave everything behind and act as if it was true love, well except her boyfriend, who was crazy in love early on, so I struggled a bit with believing he fell out of it so quickly, even if admittedly seeing your girlfriend enter a famous actor's car makes something with you. But I want to talk about the positive really now. These final moments of Schreiber's and Law's characters were funny. Also funny was how he keeps beating everybody at poker and makes tons of money this way and well I will leave it at that, you will recognize these little funny moments when you see them like what's the secret thing Schreiber's character wants to tell her and she thinks it is something else at first. Simple Woody, you know what I mean. Nonetheless, there were also many moments that were intended as funny, but did not work out so well, like him trying to hide away from his extended family at the museum. Or the scene I mentioned earlier when one character's (still) partner shows up and destroys a scene in which a couple is getting busy. Also for the non-funny moments there are further examples that you will find yourself. One more dramatic scene that did really nothing for me sadly was the one near the end when we have Gatsby's mother confess to him about her professional background back in the day. I mean this really made something with Gatsby as we find out at the very end, but this monologue by the mother did absolutely nothing for me and it reminded me of Chalamet's most famous film, in which his dad makes a confession to him at the end and that scene is so right, so heartfelt, so honest and this scene we have here is really nothing of that. This parallel was really disappointing for me. But yeah, overall I still believe the good is more frequent in this film than the weak and unless you start watching it with expectations that it could be a masterpiece, you shouldn't be disappointed. I give it a thumbs-up and nice to see Woody still come up with movies like this at his really old age now."}, {"id": 75, "text": "Woody Allen's most recent film (2019) is a huge film. One more...

They are too slow for my taste, there's usually too much dialogue and the characters are stereotypes of some sort. But this time, the old pervert did it right. This movie was chosen by pure accident: being a foggy November outside (although it's January) .I wanted to spend the evening with a movie that is light and not demanding, so I've started searching... this one caught my attention as it had more than 6 stars on IMDB. Usually, romantic movies rarely get past the barrier of the '6'. Maybe it's because all of them have the same old pattern, girl or boy falls in love, finds out his partner is not what he thought it was and in the end they end up with someone else, usually some old lost romance. So by watching one movie, you will soon have the feeling that you've watched them all. This one started as well as any regular romantic chick flick: Mr. He, a quiet, although intelligent boy has a rich, popular girlfriend and, being a movie where everything is possible, they are together. Mr. He plans a romantic weekend with Mrs. She - where else than in New York, where Mrs. She wants to have a short, one hour interview with some famous movie actor Liev Schreiber. This is a perfect recipe for these 5 star romantic movies you will watch and forget the next hour. When lucky, your better half will get all romantic about it and you will enjoy some joy-time in the evening. But not this movie: Quite soon from the beginning, the perfectly planned trip is torn apart by some unforeseen events, when Mrs. She gets invited to watch the unreleased movie of this famous actor, so the one hour interview gets suddenly longer and all of Mr. He's plans will be torn apart. Also, after this happens, Mr. He meets the handsome little sister of his first crush, and they end up kissing. Not in a romantic way, no, they are part of a movie and they are being filmed... The Woody Alan style is there, all-right, as the characters talk tremendously much, but this time it kind of feels natural: the dialogues are between people who did not meet for a very long time and they have lots to say to catch up. Also, like in any Woody Alan movie, all of the characters are put into situations where their true self comes to surface: Mrs. She will soon forget that she has a boyfriend and gets drawn into the stormy social life of several famous artists: First, Roland, who has some serious midlife crisis and obviously drinking issues as well, his friend, who by an unfortunate mistake finds out that his wife is cheating on him with his best friend or a famous Italian actor, who just wants to take advantage of her like he did with so many others. Being a naive blonde and helped by the endless drink she's offered everywhere she quickly ends up in the bedroom of this famous Italian actor . Without spoiling the rest of the movie, all I can say that the plot is not predictable at all and very enjoyable: every time when you expect that the character will act in a very predictable way, they fuck up somehow and do exactly the opposite. Unlike other Woody Alan movies, where the dialogue seems to be overwhelming the entire movie, here it feels natural that really helps to reveal the true nature of each of the main protagonists without being over-abusive. Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie where Elle and Timothee's acting talent really shines, but also the secondary characters shall not be neglected, as well, like Will Rogers, for example. To conclude, if you would like to watch a good movie on a quiet evening, alone or with your better half, this is a great choice and I am sure you won't be disappointed."}, {"id": 81, "text": "This film tells the story of a young couple's strangely eventful day in New York.This film is Woody Allen in the sense that it still contains a lot of medical terms and many rapid dialogs.

That scene elevates the film a lot, in my opinion. Elle Fanning is great in the film, as her character appears truly innocent and very nice most of the time. I enjoyed this star studded film."}, {"id": 82, "text": "Woody Allen's die-hard fans would likely agree that one of the auteur's main draws is dialogue. A rainy day in New York is no exception. In the following brief recap of the plot, therefore, I'll quote liberally. These quotes, incidentally, were jotted down on my muted cell phone from the last, entirely unoccupied (except for myself, of course) row of seats in the cinema. I was absolutely certain that not a single person in the audience was able to see the glow from my cell phone. Not even out of the corner of the eye.The plot is not unlike one of the several story lines in another of Allen's film, To Rome with love (2012), where a young Italian couple Antonio and Milly travelling from a small town to Rome and end up having separate adventures. But, even when some of the details are recycled, A rainy day in New York concludes with a different twist.The couple, boyfriend and girlfriend from the same college, go to New York for a weekend. Ashleigh (Elle Fanning), Pulitzer-aspiring journalism major, has an opportunity to interview a famed director for her school paper. Gatsby (Timothee Chalamet), perhaps thus named intentionally, sees this as an opportunity for a romantic escapade in a city where he grew up in a rich family. Similar to abovementioned Antonio and Milly, Gatsby and Ashleigh follow separate paths after checking into their hotel room in New York, and do not see each other again until the day is over.Gatsby runs into Shannon (Selena Gomez), the little sister of an ex-girlfriend, and fills in as an extra for a commercial she is making, requiring him to kiss her passionately. Upon finding out that Gatsby's current girlfriend is from Arizona, Shannon quips What do you talk about with her? Cactus? And rattlesnakes Gatsby countered. When Gatsby exclaims that he knew Shannon as a cheeky little girl and she is now a young woman, she says, Now, are you going to start singing Gigi?. Yes, there are references aplenty to other movies. Later, Gatsby and Shannon run into each other again, but allow me to refrain from further disclosures here.Ashleigh, in the meantime, goes through her personal Odyssey of three men, who respectively have spiritual, emotional and physical needs which they hope she would fill. The director interviewed, Roland Pollard (Liev Schreiber), not young any more, is popular still with women, prompting a remark from someone what is so sexy about memory lost. He seems to be suffering from an identity crisis and looks towards Ashleigh as his new muse. When he finally breaks down in a work screening to which Ashleigh is invited, and disappears, she pairs up with writer Ted Davidoff (Jude Law), driving all over town to search for him. Things take a turn when Ted spots his wife Connie (Rebecca Hall) going into an apartment where is best friend lives, and becomes so emotionally frantic that Ashleigh wouldn't want to leave him all by himself. This leads to a hilarious scene of Ted's confrontation with Connie, who charges him of bringing a 15-year-old concubine. Ashleigh promptly produces her identity card to prove that she is 21!Later, continuing the search by herself, Ashleigh comes face-to-face with the heartthrob star Francisco Vega (Diego Luna), when she tells him that her roommate considers him the best thing to come along since the morning after pills. To others, however, Francisco is a James Dean minus acting chops. Later, in the evening, all three men converge at a party, where Roland asks Ashleigh to go with him to the south of Francis to help him rediscover himself. To where of what? she echoes. The evening eventually finds her in Francisco's bedroom, and I am not going to disclose how it ends.At the other end, Gatsby is frustrated by Ashleigh's phone call saying that she cannot join him, yet. Finally, seeing her on gossip TV news getting into the car with Francisco becomes the last straw. In a bar drinking alone, he comes across a gorgeous woman whose work is to make dreams come true. Use your imagination is her reply to his prompting question. With a flash of inspiration, he hires her to accompany him as his girlfriend Ashleigh to his parent's party. His helicopter mother (Cherry Jones) soon send the girl away and tells his son point blank I can smell a hooker when a see one. More twists to follow. I have already sinned with much spoiler. Suffices to say that it is not too difficult to see what is coming if you are paying attention.Just by looking at the names, one can see the calibre of the brilliant supporting cast. But its Fanning that is captivating all the way. I won't pretend that I remember her in a 2-year-old role in I am Sam. But I well remember many movies from the amazing proliferation of her work during her teenage years (she just turned 21). In Super 8 she is a daring, adventurous teenager. Maleficent sees her as a mainstream, sweetheart of a heroine. The Beguiled is an eye-opener, casting her against type as an unsuspected fame fatale. I think we're alone now pitches her against the world's most famous dwarf in an acting contest. And then there is heart-wrenching Galveston, where she shows her true steel playing a desperate young mother. Here, with Woody Allen, Fanning displays superb, pitch-perfect comedy sense. Timothee Chalamet is of course another rising star that shines just a bright. But in this movie, he is outshined by Fanning."}, {"id": 83, "text": "Ok the female characters are airheads, or fellatrixes or shallow climbers.Even more fun several of the actors and actresses involved in this film are the most out front nanny PC lecturers wagging their fingers and mouths at the public , yet are working with #metoo poster perv Woody.

I should have listened! This film is without a doubt the worst film I have ever seen! Even the character's names are unbelievable. I don't know how Allen managed to direct these wonderful actors to give such hideous performances. The main character, Gatsby, is a 20 year old college student, who speaks like a character out of a 1950's Turner Classic film. At 84, Woody couldn't play the main character himself, so he dressed Gatsby in his signature tweed jacket, affects him with a mumbling Allenesque speech pattern, and completes the transformation by adding an eighty year old's posture to the character's twenty something's frame. Jude Law's character's wife is cheating on him with a man whose name is out of a 1930's vaudeville act. In the scene where he catches her, he reacts like a character in an old Marx brothers' film. All the male characters are a version of Woody, and they have been directed to deliver their lines as if Woody himself is speaking them. Only Liev Schreiber is spared the Allen schtick but he is given so little to work with that his performance is lost in the God awful shuffle. The performances are wooden at best, cringe worthy at their worst. The cultural references coming out of the mouths of college age kids ( supposedly in today's timeline) belong to the eighty-four year old Allen's era and the talented Elle Fanning is just hard to watch. The film is misogynistic , and the plot is almost non existent. It was difficult to sit through to the end. If this is the best Allen has to offer, Woody, it's time to call it a day.

A rainy day in New York was very charming and had many great qualities to it but was held back by it's character work and issues within its plot, let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, I loved the performances and characters, use of narration and dialogue. The performance in this film were great, Elle Fanning had a charm to her acting, and her character with her innocence and Naivety was likeable in most parts, but the best performance definitely has to be from Timothee Chalamet, who further proves that he can play any role well, his performance was likeable, charming and passionate, to the point where you couldn't help but really like his character and his progression of finding what he wants to do with his life will connect with a lot of people. The narration used was also excellent, it really added layers to the character, making you learn about their pasts, but it also added humour and more of an easy connection to Gatsby as a character. The dialogue in general was also great, it was very witty and fast paced and was a key part in what made a lot of the characters very likeable. The cinematography was also excellent, with the scenery that New York has to offer you are almost guaranteed a visually stunning movie, and this was definitely the case here, the amount of fantastic set pieces and Mise en scene was excellent with key attention payed to the lighting and colour saturation which I loved.My next couple of positives would be the humour and charming tone. The film surprised me with it's amount of humour in places, there was so many different interactions which some worked and some didn't (which we will get onto in the next paragraph) with funny characters with a good running gag of someone with an ugly laugh. The film also had a very charming tone, when watching you couldn't help but have that warm fuzzy feeling inside that just made you smile at what you were watching, the characters and dialogue was a part of the charm, but also just how classic Hollywood it felt.However, my first few negatives would be that there was too many characters with a lack of development making it feel like two movies, the odd creative choices, and the lack of connection to the main relationship. There was for me way to many characters with a lack of development throughout the movie, this made the pacing and the script very inconsistent, also making the film lack a cohesive plot, and it also felt like two different movies, with Gatsby and Ashleigh having hardly any screen time together, so it was two different stories that weren't really connected well enough. I also didn't connect to the main relationship hardly at all. The script did a terrible job at making you connect with Gatsby and Ashleigh's relationship, whenever they were together which wasn't very often, they always seemed very distanced and not that interested in each other, I just thought it was odd that they moulded the whole film on a relationship that people couldn't connect with. They also made some very odd creative choices with Ashleigh as a character. Making her so easily controllable and her lack of thought in terms of the situations she got in and her lack of thought towards Gatsby, made it really difficult to connect with her character.My final two negatives would be the lack of plot and the odd ending for Ashleigh. The film really lacked a solid and developed plot, this wasn't the case with the characters which I will get onto, but the plot was really just multiple different meetings and scenarios and just lacked and complexity, I also thought the ending they chose for Ashleigh was odd and I wasn't particularly a fan of it, the fact that they almost had both her and Gatsby just meet and make up like nothing happened was not a good decision, they did something with Gatsby's character for the end which was good, but they just left Ashleigh without any form of satisfying ending or conclusion to her character arc.My final few positives would be the character background and development and the satisfying ending for Gatsby's character. The film did an excellent job at developing Gatsby as a character so this paragraph is dedicated just for him. The amount of background they went into explaining why he behaved how he did, and his relationship with his family was really well done and in depth, it made you understand his character a lot more and really made you connect to him. How they developed his character was also very well done, to see his personal journey of discovering what he wanted to do with his life was very satisfying and well done, you learned his passions and interests as the film went on, so when he finally decided it was well earned. The ending for his character was also very satisfying, him being with Selena Gomez's character and staying in New York was definitely a good decision by the creative team.Overall A Rainy Day In New York is a charming, and funny movie, that took you back to the classic Hollywood era, with fantastic character work. But is held back by it's lack of detail to it's plot and the lack of cohesiveness with the characters and how they were all connected."}, {"id": 162, "text": "Regardless of the drama around the film.

The city works as a live character that has an affection on the characters and pushes them to take desicions that will change their lives. The walks in the narrow streets of Manhattan and the various beautiful places give retro vibes to the movie. ~Timothee Chalamet gives a solid performance and portrays a neurotic young man struggling with his thoughts and love life. He makes his own rebellion and despises reach people although he is a part of them. He is actually a Woody Allen archetype and immitates his mannerisms from his earlier filmography. The interaction with his mother (Cherryl Jones shines here) and her revelation make him reconsider his opinion about her and see some things from a different perspective. ~Elle Fanning does a decent job as always. She is a naive young woman who must choose which part of her life is more significant, her romantic relationship or her future success. As expected she makes stupid mistakes due to her immaturity and her little experience about life. On the other hand, Selena Gomez is the most straightforward but relatable character of the film and her chemistry with Chalamet is fantastic. With her first appearance comes the rain which symbolizes the changing of many things. ~The rest of the cast does a respectable effort. Liev Shreiber, Jude Law and and Diego Luna represent intellectual and sophisticated people who hide their uncertainties and their personal problems and see Fanning's character as a their last recourse. ~The ending of the movie is standard but in a good way. The couple finally meets again but they have changed. Each has experienced some harsh realities and truths that have left them more down to earth and each one has made a life-changing decision. ~The piano notes create a nolstagia for the old New York and generally an aesthetic of an older era. The photography of Vittorio Storaro is impeccable and the kissing scene inside a car between Chalamet and Gomez as the raindrops start to fall on the car is magical.CONS ~The film lacks originality considering that its themes is a terittory that Allen has extensively covered before. Moreoever, despite the charisma of Elle Fanning, the end of her character is left in limbo. ~Although the dialogue is witty and sharp, it is kind of pretentious that these conversations come from young people. In other words, it's not how 21-year-old talk and behave in the modern world but how Woody Allen wishes they talked and behaved, something that makes the characters unrealistic. ~The movie chooses to focus only on rich people and as a result it seems that they live in their own bubble and their problems are overdramatized (personally I find it hard to relate to any of them, maybe it's just me)."}, {"id": 168, "text": "I never got what the appeal of a Woody Allen movie is but this one at least was quite easy to watch only for two reasons Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Elle Fanning.

No. Do I want to know her forever now? Yes! The two or three scenes where she has monologues are already legendary. And if she keeps her mouth shut, she still completely dominates the frame.NY... 'She' does not easily combine with melancholic, but Woody Allen is able to show and exploit that side of this city. Love it. No one else is so capable of visualizing the love you can have for this city.Allen does not often sink through the 'class' his dialogues already have, to really expose underlying emotions in a more raw way. A lot often remains wrapped in infectious and very erudite - Jewish - humor. But at the very end of this movie actress Cherry Jones has the opportunity to cause goosebumps on my arms in a short, gripping monologue that digs up those emotions. It is proof of the total control that Allen has over his profession over the years. Just like the entire movie.

Critics can have their opinions, but they can't change the fact that I not only enjoyed this more than any other late Woody Allen film, but I was deeply touched by it. It reached into deep places. I laughed at it more than other films.The laughter and the delight the film evoked in me can't be mistaken. That's how it affected me. What better criterion can we have for a film? If the same film touches some people and not others, is it more likely due to a limitation of the film or the people AKA critics?Other Allen films are funny. Other films dissect our collective hypocrisy, self-centeredness, and inhumanity. This one stands out because it sounds notes of hope and love, the importance of ephemeral moments of beauty accessible to everyone willing to pay theprice for them.It's about a young man searching for his way in life, what life has to offer that's has genuine value. It rings the bell of the different things he loves, that lift him above the daily grind. THe movie manages to invoked moments of these magic spells for us, too.It's also about the foibles of film makers. Funny, and pitiful. Allen is well qualified to draw those portraits.Particularly impressive is the charm and presence of Solena Gomez. Her character radiates warmth, honesty and aliveness, profound depth of feeling combined with social adroitness.Timothee Chalamet does a good job of presenting a character that captures the features of Woody Allen without being a parody or imitation. Allen invoked the feelings and came up with the words. It's inevitable that Gatsby will remind us of Woody Allen himself, as he is on screen. Chalamet gives us an original refreshing character.People who demand a brand new original plot line are ignoring literary history. Sec comedy has used the same plot twists from ancient Rome, through Shakespeare, down to the present. This does film have insights into the meaning of life not found in many films.P.S.As far as the rejection of the film on the grounds of the accusation against Woody Allen, this is just my opinion. I respect other opinions. This is an unproven allegation based on the memory of a child from many decades ago. It's known that such allegations can turn out to be untrue, for many reasons. As I understand it, three different official agencies investigated the claim. One of them, an expert in such allegations, exonerated Allen. The other two found no credible evidence. Do we want to be a society that destroys the career of a great American artist on the basis of a single, unproven, contested allegation? I don't think that is justice."}, {"id": 183, "text": "This is one of the best that Woody Allen has offered us in the last 15 years or so, on par with films such as Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Midnight in Paris. First of all, New York and Manhattan in particular have probably pictured more picturesque with those cosy shades of sepia and the moody rainy environment captured masterfully by Vittorio Storaro, one of the great cinematographers, a real living legend.This film would go down as one of the highlights in the career of the new promising actors and actresses such as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Elle Fanning, also Jude Law, Liev Schreiber, Rebecca Hall and Diego Luna offer greatly amusing performances, while Selena Gomez provides good proof that she has a solid acting talent as she confronts Chalamet in a few funny instances.The story as a whole is one of Allen's typical themes, presenting a naive college girl dazzled by the film star society of the Big Apple and soon she betrays all love and loyalty to her young lover who desperately tries to reconnects to her on a rainy day in New York.Woody Allen, shows great nerve and style in directing, there's solid fast tempo that holds the story interesting and tight without a single dull moment. There are of course those greatly inspired one liners that add extra laughs and wit to the story. All in all, one of the finest films that Woody Allen has managed to offer in the last 10-15 years! And now, just one small note to the me too or whoever else tries to censor arts: You are the people's WORST nightmare.Only Fascists and Stalinists in the past, tried to censor or forbid arts and we all know very well how much hatred they gained just because of these actions.

Why we need him so much. without Allen, the cinema industry would have been a little boring. His films are unique and very powerful by meaning of beauty, art and emotion. A Rainy Day in New York is another perfect example of true art. The film stars with a young couple visiting New York for the weekend and end up in a rainy day full of excitements. The movie feels like another Allen love story from the start: the location of New York, the narrating, the differences between characters, how they fall in love against all chances, and the sweet ending that all viewers wish to have in their lives. When I first saw this film I immediately had a sense of nostalgia towards Manhattan and Annie Hall. All films perfectly connect to each other, not by plot but more in a sense of genre and dialogue. The dialogues in this film are just like in any other of Allen's films, catchy, humorous and with a lot of sense towards life. The cast is amazing: Timoth\u00e8e Chalamet is wonderful, his character resembles a lot of Allen's performance in his other films. Basically it's the same character but different actor. Selena Gomez is adorable and shines in her role, Elle Fanning is humorous, the entire cast works so well with the genre of the film.

So, I still have to wait until October for the film to be released in Spain. But I know that it will be amazing, so I give it a 10 already.I'm angry and furious at the stupidity and witch-hunt that goes on in the States and don't have words to express my anger and disappointment. How is it possible that Woody's art has suffered because of a shameful prefabricated accusation? Woody has worked with hundreds and hundreds of actresses in the past half century and nobody, NOBODY has ever complaint of his behavior. If you believe that prefabricated story made by 3 vengeful psychos you are either ignorant, stupid, antisemite, or just part of the lynch mob. It does not exist another single case of real abuse that presents only 1 accusation. For the ones who feel uncomfortable with the fact that Woody fell in love with Soon-Yi Previn, just have in mind that Woody and Soon-Yi love each other and are together for more than 26 years, have 2 wonderful daughters and don't care about what you, me or the psychos think about their love. Their relationship and their love is what triggers the ignorant people, not the shameful false accusation.I know that A Rainy Day in New York will be wonderful and magical, like every film that Woody makes, so I can already rate it with a 10. It has an excellent cast and one of the best cinematographers of today: Vittorio Storaro.Since Amazon loves to censure Woody Allen's fans and controls half the world I guess these words will not be published here. But just let me say that there are millions of fans who support, admire and love Woody Allen and who will go to the cinema to watch and enjoy this wonderful gem. Woody's the best director ever and the best writer ever. His films talk about love, death, dreams, art, passions, and desires, and are poetic, brilliant, real, magnificent, stunning and wonderful.We love you, Woody! Thanks for your Art. Your films make life better / Antonia Tejeda Barros, Madrid (Spain).Updated: I JUST SAW THE FILM! I had to wait until today (August 24th) to see the film. I was very lucky to be with my family in the Netherlands this month and this afternoon I went with my oldest daughter (she's 13 and loves Woody's films) to the national Dutch preview of A Rainy Day in New York at the Film Hallen (Hannie Dankbaarpassage 12, Amsterdam). We live in Madrid and in Spain the film will only arrive in October.I don't want to give ANY SPOILERS here, but I just will say: Wow, such a film: funny, poetic, beautiful, clever and so entertaining. We enjoyed it so much. Such a gem! Woody is so brilliant, Vittorio is the king of light, and the writing is so cool and funny. The only problem: the film felt too short! I wish it would have gone on for two more hours... (Woody should always make films that are over two hours long, one hour and a half simply feels too short!).I have to confess that I was very angry with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet because of his cowardice and opportunism, but his performance in the film is very beautiful. Selena Gomez is also really good and Diego Luna is very funny. Elle Fanning is probably the weakest actress here (to play comedy isn't that easy after all) but it doesn't bother so much because her lines are hilarious. Cherry Jones' performance is absolutely spectacular. Liev Schreiber, Jude Law, Will Rogers and Kelly Rohrbach are also great but I wish they'd appear more.The music of A Rainy Day in New York is wonderful as in all Woody Allen films, you can feel the rain's perfume and there are plenty of quotes that will make you laugh and enjoy.No superheroes here, no bombs, no explosions, just real people with normal problems, like you and me.

I very much enjoyed *Midnight in Paris*, for example - and tonight felt that I was watching outtakes from it that were rejected with good reason.Basically, there is nothing new here. It seemed like a patchwork of previous WA movies, but never came close to reaching the heights of the best ones. The main characters seemed to be too young to be spouting lines the likes of which we are used to hearing from characters decades older.I felt downright sorry for Ms. Fanning. She was made to play an airhead, which she did well, but do we really want to see that in 2019? I should think many women would find her offensive.The male lead wasn't much better. He seemed very shallow.They were like pale copies - very pale copies - of the engaged couple in *Midnight in Paris*, but without an interesting third party such as that earlier movie had.The usual talk about the arts seemed very superficial, as if the characters were just reciting lines they had memorized but didn't understand.There were scenes that were fun to watch for the scenery.

Timothee Chalamet is dreamy and solid but doesn't get enough clout. I'm not fond of the huddle of middle-aged film lotharios jumping all over Fanning, and I don't think Selena Gomez had enough sharp lines. However, it's another study from Allen of New York as a live character taking over the people in it and sweeping them along. Cherry Jones is extremely well-cast as the mother with a secret and Allen saves the best till last. I probably won't watch it again for a long time, not one of his best but not the worst either. It's a shame that Netflix have done what they did to Allen. Not just for him, but the hundreds of names that rolled past in the credits of all the cast and crew who worked so hard on this movie to have it junked in the US, who did nothing to deserve this.

The young actors have no context, path, frame, experience to play any of this believably. The rain is fun to watch though. It brings this eery context with the global warming doom, which reflects the larger cultural apocalypse, making this film a clash of acting methods, generations, and then Woody's own script that no one seemed to have read since they've seen enough of his films to approximate it. Thing is this is new in the sense Woody has never been so subtle with his 'metaphor'. Apocalypse Woody. The Storaro lights feel both remarking on the artificial with spotlight, warmly inviting in the doom, and over Chalamet to the european canon, making it a parallel collaboration; too bad they have to open their mouths. The release history make it like fragments after the glass shattered following his crimes. Woody, AD. Imagine how much farther removed his work will seem in the future where it actually will feel like some bizarre take on the English language. His films branched off in a chain forming a parallel evolution to a different reality, like how you set the algorithm to simulate a thousand years... and 'Rainy Day' would pop out as the five thousandth Allen film. The rain though. I don't like Chalamet in all this rain. He is the picture of a rich kid so it is a very narrow path to win the audience already. He can work as some great archetype. A prince. A sculptor's subject. He doesn't work contemporary, or rather, vocal; and I see him struggling to make this grand and small at once, giving the film its contrast. The more he talks the more he breaks the spell. The girl with the 12 year old's face, well that's both of them, drag it deeper into the surreal. Is there some dilemma of love at play? But while the world is being flooded, that is not a break from the rain, it is an indulgence of scenery when they're anxious about all the wrong things. The mother's monologue there is more a spectacle of how her intellectual indulgence has destroyed the world. Ok Woody.

The skill, tone, and conversations don't seem to be a Woody- esque ability, but a try-hard under graduate version masquerading as him.I couldn't finish this one and it won't be going into the collection. Sorry Woody, bro! 3/10"}, {"id": 192, "text": "So, I am pleased to announce myself as a Woody Allen fan. I wasn't sure before, but if I look back at all the single movies I watched directed by him.. there wasn't a single one I didn't REALLY like. So, does this qualify me as a Woody Allen fan? I think so.Maybe his comedies are not for everyone but I love their simplicity, their cleverness, their atmosphere..This one has some GREAT performances of people I didn't even know and an excellent acting from Selena Gomez, who is, in my opinion, very underrated as an actress, because she's totally real and sincere (The Fundamentals of Caring gave an example as well).Timothe\u00e9 is new (at least for me) and I have to say I was pleased to see him in the role of the protagonist and his chemistry with Gomez felt deep and meaningful.. Maybe, as a hopeless musician myself, it was really easy to relate to him as he struggles to find his own way in a sick world, with a big wonderful city such as New York to fulfill his dreams.Check this out. You will feel good at the end, and probably want to see it again, to experience the depth of the characters once again."}, {"id": 193, "text": "A Rainy Day in New York is a classic Woody Allen film: lots of dialogue and multiple intertwined characters with their own personal dilemmas-and, in the spotlight, a seemingly happy couple discovering that they don't have much in common. Gorgeous cinematography, sets and costumes. And a very well-narrated story in which the human condition prevails.Ashleigh (Elle Fanning) and Gatsby (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) are spending a weekend in Manhattan for a very special occasion: She (a journalism student) will interview one of the most famous directors in the movie industry. He will visit his parents and both will spend a romantic weekend with the excuse of a school assignment. But the bad weather in New York is a perfect metaphor for a weekend of encounters and disagreements.The cast is fascinating: Elle Fanning shines! Her naivet\u00e9 and enthusiasm are a great mix to make her character so enjoyable to watch. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is on point, despite that this will not be one of his memorable roles in his filmography. Liev Shreiber plays his character in a way that ensures the audience wants to know more about him, but the script does not have a complete arc for him to deliver.Selena Gomez plays Chan, and I love her performance as one of Gatsby's friends from the past (her sister used to date Gatsby) who seems to have a different point of view. Diego Luna plays a famous actor-great to have a Latino represented in the story-and Jude Law is convincing as the famous director's assistant who is discovering an awful truth. All these great actors are absolutely well-directed under the classic, charming, genuine Woody Allen storytelling. The music, classic jazz, evokes the sounds of a very sophisticated Manhattan and underscores the charm and elegance. The movie industry and its complexities as well as the beautiful city of New York are characters in the story like in other Woody Allen films. The cinematography is one of the greatest achievements of this film: Vitorio Storaro is certainly a master of light, and the golden hour scenes make A Rainy Day in New York aesthetically stunning and kept me in awe throughout the movie.I give A Rainy Day in New York 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for 13 to 18 (and adults, of course). Some themes won't be relevant for audiences under this age, and there's brief nudity, mild drug use and adult themes.

Woody Allen should be praised for that. But in this film neither the dialog nor the story works.Hannah and Her Sisters works so well because Woody Allen understood these characters--how they talk and behave. He knew how to write for them.That was 1986. Now it's 2019.21-year-olds in 2019 don't say I need a drink, a cigarette and a Berlin ballad. No matter what their background that's not how they would talk.A Rainy Day in New York is filled with references that no one born in the late 1990s would have. Songs by Gershwin, Porter, Berlin. Films from the 1930s and 40s. And the name of the lead character, Gatsby Welles, is just a little too cute. All of these are Woody Allen references. The problem is trying to force these references on these characters. It doesn't work.Maybe this film is meant to be a fantasy. It's not how 21-year-olds talk and behave in the modern world. It's how Woody Allen wishes they talked and behaved.No one wants to see a film about people staring into their phones but the truth is that the two leading characters would have been texting each other every few minutes and wouldn't have gotten so completely separated from each other. I think it's clear that Woody Allen hates cell phones because they get in the way of his stories.I would have suggested two important changes to the film. Have it take place 25 years earlier--1994 instead of 2019, before everyone had their own phone--and make the characters in their mid-30s instead of their early 20s. With those two changes I think this would be remembered as one of Woody Allen's better films. As it stands he's created characters he doesn't know or understand and, unfortunately, it shows."}, {"id": 195, "text": "A Rainy Day in New York is Woody Allen at his charming and witty best, even though much about the film is slightly weird and problematic. For a start we have a supposedly contemporary comedy in which a cast of young, hip twenty-something actors deliver lines very clearly written by someone several generations older. So while you'd expect their cultural references to be Beyonce, Bieber and Gaga, Allen has them casually citing Grace Kelly, Gigi, Sky Masterson, Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum while dropping his bon mots. Timothee Chalamet's character at least has the cover of being fan of New York piano bars who feels most at home at the Cafe Carlyle and the Pierre. Still, when he sits at the piano and sings Everything Happens To Me - a moderately obscure song written in 1940 - it's still more than a little odd. The other problematic elements are the usual Woody Allen fixations. All three of the older male characters (played by Liev Shreiber, 54; Jude Law, 57 and Diego Luna, 40) attempt to seduce the nubile 21-year-old Ashleigh (who at one point is mistaken for 15). And both Elle Fanning and Selina Gomez are written and groomed as Lolita types in barely-there mini-skirts. That said, their characters are vivacious (Elle) and smart (Selina) and Allen coaxes wonderful performances from them. Chalamet is also charming, even if I never quite bought him as a somewhat cynical, semi-jaded inveterate gambler, and even though he doesn't always make Allen's witty observations sing as they really should. But there are standout performances by Jude Law and Cherry Jones. The entire movie is (yet another) love letter to New York. Almost every interior location (bars, hotels, apartments) is a visual feast, gloriously photographed. And, all in all, it's an enjoyably frothy confection of a movie, and a cut above most of Allen's late-career efforts."}, {"id": 196, "text": "I had never watched a Woody Allen film before. I was worried this one was going to be either boring or depressing, which is the vibe I always got from him (and now I'm rethinking) but I decided to watch it anyway for the two female protagonists and it was not the case at all.It's the type of movies that don't have a strong plot but instead appeal to the overall charm of each one of its acts, somewhat like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood style. When done poorly, this concept results in 90 minutes of just stuff happening, which is why I was a little reluctant to watch it, but this one keeps the viewer engaged in a very comfortably relaxing and entertaining way from beginning to end. Not anxious about what's going to happen next, wanting something specific to happen, rooting for one character or wanting a couple to end up together.. it just keeps you hooked up enjoying the moment. It advances at a gentle but constant pace, it never stalls, there's something interesting or meaningful happening at every minute.Woody Allen's films are sort of a niche so if you're a fan of his work then you'll probably watch it without reading these reviews first, but if you're worried this might not be your type of movie I highly recommend you give it a try. It will not blow you away but it will definitely keep you entertained throughout the entire length and will leave you with a really nice and warm feeling."}, {"id": 197, "text": "There is no one who shows the wonderful aspects of New York so magically as Woody.

He likes playing the piano and resents his pretentious social climbing parents. But he's got a surprise in store.

Now, before you roll your eyes back into your head, when I say timeless I mean Woody has basically made this film, I don't know, ten times already, but for me the message hits a little different and still resonates each and every time. And I just love the man's writing. I also watched a couple of \u00c9ric Rohmer's early works this year, and A Rainy Day in New York reminded me of them in a most pleasant way.And I probably had the most ideal viewing experience imaginable as well: a steady rain outside the theatre, the film shown in a rather small room, with a senior crowd (old ladies letting out hearty laughs left and right), me and my nice cup of green tea in one hand and a pretzel in the other.It truly was one cosy afternoon. I look forward to repeating it once it hits VOD.P.S. (on the behind the scenes stuff): I get why people wouldn't want to watch/support Woody's work. I myself am quite iffy about watching Polanski films. While I'd question the integrity of certain cast members, donating their income to charities is ultimately a good thing.

Woody writes and directs a charming homage to his beloved New York. He creates interestiing, quirky parts for these overrated actors. But even Woody with all his directing talent cannot draw compelling performances from the ingrates Chalamet and Hall who fell in lock step with the MeToo crowd to enhance their female-identified creds. What, so he can get a part in worst version of Little Women  ever made? And work with that overrated director Gerwig, another ingrate. Chalamet cannot act his way out of a paper bag. And Hall is so wooden, she's got splinters coming out of her pores. Yet I give this movie a 10/10 - for the amusing story, marvelous score featuring the incomparable Errol Garner, the sumptuous Manhattan cinematography and the exquisite sets. I agree with some of the others on this site that the Gatsby role was perfect for Jesse Eisenberg. Because of the me -too posse, we were not able to see this film in a theatre. This is just another black mark for my country as if we don't have enough. I feel fortunate to have obtained a DVD for my collection. I just hope that when Woody writes his next screenplay, he writes parts for the loyal, talented actors who have the courage to stand up for him, i.e. Alec Baldwin and Scarlet Johansen. I hope he shoots in Europe where he is respected.

New York has never been shown with so much melancholy in an Allen offering before, and let me tell you it just feels ethereal, completing that sentiment with its wonderful and pleasant jazz soundtrack, which never fails to suit New York rightly so.Allen's dialogues are usually quite excellent, is where his talent lies, but do his performers' delivery do them justice? You can bet they do. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Elle Fanning play their parts stupendously, they fit incredibly well in Allen's designed universe and filmic context. As do Liev Schreiber and Jude Law, who have great supporting roles, and I must not forget Selena Gomez, who is Fanning's counterpart in terms of how contrasting her roles are.Allen excels at telling stories that develop in the course of a day, a weekend, etc. He knows how to unravel events, incidents and whatnot in a way that it doesn't feel unrealistic, but somehow belong to his peculiar cinematic framework, and that's a marvelous achievement for a filmmaker, but it comes as no surprise, given that Allen has been an established trademark since the late 70s, and has been an unstopabble filmmaking machine ever since, with many hits and misses, but being his cinematic self all the way through, with small adaptations to current times, such as technological developments and new stars that have caught his infallible eye for acting talent.All in all, this is Woody Allen as always, but at the same time he comes in fresh dose of renewal, which is what keeps his many supporters interested in his vast filmography."}, {"id": 203, "text": "In the Yardley College, Gatsby Welles (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) learns that his girlfriend Ashleigh Enright (Elle Fanning) will travel to Manhattan to interview the cult director Roland Pollard (Liev Schreiber) for the college paper and he plans a romantic weekend with her.

Firstly that the film was actually finally released after all the foolish faux-controversy nonsense that delayed his 50th film being issued. The second surprise was that it is really rather a fun and likeable watch. (These days, long-term Woody fans, such as I, have become accustomed to regular dud films between good ones) So, here we have a director deep into his 80's attempting to make a film in his unique style but comprising of a cast of mainly famous young actors to presumable draw in as big an audience demographic as possible. I admire him for this, and he, for the most part, blends the ages well and draws good performances out of all but one notable cast member (more of that later) The story triggers off with a young guy called Gatsby (!)(Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) we meet on campus who's girlfriend Ashleigh (Elle Fanning) works on the college arts magazine and is given the opportunity to interview a famous film director (!) but she will have to travel to New York City to do so. Gatsby decides to accompany her. The plot then involves him being unable to avoid his family who live in NY, the girlfriend being swept up into a chase and other shenanigan's when the film-maker has an artistic crisis and his producer's attempts to prevent him from hitting the bottle and perhaps carrying through his threat to not allow his new film to be released (!), and various other revelations, near infidelities, and hidden talents. This is all handled adroitly by someone who has written and directed 50 films and thus the coincidences galore and the almost ludicrous range of skills Gatsby possesses, we accept as a part of the fun, ...almost. The real treat in this film, however, is the performance of Selina Gomez (someone even I know is a young singer/actress) who is sensational as a younger sister of someone who Gatsby once dated. They bump into each other and she then drifts in and out of the plot. It is a real shame she did not get more to do because when she is on screen the film just takes off. She not only knows how to act and to act comedy, but she knows how to act in a Woody Allen film. With her first appearance comes the rain, and we welcome it. In contrast Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has absolutely no idea how to do any of these things. He should be carrying this film and making a name for himself. Instead he is a rabbit in the headlights, frozen to stiffness by the challenge, and he never once brings his character to life. The opening long tracking shot of he and Fanning discussing the trip to NY is notable for the way Chalamet never reacts to anything she says but instead gives his next line as if he is talking to us, or, more probably, himself. There is a moment a little later where he meets a college pal who is busy shooting a scene for a short film project. This pal suggests he take a small role in the next scene to be filmed. Chalamet declares But I'm not an actor. Normally when this occurs in a film we, as the audience, note the dramatic irony of such a line. Sadly, though, in this instance there is no irony because he is not an actor, at least not in this film. He was so bad that I, on the one hand, felt sorry for him, but also I kind of suspected that Woody deliberately put in that line to expose the fact that he had soon realised that his hot young star was not capable of making this film as good as it could, and probably should have been. I recommend this film. Ignore the silly stuff that surrounds Woody and sit back and enjoy the fun. Do not expect a masterpiece, or great profound art, although he manages to slip in here and there a few quotes on life: The one that jumped out at me was 'Reality is for those who don't look for anything better'."}, {"id": 206, "text": "I love Woody Allen and have enjoyed many of his films (some of my top favourites include Love and Death, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Blue Jasmine, Match Point, Midnight in Paris...). This one, however, was a big disappointment. The cinematography is still stunning as always, but the acting is so bad. Any fan of Woody Allen would be able to tell that the main character in this film is supposed to be a typical Woody Allen in his old films: an anxious, pretentious, whiny little man who adores beautiful women. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet didn't deliver any of that. I enjoyed his acting as an addict in Beautiful Boy, but in this film he fell flat on the floor. I guess either it was a miscast or Timoth\u00e9e didn't do enough study on his character as well as on Woody Allen's films, because normally he shouldn't be that bad. The acting of the two girls, Elle Fanning and Selena Gomez, was just horrid. Selena's acting made me roll my eyes to the back of my head (who the hell came up with the idea of casting Selena Gomez in a Woody Allen film ???????) and Elle's literally made me fall asleep. In short, although the film is not very long (only 1.5hrs), it felt like forever and I fell asleep before it even got near to the end."}, {"id": 207, "text": "Same old same old W.A. movie, just changed another group of younger actors, making it at least watchable. But Elle Fanning overacted like a bimbo, her acting never improved so far, facial expressions changed like a pre-programmed robot, non-stop. Selena Gomez was even worse, just delivered her dialog without any feeling at all. Meaty face was the opposite of Elle Fanning, no expression at all, just a masked woody face with fat and dead muscles, acted like a piece of log, no nothing. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was not bad, but he just tried too hard to look like W.A. in a younger version. Playing piano and suddenly started singing in somebody's New York luxurious apartment? To show off? Trying to impress the female that the wooden Selena Gomez played? That just looked weird and unnatural, man.The non-stop dialog was typical of W.A.'s formula, using dialog to push the whole movie forward. W.A. never learned how to make the actors to act normally, only asked them to blah, blah, and blah non-stop to develop the storyline. The actors in his movies were all like staging furniture, put in different properties trying to make the house-for-sale look better than a vacant one, the only difference is these furniture could talk non-stop but without any feeling or emotion. What we saw Elle Fanning did in this movie was even worse, she used her dialog to control her facial expressions, since the dialog was non-stop, so her expressions got to be synchronized with the dialog, overly exercised but without any true feeling at all.The bunch of the New York people acted in this movie didn't look like the realistic NewYorkers, but a bunch of W.A.'s outdated bunch, woody, lame, self-indulging, phony, yammering non-stop, their mouths control their behaviors and thoughts, self-claimed New York residents but all lived in a bubble, estranged to the real New York, walking around in the streets, parks, fancy apartments....but they never really paid any attention to anything but themselves. All of the characters in W.A.'s movies are all alike, talking non-stop, jabbering, yammering, blabbering, blah, blah, and blah uncontrollably. All of them in his movies were self-centered only paying attention to themselves, their mouths kept churning out the non-stop dialog to represent their feelings and thoughts. But this time, at least Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, a skinny young man with a more watchable handsome face, a young man with acceptable outlook, things around him or he himself might have encountered, would at least have happened to him and him alone, unlike what W.A. played by himself in his own production and his own directing, an extremely plain non-describable weirdo with thick lens on his nose bridge, receding hairs, stoop, fragile body and limbs....he forced himself to be a Romeo, an unique stand out outstanding attractive to women larger-than-life stud....but actually, men like his kind were doomed to be a loner, no social life, no woman would ever fall for him, fat chance. Yet in his old movies, he was the center of the universe, all things related to him and happened around him. But I have to say, guys he played in his movies, NOTHING would be possibly happen to those characters, not even one living sole would have paid attention to his existence. Guys like he played, things that would be possibly happened to those roles were because he's the producer, the screenplays writer, the director and he made himself as the leading male Alpha. That's why every time when I watched his movie, I always couldn't control myself to jump out of my seat and questioned myself: A guy like him played in this movie would have a woman crazily loved him? A guy like this guy in the film would have a romance?! It'd make Jesus cry on his Cross!But truth be told, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in this movie played a role that didn't make me jump out of seat, no matter what is the matter, good or bad, happened to him that was absolutely possible without question."}, {"id": 208, "text": "My 10th Woody Allen film and now my favourite - I found the whole thing oddly hypnotic.It gave me a few chuckles, and I just found myself really engrossed in the adventures of Gatsby (Timothee Chalamet) and Ashleigh (Elle Fanning).

The jokes are old-hat but they're funny even if we did hear them as far back as Manhattan and Woody can still muster a first-rate cast to deliver his old-hat gags. Chalamet is smart enough to take on the Allen role but imbue it with enough of his own personality to stand out while Ellie Fanning, (chanelling her inner Diane Keaton), and Selena Gomez are terrific as the two (young) women in Allen/Chalamet's life. In fact, Allen pops up quite a bit in this film; Jude Law's screenwriter is Allen, Griffin Newman's student filmmaker is Allen and, of course, Liev Schreiber's director is Allen. Oh wait, isn't he Allen's version of Bergman or, at least, Bergman if he were a character in a Woody Allen picture.Of course, no-one will ever claim A Rainy Day in New York as first-rate Allen and while it's funny it's never as funny as those early funny ones but it does look gorgeous, (once again Storaro shot it), the whole cast throw themselves into it shamelessly, (indeed, there was a time before Woody fell out of favour when Fanning might have got an Oscar for Supporting Actress), and Allen completists certainly won't want to miss it."}, {"id": 210, "text": "Woody Allen comes back once again with this pretty good film. As always, we're brought back to New York, and all the characters seem to try to be staying out of the rain. Could this be a nod to climate change?But the real takeaway in this movie, which I was impressed by, was Timothee Chalamet. I think he really shines here as a potential big time movie star, perhaps down the same lines as heartthrobs Pitt and DiCaprio. I've only seen one or two other performances, one of which he played a similar character. I would have to say all in all I really enjoyed watching him. He had a coolness about him. There was also a geekiness tied to him, which I have been worried about with the new young actors in the industry. He seemed to prove otherwise here, really outshine Elle Fanning. She put on weight, and didn't really look that attractive or appealing. Perhaps purposefully?The story is about two college students who are dating. They go to Manhattan so she could meet a director for an interview. During this time, the boy embarks on his own journey, assisting in a short film by a friend and also attending a party by his parents. The couple don't stay together in the end, and yet it's a happy ending all the same.I was really thoroughly impressed by this film. The last Woody Allen movie that got me was Irrational Man with Joaquin Phoenix. This movie is more sweet and simple minded. I do think that Timothee seems to be playing the upscale New Yorker all wrong. And Elle also plays the sweet innocent Arizonan all wrong too. They started off as actors playing a role, and by the end fit into their roles pretty well. Aside from that, everything else was sort of normal. I enjoyed the party scene at the end, and scenes with the boy walking in the rain around New York.The fact that I've given this film so much thought and a wordy review should signify the fact that I really thought highly of it.Great movie.

I like his script writing concepts and direction I hear in some of his movies the actors are encouraged to ad lib lines but I don't think the lines in this film are ad lib they're too clever.So I was keen to obtain a DVD copy to see what this one was like and I really enjoyed it. It's not a great film but it's a very entertaining sweet romance of course made more romantic by having New York ,one of my favourite cities in the world as its location. Woody Allen has often used New York and it's interesting that this is the very first full feature film directed by Woody Allen with the words New York featured in the title. However, Woody Allen has made a number of movies featuring suburbs of New York in the title. These are: 'Manhattan' (1979)Bullets Over Broadway' (1994), 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' and 'Broadway Danny Rose' (1983) - with Manhattan and Broadway being used twice in Woody Allen theatrical feature film titles.A film had of course must have more than a romantic setting it needs a good script and actors to provide the main course and I think there's some delicious moments in this movie.Timothee Chalamet as Gatsby Welles a privileged rich but naively sweet College student accompanies his current girl attractive friend Ashleigh played by Elle Fanning for a romantic weekend in The Big Apple while she is interviewed by film director Liev Schreiber ( Roland Pollard) . Their plans of a romantic weekend proceed to unravel when Ashleigh stands up Gatsby by having to prolong the interview to watch the Directors movie.Gatsby has to go solo for his New York adventure until they eventually do get back together but Gatsby Welles has changed and grown up emotionally especially after a visit to his mother's Gala event played beautifully by Cherry Jones where he realises his perception of his wealthy parents is so incorrect.The minor roles characters are just as interesting in the movie Gatsby meets Chan (Selena Gomez )the sister of an ex girl friend ,Ashleigh meets Ted Davidoff Jude Law in a nice cameo and she also has a possible #METoo encounter with charismatic director Francisco Vega (Diego Luna)Some of the actors in this film have donated their salaries to charities after the legal proceedings against Woody Allen took place including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet who announced on Instagram that he will be donating his entire salary from his work on this film to the charities: the LGBT Center in New York, Time's Up and RAINN, an anti-sexual violence organization. Rebecca Hall who plays Connie donated her full wage from this movie to the Time's Up movement after reconsidering sexual assault allegations against the director in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.It's a shame this film with its talented cast will probably slip in to obscurity because of the controversy but seeing a lot of profits going to worthy causes may save it.I must say regarding Timothee Chalamet's singing debut that his voice remind me of a Chet Baker the legendary jazz trumpeter and vocalist . If any studio or director wants to revisit The Chet Baker biography for filming ( its been done in 2015 with Egan Hake Born to be Blue but only dealt with his comeback you have the perfect man to star in it with Mr Chalamet. My favourite quotes from Woody Allen's script - Gatsby Welles: One thing about New York City. You are here or you are nowhere. You cannot achieve another level of anxiety, hostility or paranoia anywhere else Gatsby Welles: I need a carbon monoxide to survive. We are two different creatures, right? You like the sound of crickets and I like the rattle of the taxies. You blosom in the sun and me, I come into my own under grey skies.Ashleigh: -Oh my God, you're Francisco Vega! Francisco Vega: -Is that good or bad? Ashleigh: -My roommate thinks you're the best thing to come along since the morning-after pill.Gatsby Welles: I read. I just don't read what they give us in school. I mean, do I really care who wins between Beowulf and Grendel? No, I don't. Maybe if I had a little money on it.I hope it gets streamed by Netflix or Stan it certainly won't be on Amazon Prime meanwhile it's a nice edition to my DVD collection to watch again ."}, {"id": 212, "text": "I feel like this script was written 30 years ago, being as the film takes place in modern day times, it almost comes across as a fantasy considering that young people today don't talk or dress or act like the common Woody Allen character, male or female. But once the story kicks in, it does come across pretty nicely.You'll get the same ole love affair, love triangle, love rectangle, older man enamored by the younger girl story lines that we're so used to in Woody Allen movies but it feels self aware in this one and doesn't go through the usual tropes as previous films did, especially for Elle Fanning's storyline. It's something that is used to in the Hollywood world and it does stem away from that dark cloud.The performances are niche, Timothee does put on his best Alvy Singer/Gil Pender impression but you do feel for him for being undecided on life. Selena is sweet, and she makes the film more real and levels out the humor. Elle Fanning's character could be annoying to some but she is naive and extremely neurotic but it still puts on a delightful performance. Everyone else in the film does well. The music is very beautiful and if you love New York movies this will fit good in the category. If you're against this film for whatever reasons. That's okay.7/10"}, {"id": 213, "text": "If like me you adore Woody's work, then I'd wager you'll love this. I've seen Woody's recent films, but this for me really has his unmistakable fingerprint: witty repartee; romance; immaculately placed and selected songs from the incredible American songbook, all brought to life by the usual cast of flawed characters, bumbling through life. Chalamet does a stellar job embodying the quirky underdog Woody-character, whose alienation affords him a superior view on life, G*d-like, as though he's sitting on top of the world watching from afar. Although Selena Gomez' voice, sounds more worn than the actor who plays a hooker in the movie, she comes across as a child, delivering great lines with the acting chops of a breadboard, ruining any chance at even quasi-believable chemistry; even when she's playing a snotty brat, surprisingly she is still utterly implausible. Yet Woody has handled this well, with Fanning stealing the majority of screentime with her depiction of the all-American blonde. Her rank ambition renders her oblvious as to how annoying her character is, making you want to scream at her through the screen. Really great. As always, the visual splendour Woody portrays NY with confirms his love for the 'knockout city', making it feel even more NY than NY. This film is definitely one of Woody's more serious, albeit light-hearted character-based works, as opposed to the far-fetched plots he likes to have fun with. Not nearly as monumentally classic, but this film did leave me with the same wonderful feeling as watching greats like Annie Hall, Manhattan or Hannah and Her Sisters. For an hour and a half, I forgot the mundanity of life and right now, mid-plague, that's really saying something."}, {"id": 214, "text": "The photography is impeccable, I loved the soundtrack and the light and loose dialogues that explore American literature and philosophy with a beautiful touch of blues. Classic Allen. I don't think it was his best work, but I think I'll watch it again in a month or two ...I liked Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the protagonist, the role suits him well and he plays that melancholy side of New York. I never had an opinion about Elle Fanning, but I kind of like her now, even though I don't like her character, it was very vanilla for me.On the other hand, Selena's character was more of a cinnamon feeling, but I wished there was a little more of a punch, I liked the ending tho.To be honest, since we're talking about a Woody Allen film, I was expecting a little more than that, but I liked it in a way. I wonder if this will be his final work. Hope not.I wished they explored more the whole thing with Pollard and his creative crisis. At some part in the middle of the film i think all gets lost as when she is trying to find them and suddently Rollie shows up out of nowhere... I dont know...It should have been a little more well scriptedI know he is not a very good human, but he is one of my favorite directors and writers. His movies speaks right into my soul."}, {"id": 215, "text": "Started off a bit sloppy but turned out into a nice little movie. Typical Woody Allen, like an arch Woody Allen project, just the soft version. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was quite good channeling a young Woody Allen-esque character. Started off a bit sloppy too but in the end really delivered a nice performance, proving once again that he is one of the most talented and interesting actors of his generation. Chalamet combines both charmes and innocence to his portrayal of a grow up minded personality. Good work. Elle Fanning however was the weakest part. She really did have a fine character to work with but blew it with absolutely irritating overacting. She gave the impression she really did not get the part and neither played it funny, as is was intended to be nor in anyway convincing. I was positively surprised by Selena Gomez who actually turned into a very good performance herself. Jude Law had a nice supporting role and I wished he had given more screen time. Liev Schreiber was good too. Rebecca Hall had a fantastic cameo and so did Cherry Jones. The screenplay was good and the direction typical old fashioned Woody Allen. It is really not a masterpiece or anything to remember but it is a charming movie for a. rainy but comfy day on your couch... maybe in New York."}, {"id": 216, "text": "I loved the Woody Allen movies I have seen, even in their darker moments they flow with ease, a sense of airiness that perfectly transmits the moments of falling in love, which are numerous in the films he directed. Yet, in this one I felt that very ease was gone. It is an intriguing experience to watch this movie with the allegations against Woody Allen in the back of your head. Maybe a piece of art can be seperated from the creator, maybe it cannot, this is one of cinemas biggest questions since Me Too started rolling. Even if you try to seperate it and see the movie for what it is (the option I try to pick), with this movie it felt impossible. The character of Ashleigh is just so flat, it makes you quite uncomfortable. A naive puppet, put there to provide some laughter and prey for fellow men. This was quite bugging, as the relationship between Ashleigh and Gatsby could have been fantastic material for Allen to mould his dialogues out of (just their first encounter already explores the boundaries of their relationship - how well do they interact? How well do they share goals?). Love triangles, New York City, humor between the lines, this movie had all the ingredients but somehow managed to turn up the heat in some places while also undercooking the whole thing. In my experience, the good Woody Allen films worked excactly the other way around.Maybe Allen tried to deliberately violate everything that is expected in a post-Me Too-movie. That could have been a great move to make you question these unwritten laws of character definition. But it just felt like you are watching a very dumb girl being abused without noticing it. Plus, the two main characters and their love for 'old stuff' was quite unbelievable.At the local cinema it was advertised as the best Woody Allen flick in decades and boy, I think, they just fooled me into buing a ticket."}, {"id": 217, "text": "Gatsby Welles (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) attends an upstate New York college but he's more interested in winning his poker games. He has distaste for his family's upper class world but not enough to refuse their money. He takes his girlfriend Ashleigh Enright (Elle Fanning) to New York City to interview filmmaker Roland Pollard (Liev Schreiber) for her college newspaper. They go their separate ways. She attracts the attention of Roland, Ted Davidoff (Jude Law), and movie star Francisco Vega (Diego Luna). Meanwhile, Gatsby encounters Chan Tyrell (Selena Gomez), the younger sister of a former flame. There is intermittent rain over their days in the city.Woody Allen is doing the structure of a rom-com in his own way. The main thing is that I don't care much about Gatsby. It's not until his conversation with his mother that his character develops some depth. That's not to say that the conversation isn't awkwardly unreal. There are quite a few awkwardly unreal conversations. The first one starts with Ben Warheit. He's obviously a troll and I can see what Woody is doing. I just don't believe that Gatsby would helplessly stand in front of him to continue the conversation. Sure he got the Chan information but he should leave as soon as that's done. He's not doing it to be polite so the only reason is that Woody wants to do a funny. Now, Selena Gomez is probably too old to play that part. The point is that she is younger than Gatsby. She was a little girl the last time he dated her sister. Quite frankly, Elle Fanning may be better for that role and switching the two actresses would be useful. As for Elle, she is trying for some broader comedy. She's a very winning actress but the drunk acting may be too much to ask for. I laughed but I'm not sure if it's for her and at her. It's awkward to do that broad physical comedy when the older men are on the prowl. Overall, the characters grew on me and it's a minor later Woody for me."}, {"id": 218, "text": "Since everyone else is writing their reviews based on their opinion of Woody Allen, I'd like to clarify that this is my second time to watch a movie directed by him. just like the other movie I watched, I didn't like the plot of this movie as well.the movie is pleasing to the eyes, the rainy new york-which i hope one day i could visit- but that doesn't make a good movie. the movie was supposed to be a ''comedy'', but i didn't catch myself laughing which meant either i missed all the jokes or there were no good jokes.Elle Fanning's acting was horrible in this movie i recall skipping almost all of her scenes because i couldn't stand the way she acted or talked. I didn't like most of the acting, but still giving this a 4/10 for timothee.overall, it is a good movie to waste time watching; however, there are many better movies out there if you want to waste some time watching a movie."}, {"id": 219, "text": "A Rainy Day In New York (2019 release; 92 min.) brings the story of Gatsby and Ashleigh, two students at Yardley University in upstate New York. As the film opens, Gatsby's voice-over tells us about his girlfriend Ashleigh. We meet Ashleigh and she informs Gatsby that she has secured an interview with a famed movie director, which requires her to go to New York City. Gatsby decides that they'll make it into a romantic weekend getaway. Upon arriving in New York City, things go very differently than expected... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the umpteenth movie from writer-director Woody Allen. Apart of the quality of the movie itself (more on that later), the movie comes with a lot of baggage. This was filmed in 2017, yes, three years ago, and was part of his deal with Amazon Studios. With the #MeToo movement in full blaze and new rumors against Woody Allen, Amazon refused to release the film, and a number of the movie's stars, including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Selena Gomez, disavowed the project and donated their salaries to good causes. Amazon and Woody Allen eventually reached a settlement and the movie finally saw the day of light in Europe in June, 2019, yes 16 months ago. It was released in select US movie theaters this weekend. As to the film itself, it tries to portray itself as just another Woody Allen film, with the same credits, the same music, and the same overall feeling of so many of Woody Allen's films, except of course that this isn't the same world anymore, and it all just feels very quaint and out of date. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Woody Allen's alter-ego tries to make the best of it, but even he cannot salvage the fact that the script is devoid of fresh ideas. We've seen it all before in so many other Woody Allen films, there is literally not a single new twist in any of this. Bottom line: this is a film that is being released beyond its expiration date.As mentioned, A Rainy Day In New York opened this weekend in select theaters including at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so: 6 people in total including myself. If like myself you are a life-long Woody Allen fan, you are likely tempted to check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and I would certainly suggest you do so, but come with low expectations, and then draw your own conclusion."}, {"id": 220, "text": "The opening scene felt clumsy, and not in a good Allen-kinda-way, There were scenes where the dialogue flowed as a catchy, upbeat tune, and other times it felt a little too contrived and unnatural, throwing me out of Allen's melancholy world, making me remember this is not how it goes in real life.Storaro, master cinematographer, shot this film wonderfully, but in my opinion there were two times that his lighting choices were distracting.Other than those points of critique, I loved the film. I love the atmosphere Allen creates. I love the leading actors; Chalamet, Fanning and Gomez do very well in this film, Chalamet being a perfect young Allen (with the extra benefit of a velvet voice, enchanting piano playing, and less neurotic demeanor, although of course, the neuroticism is still there).The word I used earlier, clumsy, is perhaps a good way to describe the film. It is difficult for the director to maintain the universe he creates in every action and every piece of dialogue in a way that keeps the viewer engaged in the characters and the story all the time and makes them forget they are watching a farce from beginning to end credits. When it works, it's magic, it's proper good jazz, but you have to accept that there are false notes. Anyway, in my opinion, it's flaws shouldn't hold you back from enjoying this film This movie is worth the watch just for some of the Allen one liners that are sprinkled throughout the film."}, {"id": 221, "text": "I wish Woody Allen's banned movie A RAINY DAY IN NEW YORK was worth trumpeting as a film to be sought out like some forbidden fruit. Alas, it's yet another of Woody's not bad, yet not quite good mediocrities that have littered his filmography for the last couple of decades. Here we have Timothy Chalomet as a college student in upstate New York who travels to his native Manhattan ostensibly to squire his pretty coed girlfriend (Elle Fanning) around town while she is on assignment from the college newspaper to interview a famed arthouse film Director (Liev Schreiber). Along the way, they become separated. Chalomet ends up meeting up with the younger sis of his old girlfriend (Selena Gomez) and his mom (Cherry Jones). Fanning not only interviews the Director, but, has tete a tetes with his screenwriter (Jude Law) and a hot to trot actor (Diego Luna). And, it rains. RAINY DAY is another of Woody's screenplays that seems lost in time. Take out the cellphones, and the movie could just as well have been set in the 1970s. The movie opens with Chalomet's character's narration that forces the young actor to come off like a parody of Allen's early mensch persona - he loves Jazz, literature (he's even named Gatsby!) and, of course, all thing old NYC. The female characters are all ditzes, call girls or wanting babes in short skirts who pant for older more 'learned' men. Allen confronts his peccadillos head on. Here you have not one, not two, not three, but FOUR 'wise' men who are after the young blonde girl. Three of the four could easily be interpreted as stand-ins for Woody himself (the exception, I suppose, is Luna). A babe so innocent looking that she has to, literally (!), whip out her ID card to prove that she's 21. Fanning does her best, but, despite protestations that she's really smart - she comes off like a bubble-head. On one hand, I guess you have to give Allen credit for not giving in to the #MeToo movement and continue to explore his obsessions on screen. Unfortunately, he has nothing new or interesting to say. It's just another Woody Allen movie. And, that's the real irony here. Amazon got cold feet and have done their best to bury the picture. Truth is, the 'controversy' is the most interesting thing about it. If it had been released in the normal fashion, it would have disappeared quickly in the ether -- just like most other Woody Allen films these days."}, {"id": 222, "text": " Plans Film : A Rainy Day In New York Director - Writer : Woody Allen Dop : Vittorio Storaro Cast : tchalamet selenagomez ellefanningThe Charming writing style of woody Allen is always romantic.
