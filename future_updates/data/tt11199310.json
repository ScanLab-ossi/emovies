That this is absolute bullpoop is already explained in other reviews! Can someone explain which visa category in USA lets you take your entire family with u as soon as you get a job in US? That too the way they move is with the entire baggage (Visitor visa allows only 6 month stay per visit).. they literally live in a bungalow in San Francisco as soon as they move.. and in the real world scientists leonard and sheldon live in pasadena(less expensive than SFO) and share an apartment! One scene i have rewatched about 10 times is in the tea meeting where a man says ' Naa peru Krishnamurthy.. nenu putti perigindi ikkade kabatti... blah blah blah! ' baaboo, were u really born in US? A man who is born and brought up in US and is aged about 50+ speaks nothing like how honourable Mr.Krishnamurthy spoke. Homework and detailing might be something we shouldn't expect from a movie like this!"}, {"id": 1, "text": "I watched this movie in 1.5x speed still the screenplay was very slow and dragged like serial and totally predictable and the way protagonist was portrayed felt like it was a Cakewalk with little efforts to establish a company that too in USA and conflicts with the antagonist is silly...and this movie cannot be an inspiration for people pursuing MBA... misleading totally"}, {"id": 2, "text": "This movie is everything that's wrong with Tollywood! I don't even know where to begin with this movie. The movie started out really good, focusing on the Indian cultural values and middle class family attitude. This review is going to be long, let me please vent out: 1. I thought this movie was about the Miss India pageant (never watched the trailer!). But the movie is as much about Miss India as Missamma would be about James Bond. 2. Why's Brooklyn Bridge on the screen with the tag San Francisco!!! I am sure the entire movie has been shot in some European country, with European extras. Film makers, do your homework. Indians live in USA will find this movie so irrelevant and hilarious! How dare you try to show off Dubrovnik/Croatia as San Francisco in USA? You guys know that Indian people are actually moving and growing across the globe, discovering new places? 3. When are Tollywood directors gonna understand how are corporate board meetings conducted? During team discussions, no misogynistic idiot tries to show off his ego, specially in board meetings to Dumb AF puppet board members who don't even look like they belong there! 4. Apple should get some profits (if any) for this movie, as Siri did most of the dubbing. Telugu to English voice conversions for firang women and men talking in the movie are HILARIOUS! (This is the only comedy you're going to get in this movie). 5. I'd like to know what's that visa on which the ENTIRE family relocated to USA? I wonder if anyone's noticed that neither the home nor it's interiors look like they're in USA! 6. Even i would have sold chai/panipuri/Mirchibajjis on roadside tapri (cart) if it wasn't for food licenses costing $$$$$ here in USA. 7. I am gonna say this: due to the lack of proper talent, we are forced to tolerate the mediocre and flat performances of actors like Anushka, Samantha, Keerthy Suresh etc. Man, why are they so overrated! And what's with Keerthy Suresh's voice? Blehhh! 8. Family not letting daughters pursue their passion, I don't know what timeline do these characters live in. It's 2020 for God's sake and women are doing whatever they like in their careers. Grow up guys! We had movies like English Vinglish which portrays women entrepreneurs in such an inspiring way! 9. The entire punch dialogues in the movie have been ripped off from Facebook shares and whatsapp forwards. If you don't build your dreams, someone else will hire you build theirs Like, come on! 10. Although the intentions of the filmmakers may have been noble in showing StreeShakti (power of women), Jagapathi babu's character is so cringey at some moments. Unfortunately, the bad shown in movies has more profound affect on audience than the good. Please Tollywood. I am done with bleak storylines and bland screenplays. If our TFI can give movies like Nani's Gang Leader, then we can definitely do better than films like Miss India!"}, {"id": 3, "text": "While watching this movie I am confused whether it's a movie or a tv serial...short film directors should know the difference between a short film and a feature film...people who say this serial is good just ignore them as they don't know how to watch a movie..don't know when these type of movies stop coming..all of my friends are laughing at the movie...may be the Director's friend should show and tell him the truth instead of covering it up...better it's released in OTT...if this was released in theaters then max one day..."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Why you should skip this: 1.

Protaginst gives a big speech about how women are capable of running the world, and the next scene starts making telemarketing calls. 4. Not sure is it me, but Kirti Suresh's dubbed voice sounds like low budget Samantha's voice. 5. She literally sets up a tea-stall in an open park implying no licenses were procured but complains when her stuff is confiscated.

Maybe this film with any of the male superstars would have worked with a wafer-thin storyline. I would cringe then too! The initial few minutes of the film have too much happening. It's rushed and gives you no time to connect with the feelings of the protagonist. Logical gaps in the film will kill half of your brain cells. The makers need to understand the concept of women empowerment and the challenges faced by women when they venture into a man's world. Copying old superstar dialogues and giving it to a female lead sound cringe-worthy even to a staunch feminist like me! The film lacks sense in so many levels. The unwanted explanations (Keerthi explaining SWOT analysis to MBA graduates \ud83d\ude44) The unwanted hair flicking, a catwalk with heels and blaring bgm. Not once, not twice but just too many times. Unwanted flashy dress shows, brand placement? How on the earth do a newly migrating family find a villa, they were in debt, right? The Chai business has reached half of America in two months! Americans haven't heard about tea before Manasa Samyukhta! Google voice speech for American characters \ud83e\udd22 Telugu everywhere in the USA A big brand which has years of market standing falls because of a small allegation \ud83e\udd23 Unwanted objectification of women Cringe dialogues like 'girls are precious' every 5 minutes with a sloppy background score! I'm a girl, but I can't stand this fake idea to cash this genre. Keerthi looks like she will faint any moment, she possibly understood she has walked into trouble! This doesn't deserve even one star. One star for collecting KSK tickets, that was a good one \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4c"}, {"id": 8, "text": "Please don't waste your time on this one.Please don't waste your time on this one.Please don't waste your time on this one.Please don't waste your time on this one."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I don't know what to write in this review, coz there's nothing in this movie.

Too many mass dialogues and unrealistic turn of events. I had hopes with the way the movie started but that was it. Rest is a disaster. Cringed at parts where bots were used to dubb for foreigners. Other cringe worthy moments: Wannabe businesses woman, MBA rank holder, doesn't recognize coffee businesses tycoon who appears on cover pages of magazine, and that too when she goes to meet him with a business proposal? She gets offended by every other person's advice, even on facts/reality checks? Arrogant much? Not a good message. Leaves a friend and investor alone on dinner without common courtesy, he still continues to be a well-wisher and then dissappears coz madam's pride got hurt. Arrives late and strikes a pose on board meetings. And of course guess who wins lucky draw organized by competitor KSK, yup our leading lady herself. She just happened to have the bill with her right away even if many KSK customers had exchanged their bills for free chai at her place. \ud83d\ude44And what stock worth 40L does she send to BMC? TEA LEAF? did she own a plant/factory? At the end begging for money on media, for someone with so much pride, was confusing. Not collecting details of those who give money? How do they become shareholders? Really would like to know what visa was she holding in the US?IF the message was women empowerment, message not received.According to the movie Americans haven't discovered chai yet. What if someone gets inspired and starts chai shop there. I worry for the future of starbucks, since in the movie KSK gets bankrupt when Americans start drinking chai which broke the business tycoon enough to make him walk around the US in dothi\ud83e\udd23 hilarious..

The start of the movie was ok compared to how terrible it gets later. The part which makes ZERO sense is when the whole family moves to USA when one person gets job. Seriously ?? Is it that easy for an entire family to move to USA? They take huge bungalow to live in SFO which actually looks like an Indian home.Do you know how expensive it is to even live in a single bedroom apartment in SFO ? After settling, the heroine is shown to be doing MBA with the intention of starting a business later. Her brother and mother strictly tell her that she cannot do business which makes her leave home. There is no info provided on where she lives and how she fends for herself without doing a job. Later she is shown to host a tea party to which foreigners are also invited and she speaks in Telugu. It's depicted as if tea is a completely new thing to Americans when in fact it was introduced to Americans in 1650. (Anyway, let's put brains aside) She then starts the tea business with the help of an investor, and opens one tea cafe. Suddenly she is shown to be doing so well with the tea business that the rival KSK introduces nonsensical schemes to lure customers to his coffee. The heroine then encounters certain hurdles because of rival KSK and is in the verge of losing her tea business. She then shows public/news reporters how KSK and her friend conspired against her and asks help from people. In the end, she gets lots of money from people to get going with her tea business.Although the concept of a woman starting a business and making it big in a foreign land is enticing, it's not executed properly. Director should have done research on many things like visa, business, America and tea before making the movie and could have made it realistic for people especially women to get inspired. Keerthy Suresh's acting is dull and unconvincing. Jagapathi Babu seemed like a funny villian. His character could have been better.It's good that Telugu film industry is coming up with different kinds of movies which are not routine love stories. But please execute better."}, {"id": 28, "text": "One thing very funny to me was, there are some scenes where white people talk to Keerthi suresh, and the voice is the exact same automated voice that we hear on Apple Computers, when we select any text, right click and ask to Speak !

To be fair, one of the few aspects that count in the film is photography, which is really well done. As for the other ones, the film is a catastrophic. A script that borders on imbecility: shallow, empty, poor, with caricatured and cheesy characters, who every 5 minutes want to display virtue signaling and teach each other moral lessons. Ridiculous!

She's a decent actor but all the movies she's been getting lately are horrible and are trying to stereotype her into a particular sanskari girl. It's time she broke the spell and change the dubbing artiste ASAP - her voice in the movie is absolutely dull and boring. Even a slightly bubbly-chirpy character on her would have made this movie a bit bearable. Powerful women don't always have to portrayed as reserved and subdued.And my sincere request to tollywood directors- PLEASE DO NOT shoot abroad if you don't have first hand experience of living in western countries. A lot of people already pointed out the weird visa conditions entire family moved on, their million dollar house after moving to states- the house doesn't even look like it's in USA.

This list might even make the movie a tad bit more watchable (because you'll be looking out for these dialogues ;) ) :1. You are the founder, owner, and sole proprietor of your life. I liked this one, to me it meant that your life is yours to build, some aspects beyond your control contribute towards it, but it is still something you shape. It sort of gives back a sense of ownership and agency of our lives. Having faced a fair share of troubles of my own and seen the lives of youth with no agency over their own lives, I found it to be an empowering statement. 2. If you don't build your dreams, someone will hire you to build their dreams. If you don't work hard to fulfill your dreams, you will be working hard for someone else's dreams. True. 3. In buisness half of our strength goes in warding off the 'dangers' lurking around it. Being a businesswoman (albeit small) myself in a highly competitive industry, I'd say this is quite aptly true, once a business starts to take off or when it starts to settle at cruising speed. That's when competitors/landlords/Investors/even employees or even just jealous friends can become those 'dangers'. 4. Struggle is not an item that you can purchase from a store and own it. Come to think of it, in the context, it was a deep statement. Once you become successful in business, after a great deal of struggle, there sure are people who want to buy your life's work over - to either crush the competition you created or to take advantage of it. It is of course a businessperson's choice when such offers arrive. But in the context of the storyline, her passion, his motives etc. it was well said. 5. Greatness is a quality that is not gained through fame/recognition or lost because of being unacknowledged True. So true. 6. I never dreamt of success, I worked for it. Well many successful people in this world would say, I never dreamed I'd make it this far. None of us know beforehand wether we will be successful or how successful we will be. One really has to work one's best for it. 7. Good happy memories with someone we love also give us pain when the person leaves us.  true. But this is life. We cannot be sad forever, we must not let opportunities at hand pass us by. Feel like harsh words, but definitely wise and true. 8. You are using your pain as an excuse to stop yourself from enjoying the beauty and happiness around you. ... if you give it a chance you'll see it. Harsh, blunt, but again it's something that we humans tend to do when going through a sad period and these are words that we probably really do need to hear when we can't let go of our sadness. 9. Giving for the sake of giving - Charity. Sharing because we have enough - humanity. Well put I think. Sounds apt, right? 10. Good grades are no use of you don't have a goal in life. Gosh I have seen so many examples of toppers doing nothing with their lives and backbenchers making it big. This is an important life lesson, and goals need to be cultivated all along. After all we actually get to study so many subjects not to get marks but to figure the world out and find our place in it, so why don't we :) 11. Nothing matters if you are not happy. Now this is a dreamy dialogue. Sometimes I wonder why it is so hard for so many people to be happy. But it is true. No matter how hard one works, if one is not happy, nothing matters. If you are happy, you love working hard too, and truly enjoy the benefits. Even when I lost my business, was broke, was under a mountain of debt, was living at Rs.40 a day, and completely alone, I was still somehow happy, not stressed. I got in that situation even after working hard but I had been doing what made me happy. Life took an unexpectedly bad turn, but somehow I knew I'd find a way. Even slogging was fun! Well - funny, this life. 12. We are not meant to fear God, our professors, our society...we should fear the thought that we will never realize the hero within us. ... Life is an opportunity, just take it I thought it applies well to those of us who feel compelled by a dream, a goal. That really strong gut feeling about something we just have to do in life ... Of course that's just my personal opinion. 13. The dialogue about a woman gives back double of whatever you give her - give her grocery she gives back a sumptuous loving meal (well mostly;)), give her a house she creates a home, give her happiness she gives you her love, give her true love she gives you a new life, and you give her trouble she'll give you double trouble. Well, might sound quirky / cheesy at first. But I would say it resonates, at least from what I know of myself and other women - the entire dialogue btw, not just the trouble part mind you :D. Most people don't even realize how true the happiness and love and new life parts are though. But hey, of course not all girls are the same. Though most girls just get more of grocery and trouble and not much unconditional happiness or true love from a man. They say women are mysterious because they don't even know what would make her happy. Again - the dialogue is kinda true, but that's just my worldview. BONUS- this one is not an overt dialog in the movie per se. The whole movie was a long drawn dialog about sexism faced by a woman doing/wanting to build a business. Connecting with the earlier point, it's just like the brother, the first male friend she makes in America, and the first investor - all of them probably WANTED to make / see her happy, but didn't have the first clue what would make HER truly happy. They were all focused on themselves, selfish and eventually impatient - though each had their own threshold level. The main protagonist was of course the worst, he probably gave 1000 dollars as investing in his own entertainment of seeing this 'hot' woman fail miserably. But hey, she got and utilised every opportunity she got. Some men I know would say she got them only because she was a woman. Well, yes. But one has no idea how horrible it is for a woman, especially one breaking into a male dominated industry, being seen at evey step as not much beyond either as entertainment or as someone to eventually have sex with or as someone who'd eventually become a wife. When all she might want is to do business like anyone else.The sexism shown actually happens.Well. The movie was definitely bad, outlandish, etc .. everyone has pointed that and more out. Oh the text to speech dialogues really left me aghast! They shouldn't ruin Indian film industry image like that lol. But as a business owner, the sexism at every step, the lonely path, the double determination, the double crossing for-sale partner, and the force of passion - were all subtle relatable aspects.Rated 6 just for the dialogues of wisdom sprinkled all across the script, and which I appreciated as individual thoughts. Never have I ever come across so many of them in one script !Watch it maybe to laugh at the ridiculous dialog delivery or glaring plot holes. But if you do, kudos to those who find out when dialog number 6 comes in the movie!"}, {"id": 107, "text": "A nice movie about women empowerment!

The family is shown struggling to make ends meet in India and as soon as they land in SFO they are shown to be staying in a multi-million dollar house! and these are just for the starters, too many bloopers all the way. Every time the lead actress gets a little makeover they show her entry in slow motion, I mean why. Moreover they show the antagonist entry (KSK) several times as well, like really. The movie undermines the relevance of a deadly disease like Alzheimer's and shows it just as fillers and to add humor, that's super disgusting. Too much preaching about women power and their sacrifices. Corporate Job Interview: Interviewer: Why should we hire you? Interviewee: Because I am a female and females are superior and can bear the pain of child birth. This is the level of crap you are signing up for when you decide to watch it.

So will go with 3 stars."}, {"id": 111, "text": "I think you guys are familiar with Sujeeth Sign, the director of the much hyped film Saahoo. Right into his second film he was given access to a huge budget and a star cast. End result? The film ended up as the biggest disaster in Tollywood history (in terms of the hype). The Director and the Writer of Miss India, who are thick friends by the way, are no less than Sujeeth Sign. Only difference is Sujeeth has had a wonderful run as a short film director and his first movie, Run Raja Run was a box office hit. But these thick friends neither had a good short film run nor a first movie success nor anything that they can call it an achievement in the field of cinema except the achievement of making the entire cast and crew of Miss India agree to their mindless, unrealistic, over the board script. I was shell shocked as to how on earth this cast could have accepted such script in the first place. Were they given sleeping pills?I ve known the thick friends personally for a very long time. I was infact very much surprised but all the same apprehensive about this film when I first came to know about it. Looking at the stellar cast, I though they have something solid and a good script in their hand. Given the 3rd grade short films they have made in the past, I was pretty sure that this was going to end up as a disaster but nevertheless the cast made me have other options as well. But they proved me right.As I said, i ve known then personally for a long time. These thick friends are very very very peculiar in character. Their whole body, right from head to toes, is covered in a thick shell if EGO. And they gracefully accept this fact and they are proud about it. They think they have the world's best wisdom (you can observe that in the movie's dialogues). They think that they have understood the life more than anyone else (again from the movie's dialogues). They always used to say working under someone as a assistant director or associate director is a laughable thing according to them. They think that job is for losers. They just wanted to, always, directly become a director and ofcourse have a great cast in your very 1st movie itself so that you will be catapulted to fame right away.I am sorry thick friends it doesn't work that way. You need to first learn the basics, learn good amount of work from experienced people, have a good script at hand, have some common sense, have some respect towards others and break that ego shell. Now you have created an image for yourself so bad that it will take years for you to get another movie and even if you get one the result will be same as this one.These so called short film directors, not all of them, think putting low class videos on youtube make them Hitchcock, Tarantino, Mani Ratnam etc etc. On the other hand there are teams like chai bisket, who had to work and wait for years before making a feature film like Color Photo which with no big cast, no big budget, made it big. On the other hand we have these low class inexperienced directors and writers who waste these great 1st time opportunities.So my suggestion is, go back... learn stuff, be humble and comeback.Remember one thing Known is drop, unknown is oceanPS : some of these thick friends shortfilms on YouTube 1.

My mind is completely boggled after watching this steamy pile of cow dung. I don't even know what I saw, but it was so bad. Keerthy Suresh's acting is completely mind numbing and irritating in this film. Working with an illogical plot set in America, the proceedings go on and on, so conveniently for our Miss, Manasa Samyuktha (forgot that name, even), that is so boring and headache inducing that you will keep wondering How come so much money was poured in to this story-less story? Everything looks so beautiful, but nothing makes sense. The producer must've been very fooled by the complete nonsense script. The scenes are over-melodramatic, with endless philosophical speeches that go on and on, and with, bloody, background music that keeps playing every second. Headache stuff. Keerthy's drowsy and sleepy performance made me feel completely distant with her character, although I deeply admired her beauty. The production values look high, and the locations too, but how can one still feel so much of headache all at once? The lack of a meaningful story. Without a story to tell, there is no purpose for any extravagant show off. Story is the essence of true art. Here, the story is illogical.Ha!

I went to IMDB and saw that the movie had a very low overall rating. So there's a good chance that the average movie goer will not like the movie - especially if they read the negative reviews. A lot of reviews with the lowest ratings gave no details, but just gave their opinion that it was terrblie. Other low ratingss picked on the details of getting visas and houses. First, this totally misses the point of this or most any movie except for a slice-of-life or historical autobiography. In addition, through not fault of those reviewers, while their nitpicking would be accurate for most situations, the story took care of this by making the brother not just a robotics engineer, but one who was thinking originally and on target as he had greatly impressed his professor who passed along that assessment to his contacts in the US. To confirm my knowledge of this special situation, I asked my friend who owns a robotics company and who recruits robotics graduates from all over the world including India and the film's depiction is accurate in this very special and very important niche in the US and he gets full cooperation from the government including Immigration. Of course, such reviewers have no way of knowing this. A similar complaint was that Samyukta's rise to a successful business owner was unrealistically easy. And, again in general, that's true, but the reviewers missed the forest by focusing on one tree and, in addition, this issue was beautifully and insightfully handled by the story. Possibly, the best way to tell if you will or will not like this film is to read the review entitled 13 most interesting dialogues (Rating the movie as a 6). If those dialogues resonate with you, then give the movie a try, if not, then skip it."}], "reviews_amount": 114}
