It is genuinely no deeper then that.It does have a certain charm, and nice message, that Christmas is about family, not decorations.I watch too much Family Guy, so when I blink or look away, I swear Meg's in the movie. Christine Baranski was the star of the show for me, great timing. 7/10"}, {"id": 1, "text": "I don't get the 1 star reviews. What exactly did you think you were going see?

If you just take it for what it is, it's worth a couple of cheap laughs. If you're going to pick it apart, avoid it. Good one for quite night in or an easy watch with friends."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Ok, I don't understand why people are giving this movie so many bad reviews. If they saw the first one then they should know what to expect. If you don't like these types of movies, don't watch. It's a simple as that. Was it a realistic version of what happens during Christmas, no but it's a freaking movie. I'd definitely watch it again. I actually thought it was funnier than the first one. Forget all the bad reviews and give it a chance !"}, {"id": 5, "text": "... Oh, because it isn't there!People are rating this a 1 when the Sharknado series exists? I'm putting the bah-humbug reviews down to holiday depression and humorlessness compliments of stressful family dynamics. C'mon, people, cheer up.

If anything, it underscores how much pressure we put women under on holidays and how brilliantly they handle it compared to how men would."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I couldn't help myself I laughed all the way through this movie, even though it was really bad.

It's cool though fun for a free movie on Showtime! I really like the cast and how colorful the set designs are. There's some scenes with pure stupidity that's for sure but still pretty funny and I think the amount of foul language is a great delight! The wildly destructive parts are great, and Kathryn Hahn, Mila Kunis, and Kristen Bell are fun to watch being fools!"}, {"id": 10, "text": "This movie consists of a boring story line with an unnecessary Christmas theme. While some of the actors gave me hope of this movie being watchable, you will only feel dread as it drags on and on without any memorable scenes and a bronze lining of generic nonsensical comedy. Nothing but a seasonal money grab, huge waste of time."}, {"id": 11, "text": "This movie was trashy with mediocre writing... Yet I have no regrets watching it. I loved watching the cast engage in stupid debauchery. I laughed. I shed a tear. I got warm fuzzies. All in all it was a good time. It was more fun than your standard Hallmark Christmas movie."}, {"id": 12, "text": "A Bad Moms Christmas (2017)  This is a Christmas comedy film. A sequel to the 2016 film Bad Moms, it follows the three moms from the first film, dealing with their own mothers visiting during the Christmas holiday. It stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn as the daughters, with Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, and Susan Sarandon as the visiting Moms. It received mixed reviews and did decently at the box office. It's an OK film for what it's supposed to be. Doubt you'll be clamoring to catch it a second time, but decent enough to watch the whole thing."}, {"id": 13, "text": "10/10 - hysterical and very relatable (not to mention a cast of some phenomenal female talent)"}, {"id": 14, "text": "As a huge fan of comedies that bring some laughs and escape to this world, and as a huge fan of well-known stars letting their hair down and having goofy fun in an R-rated, raunchy romp, I couldn't wait to see this sequel to Bad Moms, which I mostly loved and have now watched multiple times. Adding Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon, and Cheryl Hines to the original cast seemed like a perfect match--how could it go wrong? In my mind just letting this group of talented actors improvise on the same set would guarantee big laughs, especially with Kathryn Hahn sparking the mix. I went to a paid advance screening a week before it opened to the public, plunking down my bucks without any fear of first checking reviews--I was that sure it would be at the very least filled with some laugh-out-loud moments, and plenty of amusing ones, well worth my time and money. Imagine my surprise, and disappointment, to find that the film is loaded with tired clich\u00e9s of mother-daughter relationship problems, with nothing fresh or funny to offer, old jokes and sitcom situations you've seen done (much) better dozens of times on most any TV family sitcom, and that the script is so poorly-written it truly would've been better to just give the actors an overview of what the film was about and let them improv the whole thing. Finally it ends, and you're left with an almost embarrassing dance/romp during the closing credits that is supposed to be a celebration of the joy of the film and its production and cast, with the actors having a bit of an on-screen dance party as the credits roll. Instead of feeling that (forced) joy, I left the theater depressed and saddened at the waste of money and talent, and the waste of my time and money as well. Easily, for me, one of the worst comedies I've ever seen--and I've seen hundreds over the decades and my lifetime."}, {"id": 15, "text": "I don't care what anyone else says, this movie is super funny!!

Plus it made me laugh so much and so loud."}, {"id": 16, "text": "A Bad Moms Christmas may have fell into that comedy sequel flaw were the first movie was pure laughs and fun. And this sequel may have some moments were it can be funny, but overall it fell a little boring compared to the first movie. I enjoyed the first with Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn playing mothers who are so overworked and unappreciated. They decide to take control of their own lives to have a little fun. Sure, there are some hilarious moments in this film. But it was not enough to carry the rest of the movie. Amy (Mila Kunis), Kiki (Kristen Bell), and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) are under appreciated and overworked trying to get ready for Christmas. They all get surprised by their mothers visiting them for the holidays. Then, there comes the drama with Amy's mother being the high maintenance snob, Kiki's mother being too clingy and attached to her daughter still, and Carla's mother who is a dead beat and only sees the daughter when she needs something. Straight to the point, Bad Moms Christmas had some fun laughable moments. A scene were Amy, Kiki, and Carla get a little drunk before they do some shopping at the mall. Kind of a familiar concept like the first movie, were they were trashing a grocery store. Also, a scene were they are at skyzone and playing dodgeball with their kids and their mothers also participated was also a lot of fun. But the movie does fail with having a plot. It is all about mothers struggling through the holidays, and there mothers show up to either wreck there peaceful holiday or give them a little meaningful message about how to handle there own personal life. There was a lot of moments were there was not many jokes or laughs happening. Especially, in the more dramatic moments when Amy and there mother part ways after a party that turned for a disaster in her house. And her mother and the other two mothers chat away about how they all mistreated their daughters. Overall, Bad Moms Christmas is a bad film. It has some brief jokes and laughs. But not as good as the first film. Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn were great but the script was lacking in a more fun plot and humor. I rate the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. I recommend the film as a rental."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Loved the original, paid to see it three times at a theater. This is (for me) the WORST film of the year. The characters, particularly Hahn and Sarandons are repugnant, repellent and even I am embarrassed for them. What a waste of a terrific cast! I laughed ONCE (a joke about Sarandon's characters name) and that was it. I was really looking forward to this, but sadly, it seems as if the first film was a fluke or just dumb luck that it turned out as well as it did. I love raunchy R rated comedy but this Bad Mom is one BAD MOTHAH! 1/10."}, {"id": 18, "text": "This was unquestionably the absolute worst movie I have ever spent my heard earned money on, and I have never wished for a refund so much in all my movie-going years. While I wanted to walk out after the first 15 minutes, I instead chose to continue to wait, thinking that at some point soon the movie would get better and be worthy of some words of praise or at least one commendation. However, by mid- movie it was clear that this movie was only spiraling from bad to worse, and I would have walked out had I not been accompanied by the friend who chose for us to see it. It was ridiculous from start to finish, and not the least bit funny. I was just beyond embarrassed for these otherwise noteworthy actors. Truly, it was so awful that I kept waiting for the movie theater people to jump out from behind the screen and say Gotcha, and then start the real movie, but sadly, it was not to be. SPOILER: The only redeeming moments in the movie were toward the end when the father explains the psychological forces driving the mother's controlling behavior and the touching apologies that ensued between mother and daughter in the church. The only funny line was at the end with Baranski calling the boyfriend Jesus. Do not waste your money on this disgusting movie from it's scripted, blasphemous lines out of the mouth of a sweet young child (OMFG) to the truly vile salon male waxing scene, to the raunchy dance at the end that no child should ever be made to sit through.

We will definitely not watch a movie if we're bored but we loved this movie. There are some sweet story lines, some quirky humor, and some great raunchy humor. We loved it.

And it's Christmas.I'm a mom, but CLEARLY I'm not the target audience for this trashy attempt at a comedy.Christmas is, by far, the most stressful time of year for moms, explains Mila Kunis' character. Yep. While that's very true, that's no excuse for the horrible behavior these irresponsible, obnoxious, rude moms engage in. Yes, extreme absurdity has long been a formula for comedy, but 80% of the jokes in this sequel are super raunchy, and the other 10% are simply not funny.There's no talk about the true meaning of Christmas. None of the women in this film seem to even know anything about Christ or what kind of behavior He expects from His followers.Uplifting theme: Mother/Daughter relationships Family is most important.Things I liked: Kenny G! Christine Baranski is such a critical, evil mother. She's great in all of her movies and even sings a little in this one. Surprise cameoThings I didn't like: The writing is terrible. None of the characters are capable of uttering a sentence without some kind of profanity in it. Lots of fighting. Why is that funny? Kristen Bell is so talented. Why would she ever want to be in such an awful movie? Oh yeah\u0085.money. Kathryn Hahn's character is so foul. Her role was the stand-out in the first Bad Moms movie, so they really went over-the-top with her in this one. Everyone is so critical of everyone else. I hate listening to kids scream and cry in movies. Lots of slow-motion musical montages. These moms sure have a lot of spare time to hang out with each other and get drunk a lot. Instead of the feel good song at the end, a dirty Santa does a strip tease in front of the entire family. Mila Kunis manages to push out a tear in what is supposed to be the big emotional scene of the movie, but the dialogue was uninspired and droll.Interesting Lines: It's like a giant stress ball from Christmas to New Years. \u2013 Amy (Mila Kunis) Trust me. Some day she will thank me in an inspirational speech in some large, public venue. \u2013 Amy's mother (Christine Baranski) I laughed out loud at that line, because I think every mother secretly has the same wish. Tips for parents: About 45,362 F-bombs. Even an adorable little girl uses it. Other profanity and extremely crude language. LOTS and LOTS of talk of sex, as well as imitating sex with clothes on. Moms smoke marijuana. Women kissing women. The moms commit various crimes. A bunch of Santa Clauses strip on a stage. Nude man on a waxing table (private parts hidden).

The girl who uses God's name in vain just goes to show that anyone is willing to let their kid take an acting role even if that means he has to blaspheme and use God's name with utter disrespect.

There is soooo much wrong with this film, where do I start?! Badly written, rubbish acting, revolting dialogue! Hardly starts being funny and you quickly stop caring what happens next! Child actors using the F-word (of which there was plenty) is never funny! Racist in places There's every type of lazy humour including overdone sex and clich\u00e9d jokes!

It seemed like every scene contained the 'F' word, after a while this wears thin and then you begin to realise it was being used instead of clever humour.

Well you can add Donald Trump tweets and inferior movie sequels to what Benjamin Franklin preached about back in 1879.A Bad Moms Christmas is in fact, a sequel. It is my latest review and yeah, it's pretty darn inferior. Christmas, which I don't think was screened for critics, is a half-baked continuation of last year's Bad Moms. Heck, it doesn't even feel like it has much of a connection to the first film.A Bad Moms Christmas is like a cash grab for the holidays, a vehicle that is more akin to a raunchy version of Love the Coopers (or National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation) than to being a legitimate, Bad Moms part deuce.It annoyed me that Christmas is yet another holiday film that takes place in Chicago (even though it was shot in Atlanta). It also annoyed me that A Bad Moms Christmas is another holiday flick in which chaos ensues when overbearing parents arrive on the scene. I am aware that the similar-themed, Daddy's Home 2 is coming out next week. In truth, I think I'll now avoid that movie like the plague.Anyway, with Christmas the main characters (played by Kathryn Hahn, Mila Kunis, and Kristen Bell) are not that bad this time around. Yeah they get drunk at a mall, grind on Santa, and steal a Christmas tree from Lady Foot Locker. But hey, that's only about seven minutes of screen time. Their actions just aren't as rebellious, wayward, or unladylike as in the first outing.Most of the script in A Bad Moms Christmas feels lazy. The screenwriter's idea of generating laughs is to add potty-mouthed F-bombs and a sequence where male genitalia is being waxed (ha-ha what a knee slapper). The production of Christmas feels rushed and slapdash as well. The snow outside looks fake, the sets try hard to appear like a poster child for a JCPenney Xmas catalog, and directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (yes there are two of them) have a real hard-on for slow motion shots with some tired, R&amp;B music in the background.All in all, A Bad Moms Christmas does offer a few heartfelt moments between the focal moms and their own, weirdo moms (played by Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, and Cheryl Hines). Unfortunately, Christmas also has a stupid cameo by Kenny G along with a shaming dance montage at the closing credits (Kenny G is in that too and he dry humps his saxophone, how cute).During the first half hour of Christmas, Kathryn Hahn's Carla quips, let's put the ass back in Christmas.

Ugh it's scary that this is what passes in Hollywood for entertainment. Everyone who had some say so in this should be blushing and have trouble sleeping for signing off on it. In real life, having this on a resume would automatically rule you out of future projects. Unfortunately it made money and is therefore considered a success in Hollywood.

One grandma is a pot smoking, drinking, gambler who wants money. The last grandma is a lonely widow and who thinks her life should now be shoulder-to-shoulder with her daughter.

The sequel is wilder and than the original and the introduction of the perfectly cast grand moms (Sarandon, Baranski and Hines) makes for plenty of very relatable mother-daughter moments that make one want to both cover her face in horrified agreement and call her mom to tell her she loves her all at the same time. The friendship between the three equally talented and charismatic leads; moms Amy (Kunis), Carla (Hahn) and Kiki (Bell) is fun, at ease and feels incredibly organic and their sincere and very human devotion to their kids in their own unique ways combined with that unapologetic, playful rebel streak make this new journey of the moms entertaining, engaging and realistic. Christine Baranski's immaculate comedic timing and portrayal of the overbearing, snobby but somewhat endearing Ruth is ridiculously on point and Carla's (Kathryn Hahn's) scenes with Ty (Justin Hartley) had the entire cinema in hysterics. A counseling session with (Wanda Syke's) Dr. Karl will make you - as a daughter (or son) cry big, ugly tears and the doting, charming (Peter Gallagher) as Hank stepping in to try to calm the waters are two of the moments that I think really anchor this film as not just a lively, festive, raunchy comedy, but as something many will relate to, especially at Christmas."}, {"id": 69, "text": "Merry is relative. this sequel the the surprise hit of 2016 mila kunis Kristen bell and kathran hann reprise their roles as the good time girls or moms Amy Carla andkiki who is dumb this time around they're juggling motherhood and their own mothers baranski Cheryl and Susan sarandon character called isis lots of jokes about that a doped up mother who arrived for Christmas to spend time this film is made in Chicago as we follow the Bad Moms Christmas follows our three under-appreciated and over-burdened women as they rebel against the challenges and expectations of the Super Bowl for moms: ChristmasThis movie is fun and hilarious and has a heart there is some fun jokes a 12 days of Christmas played out with decorations by Amy's o so serious mam Ruth played. and then Amy mother wants to go the nutcracker instead go to indoor dodge-ball this part is nearly the highlight of the movie its rib tickling by Christine Baranski ,who is having a riot\u2014 gratuitous in its R- rated language and sexual content, and fully boasts its awesome cast in several outrageous ways. After feeling out our moms (Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn) in the first film, I really now see and understand how the unique characters bring out the most in one another, The 104-minute run time felt perfect from the waxing to robbing foot lockers Christmas trees to Ruth spoiling her grandchildren and then there kiki dumb but fun there Santa's stripper's very fun there a lot of Christmas heart and a donkey in a house The Christmas theme is integrated right into the plot and is a fresh way to pitch the sequel, and the grand moms help induce the struggling relationships that one could find in a hard-hitting melodrama: one whose mom has unrealistic expectations for her daughter's motherhood, one who wants separative space between herself and her mom, and one who wants more closeness to her mom. It sounds very general, but when within the right framework (when not clouded by the film's foolishness) it hits as very real when it tries to. While the first film really felt to be for moms in that there is a general message that will make them feel important walking out of the theater, this sequel tries to deliver a similar thing with the grandmothers to a lesser effect. Now that there are two comedy sequels releasing about parents' parents coming home for the Christmas holidays, the similarities stop there and audiences have a choicebetween seeing: men/women, naughty/nice, or crude/slapstick. I'd say for the appropriate age, A Bad Moms Christmas delivers on more fronts , prepare to turn off the suspension of disbelief switch and prepare for a decent abs workout. but they also aren't a complete waste of time and money for how over the top they are but the film makers are expanding the bad moms universe will it be bad grandmas 10 out of 10"}, {"id": 70, "text": "I saw A Bad Moms Christmas, starring Mila Kunis-Jupiter Ascending, The Book of Eli; Kristen Bell-How To Be a Latin Lover, Scream 4; Kathryn Hahn-Captain Fantastic, Step Brothers; Christine Baranski-The Big Bang Theory_tv, The Bounty Hunter; Cheryl Hines-Son of Zorn_tv, RV and Susan Sarandon-Tammy_2014, Mr. Woodcock. This is a sequel to the 2016 minor hit, Bad Moms. It seemed like the producers were in a rush to get this movie out-it has barely been a year since the first one-because even though there are some laughs, it's pretty predictable. Mila, Kristen and Kathryn are still besties and they are all getting ready for Christmas and all the pressures that go along with the season-planning parties, shopping for gifts, decorating....well, you know the drill. That is when all three of their mothers decide to visit, at the same time-can you believe it? Christine is Mila's disapproving mom-nothing Mila does is good enough. Cheryl is Kristen's overly clingy mom-she spends all of her time with Kristen and even wants to move in next door to her. Susan is Kathryn's free-spirited absentee mom-she gambles, smokes marijuana and doesn't come around for years at a time. The best thing about the movie is the cast-great casting. The worst thing is the recycled material-unless you think little kids using the 'F' word or someone calling a person by a different name every time she sees them is funny. As the end credits start, there is a scene with the entire cast dancing. It's rated R for language, drug use and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 44 minutes.

Unfortunately the movie is highly predictable and it takes the easiest route by adding even more mums to the mix or any comic commentary about the women.

Some decent jokes, tho a bit more innocent compared to part 1. The acting of the ladies was good enough. Again Kathryn Hahn was the best of the bunch, but also she had more spice in the original part. Mila Kunis was fine and I really liked Kristen Bell. From the new additions Christine Baranski was the best although it was her now typecast character she already played in The Big Band Theory . I expected a bit more from Susan Sarandon tho she had some good moments. Cheryl Hines was hilarious however her gimmick went a bit too far after some time.

Kathryn Hahn is outrageously funny and seeing Susan Sarandon as such a free spirit was worth the time spent. The relationship between Cheryl Hines and Kristen Bell was strange (friendship over mother/daughter) and subtly funny. A virtual cameo by Wanda Sykes asva family counselor was funny. Christine Baranski as Mika Kunis' mother was over the top (controlling) but occasionally funny (Dodge Ball). All the relationships were dysfunctional at different levels.

It defiantly had the same heart-warming message to reassure all the Moms out there that they are doing a good job but there was not as many laughs as there was in last film. That being said there was a few scenes that made me chuckle. I especially loved the scene when they Take back Christmas at the mall and get drunk. It made meeting Santa fun. The sexy Santa competition and the fight between Kunis and Baranski was also pretty funny.  I think the relationships between the Moms and their Moms are great. I'm pretty sure most of us would be able to relate to one of them.The cast did really well with what they had to work with in terms of script. Hahn is hilarious in the delivery of her lines. She cracked me up with most of what she said. Kunis, Bell, Baranski, Sarandon and Hines are all brilliant and all play opposite each other amazingly.

Now setting at Christmas time, would be a sure way for the film to make good profit at the box office (which it good, though less than the original of course).A Bad Moms Christmas simply isn't funny as it tries to hard for jokes and comes off as a wasted comedic attempt. The original was quite refreshing and although not as funny as some felt, the original was still a decent and fun watch. However this sequel as some moments but overall, the comedy just is not there.The main problems are the mothers of the original three of Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn. There mothers aren't funny or interesting and as the film tenders on, become quite more annoying. Hearing a child use the F-bomb may seem funny and unexpected at first, but hearing it about 3 more times isn't funny. Another scene featuring the moms parading at a Santa Claus in the mom with a musical montage was also not funny in the least and beyond forced. A funny scene included the mothers and their families playing at a Skyzone stadium. Also as expected, the film is predictable as we all know where its heading.Overall this film wasn't it in terms of comedy and felt rushed and forced.

The 104-minute run time felt just fine to me and not overlong, but there was one subplot of this film I still could have done without and did not add much to the story, and removing it would have brought it down to a tight 90 minutes.The Christmas theme is integrated right into the plot and is a fresh way to pitch the sequel, and the grandmoms help induce the struggling relationships that one could find in a hard-hitting melodrama: one whose mom has unrealistic expectations for her daughter's motherhood, one who wants separative space between herself and her mom, and one who wants more closeness to her mom. It sounds very general, but when within the right framework (when not clouded by the film's foolishness) it hits as very real when it tries to. While the first film really felt to be for moms in that there is a general message that will make them feel important walking out of the theater, this sequel tries to deliver a similar thing with the grandmothers to a lesser effect.Now that there are two comedy sequels releasing about parents' parents coming home for the Christmas holidays, the similarities stop there and audiences have a choice between seeing: men/women, naughty/nice, or crude/slapstick. I'd say for the appropriate age, A Bad Moms Christmas delivers on more fronts than Daddy's Home 2 (which I also saw a pre- screening for, by the way); regardless, prepare to turn off the suspension of disbelief switch and prepare for a decent abs workout.

I didn't see the first film, and went to see this only because it was Thanksgiving, and I was on a binge watch at the cinema all day, catching up on recent releases I've missed ( this movie, followed by Daddy's Home 2, and The Man Who Invented Christmas, concluding with a rewatch of The Shining ) , and because Mila Kunis is still very attractive, and I'll admit, I was a bit unclear of the characters' names until about 30 minutes in. I was also unsure why hasn't 32 years old Mila stood up to her mother yet, rather than acting like a scared, timid child, every time her mother calls her fat, or undermines her in front of her family? that subplot is depressing and grating, while the clingy mom subplot was creepy as hell ( she has her grown daughter's face emblazoned on her sweaters, watches her having sex with her husband, tells her she has a variety of fatal diseases just for sympathy, and even * buys * the house next door to her, just to be near her! Boundaries, bitch! That's not funny, that's stalker material, but Merry Christmas. ) Random  celebrity  cameo: Kenny G., who has\u200b one funny line, after Mila Kunis tells him to take his flute and leave her home, he responds,  It's not a flute, bitch ... !  There's a huge, on-going argument between Mila and her mother's character, who wants to lavishly decorate her home for Christmas, while Mila wants a modest Christmas. Who cares? If the bitch wants to decorate her home lavishly, and AT HER OEN EXPENSE, who cares? Let Mila quietly tell her kids  We'll have\u200b a quite Christmas next year, but for now, let's just let her decorate, she's paying for everything One of the bad ( grand ) moms is named Isis, like the terrorist organisation. Seriously. That's the joke, and it's funny because movie. They get drunk in a mall, at lunchtime, and take naughty photos with an elderly Santa, and again, it's funny because movie. I face palmed so much when, in the penultimate scene, the Sexy Santa announced he was going to  express his feelings through dance . Random and disjointed, it's a series of barely connected vignettes, linked together only by cast, and quite frankly, this looks like it was only the first draft of the script, fleshed out with ad- libs, and dance routines. If you absolutely * must * watch this, see if you can figure why the first two thirds of the story are told through flashback?"}, {"id": 197, "text": "I wanted to read the reviews after seeing only 5.5 stars.Here are my thoughts...1) Parts of this movie is wildly inapproproate and creepy. If you don't find crude humor amusing... Do NOT watch this movie. Typically, I do not find it funny. However, there were parts that had me giggling. I found the last scene to be a bit much. Humping infront of children?2) Walking in to treat the client as a sex object is defintley going to rub some of us that support the Me too movement the wrong way. Also, wildly inappropriate. Screams sexual harassment. And, made me uncomfortable.3) Kenny G. calling Mila a B? Not a fan. I thought that really torched his character for me.If you can get through all that, the movie is extremely overstretched in every way. But, humorous. Cliche' mom and daughter relationships? Sure.

Not only is it not funny; it is also boring as it trades mercilessly on stereotypical mother/daughter rivalry and takes amusing moments stretching them out to seeming infinity.For the three principal young moms, Amy (Mila Kunis), Kiki (Kristen Bell), and Carla (Kathryn Hahn), their mothers in different ways present the ugly side of cheer. In each case the mother domineers by not appreciating her daughter, competing with her, or so misunderstanding her as to make familial love impossible.As for Amy's kids, helicoptering by Grandma Ruth (Christine Baranski) is the mode of loving, never a good thing and one of the few satirical nuggets in an otherwise sloppy script. Not that grandma is devoid of good lines, e.g., Its December 19th \u2014 even the Jews have Christmas trees by now. Most egregious are the lengthy sequences with a male stripper, Ty (Justin Hartley), which have him dancing too much with those gestures supposed to be erotic but end up being lame, even if he is better than Magic Mike. At least the directors/writers, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, have the wit to place him romantically with the cheesiest of the three ladies, Carla.The coda is arguably the best part when it philosophizes about the fraught relationships between most daughters and mothers.

Well that film not only gets a sequel, but one that is more festive themed. The film came quick and a little out of nowhere, though I was interested how the film would fare with its holiday theme. I like raunchy holiday films, they can be a lot of fun. Or completely terrible. A Bad Moms Christmas kind of falls in between the two. Its not really an improvement over the first but does enough to be a time killer with a few laughs.Our three lead moms are back but this time its almost time for Christmas and the moms of the moms all drop by. There are character flaws in all of the mothers. Whether it be abandonment, too much attachment, or a resounding coldness the moms and their daughters do not see eye to eye. A bit of chaos ensues as the character try to find a way to co-exist and come together for the holidays. That plot summary must have sounded confusing as hell. Its a rather simple plot though, not overly original but sufficient for what the film offers.The film has crude sexual references but fewer than that of its predecessor. For an R-rated holiday film its surprisingly tame. The laughs don't always come but I do remember laughing at loud twice. The introduction of characters played by Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, and Cheryl Hines is a good touch because they provide the audience engagement and do provide the laughs. The film does not avoid cookie cutter plot resolutions and doesn't really remain creative but its fine.The film isn't going to rank anywhere on the best holiday movies of all time. You won't remember it in a few days after watching it. It's not really worth a watch, but if you are a movie pass crusader like me who watches everything you'll find that the film is somewhat decent and provides for mild entertainment. I do hope the series rests here because I can see a supposed third film run out of steam fast.6/10"}, {"id": 203, "text": "If you really enjoyed the original Bad Moms it should be no surprise that this one was not as good. With most comedy sequels we tend to watch them because we really liked the characters not because there's any type of story that needs to be continued. I mean if you look at The Hangover movies more than one wasn't really necessary but the characters were so likable they knew they could continue with them. Bad Moms is pretty much the same. I felt the characters were just as likable this time around though not as naturally funny. At times the comedy was forced and was basically a rehash of the first one with Christmas thrown in. However I did like adding their moms to the mix. Susan Sarandon as Kathryn Hahn's mom in particular was one of the more funny ones because they were so similar. It was also a pretty enjoyable Christmas movie and kind of got me in the Christmas spirit even though Halloween literally just ended. Obviously it's not an It's a Wonderful Life classic but a good Christmas comedy. Overall I like the theme of a film being called Bad Moms when they're all trying pretty hard to be good moms that just realize they can never be perfect. I like that most moms can relate to at least one of the characters. And yes if they made a third called Bad Grandmas which they pretty much made it look like they would, or at least could, I would see it."}, {"id": 204, "text": "A Bad Moms Christmas (2017 release; 104 min.) brings more from the original bad moms. As the movie opens, we once again hear Amy introduce the story. I am Amy Mitchell and I just ruined this year's Christmas she tells us, amidst what appears to be a war zone in her house (and a camel walking by!). We then go back in time to 6 Days Before Christmas, where the story begins as Amy gets ready for Christmas and things start going wrong when her parents, and in particular her domineering mom, show up. In parallel stories, Kiki and Carla also get visited by their moms. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: last year's Bad Moms was an unexpected success, and I found it to be somewhat of a delightful little move, in particular with Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell playing against character as the moms gone wild in the funniest of ways. So when a sequel was announced, I was all in. Once again co-written and co-directed by Scott Moore and Jon Lucas, nothing could go wrong, right? Sadly, I must report that this sequel is nowhere close to the original, and nowhere near as funny. Why? While in and of itself it seemed like a good idea to add the three mothers of the original bad moms to to plot, it actually resulted in this being a movie more about the mothers of the bad moms, than it is about the bad moms themselves. In particular, this is mostly about Amy and her domineering (and thoroughly unlikable) mother, although of course the other two bad moms and their mothers get plenty of screen time too. The weird thing is that, contrary to the original movie, the bad moms are no longer bad at all in any respect, in fact trying like crazy to win their mothers' approval and love and pleasing their respective loved ones as best they can. Yes, there is one scene early in the movie where the moms go crazy during a shopping mall spree, but that's about it. And then there are the male strippers scenes (yes plural), which got a lot of hollering and hooting from the theater crowd (mostly female, of course). There was no such reaction when the young girl (daughter of Amy's boyfriend, maybe 6 or so?) dropped the F bomb, not once, not twice, but multiple time. The bottom line is that Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Kathryn Hahn are sadly overshadowed by their mothers, played by Cheryl Hines, Christine Baranski, and Susan Sarandon, respectively.A Bad Moms Christmas opened wide on Wednesday. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended just okay (not even half full in a small theater), quite surprising for a movie's opening weekend. I'd say this does not bode well for the long term success of this movie. Surely this will not generate strong word of mouth. I had high hopes for this movie, but sadly the film makers deviated way too much from the original premise, and this should've been called The bad moms' mothers screwed-up Christmas. I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw tour own conclusion."}, {"id": 205, "text": "A BadMoms Christmas directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is wilder than movie Bad moms. This movie is about bad but fun mom and grand moms. Mila Kunis as Amy is hardworking, overworked mom with lots of love for her kids and always on edge around her stylish, rich, loving mom Ruth ( love Christine Baranski ... Mama Mia/Big Bang Theory). Kathryn Hahn as Carla is foul mouthed but does not care about pretensions and maybe genetically inherited her personality from her mom Isis ( wild Susan Sarandon, enjoyed her acting in movie Meddler). Kristen bell as sweet Kiki under the tutelage of Amy and Carla is not very nice to her mom Sandy ( Cheryl Hines). My favorite scenes are the counseling sessions by Dr Karl( Wanda Sykes) for Kiki and Sandy. Every daughter should hear what Dr Karl says. Justin Hartley ( from NBC show This is Us) as Ty ,a strip dancer,is alright as Carla's passionate , instant boyfriend. Peter Gallagher as Amy's dad Hank does a good job at bringing peace between mom and daughter. Christmas can be quiet and without any expression of love by not giving or receiving gifts but Christmas is great when joy is expressed in decoration, food, giving and receiving gifts. I am glad i saw the movie. Christmas is special and not like any other day.

The protagonists (Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn) from the original are at wit's end from having to make Christmas perfect...and then their moms show up. One's (Christine Baranski) a perfectionist, one's (Cheryl Hines) clingy, and one's (Susan Sarandon) a stoner. Sure enough, the personalities start clashing.Much like how the original looked at the excessive tendency to organize our lives in the 21st century, this one looks at the stress that dominates our lives during the holidays. It's easy to understand why Amy, Kiki and Carla do what they do in the mall (Carla's crassness abets it, of course). And the moms have their own issues to deal with.Obviously, it's not any sort of high-brow cinema, but it's not supposed to be. The point is to be raunchy, and the waxing scene makes clear that the movie's not going to resist doing whatever it wants. Baranski's character is basically her role as Leonard's mom on The Big Bang Theory (her no-nonsense physiognomy makes her perfect for these roles).Basically, it's a fun movie. Keep an open mind and you'll enjoy it."}, {"id": 207, "text": "The bad moms are back! This time they're out to reclaim the most stressful time of year on behalf of moms everywhere by letting loose and liberating themselves from the oppression of mandatory holiday cheer. Amy (Kunis), Kiki (Bell) and Carla (Hahn) team up yet again and support each other during the holiday season all while all three of their mothers come to town for an unexpected Christmas visit. Will our three diverse personalities of middle class white women escape Christmas unscathed? Or will they be overwhelmed by the towering expectations of their dysfunctional mothers.Everything bad that can be said about Bad Moms Christmas can also be said about the original Bad Moms; tired jokes, broad characterizations, unimaginative staging, an over-reliance on improv that assumes the editor will be able to just find the movie in post etc. So then given all its faults, why am I still smiling? Why is this hastily assembled follow up to a mediocre R-rated comedy arguably better than the original? Well part of the reason may just be this movie doesn't have that far to fall. The first film posed as an invigorating subversion of gender expectations instead of drawing attention to what it really was \u2013 a trash movie. This one basically takes the shoddily propped up premise that we're already familiar with and merely staples tinsel to it. Yet because there's a lived-in quality to it, because we're already familiar with these characters, all we need to catch up is for the girls to dunk rum into the mall's Teavana samples and say f**k a lot.With no faux mission statement sprucing up the inappropriateness like protesters in a Kylie Jenner Pepsi ad, the measure of success is now whether Bad Moms Christmas can get you to laugh. And it does \u2013 not often enough to endorse strongly, but Bad Moms Christmas does have a few zingers worth repeating at the next neighborhood Tupperware party. Kunis, Bell and especially Hahn get a few good quips here and there and for once look comfortable just being in each others' presence.If however you wanted to know the primary reason why A Bad Moms Christmas is better than its prequel, one needn't look further than the rib-tickling performances of Susan Sarandon, Cheryl Hines and Christine Baranski. Baranski especially, who has had a long career playing ice queens, is downright superb as Amy's formal, acid-tongued, high society mother. Honestly this movie is bumped up a letter grade simply because between Baranski and Hines's clingy best friend mom, not a single opportunity for a laugh was lost.Susan Sarandon is also tremendous though much like the kids in the first film (or in this one for that matter), she's sadly underutilized. What's worse is her relationship with her daughter Carla offers the most narrative opportunities for growth, but this being a broad American comedy means any real human moments are quickly swept under the rug.Swept under the rug along with any meaningful insight on motherhood \u2013 the second time this series has managed the same thematic swing and a miss. Oh well, at least the jokes and gags reach new levels of raunchiness that border on the absurd. There's a memorable scene with Justin Hartley involving a few strips of hot wax that's sure to delight. And if not, there's always the old standby of listening to young children say the darnest things again and again. If you're not laughing at least once during this movie, then you're probably just not in the spirit."}, {"id": 208, "text": "Review Date 2/10/2018PLEASE BEWARE OF SOME REVIEWERS THAT ONLY HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW.

This movie was an obvious cash-grab by the studio who made the first movie in the franchise just one year earlier. This movie has no re-watch value.That might only take the movie down to three stars. But that is not all. Indeed, about an hour into this godforsaken film, it takes a turn for the emotional side. The movie becomes a commentary on the fragility of relationships between the mother and the daughter. All three of the main characters get into seemingly irreconcilable conflicts with their mothers. And then everything gets resolved in 10 minutes and everyone lives happily ever after. It felt like another movie was stitched on in the most sloppy, myopic manner possible.There are enough good Christmas movies for you to never have to bother with this one.

But wait, who's that knocking on the door? It's none other than the damn Grandmom's coming to wreck the holiday season even further. Enter Susan Sarandon, Cheryl Hines and the abominable Christine Baranski. These three women steal every scene and definitely inject some much needed comedy into a lacklustre story. This is the first time where I felt Mila Kunis was not the lead star, the over abundance of Kathryn Hahn made her the applicable candidate for lead star. Why? Because she's way funnier than Kunis. That's for sure. Kristen Bell...well, she's just there. Baranski's comedic timing that we all too familiar with in the likes of the never ending The Big Bang Theory is just gold. Just her mannerisms make me smile with glee, I mean not many people can sing We Wish You A Merry Christmas and make me laugh. Then we get to the jokes. Aside from a waxing scene (which was hilarious) and Baranski's character failing to remember her own daughter's boyfriend...it just fell flat. Some of the jokes were predictable (Isis being one of them) and one scene went way too far and dark (regarding Cancer). It's a case of poor writing and not enough subtle humour. It's constantly in your face and I grew tiresome rather rapidly. The third act arrives and the sentimentality is so forced that even Isaac Newton would've made a new law of motion.

Christina Baranski was the typical mom who pushes their daughter to be the best whilst Cheryl Hines played the mom who was a little too needy and obsessed with her grown up daughter.

The original was a surprise hit for me and a breathe of fresh air into the all-female comedy movies that are becoming more and more common. It had great characters, a fun story and was just an entertaining thing to watch for the entire run time. The sequel sadly has none of that going for it. I actually struggle to believe that the same people who wrote the original and also the original 'The Hangover' movie could write something this incredibly lazy and unfunny.The film basically has no plot. Three women's mothers show up and there is slight tension in each case. That is about the extent that the storyline reaches, I kid you not. This screenplay could've been (and probably was) written in a day. It relies almost entirely on funny one-liners to get any laughs at all out of the audience, but we are so bored by everything else going on that it's almost impossible to muster the energy. There is no situational humour in the movie at all. Each scene just passes by. If you didn't know better you could actually mistake this movie for a drama.Needless to say I did not have a good time with 'A Bad Moms Christmas'. Not only was it dreadful in every way, it also managed to run an extra 10 minutes than it was required to, almost as if it thought it had so much story to fit in. Don't hesitate to give this one a miss, it is a complete misfire."}, {"id": 214, "text": "The reason to check out the original Bad Moms was the chemistry between Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn. They had funny material to work with but without their individual performances, the movie would have been a decent yet forgettable film. The directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore know this and rely on the cast to carry them through the sequel (to the point where the movie suffers for it). The funniest and strongest part of this movie is that the 3 leads refused to phone it in. They carry this movie through some of the bumpier sections of the plot and keep you interested in where they will go next. Hahn is still the funniest of the original trio but Bell and Kunis still left me giggling. A Bad Moms Christmas brings in Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon and Cheryl Hines as Ruth, Isis and Sandy respectively as the moms of the 3 lead actresses. They're all amusing for short moments and they all manage to be decent despite some iffy material (I got tired of Ruth being racist towards Jessie but that's as offensive as it got). Jay Hernandez was given almost nothing to do except to be a prop and Peter Gallagher is a background character until the last 10 minutes.If this movie wasn't written by the same writer/director team, I would claim that they just ripped the first movie off. But it is the same team so all I can say is that this is a lazy script. The worst part of this movie is how the plot is so recycled from the first movie. They did add the 3 grandmas but other than that, they just did the same thing with an Xmas theme. The families are ungrateful, the moms are burned out and they throw tradition to the wind and cut loose to decidedly mixed results. I'm not saying Bad Moms was the deepest comedy on the market but they did a much better job making the characters feel realistic and their dilemmas were familiar and believable. This movie is sorely lacking those qualities and although the problems aren't unrealistic (the Hahn/Sarandon conflict and kernels of Kunis and Baranski's could happen) they're resolved in a rushed and simple manner just like any sitcom.Although they bring in some new characters, if you're hoping to see supporting characters return from the last movie you might be disappointed. As I said before, Jessie is a non-character in this movie and other than some insulting comments from Ruth, there's no conflict with his character. Amy's kids completely forgot the lessons that they learned in the last one, they go back to being self-centred and bratty (they do give a reason but their complete inability to step up for Amy was annoying). They bring back one of the more underrated characters from Bad Moms for a cameo and I thought she nailed it but her appearance in the sequel amounts to just a couple of minutes of screen time.The last and most important question is was the movie funny? Despite the fact that the plot and the character development was lacking I have to say yes. The movie goes long stretches of repeating the same jokes from the original (the montage of the moms going crazy in a public place) or they run jokes that were initially funny into the ground (pretty much any bit with Justin Hartley goes on way too long). But I did get some good laughs in and while I wasn't 100% entertained, I never had to wait too long before a throwaway line would at least make me chuckle. Most of my favourite scenes were just Amy, Kiki and Carla shooting the breeze about how tough being a mom is and sharing their horror stories about it.This was a hard movie to grade. I liked the performances and I did laugh but they rehashed the plot and the emotional beats of the movie feel forced. If they intend to keep treating this as a franchise, my advice would to be to meditate on the next one a little longer instead of pushing it out so fast. I saw this with a friend and her criticism was how this seemed like an enormous cash grab. I still think the original is a solid raunchy comedy for both sexes and while this one still is funny, it falls short of Bad Moms. I'll split the difference and give it a 6/10."}, {"id": 215, "text": "I know, I can't believe I watched the first one, didn't particularly care for it, and STILL watched the sequel.

With Susan Sarandon and the other moms whose name I can't remember, but think they're great, I thought mayyyybe this one would be better than the last and I would at least get a few laughs. It was all over the place and the jokes just didn't land. And Susan Sarandon and the other moms stole the show...what there was left of it to steal.The writers barely tried in Bad Moms and didn't try at all in this film, so all that was left was a bunch of dumb humor only guys would think is funny but coming out of women's mouths.Just save yourself and watch something else."}, {"id": 216, "text": "Three overburdened young moms try to meet and then rebel against the challenges of Super Bowl for moms - a perfect Christmas.It's a sequel to Bad Moms released in 2016 summer which turned out to be quite a breakout hit, earning over 180 million cinema dollars against the 20 mil budget.Ah, the grrl power comedies, the cute but mostly unfunny younger sister of American mainstream comedies which were kickstarted by 2011's hit Bridesmaid, and Hollywood's eager wish to prove that women can be funny too.Well anybody can funny, of course, but you can't really create a noteworthy all-female comedy without decent script and performances, and/or actresses' ability to improvise, and this is where the new grrl power comedies fall short usually.A Bad Moms Christmas is a good example of this. Like many mainstream comedies, it has enough of everything to get the ball rolling, but the result feels so humorless and lacking that you will probably start checking your watch/phone before it reaches midpoint, at latest.One problem is the generic screenplay, the other is the fact that despite all the talent involved, the story centers on three leading ladies, two of which are not good enough performers to carry this movie.Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are always decent supporters but they lack the acting range and presence to justify carrying a comedy. I am not even sure that they have enough star power to justify lead parts in a budding comedy franchise.So it's up to third lead Kathryn Hahn to do most of the the heavy lifting, and she's solid as usual, being able to entertain, display some acting chops and create emotional connection with the audience.All the other players are relegated to the sidelines, and have little screen time or almost nothing interesting to do. But they do it well, so I am gonna name them all:* Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon, and Cherly Hines as the bad moms of the bad moms visiting for Christmas - all veteran actresses, all giving much better performances than Bell and Kunis;* Jay Hernandez, Peter Gallagher, Justin Hartley, Lyle Brocato - various love interests of bad moms, mostly there for decoration. Hartley is surprisingly memorable as male stripper with golden heart.The introduction of his character, an affectionate conversation during balls and anus waxing, is probably the best part of the whole movie, both warm and funny. I was as surprised as you probably are reading this.* Wanda Sykes, Christina Applegate, Cade Mansfield Cooksey - quick comedy reliefs, little screen time but a great value to the whole movie. If Bad Moms 2 will make you laugh at all, then it would probably happen thanks to them.I've seen some good modern christmas comedies, such as Elf and The Bad Santa, but this is not one of them. A Bad Moms Christmas is just never funny.The first hour is watchable but unremarkable, the remaining 45 minutes are just too cliche-y and frankly boring to care.Also, I was surprised to find that Bad Moms 2 is rated R in the U.S. cinemas - for crude sexual content and language throughout, and some drug use. Because compared to possibly every other modern raunchy comedy I have seen, it sure feels meek and mild. They even manage to make the promising end-credits dance number as unsexy as possible.So... Avoid it, till it reaches Netflix or something, or when you desperately need some comedy you haven't seen yet.By the way, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the writing-directing team behind the franchise, are already planning the spin-off Bad Dads.Probably gonna be as hollow and sackless as, say, Horrible Bosses. I am surprised if they will not try to bring in Jason Sudeikis or Jason Bateman, the charming crownprinces of sackless modern comedy movies."}, {"id": 217, "text": "2 out of 5 stars (has some good moments, but is overall bad)Watching A Bad Mom's Christmas is like reuniting with old college friends after a few years apart and realizing that you were better off moving on from them. The original Bad Moms was a solid mixture of wild raunch and unexpectedly effective sentiment that made me appreciate all the pain my mom must have gone through raising me. The sequel ups the heart of its predecessor but makes the fatal mistake of turning down the party elements (despite those elements comprising much of the film's marketing materials), leaving the feel of a Hallmark Channel movie if it was written by a college freshman. While some of A Bad Mom's Christmas is quite funny, those funny bits are drowned out by forced mama drama and undercooked holiday messages. This movie should make me want to go out and party, not contemplate the stability of my relationship with my parents.The film again follows our 3 heroines, Amy (Mila Kunis), Kiki (Kristen Bell), and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) during the Christmas season, the Super bowl for moms. Each is at the top of their respective worlds, with Amy enjoying a good relationship with her boyfriend (Jay Hernandez), Kiki finally getting her husband to contribute around the house, and Carla having a successful Brazilian wax emporium. With lives this good, it's only a matter of time before those lives shatter into supposed hilarity.And that happens when their three cartoonishly exaggerated moms appear out of the blue: Amy's judgmental matriarch Ruth (Christine Baranski), Kiki's uncomfortably clingy mom Sandy (Cheryl Hines), and Carla's absentee party mom Isis (Susan Sarandon getting the most laughs). The three ladies attempt to have the best Christmas possible despite their moms' presence, something that proves much harder than anticipated.I did not have high hopes for this movie. A majority of comedy sequels attempt to rehash the formula of their predecessor, which I honestly wouldn't have minded here. The film's ambitions far outreach its grasp, wanting to combine raunchy jokes and emotional drama despite having advertised a turn-your-brain-off party film. Much of the comedy on display is predictable sex humor, a routine which gets old quickly. While the original was certainly raunchy, it also had a decent amount of witty writing and effective shock value to balance it out. Ironically, these raunchy sequences are much more preferable than those in which the film attempts to make us cry. This is A Bad Mom's Christmas, not Marley &amp; Me. Give me crazy booze and madcap antics, not fully-grown adults breaking down over issues that should have been resolved years ago.A Bad Mom's Christmas has good intentions and a few solid laughs, but can't get the perfect balance of hilarity and heart amassed by its predecessor. Its attempt to expand on the characters drowns out the fun vibe that made the first one stand out, replacing it with forced emotion that perplexed me to no end. While it's certainly not the worst sequel I've ever seen, this is one Christmas you're better off skipping.Rated R for Crude Sexual Content And Language Throughout, And Some Drug UsePS: There is a sequel-beg with their mothers at the end: I can only imagine the awkwardness that might be Bad Grandmas."}, {"id": 218, "text": "A Bad Moms ChristmasMotherhood is the only career in which your co-workers can piddle on you and not be fired.That must be why the moms in this comedy have so much pent up anger.Unconventional moms Amy (Mila Kunis), Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) have the holiday's cut out for them when their mothers (Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, Susan Sarandon) show up for Christmas.Now Amy and her band of bad moms must put the opinionated grandparents in their place and regain their matriarchal dominance over Christmas.The superfluous follow-up to the dismal original, this seasonal sequel is every bit as wretched as its predecessor, and then some. With a script penned by males, the all-female cast stumbles on the juvenile dialogue and lewd situations they're one-dimensional characters are thrust into. Furthermore, any mother who doesn't buy their child exactly what they want for Christmas is a textbook bad mom.

The first time was fun because it was refreshing,. Moms have been shown as the epitome of hard work, but here we had 3 moms who were just tired of all the stuff they were expected to do. But in this case the newness of the concept just isn't there. Now we have a 3 generations thing because the mothers of all the three are visiting town. So our moms have the dual task of pleasing their families and doing it right by the Christmas, and at the same time also getting the approval of their moms. People not getting along with their parents is a very common thing and that makes it very cliched.1. The story line is absolutely predictable. Plus the directors choose to show the movie in flashback, which kills even the remote chance that there might have been some interest built up.2. The 3 lead characters of Amy (Mila Kunis), Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) are just as fantastic as they were before. In a lot of scenes they are literally the ones driving the movie.3. Direction seems to be directionless. There are a few scenes of slo-mo where the girls are dancing around a Santa, or playing in Skyzone. But they don't add anything to the story. The girls keep going back and forth on their resolve about wanting to have it their way or go according to their moms. The movie was supposed to be about the problems of juggling with the demands of the families and aspirations of the moms, but the entire plot gets very blurry.Overall not a great movie to watch even during the holidays."}, {"id": 220, "text": "After watching the first Bad Moms movie and thinking how utterly terrible it was, I don't know what possessed me to watch this one. Probably the 2 days into a chest infection boredom and a Netflix subscription, plus its nearly Christmas.Anyways, with a cast including Christine Barinski and Susan Sarandon I was expecting this festive sequel to be much better than the first one. Oh dear. I must lower my expectations of comedies.Full of frankly sexist, racist and vulgar 'jokes' that are not remotely funny, and pushing back gender equality and perpetuating stereotypes from 70 years ago, honestly the best part of the film is the set design. The script is mediocre at best, it would have been far better to let Kristen Bell and Katherine Hahn improv the whole thing, they are both talented actresses, I can only assume they have signed contracts obliging them to stick with these ghastly movies.Meh, at least the lack of laughs didn't induce a coughing fit."}, {"id": 221, "text": "A Bad Moms Christmas is a Comedy movie and the sequel of Bad Moms in which we watch our three under-appreciated mothers trying their best for their families during Christmas time. Everything becomes more difficult when their own mothers drop in unexpectedly and now they have even more work to do in order for everyone to be happy and enjoy Christmas since it's the most important family holiday of the year.Since I had already watched the first movie I was expecting something better than that. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by this movie because of the poor plot and I couldn't find a reason why they made a sequel to this movie. The direction which was made by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore as in the first movie was very poor and worse than the first one with many plot holes which they tried to cover in the last ten minutes of the movie and of course it didn't work at all. For one more time, the interpretation of Mila Kunis who played as Amy was very good but not enough to save this movie. Other interpretations that I liked and have to be mentioned were Kristen Bell's who played as Kiki and she was simply hilarious, Cheryl Hines who played as Sandy the mother of Kiki and Susan Sarandon's who played as Isis.Finally, I have to say that A Bad Moms Christmas is a poor movie with some good interpretations made by its cast that aren't enough. I admit that I had higher expectations for this movie since I had watched also the first but the result was a bit disappointing in my opinion. There are better Christmas comedy movies to watch and there is no need to waste your time watching this movie."}, {"id": 222, "text": "While A Bad Moms Christmas is not quite as funny as its predecessor, it was still fun enough to be entertaining.It should be said that it was actually the grandmothers that stole the attention all throughout the entire movie. It was was quite interesting especially because the characters were so hillarious and outrageous. And it helped that they had gotten some very talented actresses to perform these roles Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon and Cheryl Hines were perfect for the characters.Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn sort of had to take a step back as they were definitely outclassed and outmatched by Baranski, Sarandon and Hines.There are lots of wonderful moments throughout the course of this movie and you will definitely be laughing. I must admit that I was genuinely entertained by this sequel.A Bad Moms Christmas is an adequate sequel for what it turned out to be, but it just lacked that special something from the first movie to make it truly outstanding."}, {"id": 223, "text": "The three Bad Moms are facing a stressful Christmas. Amy (Mila Kunis) stops trying to be perfect and then her passive-aggressively perfect mom (Christine Baranski) and submissive dad (Peter Gallagher) surprise her with a visit. Kiki (Kristen Bell) has her way-too-close mom (Cheryl Hines). Carla (Kathryn Hahn) has her wildly outrageous absent mom (Susan Sarandon). Carla is lonely and until male stripper Ty Swindel (Justin Hartley) comes looking for a wax.The first movie was a surprise success and I liked it. I like the chemistry between the three ladies and it's fun whenever they're together. This sequel takes the rule of sequel to heart. They double up by adding the moms of the moms. In so doing, the comedy gets thinner. The three ladies don't have as much time together. The movie is forced to concentrate on each individual mother daughter relationship. There is still good comedy but less of it here. The trio is still good. The grandmothers are fine. It's just too many characters and each one gets less time. All of it adds up to a lesser continuation and a promising franchise failing."}, {"id": 224, "text": "People that are reviewing this with a low score because it wasn't suitable for their youngsters need to learn how the ratings system works. This is a Rated R movie. Yes, it has a Christmas theme but it is most definitely NOT a family-friendly Christmas movie. Put the kids to bed before you watch this one, folks. Having said that, this film doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not. It's an over-the-top bat-ess crazy caricature of the life of imperfect mommies who do their best to make things work in the most imperfect ways. If you enjoyed the first film, you'll really enjoy this one. Kirsten Bell, Mila Kunis, and the amazing Kathryn Hahn (my guilty pleasure) nailed it again. While the first film focused more on their kids, this one took the story to the Mommies themselves and their dysfunctional relationships with their own Moms played by Cheryl Hines (Bell's overly obsessive-compulsive psycho-mommy),Christine Baranksi (Kunis' \u00fcber prim and proper ice cold mommy obsessed with grand illusions of perfection), and Susan Sarandon (Hahn's bar-hoppng gambling potty-mouthed rock chic mom).The pairing of these moms and THEIR moms makes for some great comedy interspersed with some heartfelt touching moments about the ever important relationship between a daughter and her mother....which get interrupted with more foul-mouthed comedy. Overall, it's a great fun romp....FOR THE ADULTS. As long as you don't come in with super high exceptions and just enjoy it for what it is, you'll have a great time with this one. Just put the kids to bed first."}, {"id": 225, "text": "It's not a movie to be taken seriously, it's that simple.When I saw Christine Baranski and Susan Sarandon in the cast I already had a sense of what to expect. The grandmas appear and steal the scene, they actually steal.The duo Sarandon and Hahn were impeccable, the best jokes came from them, together to this Baranski who was in his comfort zone playing a cold character also can get laughs (in addition to dazzled Mila Kunis).Like I said, it's not a movie to be taken seriously, just as it's not worth going to the movies to watch! They are predictable and repetitive jokes, but it can not be said that it is a bland movie.Watch at home, at a time when you really do not know what to do and it sure will be a fun time. The mistake of this movie, for those who watch, may be to create too much expectation, so do not do it, go with an open mind, because I guarantee it is not a low-level comedy like Adam Sandler's."}, {"id": 226, "text": "This is something that needs to be said when reviewing pretty much every comedy out there, but the comedy genre is subjective and many people don't really like when a movie is raunchy just to be funny. That being said, A Bad Moms Christmas is a sequel that improves on the original in my opinion. That doesn't seem to be a very popular thing to say about this movie, but I'm always honest about how I feel about a movie, never letting other critics decide how I should feel about a film. I truly believe that A Bad Moms Christmas is a much funnier, more heartfelt, and more genuine film than the original. Yes, the premise itself is as stale as they come and the conclusion of the movie is as predictable as ever, but if you enjoyed the raunchiness of the first movie, I just have to call it like I see it and say that I had a much better time with the sequel, and I thought the first was fine. Here's why you should check out this movie if this is your type of comedy.The first movie revolved around a group of women who rebelled against the school system, becoming cool moms for their kids and having a blast outside and even sometimes inside of school. Cursing and getting into hilarious antics is really what made the first movie work so well, so all I was hoping for was more of the same, but done with a little more care. Being a holiday film, this sequel deals with having each of their moms over for the holidays and once again having arguments, getting into silly antics, and yes, a lot of cursing ensues. Quite honestly, this movie delivers for fans of the first and actually had a final act that felt a little too familiar, but it was done well and didn't really feel all that contrived to me.There is a much more emotional turn than I was expecting here. Yes, it's a holiday film and it's going to give you life lessons about family and its importance, but I was genuinely touched by a few lines of dialogue, mainly because I enjoy watching these three women on-screen together. I know there's nothing too special about a movie like this, but there have been far worse comedies in recent memory. This year has been pretty poor in terms of delivering a solid yuck-fest, so I believe this ranks among the few good ones of 2017.Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are great players throughout these two films, but Kathryn Hahn is once again the show-stealer here. Delivering hilarious one-liners and being the raunchiest of the group, she really does earn a lot of laughs from audiences. Once again, this is a very raunchy movie and sometimes jokes are overused a little too much, but that's why I recommend this movie to a very specific audience that enjoys the raunchier type of humor or those who aren't offended very easily. If you can forgive the mean nature of many of the jokes here, I think you'll have a good time at the movies.In the end, A Bad Moms Christmas does literally nothing new for the genre, but its raunchy nature, along with a great trio of lead actresses, really makes it a harmlessly enjoyable flick at the cinema. Joined by newcomers Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, and Cheryl Hines, A Bad Moms Christmas makes itself out to be the unlikely holiday treat that I don't think anyone was expecting. Yes, there are many arguments that can be made in terms of how this has a very lackluster premise, but in the end, this film exists to bank off the original film and try to get some laughs out of its audience, and I laughed the entire way through. If you just want to escape for a few laughs at the theatre, A Bad Moms Christmas may just be your ticket."}, {"id": 227, "text": "'A BAD MOMS Christmas': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The sequel to the 2016 comedy hit 'BAD MOMS' is a Christmas family comedy flick. It reunites Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn, in their overworked mother roles. This time they have to deal with their own overwhelming mothers, who are visiting for the holidays, while also trying to put on the perfect family Christmas. It costars Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski and Cheryl Hines, as the three older moms, while Jay Hernandez also reprises his role from the first movie. It was once again written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, and it's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics (unlike the first film). It is another hit at the Box Office though. I enjoyed it slightly more than the original.Amy (Kunis), Kiki (Bell) and Carla (Hahn) are still overworked, and stressed out, especially because it's nearing Christmas time. They become even more overburdened when all of their mothers show up for the holidays; Ruth (Baranski), Sandy (Hines) and Isis (Sarandon). Each of their moms is overwhelming, in different ways, which causes excessive chaos once again for the three young mothers. More bonding, of course, also occurs as a result of their new problems.The film is a pretty routine Christmas comedy flick. The humor is definitely hit and miss (for me at least) as well, but it is more consistently funny than the original (in my opinion). I think largely due to the addition of the three older mother characters, and all of the three veteran actresses give good performances in their roles too (Baranski is especially domineering in her domineering mother role). I also think Bell, Kunis and Hahn are more settled into their roles this time around as well. So overall I'd say this sequel definitely surpasses the original, at least by a little."}], "reviews_amount": 228}
