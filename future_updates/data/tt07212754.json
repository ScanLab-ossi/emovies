The film has genuine humor n amazing exploration of human behavior. It is a bit lengthy but ther is no melodrama or songs. I laughed out wildly when Mark Zuckerberg Mishra's name was called out. The scene wher the fat man's buttocks is on audiences' face while his dick is towards the character Rahul is hilarious. The hospital escape scene is uproarious. Rajkumar Rao with his mullet hair n Mithunda's antics stole the show. The film has one helluva hot babe (Sana) with busty cleavage. Aditya Roy Kapoor's subtle taunt (on media n votes) is spot on. Abhishek Bachan gave a restrained n good performance n his character's bond with the small girl reminded me of Kevin Costner's Perfect World."}, {"id": 1, "text": "If you are really sick n tired of this pandemic situation, then watch this movie it will work as a medicine. Fantastic work by Raj Kumar rao (The Mithun Style), Pankaj Tirpathi (The kaleen bhaiya) and ofcourse ANURAG BASU. People who are saying this movie is ruining our hindu mythology n all kind of stuffs, go watch Ramayana. When people talk about humor, chemistry, story, I want to ask you Do you really understand all of these words? Passing comments is very easy, but Hats off for making a movie specially working in this situation where no one moving out of their house until it's an emergency. So guys stop writing illogical things, do write what do you feel genuinely."}, {"id": 2, "text": "After proving his mettle in the brilliant comedy drama barfi and magical musical drama jagga jasoos , Anurag Basu now ventures in the rarely attempted genre of black comedy in Indian cinema and nails it completely... multi narrative stories are often confusing but this movie has some of the finest editing I've seen in recent times... If you liked Delhi Belly this one's perfect for you"}, {"id": 3, "text": "This movie feels like a movie made on international level yet feels absolutely indian. A movie that has the best of both indian cinema and international cinema. Nearly every actor shines in their respective role. Even Abhishek Bachchan feels good. Most people calling it HinduPhobic are just plain dumb. They want movies to be made in India but don't want them to show indian culture from any perspective. Watch it and judge. It's a 7 out 10 for me. But I'm giving it 10 as I don't feel we should undermine a great effort just because people think it's a nepo product or hindu phobic."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Much needed break from stereotype up-bihar movies that is now everywhere from web series to movie.

We are slowly given birth to its world and what is really special about its film is its execution . The execution is unique and it keeps you hooked to the story . The film is rightly named as Ludo as it shows so many parallels with the board game . The ending scene of the film is extremely symbolic if you think about it . Pankaj Tripathi is just phenomenal in his role . He is calm minded yet violent and thats what i liked so much about the character. His character is much like Bob Biswas in Kahaani . Rajkumar Rao is as usual fabulous with his acting and the female leads did put forth commendable performances . Abhishek Bachchan is truly a gem for Indian cinema ... He has so much potential but yeah he shouldn't be compared with his father cause he is so much different .. overall the film is really good and unique with superb direction from Anurag Basu . Probably one of the best films of bollywood this year till now ."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Genuinely speaking before watching it i was considering it as an average movie, although i was waiting for it since very long.

It's a dark comedy crime caper based on a board game popular in the eastern part of India (ludo - namesake of the movie). 5 inter-woven by-plots with some of the characters interacting with each other is a treat for the mind. Writing and cinematography is brilliant. Acting is superb for the most part except Mr. Bachchan who seems to be stuck in his role in Yuva some twenty years back - not sure why he was cast - maybe his name. Rest of the cast - especially Mr. Rajkumar Rao - is superb. But the hidden gems at unknown side character artists ago have carried comedic yet realistic parts in the movie. The over the top violence like a Tarantino production has been handled masterfully. Mr. Pankaj Tripathy has been sensational. Indian movies had lost this space with Karan Johar NRI targeted big budget nonsense movies. With streaming production houses like NF and Amazon Prime, such movies are slowly becoming the norm rather than an annual exception. Well done indeed!"}, {"id": 45, "text": "This movie has become one of my personal favourites..Just amazing! highly recommended by me"}, {"id": 46, "text": "Feels good to watch dark comedy in bollywood.

They're not important to the movie, but having them makes it more interesting and enjoyable.There are complex intersecting story lines. The screenplay, editing and camera work are generally excellent. The performances by all the actors , even the relatively less known ones, are uniformly good. All these plus the unexpected artistic extras make this a very rewarding watch.The movie does have some downsides. When the climax rolls around it's a big relief, because the plot feels overly stretched out by then. The length should have been cut by at least 20min. The continuous intersection of story lines feels forced after a point. There is a subplot involving Abhishek Bacchan and a little girl, and in spite of the charming performance by the girl, that story line is weak and predictable, and omitting it would have improved the movie.

This is the latest offering by Netflix as their original feature film. Ludo the eponymous board game which everyone as a child would have played. Lately it seems to have caught on the fancy of young and old alike in it's online Avatar. It sounds like an unlikely name for a movie and does aroused curiosity. The movie juxtaposes this game as and with the game of life. One gets excited and is expectant to see something different or new, as for the last few offerings on the various OTT platforms are anything but entertaining or even vaguely logical, lt seems that the makers set out to make something good with the kind of themes and story ideas at their disposal but somewhere in the intervening period they lose their way and the story meanders and hurtles towards its climax. Same is the case with Ludo, it starts out with high expectations as a bearded Anurag Basu (the director of the movie) and his sidekick descend upon the screen with a briefcase. One feels some kind of Gangland exchange is going to happen but they turn out to be the Sutradharas and their conversation takes us forward to a floating Mafia den helmed by Sattu (Pankaj Tripathi) and his wacky gang. We are introduced to four sets of tales which are explained away as the four players of this game of Ludo. Though not interconnected but they keep crossing each other's paths as Sattu is the common thread or the canvas on which their existence hinges and who has the power to control them. The story keeps shifting from one set of players to another, in the process bumping into each other as on the ludo board and inflicting back to square one to each other. It finally boils down to the climax where all the four stories converge on a common ground literally and what follows is that different fate is handed over to different team. Some get just rewards and some just perish. And what about Sattu the unbreakable, the master controller of the pieces he is having a time of his life despite being the villain of the piece so what is the moral of story Live and Let die? Now let's talk about the teams and the characters there in: First, the yellow corner of the board : The Akash and Shruti story i.e. Aditya Roy Kapoor and Sanya Malhotra. A goldigger falls for a struggler and their love story goes viral, it has to be reversed, so who best but apna Sattu bhai who will lend a hand. Kapoor is maturing as an actor but still retains his cockiness. Sanya displays right amount of chutzpah. The ventriloquist doll is the highlight. Second, in the green corner : Alok and Pinky story i.e. Rajkumar Rao and Fatima Sana Shaikh. A lovelorn majnu gyped in love by his paramour is forced at the hands of his heart to put in his all to save his beloved's family in trouble due th Sattu. Is ultimately rewarded by fate. Rajkumar is in top form mimicking Mithun and sporting a different look. Fatima is unable to shake off her pehelwan looks and even as a guntotting moll in minis does not evoke any desire. Third the Red Corner: The Bittu story i.e. Abhishek Bachhan, the loser. Solitarily carry's on to give succor to his friend turned rival who has usurped his family, wife and all from him. Is the only one to be handed tragedy by fate. Bachhan shows absolute restraint and gives a fitting performance as the role demands. Fourth the blue corner is the story of Rahul and Shreeja I.e. Rohit Saraf and Pearle Maaney. It is an unnecessary interlude but the fate is kindest to them as they finally realise their dreams of becoming millionaires a la Lootcase and Waisa bhi hota hai part II. Not much acting to their credit though they hog a lot of footage. Finally we come to the granddad himself i.e. Sattu or Pankaj Tripathi who lives the Gita shloka of being indestructible only here we are not talking about his soul but his body (the soul is forever lost). With guns tied on his thighs a la femme Nikita under his lungi he and his gang act as the irritant louts but also the common thread that binds the narrative. Pankaj is in his usual laid back style and now we have seen him one too many times in the last 2-3 years. It seems he and Nawazuddin are the only character artists and dons left in the industry. Some final observations: The female characters in all the four stories are shown the manipulative ones, even the child who plans her own kidnap has a hardened Bittu wrapped round her fingers. The male protagonists are their saviours, how naive. The movie finale gives us the parting kick as the Director and his sidekick are dipicted as dhan-ta-dan....Yama and Chitragupta, well, well, well......so much for the mytho."}, {"id": 312, "text": "Ludo is that light entertainer which you may not want to miss. The movie started off really well, but felt it lost its way in the middle. The concept of mixing many stories with many characters, adding confusion to create comedy and curiosity is a concept used for decades, but the colourful frames, background music and brilliant editing ensured that a scent of freshness persisted throughout the movie. Pankaj tripathi's smile and head movements are enough to make anyone's day, he is the heart of the movie. Loved performances of all actors especially Aditya Kapoor, saniya malhotra and inayat verma (from where are they getting these talented kids?.) I loved the movie and will go back to it again and again whenever I feel down, just like the game of ludo.

The director then weaves a loose concoction if another 75 minutes, half of which is filled with songs which sound like they've been a part of numerous other movies.

Most of this mocking was lame and had nothing to do with the storyline. For example, a) What was the need to make a mockery of Ramlila? Rao's character could have been introduced in some other way. b) What was the need to introduce the three actors playing roles of Hindu Gods and mock them by making them push a vehicle? How did their presence tie in with the story in any way? This was a straight lift from a similarly irrelevant scene in the movie, PK c) The reference to gaumutra....again, why? 2) The characters of the sutradhar and his sidekick. What were they doing there, spouting gibberish in the name of philosophy? This shows that the director is not satisfied with telling a story and allowing the audience to make up it's mind What could have been a wacky comedy like Delhi Belly gets manipulated into a vehicle to sell a pseudo-secular agenda For that, it deserves 1/10 It had the potential, but sadly didn't deliver"}, {"id": 324, "text": "This is a must watch.

Life is Ludo!Whether you win or lose in Ludo, the ultimate goal for every player is to get all their 4 tokens past round one and to the finish line without being eliminated in the process by the opposing teams. There are 4 color teams which are yellow, red, green, and blue.Each story is coded by color and how the game plays a major role in those stories. The characters from each of those 4 stories cross paths with each other and the cause of that is through one major character, a crime boss named Rahul Satyendra Tripathi a.k.a Sattu.Yellow: Akash Chauhan, a ventriloquist and stand-up comedian and his ex-girlfriend, Shruti Choksi who is getting married in 3 days find out that they were taped while having sex and their video ends up on the internet. Before getting into any more trouble, Akash and his lawyer brother get help from Sattu to remove the video and along with Shruti to find out where the sting was operated.Red: Batukeshwar Bittu Tiwari just got out of jail but is having trouble adapting to normal life since his wife and daughter have moved on. His wife has a huge debt that needs to be cleared by Sattu. Mini is a six year old girl who is fed up by her parent's attention so she stages her own kidnapping with Bittu being the abductor after meeting. Bittu see this as an opportunity to use the ransom to pay the debt. Bittu looks at Mini like his own daughter and develop this strong bond.Green: Pinky suspects her husband is having an affair but he gets arrested for the murder of a builder who was actually killed by Sattu. Pinky takes help from her school friend Alok Kumar a.k.a Aloo, a die hard Mithun fan who runs a diner along with his former gang buddies. She asks Aloo to help get her husband out of jail by first having to pay money to the mistress who her husband was having an affair with so she can give her statement to prove his innocence and takes shortcuts to get that amount of money.Blue: Rahul Avasthi is a salesman who always faces reprimands from his boss and Sheeja Thomas, a Malayali nurse who is often teased by her colleagues for not knowing Hindi. Rahul comes home and witnesses a dead body in front of him. That body belongs to the builder that Sattu killed. He gets kidnapped by Sattu and is taken to his den which explodes in the process. Rahul and Sheeja meet while being transported in an ambulance with the crime boss on the gurney. The vehicle crashes, both Sheeja and Rahul dump Sattu in a lake even though he survives, and flee with his money. So now they're on the run.Anurag Basu as the director and DOP of the film decided to introduce a similar way of storytelling just like his previous film Life in a Metro. Basu's concept is loosely based on the board game Ludo and how opposing teams cross paths.The key point of the narrative was to immediately see the crossing of each story but this one was a bit all over the place. I don't get the idea of one story happening while characters from the other story appear in the background. Cross sequences will just make a story dry and out of context. The dialogues where whimsical and funny which can make the audience chuckle at times but the story was just a slight mess. The predictability of the story grew quite a lot at times but compare it with Jagga Jasoos, this one stands out much more than his previous film. It wasn't on the levels of boredom and this one will keep you on the edge of your seat. It was still a smart idea to use Ludo as a tool to tell a Black Comedy story.There is a specific sequence throughout the film where Anurag Basu is narrating the story of the film to Rahul Bagga through a game of Ludo and walking through each engaging scene explaining the effects and fates of each character.Yellow: Aditya Roy Kapur is potentially getting somewhere and his performance was earnest in a way that his ventriloquism will keep you entertained. Sanya Malhotra was very energetic and humorous but her acting didn't have much engagement. Their love story and chemistry were the achilles heel of the film.Red: Abhishek Bachchan implemented the role of a former gangster perfectly if you take his character Lallan Singh from Yuva but his characterization barely came out and his command of speaking was very low. Inayat Verma performed flawlessly as Mini and she was very sweet and cunning throughout the movie. The bond between both the characters is what saved the narrative but the fate in the end became a compromise. Asha Negi's debut as Bittu's ex-wife still showed hope and she has potential of becoming a good actressGreen: Rajkummar Rao was the true winner of this film and his performance as the Mithun fan diner owner managed to set a new standard. He was funny and he nailed the foul language as well as his dance moves. Fatima Sana Shaikh plays Pinky Jain really nicely and her precision was watchable as a motherBlue: Rohit Suresh Saraf had a very lukewarm performance as a runaway salesman as he barely spoke although he delivered a few dialogues. Pearle Maaney's performance was flat and very ordinary. She spoke a few dialogues in English and Malayalam throughout the film but she failed to add anything.Pankaj Tripathi as Rahul Satyanand Sattu Tripathi managed to nail every aspect in the book. He was dark, gritty, engaging, funny, and stood out amongst the crowd as the best performance after Rao. The Nurse Kutty also performed well who helped in Sattu's recovery as well as developing a romantic connection with him.Music is the only concerning factor even though Arbaad Barbaad is a good track but the standards of Pritam's magic is slowly deteriorating and it is lacking the rhythm to make the album enjoyable.The the song Qismat Ki Hawa Kabhi Naram, Kabhi Garam which was both the murdered victim and Sattu's favorite song. This kind of did add a new vibe to this anthological black comedy.Cinematography was also done by Anurag Basu as well as Rajesh Shukla. They did a good job with the visuals and it made the film very colorful and the serenity was solace.Overall, The only tokens that stay in their spot and aren't playable are the sub-par narrative and Music. The active playing Tokens (Acting, DOP work, Direction, and characterization/humor). This is a game you won't regret! Despite its minor loopholes, this one is watchable.3/5 - Wish this released in cinemasStreaming on Netflix"}, {"id": 337, "text": "This is an enjoyable watch.

But personally I think... It'll be better without slangs"}, {"id": 509, "text": "Thrilling story with interesting twist makes it very engaging"}, {"id": 510, "text": "Ludo is easily in top 10 best film of 2020, the perfect cinematography, brilliant character arcs, script comparable to Ludo game, performances of the cast and music blending with it, Ludo has everything a perfect script would want, except at times it does become too chaotic but yet cannot remove it from my mind. Bow to you Anurag Basu, welcome back!Anurag Basu has been quite an underrated Bollywood director. With his films like Murder Barfi Gangster and Kites he's proven he has what a great storyteller needs. Even Jagga Jasoos could've been a brilliant film had delays and unnecessary script changes weren't there. Luckily Ludo gave him complete creative freedom and he excelled it well as pee required, without censorship and perfect OTT release, perhaps it would've failed in theatrical run but OTT made sure it's a success in best way possible.Cinematography of Anurag Basu and Rajesh Shukla Is the main USP of this film, how cinematography is used to define the colours of Ludo is commendable. The 4 colours representing 4 stories in which all the stories and how amongst them 3 reaches it's final spot while one of them remains behind is exactly how Ludo game is, kudos to Basu for the same. TBH all the stories deserved their own 2 hours long film, perhaps a series itself could've made this into a masterpiece. The track of Bittu-Mini(Red) remains my favourite, really wished the story itself had separate film for itself, it had lot more to explore and give us. Rahul-Sheeja(Blue) track was my second favourite, the innocent love story trapped within chaotic world, quite a relatable content. It could've been much darker and soulful had it received it's own film as well. Akash-Shruti(Yellow) track was a quirky one like a typical comedy and it too deserved its own film, perhaps a road trip comic caper would've made it fun watch. Alu-Pinky(Green) was unfortunately weakest link of the lot either deserved a better story or could've remained avoided one. And coming to Sattu Bhaiya(Dice), his own move and everything changed well, wished more of him in the film.Performances wise undoubtedly Pankaj Tripathi was the main man, in his typical gangster show but more of comedic one this time. Pankaj Tripathi is Bollywood's own God gift and fortunately he isn't lost in the competition but rather giving hard times to others. God forbid but we don't want Pankaj Tripathi to lose his position in Bollywood, or else it'll get destroyed instantly! But as Pankaj Tripathi soars high, it doesn't mean other cast members get overshadowed here. Closely next to him is ever dependable Rajkummar Rao, the best actor of today's generation! Give him whatever role you wanna give, he'll excel it with success. You may or may not like his film but he's always been giving his best shot, irrespective of how badly written script or his character is and even here despite of receiving a bad story arc compared to others, Raj lifts it very well given his naturally blessed acting skills. Coming to Abhishek Bachchan, now I've started to believe he's even better than his own father when it comes to acting. He's always been abused, cursed and mocked for his bad acting skills and to some extent I agree he was a weak actor and didn't get good script ever, but now Abhishek is getting better and better especially after Manmarziyaan and Breathe into the shadows, with more complex roles than his father ever did. His track remains the best of the lot here, especially when he unites with his onscreen daughter tears roll down your eyes and his death makes you cry even more. Hoping to see more of Abhishek Bachchan in the future. Aditya Roy Kapur remains in his usual self with not much improvement and kudos to Anurag Basu to utilise Aditya in his full potential. Although we've seen how ARK can perform well in Kalank and Malang, we've never got to see anything new from him besides his usual happy go lucky self, hope Bollywood utilises his potential well in the future. Rohit Suresh Saraf is the rising star here! At this age he's already excelling will in given Bollywood films he's worked in, hoping to see a solo lead role of Rohit as he deserves the success, cheers to the rising star. Ishtiyak Khan was great in his role too, hoping to see him soar high like Pankaj Tripathi instead of getting side roles only, fingers crossed!While the men have done great job, women aren't lagging behind at all. Inayat Verma was the best actress, perhaps best acting of the lot. Her sweetness and innocence wins over you instantly, especially her track is quite relatable in today's time. Her chemistry with Abhishek would make you want for her more. Sanya Malhotra is another star in making, her chemistry with ARK was another highlight, in which she overshadows Aditya despite being junior to him in experience. After Dangal Pataka and Photograph, another brilliant performance by Sanya and hoping to see more of her in future, perhaps in solo lead. Pearle Manney... she was really beautiful and acted very gracefully, her chemistry with Rohit was another highlight. Only issue was she got very less dialogues or else she could've overshadowed most of the star cast here. Fatima Sana Shaikh has given her weakest performance, she deserved a better role and better acting. While in Dangal and Thugs she had almost matched Aamir here her Dangal co-star(Sanya Malhotra) is taking over her, hope she improves upon in the future. Shalini Vatsa was also great in her role, her short yet sweet chemistry with Pankaj Tripathi would want you long for more. Asha Negi was wasted badly in an uninspiring role, hoped she gets better role in the future of Bollywood.Kudos to Basu for making Ludo possible, just wished it to be little longer in episodic format instead of series. Except the climax did become chaotic and loud, which kinda messes most of the part. Giving 7/10 as the climax kinda messes everything or else a 9 would've been perfect for this film"}, {"id": 511, "text": "Different characters and stories were very well stiched by Anurag Basu.Pankaj Tripaathi was super followed by Rajkumaar."}, {"id": 512, "text": "The way of Black comedy is not easy.

Four different stories who connect each other so well. All four stories are really different and unique.

Rajakumar Rao as Aloo is so great to watch. I couldn't stop laughing when Aloo would start dancing as mithoon. The story of Yellow(Aditya Roy Kapoor, Sanya Malhotra) is a romantic touch given to the entire movie. They actually look so good together I would love to watch them together in future. Blue(Rohit Saraf, Pearle Mane) is a silent story. The story is abit slow and well written but Rohit has done a great job. Pankaj Tripathi in the movie is like the dice. He has the same Mirzapur touch of gangster but with comic trait. The most funny thing is he never dies. In one scene he is thrown of a bridge and he is still alive, then he falls from a dozer and yes he is still alive. In the end of the movie he is hit by a truck and still alive.

There is so much going on that Anurag himself appears as sutradhar, delivering exposition, explanation and also spelling out the big themes the film is grappling with - notions of good and evil, crime and punishment, love, death, murder, sacrifice.

It definitely has Pulp Fiction Super Deluxe and In Bruges Vibes and is a performance heavy film. The actors are just incredible in their respective characters and are perfectly cast. My only grievance with the film is that at the end of the film, Bittu (Abhishek Bachchan) gets killed as I felt that for the character, more than death it should have been love that would have been the perfect redemption for him.

Expect the unexpected in this dark comedy anthology as you do in the case of life or a game of ludo. The characters like players of ludo criss cross and get second chances. Anurag Basu draws parallel with the unpredictable game of ludo and stitches four different stories together to come up with this delightful piece of filmmaking which is a unique experience in cinematic viewing.Various characters get ample opportunity to shine and the actors playing them never miss the mark. Pankaj Tripathi yet again steals the show playing the role of a gangster. This bundle of talent creates an entertaining character with the help of his gestures and expressions. Rajkumar Rao plays the role of a lover who is willing to go to any extent for the sake of his love. He is extremely endearing and stands out with his antics. Abhishek Bachchan gets into his always likeable angry mode and plays the role of a tough guy who has a soft heart with a lot of brooding intensity. He is outstanding in the scene where he meets his daughter after a long time. Aditya Roy Kapoor is a real surprise as he does well in a very interesting character. His voice modulations and mimicry (Assuming they are done by himself) are effortlessly amazing. The leading ladies Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Shaikh also play interesting roles. Whether its Sanya playing a confused character or Fatima a manipulative one they have both done a great job.Pritam creates another melodious soundtrack for Anurag where the songs are seemlessly placed with the narrative. O betaji an old evergreen song has been used humorously in the story. The four colours of ludo game have been used intelligently. The film talks about karma as well as philosophy of life but all in a lighter vein. It brings a smile on your face as Anurag had rightly mentioned in his interviews. Its a mad world created by him and his team where you sit back and enjoy this crazyball comedy like a game of ludo. This light breezy entertainer is perhaps the best Diwali watch this weekend."}, {"id": 1043, "text": "I was pretty excited to see Ludo. I loved the cast and Anurag Basu is a director that puts up interesting and experimental films like Barfi! and Jagga Jasoos that other Hindi film directors don't do.Ludo, like the board game, shows four different storylines and how they all connect by fate.To be perfectly honest, I feel quite mixed on it. There are certain aspects that I appreciate and other choices that frankly annoyed me. It's very rare to see a director do the cinematography for their own film. The only other time I've seen that happen is with Roma directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and I liked what Basu did with it. The use of the four colours in the board game: red, blue, yellow and green are present in the film in many places whether it's to do with costumes, vehicles, lighting or buildings. It made the film look really good and suits the film's title really well. For a black comedy, the dialogues are decent. Rajkummar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi get the best ones and there are quite a few laughs from them.The entire cast do a great job. It's great to see Abhishek Bachchan in a film after a long time. I always considered him to be underrated and he does a great job. He gives a restrained performance and so a lot of emotions come from his eyes which conveys the pain he goes through really well. Pankaj Tripathi is very fun to watch and is great as usual. Aditya Roy Kapur and Sanya Malhotra are great together. Rohit Saraf and Pearle Manney are pretty good as well. Fatima Sana Shaikh and Rajkummar Rao are excellent. I liked the relationship they had with another and is one of the highlights of the film.There were a couple of narrative choices which bugged me during my viewing. Anurag Basu is in the film and serves as the narrator who discusses the film's themes and character traits. It's this choice that really brought down the film for me. I wish he would've let us figure out what the overall meaning and purpose of the film is rather than holding our hand and blatantly telling us. The background score also tells us how to feel during a scene. If something funny is happening, comedic music starts to play which shouldn't be the case as the comedy should speak for itself. The film is also pretty long and I feel it could have been cut down. I don't think the abundance of songs added much and the pacing during the second act could have tighter. There are a couple of special effects used which aren't polished at all.Ludo is a yet another interesting film by Anurag Basu but it has problems that really brought down the film for me. A lot of people seem to like Ludo and you can see it on Netflix if you want. I would recommend seeing Amores Perros and Super Deluxe if you haven't already. I think these films do a better job at this genre."}, {"id": 1044, "text": "#MovieReview #SpoilerFree #Ludo #Netflix #BollywoodAnurag Basu's Ludo is a delightful laugh riot featuring a motley crew of quirky characters that keep you hooked for 2.5 hours.A portmanteau tale of interconnected storylines Ludo has it all-from a resurfaced sex tape to a child who kidnaps herself for attention!Abhishek Bachchan delights as refined gangster 'Bittu' alongside an adorable Inayat Khan as 'Mini'. Sanya Malhotra and Rajkumar Rao also excel in their roles.However, it is Pankaj Tripathi again who steals the show with his over-the-top performance as the beleaguered don 'Sattu' Bhai keeps you ROFLMAOing throughout.His three-stooges like act is as unpredictable as it is funny. Two thumbs up for this whimsical, albeit nonsensical tale.Recommended!"}, {"id": 1045, "text": "Ludo is a comedy thriller told in multi linear narration. It revolves around characters like sattu bhai a gangster, his former aide bittu, stand up comedian akash and his girlfriend shruthi, a theatre artist and hotel owner alok and his ex lover pinki, nurse sheeja and salesboy rahul. How these characters are related and connect together is the rest of the film. I started watching the film for rajkumar rao and pankaj tripathi but it was abhishek bachchan for whom I rooted for. I got hooked with his track after his character bittu meets mini(inayat varma). Their chemistry was heartwarming and a delight to watch. His scene where he meets daughter makes you emotional. Ludo is a perfect comeback for junior bachchan. Rajkumar rao was impressive and I loved his long hair. Pankaj tripathi was brilliant as usual. The climax was not satisfying for me because I couldn't digest sattu bhai who ruined bittu's life in the end enjoying a happy family life and bittu getting a sad death. Also I didn't like pinky killing off her husband as she could get rid of him in other ways too. On the whole, ludo is a very entertaining film which makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Despite being a multi linear narration, one never gets confused. One of the best ott films released during these bad times."}, {"id": 1046, "text": "Ludo review :Two strangers play a game of ludo even as one of them explains the meaning of 'paap' and 'punya' through six unrelated stories which merge together in the climax. Let me attempt to narrate the same through its characters :Pankaj Tripathi plays a bhai who kills a builder and is happy to find some other person jailed for his crime.Fatima Sana Shaikh's husband is that guy framed for the builder's murder and so she approaches her college friend Rajkummar Rao for help. Rajkummar, a Mithunda fan, still loves Fatima and can do anything for her...Abhishek Bachchan is a goon who has an axe to grind with Pankaj Tripathi who got him jailed for six years. He returns home to find his wife married to another guy and his little daughter living in a hostel. Bachchan attempts to reconcile with his daughter at any cost.A little school going girl elopes to seek attention from her ever busy parents. Coincidentally, she meets Abhishek and strikes a deal with him to feign her kidnapping.After their one night stand goes viral on internet, Aditya Roy Kapur and Sanya Malhotra keep searching for the seedy hotel which filmed their sex act.Rohit and Pearle accidentally stumble upon Pankaj's black money and run away with it. His goons are now on their trail..Anurag Basu's ambitiously mounted Ludo is one of the most muddled and confusing screenplays I have witnessed this year. The stories - per se - are actually simplistic and somewhat bland but the presentation is one hellavu convulted mess.Despite the solid ensemble cast, not one performance is worth a praise. Pankaj Tripathi is getting repetitive with his bhaigiri roles. Abhishek Bachchan gets no scope at all. Rajkummar Rao overacts as Mithun Chakraborty fan. Just to clarify, swinging hips wildly is not Mithunda and those who feel so should watch Mrigaya (1976), Agneepath (1990), Tahader Katha (1992) and Swami Vivekananda (1998) to understand his range of acting. Aditya Rao Kapur makes weird faces at the camera. The Dangal (2016) girls - Fatima and Sanya - are strictly okay. As for Pearle, she shouldve chosen a better Bollywood debut than this.Technically, Ludo scores well if we can discount that badly recreated Pankaj Tripathi den. Anurag Basu's cinematography is first rate. Pritam's music is another plus point.Finally, Ludo is yet another underwhelming film from Basu. Gangster (2006), Life in a Metro (2007) and Barfi (2012) are his best works till date. The director hasnt been able to match up to his own standard making highly indulgent cinema offlate.Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."}, {"id": 1047, "text": "Ludo (2020) : Movie Review -Since the corona pandemic and lockdown bollywood audience has got literally nothing watchful that can be enjoyed like a real good film and then some films tried to gain benefit through OTT release. But these OTT releases saw huge drop in number of audience and in quality of films. Now it's fair to say that the new joining in the list is this human anthology directed by Anurag Basu called Ludo. When there were no expectations after goofy trailer, Ludo was unexpectedly looking a clever film and was almost certain to end as an Unexpected Diwali Dhamaka and suddenly last 20-25 minutes pulled it down to join the said elite club.Ludo has multiple stories connected to each other somehow, some way, somewhere and so the plotting settles nicely at the beginning. The introduction scenes of this big cast takes lot of time but not harmful at all due to entertaining and engaging storytelling. Every charcter is established perfectly and almost every character provides some genuine laughters and hilarious scenes. Especially, Rajkummar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi have got some hysterical and interesting dialogues. The rest of the characters are normal yet connectable because of simplicity. Ludo gains more momentum with the narration theory handled by Yamraj and some adult stuff involved in it.Acting wise as already mentioned Rajkummar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi are the table toppers followed by Aditya Roy Kapoor, Fatima Sana Sheikh and Sanya Malhotra. The supporting cast is okay but most importantly everyone has got enough screentime to make an impact. It's the writing of the characters which doesn't show same cleverness to every character, some are blessed with intelligence while some are cursed and totally destroyed. The destruction of characters feels strong in last 30 minutes when they are seen doing rubbish and insensible things.Ludo is 150 minutes long film and still has enough grip to hold you on your seat. However, couple of songs are damn boring and useless which fooled the editor's eyes. Dialogues are too funny and has vulgar touch, afterall it's Netflix and without abusive language they are incomplete. No doubts, the dialogues make you laugh, make you think sometimes even though the presentation of that particular scene is rough. Ludo could have been a great anthology if there was no melodrama and dumb romance because in crime dramas you don't want typical emotions to jeopardize entire smart narrative. Anurag Basu first promises you a clever film set in dramatic mess and then himself makes dumb moves to solve the mess. How disappointing it was to see this surprisingly good film going down as expected before those surprises. Overall, Ludo is just another average flick saved by some funny scenes even though at early stage it was way ahead of expectations.RATING - 5/10*"}, {"id": 1048, "text": "In this age of movies releasing on OTT platforms, very few have managed to intrigue me in the recent past as much as the latest Netflix original, Ludo. Ludo starts off with a catchy opening track (yesteryear legend Bhagwan Dada's famous song), an appealing start and a quirky narrative. The criss-crossing between characters (which is the highlight of this anthology) is observed by a pair of commentators, including the director, Anurag Basu (his second anthology after the 2007 film, Life in a Metro). However, as the multiple characters get introduced one by one with each storyline randomly running back and forth aimlessly, you begin to wonder what is actually going on? This is one of the biggest drawbacks of the movie. The ensemble cast deliver some credible performances - Pankaj Tripathi at his usual gangster-best apart, Abhishek Bachchan, Shalini Vatsa (as Nurse Lata Kutty) and Pearle Maaney (as Nurse Shreeja) really stand out. Rajkummar Rao's Mithun fan avatar is fun while Fatima Sana Shaikh as the sometimes docile, sometimes trigger-happy woman-scorned is a revelation. In the end (and quite often in the middle too), the movie tries to get too preachy - saying everyone's version of good and bad is subjective by ruminating on the concept of sin and virtue, the importance of second chances and the unpredictable nature of life itself! But somehow, the individual tiles do not lead to that all-elusive home and sadly that's where this game of Ludo is lost!"}, {"id": 1049, "text": "Decided to watch Ludo as it had invaded the mindspaces of most whatsapp groups. Here's my take on the movie.Ludo is a cryptic comedy crime thriller by the maverick filmmaker Anurag Basu . The film is themed on the premise that Ludo is life &amp; Life is Ludo. It has four story tracks representing the four shades of Ludo - which are connected by a comic villain serving as the dice that connects the four quadrants of the game of Ludo. The story is delivered in a sutradhar mode - with Yamraj (Anurag basu) &amp; Chitragupta (Rahul Bagga) discussing the philosophy of life and the shades of gray that blur the boundaries of good and bad in the real world. Yamraj - the wise one who understands life a little better in its entirety - and hence is the one controlling the narrative. Ludo attempts to extract pragmatism out of the chaos of life - by looking at it from a distance and by realizing all the coins of Ludo eventually are ordained to reach the center. This storytelling scheme in someways also defines Anurag's approach to film-making in recent times as one sees shades of this in Jagga Jasoos as well. However unlike Jagga which bombed, Ludo manages to keep us by and large engaged. There are times when it does seem to meander a bit, but a quick transition to one of the other tracks helps restore sanity and coherence. If the above description starts sounding a bit cryptic - well that is what the film is - and while it might sound a bit over the top - it is actually not so. Perhaps what works to keep the film adequately engaging and entertaining is the enviable starcast Anurag has assembled for Ludo. The inimitable Pankaj Tripathy as Sattu Bhaiya- the comic villain and the common thread across the 4 colors of Ludo is astoundingly brilliant. Rajkumar Rao (Alu) as the silent foolhardy romantic, committed to pluck the moon if need be, for his childhood love, once again delivers a fantastic character which has the potential to live through the times. I wont be surprised if Sattu and Alu find their way into neighborhood skits &amp; school plays. Abhishek Bachchan playing to his strength as Bittu - a hardened criminal of the past, now in transformation do some good for the sake of his child makes quite an impact with the silent &amp; poignant scenes which are relatively few in this film. Aditya Roy Kapur, Sanya Malhotra, Fatima Sana, Asha Negi, Rohit Saraf, Pearle Maane, Shalini Vatsa create a well hued ensemble by playing their parts as one of the four colored coins in the Ludo of life with measured panache. Despite all of them having a bagful of strong performances in the past - which so often color audience's perception of them (and at times even their perception of themselves!), in Ludo they seem be tailor made for the roles Anurag has cast them in. The film has some amazing shots that define the narrative - across action, romance and plain simple reflections on life. Apart from story, screenplay and direction, Anurag has donned the role of the cinematographer (jointly) in this film - and so deserves a lot of credit for the strong visual impact that gets created on the whole. Despite the fast pace, the intense and somewhat cryptic storyline and a bit of dark comedy thrown in, all credit to Preetam for the music that manages to stand out - in fact it serves well to temper the pace and soothe the chaos which is otherwise overarching and overwhelming, in all likelihood by design. While all the songs are good, Humko Abbad Kar do and Hardum Humdum by Arijeet clearly stands out in the sense that these songs will live beyond the movie. Lyricists Sayeed Quadri and Sandeep Srivastava should also be called out for these two compositions. Overall Ludo is a fascinating weekend watch if you don't try to be too cerebral about it. Most importantly it re-establishes Anurag Basu as a storyteller with a difference who loves to experiment - which in turn hopefully makes this industry richer and breaks the notion that Large Canvas crime thrillersand Larger than Life feel good romantic dramas are the be all and end all of commercial Bollywood.#ludo #ludothefilm #ludothemovie #anuragbasu #abhishekbachhan #pankajtripathy #pritam #arijitsingh #sayeedquadri #sandeepshrivastav #Sanyamalhotra #Adityaroykapur"}, {"id": 1050, "text": "Anurag Basu and entire star cast plus screenplay and plot writer have put together a surprising flix, it is different, it is away from typical Bollywood movies, but it is a creative bundle of intertwined plots and genre. Movie like this is more fun when movie maker intelligently makes you to pay attention to unfolding story.A multi plot story, where each different plot having their own struggles and obstacles and intersecting each other at a time, narrated by two unattached characters while they playing Ludo, talking about life philosophy, and playing dice to determine the luck of characters in movie, and story keeps moving.Movie's biggest strength is definitely its genius star cast molded by intelligent director in to playing some amazing characters, that you need to watch this movie to appreciate their art.No one genre can define this movie.

It's a black comedy, like we saw in the trailer people getting hit by trucks, bus, and what not. Abhishek Bachchan (player Red) is a fun kidnapper who has his own internal battles to fight. One will hate Fatima's character to the core as she never fails to take advantage of the hopeless romantic Rajkumar Rao(player green). The nurse and Rohit (the sky is pink) (player blue) become companions of an unplanned journey and learn to enjoy what comes their way, they are probably the only characters who are happy about this change. Now let's talk about the Aditya's character (player yellow), an optimist and another romantic looking for blind dates on matrimonial sites, just not hopeless and an artist who is enjoying doing comedy shows with his ventriloquist. Pankaj Tripathi is the catalyst/ dice, who sets things into motion and let's the story unfold. Even though you won't see his character with enough screen time, you will enjoy every bit of it. Oh, don't forget the background music Oh Beta Ji, it's a key to this game of Ludo.

The atmosphere reminded of an upcoming doomsday all the time. How would have that made you feel? This is the exact problem I had with LUDO. The storyline of the movie is not about something that kids would relate to unlike in Jagga Jasoos where it was unfolding like comic book chapters and it made sense why it had a particular visual style.Here I get that the visual style resembles the Ludo board but it doesn't suit the narrative at all. If the colours could have been more darker and subtle, the actions taken by the characters could have made the right impact.The other problem with Ludo is the narration. There was no need for Anurag Basu and Chitragupta to tell the audience explicitly that Ludo is life and life is Ludo and beginning of the movie because it summed up the whole movie in 5 minutes of the movie's runtime, after that there is nothing left to wonder or be surprised about because you know that the randomness is corresponding to Ludo's game. Even if you know that...so what? What do I do with knowing that it's all happening like a Ludo game. It would have been interesting if there was no explicit description by Anurag Basu at the beginning of the movie. That explicit narration killed the whole movie's purpose in the very beginning.There are 4 story lines and out of which 2 stood out as interesting to me. The one involving Rajkumar Rao and Fatima Sana Shaikh and the other was that MMS scandal one.

He did the same in Life in a Metro and he did it again.Each character was vibrant and minutely developed and it was perfectly played by the caliber artists. impeccable timing of Raj Kumar Rao and timing of Kalin Bhiya was worth noticing.The reference to the Bhilai wasn't unnoticed as Basu was born and brought up in Bhilai.Overall it's a good film to watch."}, {"id": 1054, "text": "I am very selective about the Hindi movies that I watch but I always make an exception for Rajkumar Rao &amp; Ayushman Khurrana.

So I was not expecting much from the movie and the few word-of-mouth that I heard were not very favourable.I am now thankful that I didnt listen to the haters. Ludo is nothing short of an absolutely fantastic movie. Its not one of those movies that you watch halfheartedly...make a short phone call...go take a piss...and hope to catch up on without missing anything. Its one of those movies that you have to watch intently to enjoy it.I was planning to give up on Rajkumar Rao movies after watching half of that children's movie Chhalang but he has more than redeemed himself with Ludo. If you have ever wondered who between Pankaj Tripathi &amp; Rajkumar Rao is the better actor then Ludo answers than question for you.I have never played online Ludo and didnt get the reference to Ludo but the movie as a whole is fantastic.

A moment of silence to Abhishek Bachchan's performance. He silently creeped into our hearts and made it cry. But it's not just him the other actors like Aditya Roy Kapur, Dangal fame Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Shaikh, Rohit Saraf and with a bit of enthusiasm for the people from Kerala, Pearle Manney.The essence of this movie is the portrayal of the fact that fate has its mysterious ways of bringing things to us that we have always desired. Anurag Basu brought in the aspects of multi-narrative storytelling and the subjects like sin and virtues and second chances. Just like the unpredictable game of Ludo, the director brought the lives of his character into this game. The best part of this movie is the way every part of the story connects well and ends with a good note. This work of motion art will leave you smiling and awed till the end. Honestly in my opinion, it's been a while since I have seen such a good Bollywood movie.If you are having a bad day, make yourself a chai, log in to your Netflix account and give this one a watch.A feel-good, dark, humorous, heart warming movie."}, {"id": 1057, "text": "Ok, I need some extra sentences because there is a lot to say about this film. This was almost going to be another Jagga Jasoos (in post production standard, but somehow it got saved - you will feel like drinking those green juices which will be bitter if the sugar is just a gram less). Editing is super, it does not make you feel that in some of the scenes actors are not there standing together, even kudos to the body doubles. Even camera is, whatever scene transitions and outdoors of beautiful Ranchi and Bhilai, both of which used to be famous travel destinations in the early twentieth century. I loved the songs (listened the jukebox just after watching the film) and liked the concept of making different third and fourth acts (and they have colour motifs too); but all these could not make something GREAT together as this hyperlinks are not new in India where all the different South Indian film industries started experimenting with this format with the respective own local flavours for more than a decade now, and once a while Bollywood gives it a try too. Now, the characters, Pankaj Tripathy (the Die) has done a lot of gangsters already, so you will not get much other than the main USP of the character. Abhishek Bachchan and the kid (the Reds) has a cute segment, and the scene where the parents deciding to keep the maid was so strong that I reacted vocally during it. Fatima Sana Shaikh and Rajkumar Rao (the Greens) gave their fullest, specially the scenes with his hard acting and the conversations with his co-workers. Sanya Malhotra and Aditya Roy Kapoor (the Yellows) delivered as their scripts demanded, and the scene when her fiance came was real as anything. And without having many dialogues, both Pearle Maaney and Rohit Suresh Saraf (the Blues) drew attention from everybody and now I am searching for her filmography in Wikipedia. Just to show off, adapting the rules of a game to a film is done well, and executed in better way, if not similarly massive, to Animal World."}, {"id": 1058, "text": "While we have adored the content of diverse and unique film which were released on OTT this year, we have certainly missed few Bollywood flicks which could have been enjoyed in theaters. Anurag Basu directed comic-caper, Ludo, is one of its kind which would have done wonders if released in theaters across the country.Just like the game itself, Ludo gives you four different dimensions - Bittu (Abhishek Bachchan) who desperately need 90 lakhs to see his daughter and performs a fake kidnapping with help of Mini (Inayat Verma), Akash (Aditya Roy Kapur) who needs to rescue his ex-girlfriend Shruti (Sanya Malhotra) from getting shamed as their sex video has gone viral over the internet, Alok (Rajkummar Rao) who does everything under the sun to help his childhood love, Pinky (Fatima Sana Sheikh), who in turn wants to help her husband out of jail, Rahul (Rohit Saraf), an ordinary salesman whose life turns topsy-turvy when he becomes the witness of a murder and runs away to save his life only to meet Sheeja (Pearle Maaney), a Malayali nurse who does not know a word of Hindi or English. All these stories are woven around a common man - Sattu (Pankaj Tripathi), a local goon, who is the main player rolling his dice in this game of criss-cross.Adapting the same concept of multiple stories with common theme in Life In A Metro, director Anurag Basu (also playing the role of Yamdooth) makes Ludo a complete entertainer leveraged with fun-loving characters, crossing each other's path. As the story involves multiple stories with diverse characters and their sub-stories, it might take some time for you to digest Ludo but once you are in the game, there is no turning back as the players move forward with their own agenda.While the first half is hilarious, the second half loses the focus with few stories unnecessary elongated which could have easily been trimmed. As there are separate stories and their sub-stories involved, it becomes confusing sometimes. Nevertheless, the climax is pretty neat with a good happy ending. Anurag Basu has created a different genre of gangster drama with a pinch of comic relief in the Indian Cinema and just like his previous films Life In A Metro and Barfi, Ludo boast off enigmatic camera work (Basu is credited for it). Art direction was gorgeous. Music by Pritam is soulful. On the flip side, the editing needs attention as the film drags for sometime. Dialogues are superb and hilarious.Though Ludo is a multi-starrer, you will fall in love two characters - Sattu played by Pankaj Tripathi and Alok a,k.a Alu played by Rajkummar Rao. The versatile actors emote so accurately through their facial expression that it is difficult to imagine anyone else in their characters. Both actors are funny, witty, and impressive with perfect timing of body language. Abhsiehk Bachchan was just about okay. The Dangal girls - Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Sheikh are fine in their part. Aditya Roy Kapur is impressive. I liked the roles played by Rohit Saraf and Pearle Maaney. The actor who played the role of lead nurse opposite Pankaj Tripathi was equally good.Overall, Ludo is sure to entertain you throughout the film which will make you laugh-a-loud. Must watch - 3.5/5.Ludo is produced by Anurag Basu and Bhushan Kumar under the banner of T-Series, Anurag Basu Productions and Ishana Movies. Ludo is currently streaming on Netflix platform."}, {"id": 1059, "text": "For once the faith in the Indian Film Industry is reinstated thanks to Basu's ensemble comedy that revolves around the lives of different people and it shows how life itself has a connect to each person existing on Earth. How the serendipity works and somewhere we are all connected within the Matrix. Life is a matter of causality and that's something which is well narrated in the script. It's a fresh break from the mindless slapstick comedy which the whole Comedy genre has reduced to. The slight nuances of each of the characters takes the movie forward in a smooth and brilliantly woven manner, much like the Tapestry of life is woven by the Fates. The story isn't in the magnanimity, the story is found in the little intricate details which have been highlighted in such a brilliant manner that words would fail to describe what a genius mind could think of such things along with having a great observation towards life. The Song opening the film O Betaji to the slight Dance of Sadness really defines how life is Kabhi Narm, Kabhi Garm. Little aspects that only true lovers of art can notice and appreciate. Even though it is categorized as a Comedy, there are layers and shades to each character that makes you feel there's a connect to each of them. Somewhere there's a Devil and an Angel in each of us and that's portrayed beautifully on the canvas. This should have been a theatrical release and it should be running on all other platforms so that it reaches more and more people. Along with that, each actor in the film has given their best, be it Abhishek Bachchan's rawness, or Rajkumar Rao's obsession, to the little Babu's smile and Chiku's love requital to the little girl. Till we have filmmakers like Anurag Basu, the Film Industry shall be running well. It is a film beyond what mediocre minds can fathom as it is years ahead in its approach and execution.

While it does appear gimmicky at times, the resultant cinematography is exhilarating, to say the least. The movie is a masterpiece for those of us who relish the negative side of human nature, but care about the redeeming features in each of our protagonists. The actors are top rate, from Aditya Roy Kapur, Sanya Malhotra, Abhishek Bacchan, Panjak Tripathi, Fatima Sana Shaikh &amp; awesome support cast too. Rajkummar Rao is a revelation in his role as the love-struck break-dancing Anil - to say more would give away the extremely complex but smoothly interacting story lines. The characters are well admirably well sketched out, more creditable given their large number &amp; complicated storyline. The scale and the ambition of the Anurag Basu's movie is breath-taking. It has many twists and turns and remains spectacularly unpredictable and bursting with so many ideas that sometimes you wish that this was a web series instead of being just a movie. Unlike a conventional 4 stories tale that would slowly converge at the end, these stories keep on violently intersecting through out keeping us glued to the action. And did I mention the colors? Bright, vivid and dream-like, almost all scenes are shot in unique innovative cuts. This movie is one of those guilty pleasures that you would want to watch again. It reminds me of Kaminey (Dir Vishal Bhardwaj) and Ugly (Dir Anurag Kashyap) given the characters and their motivations. The movie is full of unforgettable scenes and very detailed characterizations, the killing of the diamond trader is a pivotal moment and it is seen from the eyes of so many people. The dancing scene with the Mallu nurse &amp; Mallu DJ scene is hilarious. I could go on, but it would make little sense until you have watched the movie yourself \ud83d\ude0a! This is not a movie for most people, though, the language, the violence and the non-linear narrative would be off-putting. The characters would appear to be acting randomly at times with little motivation beyond greed &amp; anger most of the times. Yes, the movie is filled with gore and gratuitous stylized violence. It is a little too long at 2h 30 min and some of the ideas don't work - the yamaraj and his crony appear in the start and then mostly at the end - without adding much except playing Ludo. Given the frenetic pace of the movie, the climax appears to be not much more than what has been going on through the entire movie, but it does tie up a few things well.

His comic timing is bang on.The movies also has some very powerful visual comedy that makes you laugh and go rofl. On the other hand in most of the scenes Abhishek makes you feel the emotions of innocence, joy and pain without even saying a single word. And with all that the good music is icing on the cake.

He did a great job all-through. Also awesome work by Pankaj Tripathi &amp; Raj Kumar Rao(one of the greatest at this moment). Even Junior Bachchan &amp; Aditya Roy Kapoor did a pretty decent job.One thing I would add here that people are saying this movie as Hinduphobic. But the actual concept has been lost over the dumbness of the religion-minded audience. When one of the two narrators (Chitragupta) talking ask the other(Yamraj) what is the meaning of sin and virtue, Yamraj narrates a tale of duryodhan from mahabharat being the villain but still ending up in heaven. Then he asks chitragupta where he thinks the characters of Pankaj Tripathi and Abhishek Bachchan would end up? And chitragupta says Abhishek would go to heaven as he sacrificed himself for his family and Pankaj to hell as he ruined a lot of lives. But Yamraj laughs and says no Pankaj is not dying so soon as he still has purpose to be on earth.Hence you see pankaj tripathi in the end credit scene, the movie conveyed that just because you are evil or good that doesn't determines whether you'll die first or go to heaven or hell. The good soul can die early while the evil can still lurk around. It's all about our purpose here.

The stand up comedian Sudeep was aslo seen here and I wished he got a bit more screen time. The movie in itself grasps your attention right from the opening scene. It's definitely worth a watch. Many twists and turns that add up to the gritty writing and holding the genuine script with an awesome casting choice. A Malayali nurse and a goon, or a Malayali nurse and a man caught in the midst of mayhem( both sets being different pair of characters mind you), all the while when the main compatriots are trying to hoodwink each other was an awesome watch. I just hope that more such movies are made now and then. My final say is that movie makers need to really learn from the trailer of this film.

One's pure trash and other's gold heap but the trash gets praised, the heap remains unnoticed.In the confusion of story telling, it seems like the director wrote the screenplay on the way to the shooting spot. Therefore, all the actors are confused in the film. You can take screenshots of various characters in the film and zoom in their eyes, visible confusion.Diversity? One Malayalam speaking character doesn't make the whole film diverse. One coloured cast would've made that. With all these white washed men and women, the director depicts white supremacy through this nonsense drama.There's so much wrong with this series. It's hypocritical, has no proper characterisation like the character pinky - the most unstable character I've ever seen. Her story was prolonged with nil logic to give an already predictable ending. Being an emotional fool, she calls 'that dancer' guy that. Whatever his name might be, his character was also irritating.The so called 'desi' patriots may shower the film with zillion stars but your real patriotism shows up when you not only support your own cinema but also the other cinematic industries and languages in your country. Duck off now."}, {"id": 1073, "text": "#LudoOnNetflix - #AnuragBasu tries to make different films from what the other Hindi filmmakers create.The problem is, he watches movies of filmmakers like Tarantino, Guy Ritchie, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and tries to emulate them. Most of the times he blatantly lifts scenes and calls them as tributes to the filmmakers. Fortunately there are no such high-profile lifts here - at least I couldn't figure out any. But time will tell.Just like in #AmoresPerros - where lives of disparate characters collide in a car crash, Anurag creates a story featuring 4 different story lines and how they all get connected, using a Ludo board game analogy.After all his sophisticated thinking he probably feels that his audience has low comprehension skills. So he goes out of his way to explain the purpose and meaning of the film rather than letting the audience figure out themselves. His presence as Yamraaj and the Ludo analogies are yawn-worthy. The music too prompts the viewer in advance on how to receive a scene - Watch out, this scene is going to get funny now, etc.His skills as a Director of Cinematography are noteworthy - especially the predominant use of 4 Ludo colours - red, yellow, green and blue - in many places.Underwhelming when compared to his #Gangster and #LifeInAMetro."}, {"id": 1074, "text": "This movie either has no script or is a mashup of several scripts. Either way the movie just confuses the audience.I am still not sure if it is a comedy action drama or a drama with action comedy.The characters and events is predictable and shallow. Abhishek Bachchan is at his usual worst.No Netflix movie release is incomplete without mocking Hindu festivals and customs. Ludo mocks Ramleela with a mashup of Bajirao Mastani with a sprinkling of behenc**d. After all Hindu gods and goddesses and our historical heroes are not worthy of a decent show.Just avoid watching this heap of garbage and save your time."}, {"id": 1075, "text": "Ludo is the kind of film that works because it embraces dank humor early on and rides off all the way into the sunset with it. Not just a dark comedy of errors, the four different pieces of Ludo overlap into each other by way of clever conception and scripting. The good thing about it is that each segment holds good as a standalone as well as part of a meshed storyline. This is largely due to several knockout performances we come across in the film's 2.5-hour runtime.Pankaj Tripathi leads from the front as gangster Sattu, who's involved in a big-money deal. Part of this segment also features Rohit Suresh Saraf as a hypermarket employee and Pearle Maaney as a Malayali nurse (with all her innate Mallu-ness). Tripathi truly knocks it out of the park enacting serious stretches laced with plenty of dark humor. Pearle Maaney also delivers the goods with aplomb, never for once overdoing the Mallu gimmick.Abhishek Bachchan plays Bittu, a local thug who's also a single dad. After being released from prison, he wishes to reconnect with his daughter but fate has other plans. Mini (Inayat Verma - gosh, what a cutie!) enters his life, and everything changes. Anurag Basu picking Abhishek for this role makes so much sense given he's the (real-life) doting dad to Aaradhya. Abhishek gets a couple of emotionally charged scenes and he does good on those. The Bittu-Mini duo is tremendously funny and cute.A sex tape begins doing its rounds on the internet, putting old flames Akash (Aditya Roy Kapur, whose vulnerabilities are put to good use by the director) and Shruti (Sanya Malhotra, who seems to be getting better with each film) in jeopardy - actually, more for the latter, as Shruti's marriage to a wealthy businessman is set to happen soon. A segment that's the equivalent of an adult rom-com, the memorable things about it include Sanya's performance and some hilarious moments, especially in the final act.Alu (Rajkummar Rao), a bearer at a restaurant (and a stage performer), still yearns for his (ex) lover Pinky (Fatima Sana Shaikh) who's now married with a kid. The first half of Ludo makes you believe that this is one of the lesser intriguing segments but what transpires in the second completely undoes that. Rao gets more screentime and he shines, as expected. So does Fatima, in a role that requires her to be selfish and always getting insanely difficult tasks done by her ever-willing ex. The pairing is brilliant and this helps elevate the segment to one of Ludo's best.The connective tissue between the four segments - that of gods discussing butterfly effect, grey-shaded humans, and the comparison of life to a game of Ludo (where's the subtlety, bro?) - is the film's weakest element. Even with a COVID mention, this whole expository stretch felt prolonged, pointless, and indulgent. A multi-narrative film like Thiagarajan Kumararaja's Super Deluxe did away with this and it worked wonders for that one. I'd still recommend Ludo for what it is - an engaging dark comedy with a detailed, well-structured screenplay."}, {"id": 1076, "text": "Or at least what these people will say : 1) Political influencers 2) Idiots manupulted by social media 3) Psudo-religious loud people who have no common sense &amp; experience, least of all, knowledge about their own religion! It doesn't matter if they they're formally educated or not. They are essentially brain-dead, regressive populists 4) Automated botsThis movie is extremely Hinduphobic to the point of driving intolerance, but only to these people, who are babies who are not able to differentiate between reality &amp; entertainment, &amp; that too all of a sudden. This is not less than any mass hysteria. Normal, civilised Hindu adults know better &amp; won't fall prey to this nonsense chaotic narrative which is getting on the nerves of sane people. They are following in the early footsteps of radical Islamic intolerance &amp; extremism, which may one day may take the form of terrorism to say the least if it continues.Nothing innovative could be made without these idiocrats ruining everything, but these stuck up people don't even deserve it in the first place, because they can't understand genres, because they've only know one, melodramatic masala genre! This movie will drive them insane because of how finely it's made, instead of promoting the recycled ignorance they like to circlejerk with.The plot is simple &amp; stylistic, &amp; not even challenging, but to these people with below average IQs, it totally could be difficult to grasp the very concept. They are like those lab rats, who'll only react to things that they are trained to be triggered by, while ignoring basically everything else, even the very reasoning &amp; explanation of a scene's purposes. They act as if movies are not influenced by things actually already happening in real life, instead the exact opposite, everytime! Like bad people only exist, because of movies like these, otherwise they're pure of hearts)For normal cinephiles, &amp; fans of dark comedy, this is one of the rare gems from India. Do watch it if you're not easily triggered, because there's nothing Hinduphobic in this, at least not in ways you've probably not already r seen before in school stage dramas!"}, {"id": 1077, "text": "An ambitious Anthology, narrated through five different storylines &amp; contrasting set of characters. Almost in a satirical manner, Ludo as a Dark Comedy; tellingly portrays realistic personalities we get to witness on a daily basis. The format of 'Anthology' though delved into time to time by many creators before, it still remains as 'unpopular terrain', In a dire need of exposure. Thankfully Anurag Basu is there to help.His expertise in filmmaking once again shines through. Anurag's Understanding of cinema has always been unexampled in taste. So is the case with his newest endeavor. Incredibly picturised with conspicuous vibrancy &amp; efficaciously written plot, equipped with a bunch of poignant performances; the treatment here is almost flawless. Albiet a bit lengthier in terms of its duration, the screenplay does a fantastic job of blending all the stories which crosses each other's path on quite a few ocassions.A special mention goes to its brilliantly composed Soundscore. Each Song as a vital piece falls into their designated places, meanwhile also helping the storyline to progress.For these kind of Artsy-Craftsy representations, one would need a competent set of performers. And Mr. Basu successfully managed to assemble so. With his apt direction, he has carefully given ample time &amp; screen presence to everyone for establishing their discrete identities. Having such a supporting presence behind the camera, it always helps to bring out the best in an actor. And that shows here as well. Abhishek Bachchan, Rajkummar Rao, Pankaj Tripathi would be my personal picks from the bunch.My only little gripe would be about its closing message. They tried to convey lifelong lessons through mythological/karma references, however their inadequate attempt failed to reach any sort of resolution."}, {"id": 1078, "text": "UNDERWHELMING ASPECTS :- 40 minutes extra. Didnt remained honest to the original theme and forcefully showing the sentimental elements. putting so many romantic and classical songs which do not suit the dark comedy genre. The filmaker do not remain focused to the original plot and loved the universe of the film so much that he put so many unnecessary things which ruins a beautiful storyline. A storyteller in the film is just not required. Most of the indian audience is intelligent enough to understand whats going in the film. Average acting by the dangal girls. OVERWHELMING ASPECTS :- STORY IS JUST BRILLIANT. The concept to analogy of life to ludo is original as well as interesting. Rajkumar , pankaj Tripathi SHINES. the new actors which i dont know name of looks in form. Abhishek bachhan performaned surprise you with his good acting. Really average acting by the dangal girls ( sana and fatima) Pankaj Tripathi comic timing is the backbone of the film. The characters developed by the writer are really well written. If the filmaker stayed honest with the original theme of the film, this could give competition to pulp fiction.editing and screenplay is really amazing. It is due to director blurred vision we are not able to enjoy the film the fullest. PATHETIC FILMAKING"}, {"id": 1079, "text": "Movie hits a bullseye with its screenplay and acting department but fails to impress with its direction. Directed by anyway basu, ludo is a story of 4 sub stories of different characters which crosses each others paths throughout the movie. Made in some ways like pulp fiction, the snatch, this movie is definitely a very strong attempt which pass in some but fails in most. First thing first pankaj tripathi and abhishek bachchan, great performances by this two guys. Give pankaj any tough role, he will play it so well that it looks like an easy attempt. While Abhishek playing a role of small time goon who comes from jail and just want to see his daughter puts all the emotions in the movie to make one of his memorable performances. Aditya royal Kapoor, rajkumar rao and sanya malhotra are definitely stars of tomorrow, great work by them. All the other actors did a decent role and were looking good in their characters.after such great performances what went wrong is the fact that direction is way too weak, even after having such a good story line, its dialogues fails to make you laugh unless its from pankaj tripathi who can make you laugh on anything. cinematography is average and bad VFX makes it look worse. songs doesn't give anything to the movie, they are boring and doesn't catch you ears. At the end its a great work but not at all the parameters, cameo role played by anurag basu seems as if they did it within 2 hours without any proper script and putting thinking into it which made it look bad."}], "reviews_amount": 1080}
