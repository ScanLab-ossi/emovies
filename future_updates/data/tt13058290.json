It brought me a whole new level of respect and admiration for the girls. Thank you for doing this Netflix . Thank you YG. Thank you BLACKPINK"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Kpop really isn't my thing but this docu has given me insight to what all the fuss is about. The struggles like the genres may be similar across the board but BLACKPINK has such a unique vibe about them and it tickled my fancy. Was it enough to turn me into a solid fan? For now no, but I'm definitely not changing stations if their songs come on the radio and if they have a show I wouldn't mind tuning in either. All the hype by netflix for this docu is justified, enjoyed watching it more than I thought I would."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Just got into BLACKPINK this summer. This doc does a great job showing who they are, where they came come from, and what they are all about."}, {"id": 3, "text": "A great documentary that show their journey from trainee days to today. Good for new blinks who that want to know them better. A lot of surprise clip that we never see. Overall its a good documentary that makes you want more of it."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This is a must watch documentary. Its happy, its sad, its emotional. I dont know what else to say. But im very happy to see them all together like sisters. Bringing stuff for us. This is really inspiring."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Caroline really did a good job in giving us a different point of view of the girls. It showed how Blackpink is not just a band but also a family. It still amazes me how meticulous the process of forming Blackpink and their songs are. No wonder they're huge and global. I can see that they'll be in it in the long run. Also, I liked how they just clicked together as a group. It wasn't forced. Their synergy on screen and off screen are great and I think that's how they work so well together and put off an amazing show everytime. Seeing them work so hard to get what they want makes want to conquer the world myself. They just give you that kind of power after watching them. This was a great documentary for anyone who is really into music. And I mean like real music. And the journey you have to go through is amazing yet very challenging. I would recommend this to aspiring musicians. It gives you that determination to be successful like they are. Good job Caroline!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "I was worried that this would be a promotional, highly curated view into Blackpink's career - but it really felt honest and genuine. The girls show a lot of emotion and don't hide the fact that their job really takes a toll on their health and personal lives. I've never been a Blackpink super fan, just listened to some of their music, but I gained a ton of respect for them after watching this."}, {"id": 7, "text": "They all went through a lot and after watching this I'm much motivated than before, inspired to do well in everything. They are great and worthy to stan i'll never regret supporting them"}, {"id": 8, "text": "One hour 19 minutes not enough for me, if can I want like this every year.

Love it!"}, {"id": 10, "text": "The first thing that comes in my mind is how can someone be sure of what they wanna do in life at such a small age, Lisa being the center her, just at 14 you know what your life should be like. jennie having the most training years, jisoo knowing nothing but exceling in every aspects, rose respecting music. I mean this is so inspiring . This is a huge slap on all the haters, they worked hard and so are here Love you BLACKPINK Also here comes your new fan I m stanning them now yikesss!!!"}, {"id": 11, "text": "Yeah...BLACKPINK is indeed the revolution. I've been following these girls since 2016! The documentary was soo good!! Now i feel like to watching all of their performance videos available on YouTube!:)) I tried my best to hold my tears, but eventually i failed (ofcourse). The direction, editing... everything was sooo perfect! Thanks netflix, thanks BLACKPINK for this amazing documentary!!"}, {"id": 12, "text": "This is the second time i have seen this awesome music title like this after Sky Tour Movie. their visual are so beautiful, 4 members all live very simply and emotionally. I like the way they guide viewers through each level of emotion. Hopefully BLACKPINK will gain more and more success on their career."}, {"id": 13, "text": "New Netflix documentary, brings in 90 minutes a simple documentary, its only challenge is to leave (viewer) stuck on the TV screen, the documentary for those who are already a super fan of Blackpink should not bring much information, but for me it is a very good one for a documentary with a simple idea of introduction the Blackpink group, when the documentary explained the trajectory of the girls without worrying about the time to explain, it was there that i really connected with Blackpink: Light Up the Sky. A competent documentary with your proposal, if it appears in future awards may have a good chance."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Fantastic representation of show business and how to get there through these hard working, beautifully talented women. I was blown away at how hard these girls work for their dreams and fame. I did have moments of frustration watching how they had to separate from their families at such a young age. The women really are extremely loving, caring, devoted, talented pop stars. I have much respect for the hard work and perseverance they endured to reach their goals and stick to them. Each member shared their struggles but they all seem to come together and relate with one another, lovingly. I have to admit, I did cry watching this movie. Great watch if you love inspirational pieces and of course, BLACK PINK!"}, {"id": 15, "text": "Never know how hard k-pop is ..till now I wish these girls find their true happiness after all and be pround of what they doing now.

Can you imagine 14-15 years old teenager work for 12-14 hours a day and just got 1 day off in 2 weeks? Oh god. I give all my respect to blackpink for their work hard, their amazing Music. I never like KPOP in my life. I am 40 years old and I feel I am too old for KPOP things. But blackpink! Their vibe, their unique, their attitudes, something I can't deny. Good job blackpink \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc85.

Their awards, popularity, trends, great music are all well deserved. They have come this far because they keep themselves on the ground. They respected each other's artists and companies that makes kpop well known. That's what artists attitude should be like. They respect everyone and acknowledge them. I know this is just the beginning. They will achieve more because of their passion and attitude."}, {"id": 30, "text": "These girls didn't just gave us their music, talents, skills, and what they performed on stage. But what I love about them, through watching this film, they gave us their almost whole story and journey of their life. And that is so genuine. I love how it begins and don't want to end it, that I would rather want to look for more and know more about them. It just gave me the vibes while watching, of that feeling like I almost know them since they started. I was touched and inspired by their authenticity and being genuine of their passion and hardworks. I'm so proud of them. Keep it up and stay healthy despite of your work.

We understand that if you want to pursue your ideals you have to really stuggle and never give up whatever the obstacles are."}, {"id": 32, "text": "A documentary that is well-packaged by Caroline Suh, apart from me being a BLACKPINK fan, here I see from the side of the audience who doesn't know anything about them. At first, I thought it was like in a documentary that I watched before, I thought it would only make the audience just feel their sadness, but beyond my expectations, Caroline showed their journey which inspired me from their hard works and behind why they worked hard, which made me happy too, seeing that as Jisoo said .. not everyone can be what they want and destined for it, regardless of their job as an idol, but they are so happy when doing it, that's why what they present to their fans is so conveyed with sincere, because they do the work they love, and they like what they do. I think, this can be watched by anyone, from all people, not just for a K-pop fan, because as Jisoo said music is universal, it's not about who .. it's about what they want to convey to listeners. I hope they consistently provide positive content like this to all people. Well done BLACKPINK and Caroline, it's really a blast."}, {"id": 33, "text": "79 minutes become 3 hours when watching this.

At this point, they're really incredible with their talent and also with their music. Jennie, Jisoo, Ros\u00e9 and Lisa have their own style and character. Thank you Blackpink for exisiting!

It's no wonder they dominate the world now. At 14 I couldn't even commute on my own! While they'll already taking the steps to make their dreams come true.The story is an inspiration to all aspiring artist. Talent is not enough.

I didn't know I could love blackpink more but then I watched this documentary. It was so real. More please."}, {"id": 49, "text": "I really really liked this documentary. The way they talked about themselves and talked about how their other members helped them in their times of need is amazing. Jennie is usually shy on outside , but always stays well determined inside. Jisoo always takes care of the other members and don't show her vunerable side to others so easily. Rose wants to write and compose songs , but she's so shy about it whether we like them or not. And lastly Lisa , the smallest one of the four and also the stage killer one too. She always creates the positive vibe around her and always motivates others. I loved you guys since starting my graduation , I love guys now and I will love you guys forever. Wherever you are and whatever you are doing , if you ever feeling down or get lost track , don't ever forget that we BLINKS are always stay with you , love and support you Girls \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc97"}, {"id": 50, "text": "It was so beautiful to witness both the good and bad that make up their story, both the struggles and the successes.

They were never going to give up."}, {"id": 53, "text": "A peak behind the curtain of the biggest musical act of this generation... This documentary feels a little bit like an introduction to new fans, rather than an in-depth exploration for actual fans. It is fascinating to see these extraordinarily talented girls, behind the scenes, from discovery to debut to worldwide success. I just wish it had dug deeper. Perhaps that will come in a film a decade from now."}, {"id": 54, "text": "For years i have been Stanning Kpop, BLACKPINK is my BIAS.I really liked this documentary. Their stories can warm your heart and inspire a lot of people to fight and work hard to achieve their dreams. how they got recruited as trainees to how they keep up with the idol life. YOU NEVER KNOW. How they struggle and tears pain,Why do they get so much hate? They worked so hard.their work, dedication, and love for each other that they were able to rise up and become the global stars they are today. Their success journey shows why they deserve this success.THANK YOU FOR NOT GIVING UP,RESPECT. they're the biggest kpop girl group!

I like that there's a segment where it introduced each member and tells tge story of each of everyone"}, {"id": 63, "text": "We don't get to see a lot of blackpink offstage, and even them talking about themselves. I was surprised to find out I relate alot to Jisoo and jennie, especially to Jisoo. Being the outcast of the family and being called ugly/monkey is nothing to feel good about. I knowing how big in success and how beautiful Jisoo is now truly inspires me. Blackpink are my inspiration and motivation to keep going.

It will enlighten everyone What is K-pop?, How the group formed?, to know them individually and as a group. That even though each has differences they are powerful as group.

It's really inspiring, not limited to their industry but to everyone who have dreams that you can make it possible with hard work."}, {"id": 65, "text": "A nice way to learn more about Blackpink! Every member shows who they are and their struggles becoming a star. Worth a watch or two ;)"}, {"id": 66, "text": "The documentary is exactly from what they world needs to know who BLACKPINK in reality are. As the director Caroline Suh said This documentary humanizes the girls by totally tossing away their image of cool, badass and rich and showing the real BLACKPINK - 4 girls with a dream who left their countries and hometowns to do what they love the most - sing. It shows an exclusive footage of their trainee days and personal interviews with the girls opening up about their real feelings and emotions, their bond between each other and the obstacles they needed to go through to be where they're now. Watching this made me admire and feel proud of BLACKPINK even more than before because everything they do is filled with nothing but love and respect for music and their fans."}, {"id": 67, "text": "Very inspiring and motivational movie! It makes you think about how one decision can change your life in so many ways.

Starts a bit squeaky for me, but the transitions and story-telling as it goes on, it gets better, then ends with a very satisfying ending. Speaking as a BLINK, this is what we've been asking for years! You will be very proud of what they've come. Overall, I definitely would recommend this even to non-fans. A watch worth your time."}, {"id": 72, "text": "This documentary showed that it's not an easy journey for the 4 girls that came from 4 different world to achieve their dreams.

I love the girls so much"}, {"id": 75, "text": "For me personally I have always felt a bond between the girls of BLACKPINK. By that I mean I never put them down because just like many other Kpop groups they've gone through struggles, training, and a point to where they felt they needed to give up. This documentary just shined a light in the shadows that they had hidden away from us blinks. In some sense I feel that I can relate to them because just like us they have emotions and a life that others don't get to see. And seeing them talk about how they struggle made me realize they're human just like us. They're a group of girls trying to make a great change to the world. No matter what as a Blink I'm always going to stick by them. The film made me cry in some parts because thinking about it I'm not ready to grow up and I'm not ready for them to either. In a way I'm not ready for our girls to think about having a life that isn't related to them being BLACKPINK. But no matter what and no matter the decisions they make. I know that forever and always blinks will be there for them just as they are here for us."}, {"id": 76, "text": "A documentary about 4 different girls that happen to create a new atmosphere of music not just in their country (SoKor) but to the whole wide world. This documentary not just focuses on their humble beginning but also how does kpop started being global. What charm does this 4 girls have to be loved by many people, moreover, people who is not into kpop before (like me). They've change my view into this genre. And even though I already watched a lot of videos and blogs about them, this documentary really did gave us blinks an insight on their personal hardships and in depth work etiquette. This documentary really is a bow down from us fans. My love for this girls grow deeper and deeper and as always, so proud of them."}, {"id": 77, "text": "Congrats to everyone who's been part of the documentary! So good!"}, {"id": 78, "text": "This was such a beautiful and well-shot documentary - from start to finish. It captured such authentic moments and showcased BLACKPINK in a soft and natural light. We got to see the real BLACKPINK and I couldn't help but relate to them even more. They were honest and real throughout this documentary. This just proves how hard these ladies had to work (and continue to work) in order to get to where they are today - at the top. I'll definitely be watching this again and I would strongly recommend this documentary to others!

We get to see more of each of them.-I love Rosie's Australian accent so much.-Jisoo gets her makeup done at a shop and asks if she lost her baby fat. The makeup artist says she did and Jisoo says she should eat ramen tonight. She wants to keep that youthful baby look.-Their predebut videos...I've seen them on YouTube and it gives us a glimpse of them before BLACKPINK, when they were children.-Their outfits, particularly the ones in the YG predebut dance practice videos and Coachella looks TOO PERFECT - their bodies look so sexy-Jennie working out and explaining she gets sick easily was insightful.-Jisoo's hair in this one clip where they had a rehearsal looked perfect - so much volume.-Teddy Park looks so cool. He is this cute guy who was a K-pop member. He now produces every song of BLACKPINK's. So talented. He wears a mask in the film.-Lisa speaking Thai sounds just so cool.-Jisoo says it is hard because when they aren't working she feels she should be. When she is her body needs to rest.-It feels like they are being chased - what should we do now after finishing something.-Coachella was perfection. Lisa tells the audience she thinks she will remember this moment for the rest of her life.The girls talk about the reality of being idols. At their last stop on their tour Rosie says she knows they only see what is on stage and not so much of behind the scenes. She tears up and Jisoo dabs all their tears away.These four girls are such good role models. Lisa talks about her concerns about being a good enough role model - she reminisces the first time she went back to Thailand and everyone wants to be her. All the members are so kind...you can see it in their eyes and facial expressions.Another thing I can take away as well is to HAVE FUN with what you are doing. I want to try this with everything I do.One of the members says even if they grow old and get replaced by a younger generation, if ppl remember them and how brightly they shone, that is all that matters. They sit at a restaurant together at the end and talk about what life in their forties will be like. Married definitely, kids maybe. Or Rosie says they can marry later in life."}, {"id": 88, "text": "I was so excited watching the documentary that I was looking forward to it. It is incredible to see that side so human, so vulnerable and so humble of them, that it reflects how BLACKPINK has changed our lives in such a short time. This is their month and they are breaking everything, and that includes all the records they have and to have; her Album is a marvel and is a world trend. And everything they have achieved they have earned precisely these years based on every drop of sweat, tears, effort and teamwork. I LOVE to see them together as the REAL SISTERS, because that is, ONE FAMILY; just as we are for them.

It also shows their determination to succeed and find their feet in the music industry. The blackpink girls come across as genuine, funny and quite frankly, adorable. Ros\u00e9's creativity and perfectionism shines throughout the documentary as she shares vulnerable moments of herself in the studio. Jennie, comes across as shy but well spoken. She walks the audience through the struggles she's faced and leaves you with the strong impression that she's a hard worker, dedicated to her craft as well as nurturing those around her. The youngest member, lisa, is a ball of sunshine, not just to her members but to the viewers too. Her smile is contagious but throughout the documentary she portrays multiple versions of herself, first as an exceptional trainee, second as an icon and inspiration to people across the globe and third, the member whose happiness holds the group together and keeps them motivated through difficult times. I was particularly fascinated by jisoo, she's reserved and quiet, Teddy refers to her as street smart. She looks as though she is always observing everyone and constantly thinking, she's careful about what she chooses to share. It's very obvious she cares for the members and supports them. One of my favourite moments is seeing her open up about her injury at coachella, unknown to fans at the time of her performance, and yet she fights through the pain to deliver a spectacular performance. Jisoo, is a person who hides her pain to be other people's strength. What is evident throughout the documentary is the love, strength and unity of blackpink. It's not your ordinary manufactured group, it is far more organic. From their first meeting, they clicked so well and seemed to move as a pack. These four women have now almost spent 10 years of their lives together, and that unity is reflected in their joint desire to see blackpink succeed.

There are a few things about this doc I really liked, but there were also some significant cons.First of all, I really fancied the way they made the members look way less 'perfect' than they are portrayed in other media. You get footage of studio sessions, live concerts as well as footage from their time in training. This made the doc feel much more genuine than I initially expected, and makes it a must-watch for any hardcore Blackpink-fan.Another pro of this film is that they definitely don't glorify the k-pop industry. These very charismatic girls tell many a tale of the insane work-hours and other struggles that they experienced in their training and their touring schedule. I found it quite interesting to hear about the insane training facility these girls were in, fighting against very difficult competition and working 28 days a month for 14 hours a day; for YEARS on end.I missed a bit more of this critical view though. The industry itself is extremely commercialized and competitive, and instead of exploring these very serious downsides of the industry, these are only briefly mentioned. I would have liked the doc to have explored these negatives much more, but i guess that wasn't possible (don't want the production company to get a bad rep). The harsh reality of the K-pop industry shines through the cracks of this documentary on occasion: The girls sitting around after a recording session, them crying on stage because of their homesickness and of course their stories about missing out on so much of their childhood and adolescence.The biggest flaw i had with this doc is that it doesn't really go in-depth on any part of the story, and generally lacked a storyline or purpose. I don't feel like i learned a lot about the K-pop industry, nor do i feel like i really got to know this group that much. This film would have benefited from a much longer runtime. The 80 minutes don't give enough time to explore the many interesting facets of this group and the industry as a whole. We get an introduction to each of the girls, get some recording and touring footage, then, before you know it, the credits are already rolling.Overall, i would 100% recommend this movie to fans of Blackpink or K-pop in general. There is a lot of interesting footage of recording, touring and the chemistry between the girls in general.I believe this movie is much less interesting for people that have no knowledge on the subject. I still enjoyed my time watching it, but there for sure are better music-documentaries out there.Overall i'd score it 7/10."}, {"id": 148, "text": "I really loved the way the members genuinely portrayed their feelings, their deep emotions, fears, insecurities, happiness, euphoria, all emotions.

Their lifestyles are just unimaginable and so far fetched. But with Blackpink's documentary I did not feel that at all, as a matter of fact some cases presented are very relatable. They are just normal girls who loves to have fun, goof around, be cringey, do silly stuff to amused themselves and just wants to do their best with their work. They don't pretend to have this extraordinary glamorous lifestyle. It's so different considering they're very young and they don't act arrogant that exudes 'I made it and this is how fast I became famous'. I have followed older celebrities who acts like that which is opposite to BP's way 'we don't get it into our heads'. This documentary shows them as human beings, and personally they are very reserved and values their personal space. It's very deep for them to talk about dreams, passion, reality and struggles. The show humanizes them in a sense that it's really heart warming and something fresh to witness right? Also the way they answer is that they're very articulate of expressing what they think.Also I want to point out their friendship. It's more like a family thing where they don't necessarily need to be bestfriends. They bicker, fight and argue too like sisters. They tease and be savage against each other and also respect individual's time off.I love that they didn't cover too much of their personal stuff and added any drama. They highlighted how they persevered and did not give up from a hellish training and the pressure to meet people's expectations. Their tenacity is extremely one of a kind, you can't just have the fighting spirit without the hardships that came along first. I am so happy for them and all that they have achieved. They deserve everything that they have now."}, {"id": 150, "text": "I was really contemplating about giving a review or not but I felt like I needed to share my opinion as a blink. So here we goes, I wasn't really a fan of KPOP, I swear. Idk why, maybe because I don't understand it. But one time, I was scrolling on Twitter and accidentally saw BP. The tweet was kinda controversial since BP was stopped in the middle of their performance and they were sent home, I think. However, I started stanning Blackpink fully in the year 2018 where they released their hit song D4. It was a cultural reset. Like every neighborhood in the Phil just jammed in that song. And that's the beginning of my fangirl life. But it wasn't easy because BP doesn't released song regularly. Like you have to wait. Lol. Sorry, my back story was so long. Going back to the documentary, I always think highly of BP that I neglect to see or perceived them as human like behind the spot light they were daughters, a sister, and a friend to someone. With this documentary, we learn to appreciate more and accept them as a person who also dream, work hard and sacrifice something to achieve whatever they have right now. And I hope more people see that. And most importantly, Blackpink doesn't only give me music, they gave me an experience I'll treasure for the rest of my life.

As a Blink, I really enjoyed it.As a human being - I'm so proud of these 4 girls, standing for what they want, working their hardest to achieve it and being the powerful girls they are - I have nothing but love and admiration. You girls deserve everything you have! Keep motivating Males and females Around the globe with your awesome work and talent! Keep Lighting up the Sky!!!"}, {"id": 155, "text": "I'm not a BlackPink fan but I enjoyed this documentary. If you don't know about the Kpop industry or you are just starting to get into Kpop then you should definitely watch this. It's very informative with what you have to do to get into the Kpop industry and how hard it is on Kpop idols, the Kpop industry is very different and isn't anything like what you have to do to become a singer in the west. Each Kpop company is different too so it's interesting to see what YG is like. Since I'm not a fan I actually surprisingly liked seeing the journey the girls went though from being kids to debuting!!Good starter if you are only just becoming interested in Kpop since BlackPink are such a popular group, have very different and interesting music and can also speak multiple languages, they are a very watchable group. For any BlackPink fans obviously you're gonna wanna watch this documentary!!Netflix definitely need more Kpop releases!!! Enjoyed this documentary, it's very well made. I do wish they could have put more performances in though but at the same time it's not a concert movie (Netflix get on with releasing Kpop concert DVD's please!!!!) :)"}], "reviews_amount": 156}
