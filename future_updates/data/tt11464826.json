{"name": "The Social Dilemma", "titleId": "tt11464826", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "Just a reminder to the Netflix that using fake acting, suspicious background music and unrelated video clips DO NOT make documentaries more effective but cheapen them and make them less believable. Over-dramatizing the topic just puts the documentary into a storylike place where its unrealistic and undermines the seriousness of the topic. They all have cheapened the message. Next time, keep these in mind, please.Reminder: There is a clip of Hong Kong protesters pulling down a utility pole. The narration suggests this incident is related to 5G. It's not. The incident took place in the Kowloon Bay area, where a new traffic surveillance system was under test. The protesters believed the system was used to monitor protests. It's nothing to do with 5G."}, {"id": 1, "text": "It's partly unbelievable a documentary like this has not aired yet. Albeit not perfect in execution - the acted part is underwhelming - it is a definite eye opener and should be watched by teens, parents, entrepreneurs, politicians and everybody else."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Please do yourself a favor and watch it.Social media is not only scarring self esteem, making people question their self worth, causing dissatisfaction in life, increasing depression and suicides at an alarming rate but now has transcend past to more dangerous territory. It is now altering behaviour and changing the perception of how people perceive this world rigidly than ever at the expense of attention that is being sold.Democracy is being toppling around the world, political divide is higher and more extreme than ever, false news is spreading faster than the speed of light, citizens are on the verge of civil war.This is bad and I can see it, I just didn't knew social media is responsible for it."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I'm in my 60's. I am at the age when I have seen this coming for years. Since the internet came along it was a marvel. Wow, we could buy things, sell things, look up things, communicate with others, amazing.Fast forward with social media. Everyone is a arm chair critic. We all scroll to the comments first. We like Twitter, Instagram, I got away from Facebook posting but, I still go on to see what others post, huh? As I have heard before, social media is the toilet of the internet, it is.This documentary is explaining what us old people have been seeing with younger people being totally obsessed with screens. Kids are growing up with phones attached to their hands not fully understanding what the meaning is behind likes, emojis, thumbs down and criticism. We sit back and watch as people are staring at, talking to and being totally engrossed with their devices. I use mine to get help if I brake down in my car.I right now have been cut off from a friend of 40 plus years because we don't agree on politics. He will not talk to me right now. My sister sends me daily emails of her point of view on who to vote for. My neighbors phone beeps constantly with notifications coming from everywhere, hard to talk to her.I have no children and I'm glad now because of the way the world is spinning out of control because of the media spoon feeding us whatever it is that we choose to watch, crazy. I feel for people out there that are trying to raise their children with ideals and morals that help them grow into responsible, humble, trust worthy adults.This documentary is very important for everyone to watch and wake up and realize that so much information out there is either fake or false and our personal information is being sold. Please look at what is happening in the world. We have come to far as humans to let the social media bring us to our knees. As Senator John Tester said, I will be dead and gone by the time this all comes to fruition. I get that and I have said it many times."}, {"id": 4, "text": "A must see. Even these movie elements are important, becausevthey show exactly what happens, if you interfere with this system.

Is that because it was a one sided documentary (which it was) which always makes for a much more persuasive argument? Also, did I only watch this because it appeared on my Netflix Home page, and is this just because Netflix knows that I like these types of documentaries? If so, then I feel like I may have been manipulated by the technology and that this could actually be fake news, however if that is true then the arguments contained in the documentary are true which makes it real news. My head is spinning, it is too much for my simple brain. I think I will just go and check my Facebook page to make sure that people still like me."}, {"id": 6, "text": "A documentary should be just that.

What's fueling this endless hate... man this movie Nailed it !!"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Its not a documentary about the harmful effects of social media. Rather, its a much detailed insight on the business models of these companies. May be, some of the outputs are unintended consequences and interestingly, the documentary interviews the people who had designed and put such systems in place first. One of the best insightful documentary on Social Media. Must watch!!"}, {"id": 10, "text": "After watching this (ironically after seeing it plastered all over twitter) I felt abit violated and felt like a break in social media was well overdue. I did just that but after 24 hours 'THEY' turned the dials just like how they explained they do for periods of non use by the user and just like that I was back in the game. The most disturbing bit for me was the phrase there are only 2 industries that refer to their customers as users, the illegal drugs trade and tech companies and I thought then that if you think about it, they both create addicts then profit from the addiction. A very clever and thought provoking film."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Truly eye-opening piece about social media and its effects on our world. The only quibble I have with it is the scripted portion of the show, which was unnecessary and distracting.Show this to the Gen Z'ers in your family, which will, of course, cause eye-rolling and Ok, boomer to roll out of their mouths. Still, maybe it will hit home with them eventually."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I got off Facebook years ago! I never missed it. Shortly afterward I deleted all other social media platforms. I don't watch main stream media news either. I do my own research into EVERYTHING!! Social and MSM are huge problems in the world today. Lies lies LIES!! This documentary is just a peek into what they're really doing to our society. I applaud these men and women, who have been there from the beginning, now realizing the huge problem that is social media and doing what they can to educate us. They're pulling back the curtain begging us to see. So open your eyes and see!! Then tell everyone else. They only way to change, starts here. Thank you for an honest documentary!"}, {"id": 13, "text": "After hearing so many people speak so highly of this documentary I figured it must be revelatory. It isn't. If you know how social media is monetized, how the algorithms are used to manipulate your emotions, and how echo chambers works, then you will learn nothing new. Also the interwoven movie scenes were silly and juvenile. They seemed to mostly serve and filler to make this feature length because otherwise it would've been 45 minutes."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Its very deep.I think we all know postive side of social networking sites that why we all using them.This documentary reveal ugly side of social media in very deep manner.It's not like all the documentary that's show only surface level of information.Must watch. 100 % worth your time. You will going to shocked definitely."}, {"id": 15, "text": "To be honest I struggled to watch the entire documentary. While watching, I thought it was a commercial rather than what it should be. I'm not arguing documentary should in a way that it used to be. Taking a new step in production isn't bad but they were more focused on making it filmic or up to Netflix standard rather than focusing on the content. Here the documentary fails to impress persons like me because all those things they ere saying aren't new to me or at least to a person who know what is the worldwide web. The exaggerated cinematic visuals made it more like a staged performance rather than real facts and the funniest part is that they made fun of every other social media except themselves. If it's a genuine production, they should include a session about things inside Netflix too. after all its a social media platform!"}, {"id": 16, "text": "This film explores the cultural changes in society created by social media, as told by experts in the field and often the actual creators of the platforms themselves.Both eye opening and unsettling, the film details the growing monetization of the human attention span. Remarkably unfiltered, the film is an absolute must watch for anyone who finds themselves at a loss with the direction the world is going.There are some dramatizations in the film which should have been left on the cutting room floor, as they detract from the essence of the interviews. But other than that, a great film."}, {"id": 17, "text": "I scroll twitter a lot.. after watching this documentary I went to my twitter feed and guess what, there was a Chinese state affiliated account on the top of my feed that was saying something bad about my Indian army.. and that actually provoked me to respond.. and I just saw the same thing in the documentary.. it's real.. the facts shown in the documentary are too damn real.. I just uninstalled twitter.. Now I realize that how many precious hours I've wasted just scrolling through the twitter feeds to trigger my reward centres in my brain.. I thought that I was a part of political narrative that will change my country but unknowingly I was dancing to the tunes of these big social media marketing tactics.. Seriously I'm done with social media.. and thanks netflix.."}, {"id": 18, "text": "We all know the benefits of social media, and maybe we all have an idea about their issues.But a lot of people, are not aware how really big these issues.If it's up to me, I would even recommend it in schools, people must get their eyes open to the other side of the coin."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This is a documentary demonizing technology with exaggeration and hypothesis.Perhaps this documentary is targeted to people who do not have the ability to make decisions and filter information.The documentary promotes the assumption that people are weak minded and incapable to control what they see, hear and in general...technology. Fake News was not born with the internet. It exists since the first humans communicated information in a way that served they own agenda. They had Fake News in ancient Greece, they had it in the middle ages, they had it in WW2.Most people I know have control of what they see and do on line. They can investigate if something i Fake News or not. It just takes a bit of reading, clicking and time.Near the end, it is promoting that idea that technology and global exchange of information and ideas between individual people is bad. That technology may cause the end of civilization and civil wars (in the US). Is there an agenda here? Is it a good thing to distance people? Is it good for individual citizens to stop communicating directly and form relationships over vast distances?Of course I am located in Europe. Perhaps this is a documentary only targeted to a US audience where people are affected differently for some reason beyond my comprehension.Personally, I have been using the internet since the Beginning of internet! I have never been addicted, misinformed, isolated, missed dinner, sold something I did not want or gone to war with my neighbors. I even decided that I don't really need a smartphone because I get enough internet on my pc so I am only using my mobile phone to ...talk.So, I give this mockumentary...a 2!"}, {"id": 20, "text": "They try to address a topic that most people who use social media have a notion of what happens. They make a veiled criticism of capitalism (as if they themselves do not benefit from it). In addition to being extremely biased. The examples are always from right-wing parties and not even addressing the victimhood generated by groups like themselves and who always blame the system or others for a human problem. It could be a great documentary if throughout it it was not visible how much is a super biased political propaganda."}, {"id": 21, "text": "This film is very confusing but also makes perfect sense at the same time. The idea is that we are all fighting against AI every single day through our phones, and it keeps dividing us as a society. It is a perspective I have not come across and I think the execution of the film defining the problem is excellent."}, {"id": 22, "text": "I knew I was in for a documentary-drama on the dangers of social media and its excesive use (abuse). In an age where no teen is left behind of this new tools of conformity, one can't leave any tone unturned, especially those of us with kids. Very eye and mind openening in regards the traps and methods used by large social media companies to shape us and direct us toweards their goals.But the discerning mind can't help but notice the left wing tendency of the documentary. They were doing very well on the pyschological effects of Instagram on teen girls' self esteem when all of a sudden we are ralking about tumbling democracies and, oh, surprise, influencing elections. The second third of the documentary is all about politics and Facebook. They lash out on Zuckerberg's social media, when in fact Twitter is far more toxic and dangerous.While I do too belive that we are more divided than ever as humans, of course, the filmmakers very thinly accuse Facebook and Russia of dismantling democracies. They just never mention Trump because they are too wise.So they end up doing the very same thing they accuse the social networks of doing. Trying to influence your thought and ideas about politics,, but now via Netflix (who, mind you, employ some of the very same tactis social media use to keep you hooked).Finally they get back to the psycholigical and emotional effects of the abuse of SM, and suddenly it ends with the best advice of the whole movie: Delete your social netwoks. Especially Facebook, they said."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Under the control of Faecesbook, PooTube, Instascat, S*itter et al - these farmers of the digital age, the owners of the abattoirs, where your mind is removed, rewired and reset.Great documentary about your lack of self determination and what you can (must) do about it."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Not telling me anything i don't already know or that hasnt been brought up a million other places, adds nothing new to a (admittedly important) conversation. i do not recommend.

Agenda driven elitist corporate propaganda presented as the opposite. The irony is too hilarious. Unbelievably wealthy people telling you what to believe, because you're too stupid and poor to figure that out for yourself. It's so awful it plays like a satire of a Michael Moore film."}, {"id": 26, "text": "A limited hangout. Quite clever really. Top executives and engineers of these systems of control tell us: oops, we did an oopsie! Let's turn the bad Internet into good Internet instead! We promise!. So instead of using a 'bad' system of control, they propose a 'good' system of control to 'keep society from falling apart'. As they constantly say, 'it's not the technology that's bad, it's ho it's used' so somehow they are trying to convince us they will use it better from now on.No mention of economic or political dimensions to peoples real lives, somehow everything is just because of social media. Ridiculous propaganda."}, {"id": 27, "text": "This movie is a major step to save mankind. It should be aired on all schools. I am not kidding.

I feel like this is the third version of the corporate control theme I've seen this decade."}, {"id": 29, "text": "Eye-opening documentary. 10/10 for the content 7/10 sidestory 7/10 sidesketchesBut 10/10 as whole because of the content. This will hopefully lead to more of this type of documentaries, the world really need this now."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Lots of good and eye opening messages in this documentary. The show explains how subtlety and magic is used by tech to get our attention and influence us, however at the same time there are subtle biases in play throughout the documentary. A few examples: early in the documentary they explain how if you enter in climate change is in Google, depending on where you are the search results will be different, however later 2 of the people being interviewed express very urgent climate change messages, including one who said it was an existential threat.They begin talking about government intervention to disrupt and overthrow democracies, using an example to Asia and slowing and subtlety use Russia as an example clearly implying while not explicitly stating the US was a victim of this same influence.The overwhelming majority of the news clips sprinkled throughout the documentary were from CNN. Would have been nice to see clips from other sources.There were lots of depictions of angry protests, specifically the anti-vaccine movement which I feel was an easy target. Also it depicts the 2 main dramatization actors accidentally walking into these protests and then wrongfully thrown on the ground by police, which I feel further feeds a all protests are peaceful and anti-police sentiment.Finally there was a lot of undertone of demonizing capitalism and profits as the enemy. Most of the people interviewed were former executives of take your pick social media company who say the solution to the problems is more tech but humane tech.My suggestion is to watch the show with a grain of salt, lots of positives and messages to take away, but the whatever change you feel is needed from those messages and takeaways should be actions you make from your own personal choice and not this Animal Farm istic notion that only the tech before us is bad, but not the tech and regulation this new round of tech suggests."}, {"id": 31, "text": "I am witnessing war within nation, war within family, war among friends. There is no accident in this world. All bad things happened were intentionally or unintentionally created by man. By foolish men. Foolish smart men and foolish rich men.

I always thought there was something wrong. But it wasn't until I realized that the creators of Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. sells personal information to launder money. It bothered me when I realized I was addicted to social media but I went cold turkey and deleted them all. Good message, good exposure. I like this Doc. Just didn't like the made up scenarios of AI bosses just show the facts. A visual isn't necessary of the people in charge of us. The evidence will speak for itself."}, {"id": 33, "text": "The documentary is interesting until its half, then it falls for an endless progressive advertisement.Interesting that Netflix and the Silicon Valley crowd create a documentary with that content in a time when countries are turning to the right.The creators of this manipulation system are the leftists of the silicon valley.

The dramatisation parts were totally cringe worthy."}, {"id": 37, "text": "I'm not writing very often a review. But this title deserves one. This is a must watch title! This documentary brings 100% on point what the challenge nowadays is. Even tough the social dilemma is only touching the surface of this subject, I still believe for many people this will be an eye opening documentary. Not many know about the system that the big tech industry is implementing and using. And what I personally like it's not trashing the technology that is out there. It brings on point what is currently wrong with what we have and what we need to change to improve the current system. As well the subject is simplified enough that not only tech geeks will understand this. It is good explained and made understandable for everyone out there. I can only highly recommend this movie. Go watch it and be amazed!"}, {"id": 38, "text": "I find it funny that a documentary that touches on the dangers of misinformation through social media could give such a biased documentary.It certainly does a thorough job of illustrating some of the potential (and very valid) problems with social media, but misses many other problems and importantly glosses over some of the benefits of social media. It is a complicated subject that really would've benefited from being a series with each episode touching on different aspects of the debate. Instead we ended up with this feature length opinion piece.I also take issue with the narrative that we need legislation to regulate what is allowed on social media sites, as it is a major threat to freedom of speech and will do nothing to stop the propaganda machine that has lasted for as long as humans have existed. I think the best takeaway from this information is to teach the public to be critical thinkers and emphasize the fact that they need to fact check and look at differing viewpoints, rather than staying safe in their own echo chambers. This mindset will better serve people in real life.In summary; while the problems illustrated are based in reality it doesn't offer a complete picture, and the solutions offered are one sided. It felt more like an opinion piece than an objective documentary..."}, {"id": 39, "text": "What could possibly be scarier. To realise that those technological dystopias are already there, controlling our world and feeding us almost every single input that gets our attention. Of course i heard a lot of what was discussed in this documentary before, but seeing it condensed in an hour and a half with -almost- no distractions made the nightmare very real. At least, real enough to delete my facebook."}, {"id": 40, "text": "This documentary features a biased, neo-luddite perspective dressed up as some kind of concealed truth.

If you already knew that, you shouldn't watch this 'documentary'.Netflix always does this: Take any social problem or injustice. Exaggerate it, repeat it. Invite woke activists as experts. Make them say stuff like ''if you aren't paying for it, you are the product, billionaires, taking away democracy, reprogramming your brain. And voila, you just shocked the majority in the age between 14 and 19.Don't get me wrong. Tech companies have too much power and invade our privacy.

They spend 3/4 of the show building up the idea that social media is wiping clean the free will of everyone. Then they drill down to the Hillary driven narrative that Trump won the election through mass manipulation. Transparent as can be and an obvious pre election tool to try to stop people from seeing the truth and going back to just ignorance. If it wasn't for the internet we'd think that Obama was a hero and Hillary is pure. The internet is why we know sleepy Joe has dementia etc. Such a slow buildup but as soon as they said Russia effected the election by their social media posts, I turned it off. That boat has sailed we know they spent a total of 100k and half of that was after the election. We ain't that stupid. The fact that they're so scared of Trump is exactly why he was and will be elected.

As other reviewers said, it is a few years late as this documentary should have been released when social media was really taking off. As a new parent, it made me think about the times I chose to look at my phone instead of giving my attention to my son. But it also scares me thinking that one day, my son would want a smartphone with all the negative consciousness that unfortunately will follow. Technology is an amazing thing. And as an optimist, I believe that all the tools created by the technology weren't meant to be used in a nefarious way. Perhaps is our human nature. Or the need for these technology companies to financially outperform their previous quarter. My only criticism is Russia. Even though it has been proved that Russia didn't affect the results of the 2016 US election, the documentary actually makes the point that it did.

I fear that it's too little too late to repair the incalculable damage done to our societies by social media and the intolerant, overly entitled and ultra sensitive millennial generation that it has bred.

The testimonies are from heavy weight people in the industry, such as former presidents or chief engineers of platforms such as Facebook, Twitter Pinterest or Google, who use a coherent and (apparently) sincere speech, unlike some documentaries I've seen where former employees talk trash just because they were fired. It is an awakening of minds to modern slavery to which we are subject, which limits our thoughts and actions, and which molds us to the image of what enhances the profit and enrichment of a group of capitalists. I like how the first part talks in general about the SoMe and the second part talks more directly about how these platforms affect elections, public health and can start riots or even revolutions under false statements."}, {"id": 54, "text": "Right after watching this I deleted my Facebook account.

You listen, then as the movie continues bit by bit you recognize it's just controlled opposition. They never really dig into what the problem is, they just feed you with some known stuff. For example, they start mixing in #PizzaGate in a way making it sound fake without proving it to be. They do the same thing with many other topics too as the movie progresses. In the end you realize, it's nothing but controlled opposition. What they reveal anyone who spent some time on Youtube, Google, Facebook or Twitter will know after a couple of days scouring the platforms. In the end it's just liberalism with a better haircut."}, {"id": 59, "text": "This movie has the ability to make real changes in our habits. It did for me - I spent the last 24 hours deleting social media accounts. If you haven't yet questioned how internet companies work, how opinions are changed, minds manipulated, human behavior predicted and monetized, privacy invaded, now is the time to think about it. The added fictional story was underwhelming, but the whole documentary is just remarkable."}, {"id": 60, "text": "Bad movie. It is designed and executed the same way conspiracy theorist propaganda is created. Some facts, mixed in with sensationalist nonsense. \ud83d\ude44 Two party democracies leveraging all the tools they have available are creating the division. Media companies like the social media companies are tools. The fact is, it is the archaic political systems that rely on the masses to decide who rules that drives division."}, {"id": 61, "text": "This is not a documentary as it looks at a single side to the issue and tries to manipulate the audience into their point of view. It is poorly done propaganda. Even Nazi propaganda 80 years ago was better done. Not surpringly they omitted discussing Netflix , which is arguably the single most manipulative, capitalist tech company in the US."}, {"id": 62, "text": "This documentary has some good and illuminating stuff in it - definitely things I didn't know about in terms of the mechanisms of social media AI and how it attempts to manipulate human psychology. However, you could say that, rather than being a new and uniquely evil force in the world, that social media is similar to other, long established things that people can get hooked on and be driven by in some way. Booze, tobacco, hamburgers, hard drugs, sex, sweets, movies, music, etc. are all manipulating things. Social media is like mental junk food.Personally, I'd say it is always for the individual to take responsibility for what they do. The best that can be done is to ensure there is information available about the potential negative effects. I've never been on Instagram, snapchat, or twitter, and use fb sparingly, sometimes delete for several years. It is a balance thing.The participants in the movie are making out that social media is causing social division - but there's always been division and civil war. FB didn't cause the American civil war, the french or Russian revolutions, the Maoist takeover in China, Nazi Germany, etc. Fact is, the internet is incredible if used in a considered way. Before internet it was just tv and newspapers setting the agenda - still driven by advertising and other distorting factors.The overall gist of the film seems to be about having more government regulation and so on, but as ever, that's going to be broadbrush, and fine only if one agrees with the selected controls. There were also some other, I'd say, left wing political points thrown in alongside the interesting psychological observations, such that there was a degree of manipulation going on of the sort they were accusing social media of. I suspect Netflix gets up to the same sorts of tricks in different ways and this might be one of them. The dramatised parts were also somewhat hammy.Perosnally, I'd prefer to leave social media largely as it is, but maybe have more of a health warning about the potential psycholigical effects, but otherwise leave it to the individual. Responsible parents probably shouldn't let their kids have smart phones and so on, based on what we now know.The film is worth watching but should come with its own health warning."}, {"id": 63, "text": "My first attempt to watch a documentary came with something which is very disturbing yet very very important.

One of them suggested not clicking on YouTube's suggested videos which so mightily dumb because who hasn't benefited from discovering new high quality content of interest with YouTube? If you keep getting trash suggestions, maybe you are the problem, not YouTube.And that goes with social media. It is as good as the society using it. If society wants to believe fake news, then fake news will be the prevailing content. If they love the Kardashians, then you get freaking Kardashians. But if society like science, facts and discovery of truth, then social media will accelerate that.In a world without social media, a fake news believer won't buy newspaper, the Kardashian lover won't buy a Michio Kaku book.

The doc takes pains to appear politically balanced, going so far as to depict the Extreme Center as its bogeyman, but the film fails to see its own biases. If, as the film contends, social media is manipulative and damaging particularly to young girls, then why not simply tell them to turn it off/not join in the first place? The film *assumes* social media is a necessity that needs to be nerfed for our protection, without ever questioning that assumption. Later, the lead interviewee says in passing, We need to get rid of populism. Which is richly ironic, since most of the population - be they Trump or Bernie supporters - would vehemently disagree. The doc derides fake news and disinformation but *never* mentions social media's left-wing leanings, which is amusing given that there are almost no right-leaning social media companies and it clearly explains social media's recent censorship of the Hunter Biden e-mail scandal.

Unfortunately, Netflix have muddled this idea (as their documentaries so often do), and it gets hidden behind the horrible set pieces used to more clearly explain the idea to the less perceptive. I have a feeling that this documentary's success is less a result of it being mind-blowing, and more a product of Netflix's offensive marketing campaigns.One of the main premises is that social media is not free - at least, not in the way you think it is. Companies like Facebook and Snapchat are essentially selling you (the user) as a product, something to be bought by marketing companies in an aim to sell you their products. This is not as shocking a realisation as the show seems to suggest, but may be food for thought for some people. More concerning may be the outlined detrimental effects of social media, its use strongly correlated to self harm and suicide in teenagers and even younger ages.The real insight comes from the experts speaking, and how blatantly they talk about social media's dark side: they all know it doesn't further their lives at all, but cannot resist logging on day after day. Their pleas for people to delete online accounts is somewhat dampened by the documentary's awfully staged examples of social media's effects (kids smashing boxes to get to their phones, failing to function without access to the internet etc).I get what the creators were going for, but is there any need to make it so obvious? If anything, this detracts from what a documentary is really supposed to do - impact a viewer for more than 5 minutes after they finish watching.

The young boy from Santa Clarita Diet with the three tech guys influencing him virtually was silly. As for advertising on the platforms or whatever I just ignore them anyway.

I really do respect the opinions of the producers and the interviewees in the documentary. I just wish that both sides were shown in the documentary. It was one-sided. I just don't think that government regulation is a good thing for any industry. It always brings in great barriers-to-entry and kill any competition and give even more power to those in charge at the larger companies. That's why Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that he wants more regulation for all tech companies.

It has the opinions of many professionals of the tech industry and, in some cases, statistical data to support them. Former executives of these corporations, computer scientists, physiology doctors, and well-respected university professors will give you an insight into the overall problem that social media presents. By the end of the film, you will not be as ignorant as you were before watching it. It makes you self reflect on your usage of social media and how it's affecting you individually, and how it's affecting everyone as a society. Graphical illustrations are generally good for supporting the dilemmas that the writers are discussing.On the other hand, some of the dramatizations feel a little extreme for what the argument is proposing. The overall sentiment of the film is also not completely clear at the end as you cannot fully understand whether it's tragic or optimistic. It makes you question yourself if we still have time to do something about it or if we are all headed towards a tragic, unchanging future.Even though credibility is its strongest attribute, it certainly is not perfect, as you don't see much of the other side of their argument. For example, we don't see what other executives and professionals of the industry have to say about the issue even though the documentary claims that social media makes us disagree even more with a different opinion than ours by hiding them on our feeds and recommendations. Yet, the film is basically doing that by not fully exposing the opposition to its arguments. Also, when discussing the social platforms that are causing the problem, Netflix is conveniently left out of the discussion. The documentary claims that division arises among us by not having the same content displayed for everyone in a social platform. Instead, they show us what we are more likely to keep watching regardless of whether the content is appropriate or not, or whether it's fakes news or not. Yet, Netflix does exactly the same with their suggestions tailored for every user with a focus to just keep you watching.Overall, I'd recommend it to watch to anyone with an interest in the subject.

We, the people, have the power to choose and to change, but first we should build awareness. Why do things have to come so hard? How bad things must get til we perceive a way of change? How long must we wait? Internet has been given the power to amplify human ignorance when It could have been otherwise, so how do we stop It?

Using a technique that I've not seen before, the filmmakers weave dramatic footage in among the interviews to tell a companion story that works pretty well on its own.

Might be a bit on the melodramatic side for the subject matter it discusses but no matter, I won't delve into the psychology or try to pretend I understand any of it.What is evident is that these companies are vying for your time and these applications are addictive. The message is to reclaim all your lost time(In essense your soul). My own obsession was slowly becoming a mix of Quora(A bunch of nobodies proclaiming wikipedia articles they had quickly summarised), instagram and twitter. Half an hour of scrolling here, half an hour of scrolling there, what harm??It's easy to associate with the issues mentioned in the documentary. It's also evident that people's opinions are generally supported by google searches. I've relayed people info which they look up briefly on google to immediately have a solid stonewall opinion without spending more than ten seconds researching the topic, this is frustrating on many levels. One can no longer have an informed conscious conversation with someone else's educated and considered opinion. Instead you can only have an informed semi conscious conversation with Google.On to Branded, a Russian film made in 2012 that has struck me as having a greater sense of clarity and foresight having watched the social dilemma, like, wow, they just hit every nail on the head, the time consumption, the mindlessness of modern consumption, even the great big leeches!! And the most exciting brand war ever put to screen!! That film did not quite have the nuance to pull off the same message perhaps, or maybe just because it was Russian it doesn't make it onto our algorithms? But If I had one complaint with the social dilemma it is they should have just screened clips from Branded in place of the 'subtle' Dramatisation they have here!"}, {"id": 217, "text": "I've seen before the rich women hug a tiny pet dogs with one hand, doing anything with the other hand. It's almost like their tiny-weeny pet dogs have become a part of their bodies, an extension of their hands. Now it looks different, everybody got a cell phone in their hands 365/24/7, their eyes doesn't look elsewhere but focus on that tiny screen, no matter if they're taking a dump, across the street, sitting with their loved ones, at the airport, on the train or bus...they just concentrate on that tiny cell phone screen and completely lose themselves. The most ridiculous scene I've seen was those illegal immigrants when they tried to sneak into their destination country, some of them still kept looking at the cell phone screen. I just don't know if they could still be afford the wireless service charge. To me, it's not the social dilemma, it's the ultimate simple-minded stupidity of the 21st Century!"}, {"id": 218, "text": "It shouldn't be a shock to users of social media that the platforms are manipulative, but if the idea never entered your mind, this documentary will go a long way to convince you. It actually gets scary when you hear the developers of the software and algorithms that comprise one's social media experience state that they won't even let their own families use it. That's probably a stretch because as we all know, there's potentially good and bad in just about everything, but when it comes down to the wire, it's money that makes the world go round, and the monetization of sites like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Twitter suggest that one only exists to become a paying customer. Call me naive, but when I learned that budding programmers can immerse themselves in a course designed around Persuasive Technology, it sent a bit of a chill down my spine. In other words, there's a behavioral science that maintains as it's central tenet the ways in which these technologies can separate you from your money. There's also the very real danger of polarization whereby one is bombarded with clickbait that feeds off of prior keystrokes and web visits. It's actually a bit surprising that this film currently airs on Netflix because one would associate it with the usual suspects mentioned in the picture. After all, as soon as you finish watching this film, you automatically get suggestions on what to watch next. Come to think of it, you get 'More Like This' on every IMDb title page."}, {"id": 219, "text": "I did like this film, but of course I did have a few issues with it. To the point of where I just felt annoyed that it kept going in the same direction the whole time. The monetization and way that people spread information around for destructive use isn't anything new to me, I've been aware of this for a long time now at the point even though many in my same age group aren't as well. But the way that this film played was that it was supposed to open your third eye or something like that, and judging by all the people who gave this film a 10 it obviously worked!False rumors would exist without social media, and the documentary does point this out at one point too. However, the composition of the entire film just focuses on the negative aspects of the whole process, and very little on the good things spare for the beginning and end. It's even more amped up with the scripted segments too! I was absolutely blown away by how unintentionally funny these scenes were, where all of them play out exactly like a mediocre Saturday Night Live sketch. I would not be surprised if you put canned laughter over it that it would blend perfectly.To shed even more light on those segments, it just portrays everybody as being easy manipulated and belligerent. Where the daughter is SO addicted to social media to the point where she has to forcibly break open the container that has her phone after spending a minute away from it is over the top. The boy becoming depressed in a relationship and turning to radical politics? Both of these cases do happen to teens, however the path that's used to convey this would make it seem to a na\u00efve parent that this will definitely happen to my child. This point of thinking is just enforced by the ending where all these tech insiders are talking about not letting their kids have social media or sitting down to talk with them about how much time do you think you want on the screen? How is a kid supposed to know how much time they're going to spend using a device? They could be doing something completely different each time they use it, and it acts more like a loaded question.For the points that this film was looking to get across, I would say they did what they set out to accomplish. Talking about Pizza Gate and conspiracy theories was an effective way of doing it. Putting all these key players behind designing some key components of the experience lent to it's credibility a great deal as well. Talking about this misinformation in this way would suggest that everybody is mindless and will just believe everything at face value. A lot of people do, but they don't realize you shouldn't believe everything you're told. People will lie to you, whether they know it or not. Could be a fact or news they heard from a connection of people and think it's truth, but the people who it's fed to don't think any deeper about it or say to themselves is that true? This isn't a new concept now, it's been like this for years even before social media became popular, but it's just been amplified (again, to the documentary's credit of mentioning this). We don't live in a world where you can do that anymore reliably, always try to fact check, especially for important events.The way it concluded was a good way to wrap the whole experience up. I wasn't expecting that kind of humility where one of the people they interviewed mentioned it's not all just doom and gloom. Where these people reflect on the cause and effect of their inventions, specifically the creator of the like button on Facebook. Like he said, there's no way that anyone could have predicted that's how it would be used. You could say the same thing about the algorithm, which is treated like an evil contraption is this piece of work. Which when they explained it it just gave me the thought of yeah? are you going to tell me something I didn't know?, that's how recommendations work! The program they wrote is like having a real person tell you about it when they say oh, you like this? well you may like this too and then give you a sample of it. The train of thought this sparks off for me being portrayed in this film is The Matrix, which unfortunately the film creators were thinking of the same thing, as well as the people they interviewed.When they explicitly mentioned that, it made me cringe. Even worse is when the inventor of the infinite scroll said I had to stop myself from using Reddit, turning my non-smile into having an even lower chance of enjoying this film more. The general sense of thinking all of a sudden made sense when these two parts came up, it's the Reddit mindset! Where the general consensus of people who use the website is mostly dedicated to consuming media generated by these very same corporations they're criticizing with glee (trust me, I know. I used it for 7 years). Focusing on the horrible aspects all the time, talking about the world devolving into chaos as well. It's a literal echo chamber without (pretty much) no room for thoughts outside the hive mind of group thinking. Considering all that into effect, that's what this movie felt like. An enticing part of intellectual enlightenment or something pleasing, which is ironic considering the whole message of the film is to get away from that. Made the whole experience fall flat for me when it was all said and done.If you managed to read all that above to get to this point or you just skipped to this point to get the verdict, it's a 6. Do I recommend it? I guess if you know nothing about it, it's a good place to get a start on understanding what goes into social media.

The movie claims social media gives the impression of different versions of reality. However, there is no single reality or truth. There never was. That's why humans invented norms and rules as pillars of socity. A consent of values everyone with common sense understands and adaptes. That's what we need to focus on. While learning a new way in handling social media: Ditch the phone and spend time with our families, have a talk and really listen, enjoy a walk and really be in the moment.

Some key takeaways are, delete your social media apps (could go further and deactivate or cancel your account altogether), turn off notifications, and (I don't believe this was explicitly mentioned), turn off location tracking (unless an app truly requires it). While the movie did an excellent job of explaining how we are all being presented with our own set of truth, and how this is dividing people, the following aspects of the movie were either unnecessary, biased, and hypocritical - gaslighting conspiracy theorists (a.k.a., Pizzagate), COVID-19, climate change, etc. The point of the movie is to expose how social media is presenting topics like these in a biased manner-yet the movie does the same thing.

I've been shaking my head for a long time wondering what has happened. And it seems to have happened within the last 10 years. I could never put my finger on it or why hate has grown so much in society. Now I understand much better. It's subtle and insidious, because you can't really see it.The news and posts I see on my timeline are completely different from other people. Social media sites set you up to get the news you agree with. Not other points-of-view. If you're prone to lean one way in politics it will post according to that leaning. If you're prone to conspiracy theories, it with send you tons of conspiracy theories things. It even uses geography for certain areas that tend to have a certain leaning. You could live there and be on the verge of thinking differently, and then go to look something up and everything comes up for the popular leaning in your area, instead of different views. So then you end up going with the popular leaning in your area.I'm guessing if you're a protestor that wants to stand up for justice, or against things in the world that seem wrong to you, that social media will send you every single perceived wrong thing that happens, and that you become a person that goes out and protest all the time on many different issues. On the other side of the coin, if you lean a certain way opposed to the issue people are protesting, then social media will send a ton of things that imply the justifications for protesting is all wrong, and/or there are billionaires that are paying people to protest. It becomes confused as to who has the right facts and information. Nobody talks anymore. People are being bombarded with more-and-more post validating their points-of-view so-much-so that each side thinks the other is stupid and/or evil and they don't want to hear different opinions that don't match their own. I mean, there's a certain satisfaction when you see post-after-post of things that suggest you are right. Nobody wants to hear that they are wrong. That's human nature. The technology that social media uses totally takes advantage of that.I was already aware of the manipulation of likes and shares etc. It gives a false sense of validation and a feeling of being popular. I have had all my notifications turned off for years. Sheesh, they're annoying, especially the little bell ones. I don't interact a whole lot, especially as I find that time-consuming when I have other things to do. I use and old type of flip phone. No internet on it. When I got my first cell phone several years ago, I only ever wanted just a phone, not all these extra things. I have text messages enabled to receive, not send. This is useful since I have second verification security setups everywhere, and for other type of alerts. I like the camera, not because of selfies, but it's come in handy when I need to buy a thing at the grocery store that I'm not used to buying, taking a picture of the packaging before I leave. We don't need all these extra things on a phone. We just don't.I think these tech companies really need to change. ASAP. Or else humankind is going to head to a very dark place. I think they need to be regulated just like TV, and that there needs to be more protection against foreign actors going into any country in order to interfere in elections and politics via social media. In the meantime, people need to question everything, research everything, and not be perhaps so quick to jump on the bandwagon. They need to listen to different points-of-view. Everyone needs to take a rational approach to things. That doesn't mean that there aren't indeed wrongs in the world that need our attention, but maybe we should have all the facts first in order to decide what to do next.I think a lot of people will feel the same, that they were aware of a certain amount of manipulation, but this doc really elaborated on how bad things really are and the negative effect on the world, especially on our children of tomorrow. 10/10"}, {"id": 316, "text": "I gave it a full rating just for the sheer importance of it.

A lot of facts are either inaccurate or out-of-date. These problems have been known for a decade and measures have already been begun to start fixing some of these issues.The documentary tries to portray it as if your data in particular is controlled by some small number of people that are actively trying to mind-control you into using their app as much as possible, while in reality it's more like your information is a tiny droplet in an ocean of data that is handled by AI. There is no personal connection between your data and the employees at these tech companies.Then they bring up that because you are using the app for free and viewing ads, you are the product, as if that somehow makes you a mindless slave to these tech companies. This entire point just falls flat if the app just starts offering subscription services instead, such as YouTube premium. They don't bring up adblockers, and they say that advertisements is a reliable source of income, while it's the complete opposite; advertisers pull their ads all the time, from even the most minor of controversies. Many youtubers can't even rely on ads anymore, and have to use subscription services such as patreon or YouTube member to survive. More and more news sites have paywalls because adblockers are too effective. Everything seems to be heading in a paid-membership direction, which makes you the customer.Then they continue to compare facebook to heroin because of the dopamine kick (and ignoring the destructive effects of heroin), and compare some notifications on your phone and an AI-tailored feed to magic and mind-control.The fake news thing they bring up comes from echo-chambers, which is a real issue in any environment, not just social media. Religion is one of the biggest echo chambers we have. They go a bit too far with this though and blame facebook for promoting election fraud, invasion of countries, genocide, and that it will be the downfall for all of humanity.Lastly they call for a ban, taxing, or regulation for all social media instead of looking at any actual solutions such as parents teaching their kids about social media, being more strict about phone usage, teaching them not to trust what some random guy on the internet said, staying objective on a subject and taking in as many angles as possible before making up your mind, visiting social media maximum once a day to check for updates, and most importantly blocking your notifications! There is nothing more annoying than a phone notification, I don't understand how people stand it.Overall I think it's important to bring up these issues and I'm glad they did.

I have switched off all notifications on my phone and plan to switch off recommendations on all my social media accounts, I may even go so far as to delete Facebook. I do not want to be enslaved by the matrix, which basically is what the algorithms that are employed by Facebook, twitter, youtube, pinterest etc... have created. They know everything about us, what we like, what we don't like our political affiliations, whether we are prone to depression, everything and they tailor our newsfeeds to reflect that. We no longer have freedom of choice, because we are being constantly force fed what the algorithms think we want to see. Every Facebook users feed is subtly different to everyone elses, and in alot of cases poles apart, because that is how the algorithms work. For instance what Facebook shows someone like me a liberal minded person is totally different to what someone who is a Conservative minded person sees in their newsfeed.

I know there'll be people out there who didn't already realize what these giant corporations are doing to us and how we as customers are viewed to these tech Goliath's, but I have a strong belief that this won't change many people's feelings on the matter. There's no pathos. They do a nice style of adding actual actors to act out these scenarios in an understandable way, however, I found myself strongly wanting to skip these parts as they weren't fleshed out and I didn't care about any of them. I get that all of these characters are supposed to be us in a sense, but it really distracted from what's interesting about docs and that's hearing facts and examples from the experts. Although, I did really enjoy Vincent Kartheiser as the A.I.. Good stuff there.To sum this up, just know that you are a product and the reason you saw an ad on Facebook for that discounted Chanel bag is because you looked it up on google and were talking about it with friends so they try to cater to you so you'll go back to their site. 4.5/10."}, {"id": 344, "text": "Se dovessi trovare dei termini per descrivere questo docu/film se cos\u00ec si dovesse definire \u00e8 solamente un grandissimo OK BOOMER"}, {"id": 345, "text": "So I jumped into watching this as I had seen a few trailers and the write ups had been high, so obviously I decided to watch this.

I would recommend it for anyone unfamiliar with this underbelly of the modern internet (although maybe skip the acted parts, they don't add much). If this is the first time you've encountered these concepts, sure! start here. But don't stop here. (The movie Feels Good Man is a good next step.)However! As someone who's been paying attention to these trends for awhile now, I was disappointed anytime the movie tried to go any deeper than its central thesis. It's functional, but overly simplistic for the sake of accessible sensationalism, and dangerously shallow whenever it comes close to anything political.There's actually one specific moment that almost completely embodies these faults: as someone talks about how social media has lead to polarization on both sides, they show a clip of the Charlottesville rally vehicle attack, where a far-right terrorist drove his car through a crowd of people, killing one woman. The political and historical context for what was being shown was completely missing. And this is something the movie does a lot. It shows contextless footage of people smashing windows, of fights breaking out in the street, of the Chirstchurch shooting, for god sake. The film is so myopic in its social media bad message that it doesn't do any of this real justice. It does not understand or accurately present online radicalization or the political violence it can incite. And this would be fine if it didn't try, but it does. The main arc of the live action sections is of a teenaged white boy's decent into radical online content, as he grows distant from his family and becomes further enmeshed in an extremist ideology. The ideology shown is vague, with essentially the only concrete belief shown being climate-change denial. He's shown watching videos with people making veiled calls for violent action, doing whatever it takes. And then, at the end, they turn the social media machine off, and... he's better? That's it???Yeah. That's it.I think the most insightful point in the film is that these technologies don't on their own have the capacity for harm, they can only magnify the flaws that already exist in society. But the film seems dead set on critiquing the tech but not society. The acts of violence they show all have specific motives, specific ideologies behind them, but those go completely unmentioned. And if you just turn the social media machine off, well, that teen is still gonna believe whatever extremism he found a home in, he's still gonna be connected to communities trying to radicalize him further. Changing how Facebook works isn't gonna stop there from being neo-nazis. These problems are incredibly complicated. And this movie? It just isn't complicated.The folks they interview mostly come from the world of tech and still believe in its central principles, even if they've grown to be critical of how things have been implemented and the impacts these technologies have had. They advocate for holding companies like Facebook and Google accountable, and forcing them to change their practices. But these companies don't exist in a vacuum, and they've grown to their current size and power exactly because of these harmful practices. Just as the systems these companies have created rewards content which monopolizes people's attention by pushing them further down rabbit holes of radicalization, the system they exist within rewards the companies for their blatant disregard for common welfare. The profit motives for radicalizing that kid don't just go away.It's an alright film. It's a fine introduction. It's just so shallow. And after watching it all, with all these frustrations, to hear them talk over the credits about their optimism, about how the system can be reformed, only to have it end, and for netflix to autoplay a trailer, specifically suited to my tastes... it doesn't exactly give me a lot of confidence."}, {"id": 418, "text": "So very disturbing, and I believe every minute of it.

Rather hypocritical if you ask me.Don't trust film makers or Netflix any more than you trust Facebook or Instagram.Full disclosure: I work in tech (but not for any social media company), I hear these same claims on a daily basis and what the film does not tell you is that there are a lot of activist groups with different agendas trying to lobby the government into passing various laws at the moment. Not all of these groups are on the same page, or want the same things and they are not necessarily looking for the same results that you are. None the less, various individuals from these groups were featured in the documentary and edited such that it looks like they have a common goal and a common interest when they don't. For example: maybe you are concerned with the mental health of children as related to social media consumption, and an activist group - knowing that's something people care about - will give lip service to that issue while what they're really wanting to do is pass censorship laws because they want the power to control what can and can't be posted on social media.Just beware that this documentary was manipulative in itself, very one sided and does not accurately represent the disparate, nuanced and occasionally contradictory views of the various people represented."}, {"id": 421, "text": "This documentary:1) Selectively blames only technology/capitalism/profit business models/private initiatives etc.2) In parallel, it completely omits/ignores individual responsibility, which in fact is replaced by victimization. Individuals always are presented as innocent victims exploited by immoral monsters (point 1 above).3) And the cherry on the top: It proposes REGULATION as the main solution. In simple words, this documentary is based on the (unproven) belief that the solution is a gigantic Statism (more regulations, more interventions, more bureaucracy, more collectivism, more Man-in-the-middle, more liberty/freedom restrictions etc)... just because individuals always are weak, always are victims, and always need the Big Brother (Statism) protection. Between hidden lines, it's like using North Korea or China as a model, where communism always is protecting the people (the weaker, the victims, the exploited, the common-good blah, blah, blah) by increasing the power of the government (in one hand), while regulating/controlling/manipulating Social Media and the whole internet traffic (in the other hand).4) In addition, the documentary totally ignores, for example, that Religion was/is/will be many times much worse than technology, Religion has existed for centuries causing colossal destruction and death, Religion always is tax-exempted enjoying countless fiscal benefits, Religion always is based on profit and power accumulation, and Religion is one of the worse exploiters of human mental weaknesses. In this same context, Statism for centuries has done (human brainwashing using political ideologies) the same as Religion did. But both Religion and Statism historically are culturally accepted, so both are never seen as enemies of humanity.Conclusion, I do not deny that Social Media/Networks are a problem. I just affirm that this documentary is selective and incomplete. The real problem is not Religion, nor Statism, nor Social Networks etc. The real problem is humanity, and their (our) tendency always to victimize themselves, never taking responsibility for their (our) actions and the consequences of their (our) actions."}, {"id": 422, "text": "The Social Dilemma is an unlikely hit on Netflix. Most of the 94-minute documentary is simple interviews with worried former tech-industry executives. The interviews are interspersed with a dramatized story about Ben, a teenager whose life is controlled by personified AI algorithms. Rather than building up to a climax, the documentary examines several problems with social media one by one. The heavy focus on interview snippets and the laundry-list approach is a recipe for a boring movie, but The Social Dilemma has garnered nearly universal acclaim.Early in the The Social Dilemma, several of the former tech execs are asked by the interviewer to describe the problem with social media. The execs are momentarily tongue-tied. The impression the documentary wants to give is that there is so much wrong with social media that the experts don't know where to start. But maybe the answer is just hard to summarize. In the last decade, social media has been associated with scandal after scandal - Russian vote tampering, the livestreaming of the mosque shooting in New Zealand, the promotion of extremist conspiracy theories, etc. The documentary assumes that its viewers already agree that social media has a problem. Like the execs being interviewed, we just can't say exactly why.One recurring point in the documentary is that social media companies don't have the best interests of their users at heart. A text frame announces that 'if you don't pay for a product, you are the product.' In particular the user's attention is what can be sold to advertisers. (Another text frame quotes data visualization pioneer Edward Tufte: Only two industries refer to their customers as users, illegal drugs and software'.) Social media companies do whatever they can to attract and hold the attention of users. The companies employ powerful artificial intelligence to predict what will bring a user to the app, and keep them there.If we stop there, the way social media keeps us connected sounds dystopian. But companies never have the best interests of the customer at heart. 'It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest,' wrote Adam Smith. Even if social media companies are out to harvest our attention, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The outcome is what matters, not the motive. If social media companies keep our attention, it may be by giving us content that we find entertaining or informative. Maybe we go back to Youtube because we are addicted. Or maybe those dystopian algorithms suggest media we find worth watching. We all have choices about how we spend our time. The Social Dilemma suggests we don't have any choices to make.The word 'manipulated' came up again and again in the documentary. Users of social media are being manipulated to use the apps in a way that is not good for them. In fact, many users are 'addicted' to social media. This language reminded me of Marxist language about the 'exploitation' of workers. The word itself tells us how we are supposed to feel about the practice. If we instead said users are 'persuaded' to spend time on social media, the whole market sounds less ominous, but the meaning of the word isn't much different.As a little aside, I watched The Social Dilemma with Netflix closed captioning on. Closed captioning contains both subtitles, and also a description of non-dialogue sounds as well. When the discussion was related to suspicious practices of tech companies 'ominous music' was played. When a character in the dramatization suggests that we use less social media, 'energizing music' was played. The captioning parted the curtain a little bit so I could see behind the scenes how the film makers aimed to 'manipulate' or 'persuade' the audience into certain feelings by using musical cues.This isn't to say that there is nothing worrying about social media. The effect of social media on children emphasized by the The Social Dilemma is genuinely worrying. Children, especially pre-teen children, are not mature adults. Children are often gullible, and make poor decisions. We cannot expect them to make decisions which are in their own best interest. Social media for children should be regulated similarly to how children's television is regulated. Short of that, parents should limit their pre-teens' connections to social media, and regularly look through what they are doing online.The documentary ends with a short discussion of the existential risk of social media. That is, the chance that unregulated social media will lead to the end of humanity as we know it. This far-fetched idea is endorsed by a couple of the experts who appear repeatedly in the documentary. I am not sure I understand exactly the mechanism by which social media would end the human race, but I think the fact that several of the interviewees support it is telling. The former execs that are interviewed in The Social Dilemma all spent much of their careers thinking about social media. Since social media is their life's work, they might think it is more important than it really is.The Social Dilemma is a long diatribe, with some interesting ideas and observations thrown in along the way. I think it could have been cut down significantly, and I did not find the dramatization helpful. The mediocre documentary is boosted by plugging into the current widespread skepticism about the role of social media in our lives.

Everything in your life has been manipulated by media and advertisement for decades (at least). How you dress, eat, talk, think. That's how media and advertisement work. Social media is just another tool. Social media enables fake news and polarization. Really? How about the times before social media? We had two world wars in a decade and a decades long cold war. Who polarized people in 20th century?Before social media: 1 - Average people on the street did not have a platform to express their ideas. I don't understand how a progressive intellectual can have a problem with that. 2 - Average person did not have the chance to show their skills to the world. Media and Show business were controlled by a bunch of elites. Now, anybody can start a TV channel in youtube, or publish an independent movie on social media. Social media enabled people to share ideas, find like-minded people, hear different opinions and many other positives.

Disconnecting people by connecting them online. That is the ultimate irony.Stop giving your power away to advertisers. Resist the urge to purchase things you do not need.

Essentially they're selling you to the advertiser, making you the product, not the customer.The documentary also shows how this impacts your thoughts and behaviours, as you end up only seeing news and views that reinforce your pre-existing views, rather than challenging them, leading to a polarisation of society.The points made in the interviews are illustrated with a mini-drama involving a family, showing how the children spend far too much time staring at their phones and how social media shapes their self-image and confidence and distorts their perceptions.All in all it's a very thought-provoking, sobering, challenging examination of the world we live in."}, {"id": 427, "text": "9 minutes into this documentary I knew it was over dramatised biased nonsense.

It shows Netflix have an agenda other than presenting facts for me to decide the reality for myself.Netflix negates the fact that people choose to give their kids access to mobile phones and allow them to use the internet while ignoring that Netflix are literally using the same techniques poorly disguised as honest and truthful information. Many times you'll hear the internet is bad yet Netflix reside on the internet and no one mentions this because that would make it more impartial and possibly make me think and not blindly follow what Netflix say is true.All this doc does is blame the other and doesn't entertain the idea that maybe US the user should share some responsibility for our actions and life.

This documentary makes us realise the flip side of connecting with people via internet. How social media can and has destroyed the very basics of democracy by undermining it. How we were supposed to live in a world of information, but now we are living in a world of misinformation.

I felt like that was obvious before it even became common knowledge that if you aren't paying for the product online, you are the product online. I remember around 2014 or earlier seeing specific ads for things I was just looking for on platforms like Amazon, which I never saw ads for before. The ads would very specifically match the exact item I had been looking to buy. I also remember even earlier seeing ads for things on Facebook that were associated with my specific Facebook profile information. Given experiences like that I was startled how surprising so many people where when they learned the truth about social media's business model being based on acquiring data and using that data for effective as effectively as possible to make sure the ads are as likely as possible to appeal to the individual seeing the ad.I wish that programs that we pay for like streaming services or Amazon could at least let us turn-off the advance algorithms if we wanted given that they are already are getting a monthly amount of money from us whether we use the service or not.This documentary's strength in my opinion isn't just that it effectively emotionally presents the way the technology works and how it is dangerous and unreliable in terms of providing a healthy experience for the user(because that's not the goal of the algorithm), but it's presented by a lot of the tech people who were at the forefront of making these social media companies In these particular ways. And many of them were near the forefront around 2015 in raising concerns about the affect of these programs.It seems to me like I've been a bit more skeptical than most of the concept of people being taken over by artificial intelligence. But this movie did a pretty good job of providing merit to that concern. And probably the best case to me was when they said that the companies are good at addressing and exploiting our subconscious weaknesses in thinking rather than our conscious strengths and will. And the movie showed how addressing our weaknesses is a real problem in its own right. It was also disturbing to see the social media companies try to not take responsibility or suggest that more algorithms could/should be used to address the problematic ones. My thought was, why not create legislation that forces social media to get rid of a lot of their algorithms and platforms troublesome propensities.Near the end the documentary they reminds the viewer that most of these dangerous components of the programs weren't made with evil goals in-mind (unless one just counts making money as just evil, which I don't) . And that a lot of good things have come-out of the platforms to accompany the awful. And I'm really glad that they provided some tips on how to undo some of the awful negative effects of social media. I personally think the easiest and best suggestion is to turn off the majority of your phone notifications. Keep the phone on vibrate. And find outlets that get you to think about things that you don't already accept or already aren't convinced-of. Make sure the different places are challenging how people think rather than telling them what they think. and be sure that when they address the other side that the other side isn't being straw-manned.Also, don't use any social media platform as news. If you have to use it, use it as a conduit to get to actual legitimate sources. If you're calling something news and it doesn't have sources, it's not necessarily news.Probably the best piece of advice that they didn't mention was that people need to be taught how to think skeptically and develop a strong epistemology. Critical thinking and logic really should be taught in public K-12 education in my opinion. Because whenever we get presented with false information, it's up to us to refute the lies or accept them. Having a wrong conclusion feels identical to having a correct idea. So it's important for us use good mental tools and not bad ones for determining what is or isn't likely correct. There are places online that address basic thinking blunders that occur far too often. If we understood some thinking basics a bit more universally, people might not be taken-in by logical fallacies, people might understand the difference between validity and soundness , and the differences between evidence and claims.There are channels that discuss how to get to the root of a supposed scientific claim and determine if the popular blog or news source is accurately describing what the scientists actually wrote about from the start. Even big news sources commonly will misreport science news in particular. And not always intentionally. But if people learn claims that are wrong, whether people along the communication chain meant well or not is mostly irrelevant. The person getting the wrong information is becoming wrong either way."}, {"id": 431, "text": "The irony of this documentary is that it pretends to be an alarm to expose social media as dangerous in the sense that it collects data and surveils you while the AI algorithims feeds you propaganda (fake news and conspiracies). Then they go on to suggest regulating the narrative is the answer (aka censorship). The irony is this documentary is a propaganda piece (albeit cleverly done) that leads us to believe that regulations are needed on the information we access through social media. The fact is major social media platforms are already censoring truth and demonitizing or banning those that share truth. Of course there will always be some disinformation on these platforms, but it should be up to each individual to analyze the information and make an informed personal decision. So in conclusion, The Social Dilemma question they are asking is essentially...how can we (the giant technocratic data collectors) collect data and surveil users while also socially engineering them to the correct programming. How can we keep them (users) hooked while preventing them from sharing/learning truths that are harmful to the mainstream propaganda narrative (obey and never question authority) A quick example of how ridiculous things have gotten is I just recently read a warning on an Instagram post that said (paraphrasing) The following FACT is true but it could lead to dangerous opinions....lol...WTF...a fact is a fact...stop trying to censor factual information.

LOL, as they say.Having not been raised by a computer that fits in my pocket, I'm nostalgic for the days when people using your as a contraction seemed about the biggest menace emerging from the internet. Talking about myself isn't something I usually spend much time on in reviews, but in the spirit of the age of social media under discussion in this documentary, I'll break protocol a bit. I've always been weary of social media. My mobile phone was secondhand and several years old before I got it, and while it's, perhaps, technically smart in the sense that it has Wi-Fi capability, it's usually turned off. At some time or another I have to inform most of my contacts that my phone won't show pictures or emoji they text me. The only internet communication I regularly contribute to are these reviews. I don't upload photos or post on Facebook, and I've never had a Twitter account. (Google and other search engines are problems, though.) Believe it or not, Cineanalyst isn't even my real name. Indeed, my disinclination to forfeit my privacy to become addicted to advertisement-geared algorithms would seem to indicate I'd give The Social Dilemma a like, or forward it, retweet or what have you. But, if we're going to become increasing divisive, one might say that I'm an aestheticist rather than an ethicist, which is to say that whether I agree with the standpoint of a documentary isn't my primary concern--especially when it isn't very informative because one should already know most of this stuff. If I wanted to sit in an echo chamber, I would have a Facebook feed.Not to downplay the dangers of social media and other technology (although the existential scaremongering may be going a bit far sometimes), but Mark Zuckerberg and whomever-else tech wiz didn't invent employing fancy tricks and formulae to attract attention to media, nor with sometimes disastrous effects. Movies such as this one have been doing it for over a century now. Likely the most influential film ever made, The Birth of a Nation (1915), revived the Ku Klux Klan in the United States. Netflix itself has revolutionized the industry and how we see motion pictures, including by suggesting what we watch based on data they collect on us. Or remember Citizen Kane (1941) and the implication that William Randolph Hearst was responsible for getting the U.S. involved in the Spanish-American War. Going further back, the printing press may not have started the Reformation, but it certainly helped. And the talking heads here are worried about contributing to civil war? Whether the Rohingya genocide mentioned in the doc or, say, the Arab Spring, it's already happened. Huge technological advances always contribute to upheaval of some sort. Computers, the internet, mobile phones, social media--they're not, as compared to multiple times here, the bicycle. More so, they're automobiles and trains. It's motion pictures and television. It's paper and the printing press. Kudos, though, to some of the subjects for somehow managing to both appear overly alarmist and to underappreciate the vast transformational significance of their innovations. To top it off, the picture concludes with vague optimism of society overcoming the dilemma that seems more naive than their intentions in creating that dilemma in the first place.For such a revolutionary topic, it would've been apt had the filmmakers not relied on such familiar tricks and formulae of the cinematic platform. Besides the interviews, there's the manipulative score to ratchet up the drama. Worst of all, though, has to be the fictional, I guess you might call it illustrative story, edited between the documentary footage of interviews, lectures and newsreels. The fantasy of imagining code, or artificial intelligence, in the form of three humanoid Silicon Valley bro stereotypes manipulating the actions of their user from behind some Inside Out (2015) control panel is hokey. And that his rabbit hole of a feed leads the user to nonsense content regarding the so-called extreme center inciting him not to vote is contrived equivocating and ends up with nothing more arresting than supposed protesters and police officers bumping in to each other in a confused mess of stupid docudrama.

This isn't a documentary that preaches to you to stop using social media, it tells you to be aware of what's actually going on, and it opens your eyes on things you didn't know before and were oblivious to.For me, I give it a 10/10 for capturing and explaining the negatives of social media. A very well made, important and informative documentary. And I like the incorporation of movie scenes made for that purpose."}, {"id": 438, "text": "Started watching this in disbelief that Netflix was promoting this type of documentary when they released a movie exploiting children simultaneously.

People who believe in Pizzagate do NOT simply believe that ordering a pizza means you are ordering someone who is being trafficked. It goes so. much. deeper. 2. Look into the shooter. He was once an ACTOR. He shot one bullet into the floor and it went through their computer system and destroyed the server. 3. Also look at the artwork in that place.. look at the owners old Twitter.. look into the bands that play there. It all points to one thing. Last, which is probably the most important of all, anything Pizzagate, Save The Children, Q, Right-Winged, Pro-Trump, and etc.. is currently being banned and silenced right now. Social media accounts of those who are outspoken Trump supporters and outspoken Q believers are being shut down with no notice, no reasoning... not being promoted for growth. Censoring is real. While a portion of this documentary is legitimate, it's just yet again, another piece of propaganda."}, {"id": 439, "text": "The social dilemma is a fairly interesting and important documentary with a lot of information lists of people are not often exposed to. I think it's a good thing that there is a popular documentary that is bringing a lot of attention the dangers of technology, but it's not like this is the first one so people need to stop treating as if it is, just because it is in a documentary style does not mean it is more accurate than films or TV shows that address the same issues years before. There are south park episodes from years ago addressing the dangers of technology, WALL-E shows the dangers of technology in 2008 and eternal sunshine of the spotless mind did in 2004, I could go on.This documentary puts a lot of attention on how technology and mostly social media manipulate people. But it is manipulative, from the sad music when they are talking about bad things to happy music when the kid agrees to not use his phone for a week. My biggest problem however is how manipulative the skits are. There are skits that are played every now and then of a family, mainly a young boy and his older sister, the young boy is addicted to his phone and his sister is against technology. They use the young boy as a representation of the average person, but he does not act like a person. It tries to show people what technology does to people but does not represent it in a truthful way, this is manipulative and most of all hypocritical, how can you put so much emphasis on how bad it is that we are being manipulated while you are manipulating your audience. This is a huge problem in an otherwise decent documentary.That brings me to my next point that the filmmakers are out of touch. I don't think the people they ate interviewing are out of touch as they worked in the tech industry for years and they definitely know what they are talking about, but the filmmakers don't. Some of the questions they asked were really bad and out of touch. The representation of the average teenager is complete bull, this also shows how out of touch they are. Many news reports are used as 'evidence' to support the point they are making, but the news and these news reports are also completely out of touch. You can not use a montage of news reports as evidence to support your point if the news reports themselves are manipulative and out of touch.They also talk a lot about people who are born after 1996 and how they grow up with phones from as young as 12. It goes into how practically growing up online will lead to addiction. I am in this generation of people but did not get a phone until I was 15 years old. I can understand how people get addicted if they grow up with their devices from such a young age but I am not. I do know that I watch too many movies and write too many reviews that nobody cares about but I could easily go a week without my phone. This is not me doubting that people get addicted to technology because obviously they do, but I am saying someone like me who didn't get a phone until later in their life is not destined to be hooked on technology forever.From a technical standpoint it is just a standard documentary. Nothing special, it cuts between interview footage and cringe skits and news footage like every other documentary ever. I guess that skits are fairly unique, but I'm glad not many documentaries use skits like that.Overall, the social dilemma is a decent documentary that unintentionally contradicts itself constantly. I guess that is quite a good message about how even people very against technology can still fall into their trap. I'm very glad people are finally starting to pay attention to things like this."}, {"id": 440, "text": "I don't watch many documentaries, however the technology addiction that currently plagues the world interests me as a topic, so I decided to give 'The Social Dilemma' a look. I said to myself before watching the film that I can't think of any new information this documentary could give me that I don't already know on the topic, but I'll give it a chance anyway and hope to be pleasantly surprised. Sadly, I was right. This documentary offered almost no new information and was actually quite insulting to the intelligence of the average person when you sit back and think about it.The film basically has one point, and does an admittedly brilliant job of stretching that one point into a 94 minute runtime. The entire thing is basically different experts finding different analogies for the exact same concept. I kept thinking to myself - okay you've laid out the problem, now give us some answers. You won't believe me but the answers they offer actually come during the credits. And the reason for this is that they are embarrassingly simple. They are not answers to anything. The documentary doesn't want you to realise this, because if there are no answers then what was the point, right?I hate documentaries like this one. Over-produced, soul-less and money-grabbing. Phone, social-media and technology addiction are terrible things, and any awareness of it is better than nothing, but 'The Social Dilemma' could still have been so much better if told with a different style of narrative.

Even otherwise, the narration is simple and lucid. What I didn't really find amusing is the story of a family (especially its Gen Z and Gen Alpha members) that runs parallel to these interesting interview snippets with ex-employees of popular social media companies. Much of the documentary is what's already out there for everyone to read and make sense of, but compiled in a crisply-edited 90 minutes for easier consumption.The documentary gives insights into people's unconsciously growing addictions and how social media is eating into young minds who perceive validation as a necessity in life. It also takes a solid stab at the usage of social media to spread lies and propaganda. In short, the makers and those featured in the documentary want the world to introspect, and recognize the ugly side of social media (and technology in general) for what it is - billionaires manipulating everyone else so that they can stay billionaires. It also urges us to take action; to fight the systems run by a few extremely wealthy individuals in the simplest of ways that can bring about impact in the long run.It's definitely worth a watch; I should probably give more documentaries on Netflix a try because they've clearly been disappointing me in the (original) feature films department.

Good luck fighting the algorithm, folks!"}, {"id": 442, "text": "Expected the usual YouTube documentary, surprised by the admission that the narrator didn't know what actually made him so uneasy about the social media phenomenon. The moment of silence may have been staged, but it was - for me, at least - remarkably effective. Yes, why do the social media make us so uneasy?Kept me awake for hours. The moment of silence was effective, as said, but more intriguing is the fact that no answer to this question was offered. In other words, if you want an answer, hey, go and find it for yourself.Fine. Start with the other moment of emphasis, when the narrator offers a contrast between a tool, which we are free to use, and social media, which is a tool that uses us.Tool. Are we merely free to use a tool? Consider a basic tool, say a hammer. To use a hammer would require some nails, some wood, a design or plan to follow, and a placement for the result of our use of the tool. In other words, to use even the simplest tool would require a significant degree of social organisation, a ste-up that we would be obliged to conform to in order to be free to use our tool.Now take a more central tool, say a steam engine. An extraordinarily useful tool in its time, that transform whole societies in a generation or so. For instance, consider railways: the level of speculation and investment, labour expended, whole nations transformed. And behind all this was the rise of the coal barons and the huge industrial complexes that made the track and the trains. Then we had the combustion engine, motor cars, trucks, huge ships, and the rise of the oil monopolies - which still exert enormous soicla, financial and political influence.You can see that our freedom to use tools can be quite fundamentally determined by forces utterly beyond our control.Now consider a tool closer in character to social media: television. We have licensed televison services in this part of the world, where possessors of television pay an annual sum towards the operation of a television service that was understood to serve the interests of its viewers. Elsewhere there is commercial television, which is provided free to its viewers while funded by an income from advertisement. A very successful arrangement: free to view if you didn't mind the occasional interuption to the entertainment. But who noticed that the provided entertainment never outshone the sparkle of the ads? Whoever noticed that they came to buy branded products rather than basic materials like washing powder or coffee? See? If you are not buying your entertainment, you are the product.So, nothing new in social media on this score: ads on the tele, ads on the phone, what's new here?The reason it is so hard to isolate what is new and unnerving about social media is because it is so obvious. Here's the core. In the documentary, a youth undertakes not to use his phone for a week. We see him lying on his bed staring at the ceiling, then staring at a window. OK, he's bored. It's as though the ceiling and the window are screens that are not providing him with information. See? The youth, for instance, does not know that you can look through a window, and that you can then decide what is to be learned in that way.Education: trains you to accept second- third-hand information as sufficient knowledge, that fills you up with this information, textbook after textbook, and trains you to use this information, projects and exams. No matter at what level, education is information, and nothing else. See now that social media is merely an extension of this system, just more recycled information. And you can see why the narrator was so uneasy: he sensed he was already part of the social media universe, trained up long before he knew where it would take him. And his unease: I suspect it arises because he senses the strangeness, the otherness of the world outside that closed info sphere.See now that the youth could not think for himself. Why? Consider the last time human beings thought for themselves, back in sixteenth century Europe, and the hundred years of religious wars that followed, that devastated large parts of the continent.And the burden of the documentary - the reason I give it 6 stars - is the uncomfortable fact that each of us must decide for ourselves just what social media is and what our relationship to it should be.

But I also noted an undercurrent voice that was very alarmist and also a massive hole to acknowledge the part the streaming platforms have played in this such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney Plus. Ironically a doco like this coming from Netflix did seem a little strange, when they also contribute to some of these problems themselves, such as addictive behaviours, the 5 second counter to keep you bingeing a tv show, recommended for you settings which keep track of your behaviours.

And so much of it is positive and beautiful...but I think we also long for mystery, we want to admit fully that we are mesmerized by a thought or an idea, but suddenly our critic comes to the surface to look for information that discredits what only seems to be (or so tells us the critic) a good-hearted message. This documentary is an example. The creators probably did not mean to tell you everything there is to know because nobody knows that. But if we examine things and find the essential (which is I think a good way to live with so much content and information around) we will find that the message is one: there are people out there that are looking to feed (yes, feed, not create) a behavioral tendency in humankind. That is the tendency to disconnect ourselves from ourselves. Because of overstimulation of the outer world, stress or painful life events, or any reason, we drift away and take distance of what actually means something to us, and that is life itself. Being present in life. Eating and tasting the food. Creating. Breathing. Connecting to others. Living, however it manifests in each of our lives. So yes, social media is a way to disconnect yourself and feed the drifting mind. It is a very lonely and distressing state of being as I have experienced myself...you go down the rabbit hole (like the authors of this documentary portray in such a cool and relatable way). And when you go down this rabbit hole you go driven (or should I say trapped?) by your own insecurities and frustrations, you feed this part of yourself that wants to escape or that needs to cling to something external to feel complete. You binge watch videos about other people, we go hours and hours fantasizing about another life, another food, other clothes, other life...or consuming information like if we wanted to get answers about what to do with our lives with it. As I said I am guilty of this myself, and at first it feels like I am in control and just discovering this holistic nutrition program, or this animal shelter that this acquaintance of mine built, or getting to know about this person's experience with volunteering in Asia. So cool and enriching.

I like about this work that it shows this feeling so accurately, but I don't agree with the conclusions they draw. We are not powerless humans who are just trapped by the machines. We have the power to be present, to show up in our lives. We have the power of choice always. The solution is enjoying life as much as we can. Work on ourselves.

It raises a lot of important points about the destructive influence of tech on our lives and society as a whole. At the same time, it overdramatizes it's own message by blending interviews with cinematic elements which weakens the incredibly important issue. Still, this is a must watch documentary for people of all ages because let's face it, there is no escaping social media.The first half of the documentary is brilliant as they bring in big names from the tech industry who demonstrate how social media has gradually taken control of our lives. While most of the information is obvious, the documentary fuses the small points into one big eye opening punch. Social Media a drug that crushes people's self esteem, causes dissatisfaction with life but most importantly alters the way in which we perceive the world around us. Children are growing up with phones as their digital pacifiers and they are becoming completely zombified in the digital world.Many wonder how will AI ultimately take over over lives. Will it be Terminator style with robots enslaving us? No, it will be the Matrix and this documentary points out how we are already living in it. The tragic part is that we are voluntarily plugging ourselves into it allowing AI to tell us what to watch, how to think and who to be angry at. Non surprisingly, the cause for it all are the billions that tech companies make because at the end, it is a business and we are the product.Second half is where it gets problematic as Netflix doesn't present an opposing point of view and for some reason dives head first into politics. To increase the shock value, they pile up unrelated excessive content without any evidence to support it. As a result, the docu-drama leaves a sour tastes. Admittedly, they do pose a neat proposal involving taxation but in the end this problem has become too big to solve.

No realistic and workable solutions are proposed except for very general things like regulations, removing the apps or hints at outright bans.

The tools and techniques they use are endless. But it's just plain manipulation, for short.Never have we had as much information as we do today, and never have we been so ignorant. But is it really information, or just perception? A version of the reality we chose/were led to believe in? We can't tell what the truth is anymore. I for one cannot, and I admit it. And as the documentary forewarns, the moment we stop being able to tell what the truth really is, we will be doomed. We probably already are, as we have a knack for mistaking growth for development, landscape for nature, and bigness for greatness."}, {"id": 457, "text": "The Social Dilemma filmmakers are definitely concerned about our best interests.The movie is well made and provides very well documented arguments.But unlike a documentary by definition, this is a movie presenting arguments to support an opinion.An opinion I happen to agree with: We, and our children, need to become strong in exercising our critical opinion. We MUST consume all digital media with skepticism and questions in order to determine its value, and in turn to protect ourselves and to keep truth and its value alive.Computer algorithms can teach themselves to guess and eventually almost certainly predict our behavior. That is what generates the money needed to keep the social media websites afloat.When presented with those AI induced results on our social media favorites it is our duty to ourselves and humanity to question the results as a matter of daily life. The fact of the matter is that the rather crude and remarkably stupid A.I. results of our social media activity loses its hold on our hearts and minds when we immediately question EVERY thing it presents to us in reaction to our online actions.Western World Proverb: If it smells like a chunk of rancid pork, then it is a chunk of rancid pork.It is in the most deepest sense in the best interests of our children, our children being the messages we send to a future we will never see, that we teach them to defend themselves with critical thinking.Our children must be taught to question everything; not because paranoia is a healthy way of life, rather because we do not want to feed our brains poison anymore than we'd want to feed your body poison.A.I. results presented to us in social media in my opinion are really pathetically bad, but some day will eventually be razor sharp to the point of being more dangerous to humanity than they already are. In the meantime we must not allow ourselves to fall prey to them.Whether or not you agree with the opinion presented here in this not-a-documentary opinion piece movie presented in our best interests, it is well worth watching all of the way through.If you love your family and your offspring, you'll start looking for ways to strengthen your own critical thinking and most importantly that of your living messages to the future.It feels weird to say, but we must arm our children to the teeth with critical thinking skills to insure that they do not fall prey to a zombie apocalypse.To the Social Dilemma filmmakers: Message received! Thank you for your hard work and heartfelt passion to address an enormous dilemma.And to the great minds that in all innocence and good faith created this beast who now recognize the problem AND have come forward to share a call to action to fix it, I'm most grateful for your sense of responsibility and assistance."}, {"id": 458, "text": "As someone who has been researching the psychological and neurological effects of social media for the past few years, I was very happy to see this documentary emerge on Netflix, and on a site that has such a wide audience, in particular. Overall, I found it very informative and well put-together. However, I do wish they had focused a bit more on dopamine and the ways in which social media sites are designed to trap people in a dopamine feedback loop, hence, making them so dangerously addictive. They are literally built to re-wire our brains. And I strongly believe that the effects these sites have on people's dopamine levels is one of the primary reasons why studies have shown that they cause depression and anxiety (increased dopamine causes a decrease in serotonin). We are living in an era where social media use has become the norm and is increasingly programming people's behavior without users even realizing it. That is why this documentary is so crucial, and I truly hope that it causes many people to wake up in terms of what social media is doing to their brains, to their lives and to society in general and to consider deleting their social media accounts. I deleted my social media a few years ago and could literally feel my brain change afterward, as my dopamine levels began to stabilize. And I can say with all honesty that I hadn't felt so happy and so content and so at peace in years. Someone could not even pay me to go back to using social media now that I know how much better and more at peace I feel without using it and how much more in control of my own life and my own time that I now feel. It took me three different tries to finally get away from there for good, but it really is just a matter of getting it out of your system and then you will begin to see it so much differently and realize that you have your free will back once you are no longer being programmed by the program, essentially. To whoever reads this and has been wanting to get away from social media: It's only a week or so until you no longer begin to miss it, as your brain chemistry begins to change and normalize. Stick with it and don't go back. It only becomes and easier and easier to stay away."}, {"id": 459, "text": "I'm 50 years old and feel that p u l l to my phone.

Sometimes hard to find sometimes it's there but make effort to grab it and watch it. Then when you do, all you see is less post-production and more real-life camera following, no script running.When you admit the problem and reveal almost all of it's aspect; the expected is to bring solutions based on the root of a problem. What this documentary did is and ironically saying yes we know about your issue but we are here to justify in a selective and manipulating way as they scripted this show.And by the point telling us it's just an AI, they were right about this.

Yea Netflix your AI-advertising-man-made works just fine until this review.Probably this won't go up as advertised as well."}, {"id": 461, "text": "This documentary is about how the internet influences people's minds and how they think specifically teens and young adults. The problem is they way it is shown is completely inaccurate. It shows a young man being influenced by social media and notifications but the way it shows it is as if there are actual people looking at everything you are looking at and sending you things to keep your attention. This could not be further from the truth. There is no one looking at you and analyzing your actions on the internet in real time. It is an algorithm that does all of this for millions of people at the same time. This is mentioned briefly but instead of talking about how the algorithm works they show 3 people monitoring the kids every action and trying to influence him. Thats not how that works at all.Another thing I don't like is that they assume everyone on the internet is a nut case conspiracy theorists. It is true that there are a lot of those out there but there is nothing wrong with people telling others not to believe everything the mainstream media and scientists tells you. Because actual scientists do the exact same thing as conspiracy theorists. They present theories as fact. You can clearly see this on Neil Tysons new universe show. He never once says that the things he is talking about are theories. He says this is the way it is and that is simply not true because there is absolutely no way of knowing what he says is true unless you actually observed it which no one ever has. My point is it doesn't matter if you are a scientist or just some guy with a webcam anyone's guess is as good as anyone else's guess when you are at this level. because no one has any idea how some of these things work.This brings me to what I believe is the overall point of this documentary the point is to make people not trust anything. They are trying to get us to the point were no one believes anything. They are trying to create so much doubt that anything could be true or not true. There is no way of knowing. You don't even know if they way you are thinking is because you really do think that way or if someone is making you think the things you think.My solution is don't concern yourself with things that don't matter. They try to say the world is horrible and chaotic and on the edge of destruction with climate change and riots and polarization but the truth is as I'm typing this I'm sitting an my patio and today is such a beautiful day.

And the children are defenseless against it. And our brains haven't evolved in millions of years so we can't compete against a super computer. Oh, the doom and gloom. The doom and gloom. Society is coming to an end. If only I could think for myself instead of being a test animal to super computers running the algorithms. The people being interviewed, most of which are ex-employees of tech giants, are articulate in their speech and the points they make. I started to get bored because it seemed to be the same talking points over and over again. My problems with the documentary is that they are acting as if these problems never existed before. Before social media, dictators could barely control their countries. Before social media, no country had ever tried to manipulate the election results of another country.

However between the snippets of these interviews there are these acted out scenes to illustrate the effects of the concepts that were just explained. These are just awful. Poorly acted and to much on the nose. Also to show how the algorithm works they to put this actor with different hairstyles and put several versions of him behind a desk, like in the movie inside out, to control your actions and make you watch the content the program wants you to see. This felt more like how you would explain all this to a child. It insults the intelligence of the viewer by adding this.

Since we don't pay for these services we actually are the product being sold to advertisers.Surely you must have noticed that the ads you get are targeted to your searches and that's because there's no privacy on the net. Every algorithm is calculated to get inside our heads and fill them with craving for what we don't need.You also must have noticed young generations spending a lot of their times staring at their phones on public transport, walking, sitting at the cafe and while with their friends. If you still use your brain to think, you may wonder why people sitting with friends feel the need to check constantly their phone... having watched this documentary you will know why and perhaps regret the days when we did' have social media.One or two point of demerit for the real life scenes badly scripted and acted.

As a matter of fact, once I finished watching The Social Dilemma, I opened the settings on my IPhone to see what my daily usage time was, and I was shocked to find out that I spent three-and-a-half hours every day on my phone. That's crazy! It's the equivalent of an entire day every week! My habits need to change, and this documentary might just provide the spark that I needed to take action.While I think that The Social Dilemma succeeds very well at scaring the crap out of the audience and convincing us that there is a problem and that we need to change, I would have liked to have more varied expert opinions on this topic. There are basically only interviews with ex-tech experts from Silicon Valley, which is great and all, but a psychologist would also have been interesting. Or a sociologist. Or a neuroscientist explaining what social media does to our brains. You get the point.That said, I can't press this enough : go watch this documentary on Netflix, everyone!

They have been wonderful tools overall, but not without flaws. This documentary really hits home on the damage the internet does to the individual physic of our youth, but also the damage to the social fabric of society. I don't believe these internet companies have bad intentions, they just are trying to figure out what we are about so they can sell things to us. The problem is there are some bad actors that use the tool for their own nefarious purposes. There are a segment of defenders out there that argue that it up to us to police ourselves, that we don't need a nanny state to protect us from the evils of the internet. Like all libertarian arguments, this simplistic approach ignores the cumulative effect on society of us consuming media on the internet. The documentary ignores an important element of human nature: Cognitive dissonance. That is, we don't always process decisions in a logical, clear headed manner. In particular, we all struggle with affirmation bias. This term refers to our processing of information. Once we've made a decision about a particular topic (especially emotionally-charged topics like politics or religion), we begin filtering all information that comes to us. We cling to information that supports our decision (no matter how extreme it is) and discount or dismiss information that runs counter to our decision. A lot of bad actors are out their posting stuff that is extreme on both sides, which plays on our affirmation bias. So we decide Trump was ripped off in the election and start searching for articles to confirm our assessment, social media picks up on this and sends us more stuff than we can read in a day. After several hours of reading this stuff, we become absolutely convinced that it was a mass conspiracy to steal the election. I've had conversations with relatives that buy all this conspiracy stuff and I wonder what planet they are living on. Now that I've seen this documentary, I know exactly what's happening. Unfortunately, the document is long on problems and short on solutions. Most of their solutions don't seem to be realistic or really effective. I fear the current course is going to lead us to Civil War in 20 years. I'm getting started on building my bunker..."}, {"id": 467, "text": "The conversation intended to be made by The Social Dilemma is one that should be had, and indeed the documentary made a number of basic points as to why. Unfortunately, the points never went beyond surface level, and provided almost no evidence of correlation between social media and the issues claimed to be caused by them, rather, a group of individuals making extremely common blanket statements and expecting the viewer to make the connection between social media and the issues potentially caused by it.The message was further undercut by over the top cornball dramatizations inter cut between conversations with real people. The dramatizations, were not only distractingly poorly acted, but they did a great deal to lessen the impact of the overall message by creating ridiculous scenarios and extremes that would never unfold in the way they were shown. It made the entire effort seem heavy handed and ludicrous.They further undercut themselves by pointing out at almost every stop that the problems they ascribe to social media were already prominent and on the rise prior to the peak of social media, throwing into question if Social Media is at fault in any way or if these problems are a natural progression.While it did find it's footing midway through the second half, focusing on things such as the rampant Fake News and Emotional impacts on impressionable youths living in a world where they are constantly evaluated, the bulk of the movie focused on advertising in a very strange and incorrect way.The assertion that was covered over a significant portion of the film was that people were profiled and sold to advertisers so that their behavior might be modified by said advertisers so that they would engage with the advertised product. This of course sounds very scary until you realize that what is being said is essentially Advertisements trick you into doing what they want, which of course is the entire point of advertising. Advertising has always been directed at audiences that the companies feel are most related to a product, and the end goal of ads are to get you to engage with the product, there would be no point in advertising if the goal wasn't engagement. However, in this film it was framed as manipulation or behavior modification and heavily implied as nefarious.In the end, this documentary had the right intention, but was unable to stay focused nor successfully demonstrate the points it should have easily been able to. If you are interested based on the film description, then you will likely be engaged enough to enjoy it, however it will not bring anything new to the table."}, {"id": 468, "text": "A lot of the reviews talk about how one-sided this documentary is, and maybe I'm only saying this because I don't know--but what is the other side they want to hear about?

I think it was made pretty clear that nobody initially intended for the internet to become what it has. This documentary is great because it's revealing what the initial intentions were and what they are now. People are mad that they're blaming capitalism and victimizing users and taking the responsibility off of them, but why is that wrong? It's like telling drug addicts or cigarette smokers that they're in the wrong for trying the cigarette in the first place. THE ENTIRE POINT is that these companies are manipulating us by exploiting our basic human desires and profiting off of them, like the need for connection and desire for information. Not to mention how a huge target audience for tech industries is CHILDREN. Did they miss the whole analogy with magicians?? The fact that millions of people are put under the spell of these companies should tell you that it isn't about how much self control we should have. They are purposely breaking down our self control and controlling us instead. People have this wishfully ignorant idea that things can't be so bad--well they are, and that's exactly what this documentary shows you. It's sad, and messed up for sure, but a good amount of the people in power do not care about you, your health, or wether you even live or die. They want to make money, and the easiest way to do that is to exploit people. We've seen it over and over again throughout history; slavery, gambling, pharmaceutical companies, etc. Wake up!!!!

Instead... we have a system in which we not only gladly carry such devices around with us, but happily pay huge sums for them, buy nice covers for them, willingly use them at every available opportunity.

Also, many people are not aware of the amount of personal information that is being released, therefore we should be concerned about the impact of social media. As far as privacy concerns, worrying about our own information being spread should not be something we need to worry about, but there's nothing we can personally do to stop it. In the film, many experts such as Justin Rosentein, the creator of Facebook's like button, and Sandy Parakilas, former Facebook operations manager. For example, Justin Rosentein speaks about how the intention of creating the like button was to spread positivity, but as time passed, getting a certain amount of likes became something that made teenagers and adults either cool or losers for not getting many likes. Furthermore, there has been an increase in anxiety, depression, and self harm by the girls now in Gen Z. This shows how much social media and something so little such as a like button can affect someone and their mental health negatively. The amount of people addicted to their phone is alarming, but with the algorithm that is used to keep users attached by improving the services through ads or posts. Algorithms are used to build one's definition of success and can also build polarization in our society. Also, even the workers at companies such as Twitter and Facebook don't completely understand or know how the system works besides a few people. With only a few people who actually understands how the system works, no one really knows what can happen with your content. Although there is a technological gap between different countries, most of the time apps such as tik tok and twitter are being used globally. In addition, social media such as Facebook can impact elections as well as other countries being able to manipulate another country using tools created by Facebook. Along with the tools, AI does not know the truth to anything. Overall,the technology's ability to do so is an existential threat which is negatively impacting our society and not the technology itself. Even if one does not use technology, it has already affected them in a way because of the impact technology has on society. Technology has been affecting an individual's mental health, affected people's political opinions, as well as invading someone's personal privacy. The constant use of social networks has normalized people being addicted to their phones to the point where the dinner table would be silent because everyone is using their phones. Watching this film has really opened my eyes about what is going on in the technology world because it is not spoken about on a daily basis while the tech companies are gaining more money everyday. More people should be aware of what happens to their information and the negative effects technology has on the world.

They seemingly have important key people talking about the social media. It taps to some important issues, some of them interesting.Cons: Cheesy acting. The direction feels more like The Secret where everyone talks in riddles at first, to hook you in. I find that to be very manipulative. Which is hypocritical since they talk about social media manipulating people. This movie does the same. Also there is no dialogue, as this is not an unbiased documentary. It is VERY one sided. Which is another hypocrisy, since the movie blames social media for being biased and giving us only the info they want.Of course nothing is black and white. Everyone can choose not to have Facebook, have ad-blocks, use VPNs or duckduckgo instead of google! The internet may manipulate people but so do movies (just like this movie tries to do). The internet is just another thing, like electricity or fire, that can be used for bad or good. The thing is, that in the internet everyone can voice their opinion and have a dialogue. But if you released a biased movie, only 1 side can be heard. This movie is not here to provide solutions but to smear panic via kind-of fake news, pretty much like those it tries to fight against.Yeah, social media profit from advertisements to provide free products. Guess what, TV channels did that since the 60s. I don't like big companies myself but people need to stop demonize everything. Even back in the 90s when Bill Gates was selling Windows 95, people were saying that he is the devil. And yeah back then kids were playing Game Boy instead of Mobile games. Just get a grip and be good parents instead of blaming the people who try to make a buck.

I'll freely admit that I'm an IMDb fan, but that's because I love movies.

I still talk regularly with (my actual) friends.

Especially during the end credits, some advice to parents with children and how to use social media or how to educate them."}, {"id": 476, "text": "The Social Dilemma is an educational documentary that does a very good job at showing just how sophisticated the systems behind your favorite social media apps are. It covers a lot of good topics such as cyberbullying, the dangers of mob mentality, and, of course, all the secrets that big tech giants know about you. It is very informative and enlightens the viewer of just how slippery a slope society is on and how a failure to reform the way we use the internet could be detrimental to the world. One thing I disagreed with in this documentary was the stance on the way you are advertised to today. I, personally, find nothing wrong with ads being personalized to your interests. It is beneficial to both the consumer and the vendor. The problem occurs when this same data is used in a way to give to misinformation or skew the truth to fit a certain viewpoint. Also, I wish they would have spent a little more time telling the viewer what THEY can do to improve social media and how THEY can protect themselves online (this was done during the end credits, but most people probably would have clicked off). All in all, a solid documentary and one that everyone should see."}, {"id": 477, "text": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningTristran Harris was the former 'Design Ethicist' for Google, before quitting and going public, becoming an active critic of the social media phenomenon, encouraging people to delete their social media accounts, before large scale reform is encouraged within the industry. Jeff Orlowski's film then goes on to examine the larger scale impact of the main companies, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat on society as a whole, mainly on the effect on so called 'Generation Z', as well as the modern day phenomena of 'fake news' and it's corrosive effect on world events.Just last week, I did the unthinkable. I left my house without my phone, just plum forgetting it. Without direct access to a computer in my line of work, this would mean a whole day without instant, portable access to my social media feed. This is something I've only ever done once before, but although I feel a bit miffed about it when I first realize I've done it, when the day is done and I've gone a whole day without it, I always feel better, managing to spend the day reconnecting with a time when they weren't available, and you had to amuse yourself in your head.Director Jeff Orlowski here presents a feature that highlights just how dependent the modern world has become on these devices, which is truly astounding when only a comparatively short time ago, they weren't around. To the younger generation, they're effectively a body part, to whom my tribulation last week would have been akin to being without an arm or leg for the day. Orlowski probes into the damaging effect this is having on their self esteem and attention span. As one talking head observes, when the bike was invented, it served a purpose but stayed out of use when not needed, whilst SM makes constant demands on your time, with endless notifications and 'red circles.' Another uses the popular information site Wikipedia to highlight the difference between one use of the internet, with the dominant social interaction pages.It's short and sweet, and while not as searing and in depth as it could have been, it does highlight a very real, modern problem in quite an enlightening way. ***"}, {"id": 478, "text": "Yeah, it's pretty good. I think they made a lot of good points. Even shocked me with the degree to which things I'm not aware of are happening. Some is suprising, some not so much.However, speaking for myself, I don't and have never loved or even really liked 'social' media. I absolutely detest being on my phone, (though this has developed over years, and younger people may not become this way until after years of phone usage). I remain absolutely appalled at the degree to which people use technology and get too involved. Twitter has never made sense to me. I consider it a loathsome technology, and I've really only actually tweeted once EVER. And I have one single post on my wall on Facebook. I am not the norm for sure.But the thing I just can't seem to process is the degree to which Americans haven't grasped how they are also part of the problem of technology. Most of them virtually never leave their houses, except to shop. (I would know. I walk around neighborhoods all the time), and they also, at least where I live, are isolated in their cars. Where I live, (other places may be different), people have basically built themselves into actual physical cages, (cars and homes), and don't interact with other people when they go to restaurants. You could be forgiven for thinking that they are phone addicts, but the REAL problem is that most people don't go to restaurants to socialize in the first place. And you're not really allowed to truly be yourself there in any case.What is the point I'm trying to make? Well, I personally think that technology addiction is an environmental factor. The polarization in our country is less due to the fact that algorithms are dividing us, and more due to the fact that Americans don't hardly ever leave their houses. They could solve this by actually going out at least once a week for reasons other than to shop, but of course, there are no actual public spaces where you can hang out and literally do whatever you want, at least where I live. Going to a restaurant may make you feel like you're part of the public hive, but it's approximately the same as trying to get all your nutrition from a milkshake. So to Americans, nothing seems wrong, because they are conditioned this way. But in the midst of all of this, they nonetheless log on to the internet too much and argue with people with wildly different views from all across the country, which is inherently flawed. Are people isolated because of their phones? Or are they isolated and lonely first and foremost because Americans hardly ever go outside in the first place, so living in the US feels like living on the moon?Anyway, the reason that people don't tend to do anything spontaneously IN PUBLIC is because everything is PRIVATIZED. It's not really that hard to understand. If you are 'out in public', you are likely at a restaurant, so why would other people spontaneously want to do something with you, when that's not the reason that they came in the first place? Yet, we all blame technology. You walk into a restaurant and think that the person that's on their computer or phone is an addict or something, when in actual fact, it's actually quite likely that they are casually waiting to strike up conversations with other people as they walk in the door. But the person who comes through the door looks to you like they COULD be coming to strike up a conversation with you, but you don't know that. To YOU, it actually looks like they could be trying to find their friend who they came to meet, and then they get distracted by the hostess anyway. It's a complete mismatch that also makes people feel lonely and isolated. Not to mention that people who are out in public just to eat are usually under time constraints, which prevents them from having a prolonged conversation with a stranger, and no one usually wants to have their social lives revolve around the dining room of a McDonald's or what have you, so the same people USUALLY aren't there on a regular basis. Multiply these types of interactions thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times across the country and you discover that our perception of 'technology addiction' might in many cases be a completely contrived and fake crisis.Get a clue, people. Create a better world without so many parking lots, fewer cars, and with REAL public spaces.***Disclaimer*** No protests where I live, so I have rose-colored glasses on to a certain degree, and I admit that.

The thing is, we are all victim to this manipulation. I have witnessed childhood friends stop talking because of social media, and to the point where they now despise each other. I am convinced they would have still found a common ground if it weren't for a third party manipulation. As Jaron Lanier explained in his Tedtalk, It takes a long time to build love. It takes a short time to ruin love.There are psychological vulnerabilities that we all share. We do have to collectively rise up and demand better for ourselves.Lastly, I would like to thank all the contributors featured in this film and all the people behind the scenes. A++++ for Netflix, and I would say this is the best documentary I have ever seen."}, {"id": 481, "text": "A very thoughtful, well put together documentary that outlines the inherent problems humans now face with social media, and the challenges that lie ahead.In the film, 'Users' is the term used to describe illegal drug users and software. Relevant for numerous reasons. A saying that is relevant here is that The road to hell is often paved with good intention. The designers and engineers behind Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc likely did not foresee addiction and anxiety related problems, as well as the spreading of fake news and divisions among people as a result of their designs. However, these giant tech companies clearly know this now as a lot of their original VP's and designers have opted out and no longer work there any more.Unfortunately these giant tech company's put profits ahead of the wellness of humankind....constantly searching for ways to keep you logged in, stuff to click on to pull you back, basically the longer you are on there (clicking away) the more money they make. Again, quite probably they originally would not have thought of the destructive influence this would have on a humans moods, level of attention (or lack of) and disruption of their own interactions with the real world. But they know now, and this stuff needs to be talked about.So with interviews from ex-employees, this film eloquently explains some fundamental problems with social media and how it more or less dehumanizes people. I personally am seriously contemplating unplugging or quitting my social media accounts.... I mean heck, what have they actually given me? Facebook was so much better when it first came out, no 'like' buttons, minimal or no annoying ads, no pop-ups, no messenger etc. Basically it wasn't intrusive, just you and your vacation+family photos, a few comments and that was it !!!P.S. The documentary shows interviews of ex-employees giving you the lowdown, straight shooting about it and that we need to fix it; and it segues repeatedly to acted out scenes of a family. The family has a cast of characters and shows them using their phones on a daily basis. One reviewer said the acting wasn't good -- Not fair!! The acting is excellent, and to me portrayed exactly how people use their phones and talk to each other."}, {"id": 482, "text": "The central message of this documentary is very interesting and I found the sections with industry figures and experts to be informative albeit one sided.What let's this documentary down is that it uses the same methods as the social media and technology companies that it is criticising to get its message across. The dramatisations are mixed with news footage which blends reality with the fictional characters and these characters are primarily there to affect you emotionally and to get you to buy in with the key message. This is a tactic that is used by social media companies, fake news stories etc. and the same is true of the use of music to effect you emotionally.This documentary would have been more far reaching if it had not included the dramatic elements, especially the children's TV level of presentation of how AI works (even though in reality we are at the machine learning stage rather than actual AI), add in figures from the other side of the argument and this would have made the documentary essential watching.At the end of the day what social media and technology companies are doing now is no different to what has been done by people with a vested interest in your engagement with their product / ideals at different stages across history... for example speeches, newspapers, political flyers, supermarkets, documentary film makers."}, {"id": 483, "text": "A friend of mine from Thailand has a saying, 'I can't afford free', I figure the majority of tech users may find value in such a sentiment. There is some useful info and eye opening perspectives but its a very edited and slanted presentation. Could have used more actual data and less opinion, especially from the hippy dreadlock guy. The funny thing is they actually mention where the fix is but coast right past it to claim gubment is our only hope via regulation. The part they get 100% correct is AI will play to our weaknesses long before it plays to our strengths. This has always been a truth of life and applies to everything across the board outside of close personal relationships which drops to a 'may' instead of 'will'. Older people may remember claims made in this movie have been made before, some about different things, some about the same things. And like in each of those previous cases the action that actually solves the issue is swept under the rug with barely a word in favor of hand wringing and superstition. I would recommend people give this a watch, especially parents of teen and pre-teen children. This tech is going to expand and integrate into our lives more and more.

It does brings awareness to important questions about the impact of social media but failed to address people who are between the above mentioned junior and senior citizen brackets. Users in current climate are lot smarter than this documentary gives them credit for, look at multimillion empire made by influencers exploiting the same algorithm presented by these platforms. Yes, there will always be non-believers, as there always has been people who didn't believe in Holocaust so they won't believe in climate change either even when we're amidst a pandemic and wildfires around the globe.One of the tech guy said Oh I am nervous I need to check with my lawyers first but then failed to say anything which we haven't heard before. All these dramatic tropes to make it more dramatic Oh something Salacious is coming instead of giving something real substantial which can change the tech industry. Everything mentioned or dramatised you have heard, read or seen on an articles, YouTube, Ted talk or on Podcasts. They skipped past the biggest issue how these platforms are listening to you how you talk to your friends about something whether insurance, cars, vacuum cleaner or in my case once Compost Bin and once Spotify Premium Duo option and suddenly I got ads for Compost Bins on my Facebook and e-mail in already subscribed Spotify account about Premium Duo upgrade option. Both things I didn't googled but just talked to my friend about it. Now, that would have been really eye opening for viewers as you have all these insiders talking about the side effects but unfortunately noone goes beyond their Ted Talks bullet points.The side effects of social media mentioned in this have been mentioned many times before anxiety, likes pressure, fake news, misinformation, body image, suicide rates gone higher, surgeries to get Angelina Jolie lips, photoshops, clickbait, stunts, gimmicks, first giving controversial statements, then fake apologies videos etc etc etc. Anyone would do anything for some CLOUT... As Yuval Noah Harari said  Humans were always far better at inventing tools than using them wisely.The makers just like the platforms they criticised merely gave about 5 minutes how to improve our experience using social media. I would have preferred if they had spend more time in giving ideas to big corporations on how to make their platforms better, how to change their algorithm in betterment of the society instead of disintegration of the society.

I would expect a documentary to deliver concrete information, numbers, objective view of a situation. This seems more like a conspiracy video. It brings claims of you being the product and says that the ads, feeds and news personalization is something new and dangerous, but really when has the media not been influenced (even TV, newspapers whatever all of them could have been and at some point in time were influenced so there is no real difference).Everyone is already aware of this. It doesn't bring any new details around algorithms, does no investigation for information and feels like someone just invited some people over to a studio to deliver their opinion (and yes, it is in format of opinions) and hacked it together into a movie over a weekend without even trying to do any extra work around the matter.Skip if you value your time, you already know everything that will be said."}, {"id": 487, "text": "Don't get me wrong, there was some great insight on offer in this film, but it did shift the goalposts from identifying that it is the way the technology is manipulated for profit that is causing the problem, to blaming the technology. ie get off social media, don't let your family use it etc etc.There isn't anything inherently wrong with the connectivity that a phone can give you, the problem is when the companies that offer the services use access to your attention to generate profit and then turn that into mining your attention as a resource that cause the problem, and the filmmakers and talking heads clearly established that in this film, and then let it slip into blaming the devices.Me being able to have conversations and share information with my family and friends is not a dilemma, a third part controlling and shaping that in order to keep me unnecessarily engaged and available to be monetorised, now that's the problem. And that was he fault here. The panel didn't manage to keep that clear distinction in focus.

I simply think that in what it tries to do, it falls short, or does not provide a full story. This movie does an excellent job explaining the many prevalent issues of social media, and the problems that arise when a given individual forgoes the responsibilities that they have to themselves and others, when they spend too much time on social media, or the internet in general. However, it falls short in a myriad of other areas. It fails to show the important and beneficial ways in which social media can bring us together, promote closeness with one's family and friends, or promote social change in the world around us. When used as a tool and when used to help promote someone's preexisting social life, be it by connecting to friends or family, or people many miles away, social media does not necessarily harm anyone's life, it can help augment it. Simply put, I am rating this movie 4/10*, not because it is necessarily bad, but because it does not promote conversation about the usage of social media. I would most definitely rate this movie higher if it promoted a genuine conversation of the usage of social media in our daily life, but it instead only gives us a single argument against it, one which has been already been presented time and time again by other documentary producers, film writers, and authors. Had it actually promoted debate on the topic of internet and social media platforms, rather than just bash them, it would indeed been a good documentary.*The score of 4/10 is based on the fact that the average possible score out of 10 is 5.5, putting this movie's score at slightly below average.

The fact that technology can adapt and become better and better predicting behavior and therefore manipulate and ultimately control society's behaviors is disturbing.The fact that the very inventors of these platforms don't allow their children to use what they've created should speak volumes in itself.

It's helpful to stay connected to the people that are close to you, but it can have a very negative impact on people's mental health. This is especially the case for teenagers, as they are so focused on getting likes on their photos.Being popular on the various social media platforms is a necessity for many teenagers, and if they don't reach a certain level of popularity then it often causes negative feelings and depression. The statistics they showed to back this up was powerful.The end of the documentary showed us exactly how we can fight back against the system, and I now look at social media very differently than I did ninety minutes ago. I'll certainly be thinking more carefully about what I see when I log on to the various platforms.Overall, this was such a well-crafted, thought-provoking film, and I wouldn't mind watching it again which isn't something I usually say about documentaries.

Phones, TV, computers, pretty much any device that mines data without you knowing.

There are clips of him delivering lectures, in political panels, and I think they even showed him giving a TedTalk. Now Mr. Harris is the CEO of The Center for Humane Technology. Again, deceptively subtle, but at the conclusion of the documentary, where they provide some antithesis to the issue; the magical solution, they showed a bunch of software engineers huddled around some code and threw out the power word humane around. The mod changed from fiercely tense to happy and calming, and this again seemed like the perfect resolution to the issues presented in the documentary.

I won't say this scenario doesn't play out in reality, but we're touching on the extremes here.Now, there isn't anything wrong with such a radical portrayal of social media, it might just be what the world needs, but it's that it pushes forth someone elses agenda is the inevitable irony and laughable quality of this documentary.So yes, this is a great documentary and I recommend that you give it a watch, but apply your own judgement with how they display their arguments on screen, for your own sake."}, {"id": 499, "text": "They seem to think that all FAaNG biz models are the same. For the most part, amazon and google don't play the game of increasing session duration. Google is successful if it gets the RIGHT ad in front of you. If they advertise something you don't need or want, it's a waste of time. If they tell you about a product, service, or price you didn't know about- SUCCESS.The Facebook behavior is rather bad in that they make the tribes MORE tribal and feed fuel to the fires.Amazon is well over 50% search vs browse. Most people are hunters not gatherers. To the extent they foster browsing it is because the customer wanted to browse.No comments on apple; the most closed of the group? Come on! They are guilty of selling people many things they don't need."}, {"id": 500, "text": "If you have not lived under a rock for the last ten years, most of stuff said in this documentary are not new. Other documentaries on the topic have been done and more or less what you will hear, has been said millions of times. It is interesting to hear opinions about social media from people that actually created these tools. Netflix realized overall a decent documentary and it is for sure one of their best production realized lately.The film is very well edited, there are a lot of video contributions from news and other documentaries that enrich the narrative, and a few scripted scenes, I did not like this choice, they could just get rid of those, in my opinion were not well realized and basically useless. I agree with the fact that the situation is worrying and that there is a lot of disinformation on the internet, giving birth to dangerous ideologies and mentalities, but over-dramatize this using scripted scenes or ominous music is not the right way to sensibilize people on this topic, instead it will cause the opposite effect. They should have focus more on just exposing facts, instead of making a drama.The Social Dilemma is not the best documentary on the topic but is worth to be watched, if you want to be updated on the current situation about social media and the power/influence that these tools have in 2020."}, {"id": 501, "text": "This documentary is nothing but over-dramatization of certain facts. It is completely overlooking at the positive side of the information age (that has made our life so, so much convenient) and only amplifying its black mirror side. Companies like Facebook and Google do realize there are some ethical issues and they have been investing very heavily on preventing negative effects of social media and information. The only problem here is: It's a new media. We all are hungry for the news that we desire to see. All news channels exactly exploit that fact. But the great point here is: We still have a control on what we want to see. We do not have the same control with Fox-news, CNN, BBC, Zee news, Aajtak, etc. If you think some friend is spreading fake news, you can unfriend them. I often unfollow the folks who I believe are spreading fake news. Gmail, Facebook, Google, are the tools that you can totally use for your advantage if you always make conscious choice. The key here is being conscious. If you are a person, who tends to always act subconsciously, it is not a medium for you. Any addiction is bad. Alcohol addiction, Iphone addiction, etc. That does not mean Apple should stop producing IPhone because now many folks spend over 50% of their life on looking at the phone. A course of discipline and concentration should be a part of our school curriculum."}], "reviews_amount": 502}
