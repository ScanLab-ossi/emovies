This documentary asks questions that many adherents to the religion may be uncomfortable with, but does so objectively with some needed levity."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Cameron provides a thorough coverage of Christianity telling the story of how the religion came to be what it is today. He exposes the disparities in the bible which most tend to ignore or sheer away from. The documentary leaves you questioning what else in the bible doesn't hold up. 10/10 A great watch, and a great film debut for Cameron."}, {"id": 4, "text": "It's OK. I feel like the documentary made a lot of sense. I need to check the verses that they quote and probably should go through all of the Bible first but in any case I found it fairly thought provoking.I came here to check the reviews and saw some ppl who have been offended by this and consider it fake news. I don't think it's fake news I think it gives a fairly balanced approach to the reality of the situation.My true rating is probably 7.5/10. It's good, worth a watch but won't say anything you didn't already knew."}, {"id": 5, "text": "This is a fascinating documentary that brings us up to date with biblical history in an entertaining way. Very thought provoking and contrasts well the biblical stories with the real historical context of the times. Would thoroughly recommend."}, {"id": 6, "text": "A great documentary taking a serious and yet entertaining look at the history of the rise and rise Christianity."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I actually learned quite a bit from the film, but was very off-put by the cringe humor. Maybe you need to be Australian... however, it was refreshing (as an American) to see someone other than Ken Ham speak about the Bible with that accent. I would much prefer less movie references and the animations to support the information being presented by the experts, not as silly gags. (Score is weighted to balance grumpy Christians)"}, {"id": 8, "text": "Really excelent doc on the history behind the messiah, christianity and the gospels. Excellent presentation with humour and facts. Will make people question the pillars which they have taken for granted about Jezus and christianity. Thats what a good doc shud do inspire you to research the facts more. Highly recommend it"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Cameron delivers a fun, direct , and understandable explanation of how Christianity has been shaped and formed into a digestible product for a hungry humanity. A must watch if ya don't know a thing about where the church evolved from and where it is today."}, {"id": 10, "text": "I found it a interesting watch and I find the reviews even more interesting with how many outright bash people beliefs. Imagine this but it was the Koran, how tolerant do you think those believers would be of the movie? All in all worth watching but Christianity is a easy target and it does not take much courage at all to make a movie like this about it."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I'm a huge history buff and I'm obsessed with the history of Christianity. I was so surprised by this documentary because of how many things I just didn't know. How the gospels are broken down and examined is true genius. It was like evidence presented in a court case. A must watch if you are a big history buff."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I have struggled to watch documentaries for years now. Most lose my interest because they don't ask compelling enough questions about the topic they're exploring. I couldn't make it through Religulous for this very reason-it was just too easy. I'm one who doesn't consider Christianity-or religion in general-to be some joke that any adolescent can dismantle with a couple of clich\u00e9s. But I very much appreciate sophisticated questions, and that's exactly what this documentary is chock full of. It's also fun to watch from beginning to end. I laughed out loud several times and had to rewind. One of the best things is that this documentary is CLEAN. I very much appreciated this as I have little kids crawling all over me at all times. I am definitely looking forward to the next Deep Dive production!"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Incredibly interesting set of interviews with biblical scholars wittily and insight fully edited by Cameron Reilly. Some of the scholars, though by no means all, uphold that Jesus of Nazareth was a completely mythical character. Whichever way you look at this, even if there was a historical Jesus then there is still the question of how much of his life was made up by the Gospel writers. Even if you believe that there was a historical figure if you take out the virgin birth, miracles, the resurrection, what is left of Jesus of Nazareth? His sayings? However, the main theme of the film is how a small, insignificant movement ended up becoming the official and only legal religion of the Roman Empire eventually becoming a major world religion. Thanks in great part to Saint Paul. Anyway, well worth watching with plenty of food for thought for all. Enjoy!"}, {"id": 14, "text": "An enjoyable take on a fascinating topic. The director is clearly attempting to be fair and appeal to both believers and non-believers. It's a well constructed documentary with high production values. And it races along. Great stuff."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Cameron's put together a wealth of research and interviews, mixed it all together with the trademark humour from his podcasting career, and gives a strong sense that the picture is so much bigger - that there's more yet to explore and discuss. It's got a lot of content, so be patient with it. And bear in mind this very much about the history of early Christianity and doctrine (and changes in historians' perspective), and less about the mythical or religious elements - although they do enter into it too. Maybe it should have a byline: How to fine-tune a religion for maximum market share and domination, if you're one of the Apostles."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Well, I thought I had a pretty good handle on early Christian history but found a whole lot more information in this. The documentary presents a number of scholars who pretty much agree on the information that's presented. This gives you a lot of confidence that you are getting facts in a topic that is not well disposed to facts. Great stuff."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Extremely well produced documentary that moves along at a high lick of pace. Entertaining and funny whilst tackling a vast and serious topic. Insightful narrative, drawing in a wide and balanced range of expert opinions. This feature length docu should really be the pilot for several 10 episode series on Netflix or History Channel."}, {"id": 18, "text": "As is Cameron Reilly's signature style, this documentary effectively mixes top notch historical scholarship with humor and good fun. Reilly challenges the traditional perspectives around Christianity's rise by examining its context and critically assessing its surviving texts. Everyone from the most devout Christian to the most ardent skeptic has something to gain from watching this entertainment and well-crafted film."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Cameron has done a truly outstanding job on a challenging and difficult topic, one for which far too many people in the 21st century do not have an informed perspecitve. This film can cure this gap and does so in a very humorous, and at the same time, enlightening way. The documentary is packed with fascinating knowledge and insights by some of the most leading edge experts in the field. I was particularly pleased to see Richard Carrier featured as one of the knowledgeable experts in this production. Someday, I believe Carrier will get his due respect for the ground breaking work he has been doing with books like On the Historicity of Jesus. I wish I could get everyone I know to sit down and watch this film for the self improved knowledge position they will gain, not mention how thoroughly they will be entertained in the process. 10 of 10!"}, {"id": 20, "text": "Fantastic film! Cameron Reilly brings his unique experience in marketing to critically analyse the canonical doctrine of the history of Jesus. Rather than presenting a personal viewpoint, 'Marketing the Messiah' instead relies on Biblical Historians to lay out how complicated and convoluted our conception of Christ today is, as opposed to historical fact, as well as the processes of how this happened. Fans of the classic documentary of 'The Crusades' by the late Terry Jones will be all over this. Absolutely fascinating and told in a humorous style. Couldn't recommend it any higher. Hope the DVD's in the store for Christmas :)"}, {"id": 21, "text": "A very thought provoking look at the origins of Christianity. Who was the Messiah, who wrote the Gospels and what do we really know? This is an excellent examination of these issues from both sides of the faith divide that will leave you wanting to watch it over again; just to pick up on the weight of academic knowledge that passed you by while you were laughing at the humour in it. Highly entertaining!"}, {"id": 22, "text": "Marketing the Messiah gets to the heart of the genesis of Christianity in a clear and entertaining way. It encapsulates really good commentary from a number of scholars who have deeply considered the early development of Christianity - all these scholars provide clear commentary that is both thought-provoking and easy to follow.The film does an excellent job of showing grabs of their commentary collectively and sequentially by topic, interspersed with comical takes that are on point with the topic or aspect being discussed at that point.This info-entertainment-doco is likely to appeal to and be appreciated by a wide audience. Well worth seeing for an appreciation of history then and as a reflection of the role of religion in society today."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Full of insightful facts, scholarly comment and funny cartoons giving an excellent, sometimes funny, sometimes profane potted history of the beginnings of Pauline christianity."}, {"id": 24, "text": "This documentary is all the better for relying on academics to tell the story of how the christian bible was assembled and the doctrines of the church adapted from a Jewish cult to serve as a mass state religion for (mostly) non-Jews. Light-hearted and goofy narration keeps the pace going in what could be otherwise very dry subject matter. Nicely done."}, {"id": 25, "text": "The creators did an excellent job of framing the stories of the NT with actual historical context. Seemingly dry information was presented in a palatable way and sprinkled with some levity; far better than a lot of the trash that passes for history you find on cable. I could seriously watch this at least a dozen more times and find something new every time."}, {"id": 26, "text": "After seeing this excellent documentary you will never feel the same about Christianity again, because it shines a light in an area where few people ever see. That area is the convoluted and contradictory origins of the religion which are never discussed in any church. They are never discussed because the origins of Christianity are a total confusing mess, with Biblical contradictions, different interpretations, historical uncertainties, doctrines borrowed from earlier religions and many other obscure aspects. This well done documentary will make you realize why priests and ministers essentially want everyone to not critically think about where this religion came from but just believe it. They want you to just believe because they know the origins of Christianity undermine it totally as shown in this documentary. The documentary has a group of biblical scholars and your excellent host Cameron Riley who ties it all together in a most interesting and entertaining way. Check this out."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Over the years I've read the entire Bible straight through from beginning to end 3 times, trying to find whether it contains the thread of a consistent narrative or message. I couldn't find one, but I didn't know enough about the background of how the Bible came into existence to understand why it's such a jumbled mess.This documentary provides the background to understand how the Bible came into existence and the origins of the stories in the New Testament. Absolutely fascinating, whether you're a believer or not."}, {"id": 28, "text": "That everybody should see. Don't believe the stupid trolls, this is was the perfect christmas' eve movie, combining funny animation and humour with spot-on historical and biblical analysis. Highly recommended."}, {"id": 29, "text": "Longer than it should be for my taste, or maybe I'm bored with the subject and as time goes on I appreciate more direct, condensed information in general. But more than a 5 something score for sure. When I came here and saw the stupid 1 star reviews it confirmed that lots of them are offended christian trolls. So, as many others here, I'll give it a 10 to balance things out, and I hate to do this because I'd like to score it fairly as per my opinion on it and know how other with critic capacity feel, but fanatics take that away from us and I don't like to let an obvious injustice slide. Like in other controversial topics, racism while BLM, the incel or eminist-triggering stuff, or superhero fanboys without critic sense, it's become a hotspot for fanatic trolls spewing poison."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I was always told, as a kid, not to discuss politics or religion at the dinner table. But those are ultimately the only two things that deserve real discussion. We live in an age where people are killed for a humorous glance at Mohammed. Are we in the West any different? We need to deflate the sanctimony that defends unquestioning orthodoxy. That's what Reilly's film does. Academic discussion mixed with humour. Facts leavened with laughter. Just imagine how the world might be different if al Qaeda had a sense of humour."}, {"id": 31, "text": "What a fascinating topic and one which hasn't had much overt consideration in recent times yet continues to bubble away just under the surface of so many aspects of our modern society. Cameron, an amateur historian, has yet managed to bring together a wide range of biblical scholars that cut through the fog of christian 'marketing' and paint a clear picture of what the bible actually says; contradictions and all. I loved this film and would like to see more like it. The format would play well with a television documentary series."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Typical of cam he's gone really deep into his research just like in his podcasts. I've never read the bible and have always been a firm atheist and could never understand how Christianity has survived this long and through the modern era. This film explains it all and is hilarious to boot!! Well done and looking forward to the series and more of the Julius Caesar and Jesus Christ comparisons!"}, {"id": 33, "text": "There is not one single serious scholar in this production! They speak about myths and they are themselves the myth-makers! They (obviously voluntarily) ignore/skip a multitude of historical evidence from primary sources, and they are trying to change history in the most amateur way! I wonder why did they even bother!"}, {"id": 34, "text": "Great work all the way through! Balanced, insightful and funny. And then it gets ruined at the end when you say he doesn't exist. Santa. Really??"}, {"id": 35, "text": "Cameron Reilly has been an early history podcaster and on the top of that game for well over a decade. He finally made a documentary about ancient history and a topic dear to his heart. The vast amount of historical facts and funny anecdotes makes this a must-watch documentary for anyone interested in religion or history. Very impressive line-up of international experts and scholars too. 10/10"}, {"id": 36, "text": "Anyone can create a documentary and propel it in any way they like by carefully selecting people to interview.Remember, this is not a free documentary, the maker earns money. It's easier to earn money by making something controversial."}, {"id": 37, "text": "Did Jesus exist?Cameron Reilly has created a fantastic historical analysis of how Christianity was formed, grew, and the internal conflicts inside the religion. There are fantastic interviews with many notable religious studies and history professors from around the world.This is a wonderful scholarly work, and really casts new light on to the development of who wrote the bible, when, and how this evolved over 2,000 years. Discussions of how Judaism and Christianity are fascinating.Highly recommended. Also there are many funny parts. It is really an engaging movie for anyone who enjoys history, religion, etc. This is not boring, it is a really fun movie and will intrigue you and educate you. Great for any night of the week."}, {"id": 38, "text": "As you might guess from the title, anybody who is personally bought into the (better: a version of the) religious story of Jesus will not like this movie very much. Which is a pity, in a way, because it does provide a great deal of historical background of that figure and the genesis of its story which could be instructive even to believers. However, its irreverent presentation, its use of humor in places the devout might find inappropriate, and also some of the questions it asks and answers it gives will make it difficult for many Christians to enjoy. They do, however, make it a great little documentary for the rest of us with some interest in those early days of nascent Christianity that many people (including most believers) know precious little about, even though they are really a key to understanding some of the more bizarre facets of that faith --- chiefly among them the central question of this film: how does a fringe cult of a marginalized Middle-Eastern people become the state religion of the empire that executed its founder? Assembling a range of perspectives from a variety of interviews with scholars in the field, and providing some background on the times during which this remarkable development took place, this film attempts to give an answer to this question. Well worth watching."}, {"id": 39, "text": "The first thing I must acknowledge are the production values and the quality of the presentation. If this had gone out on the BBC or History Channel, I would not have had any hints that this was a Kickstarter-funded project in any way. Cameron's style is objective, gently humorous but never mocking, sceptical but never cynical and very watchable. For those familiar with his podcast shows, this is toned down on the humour and turned up on the academic and factual credibility scale. An aspect that reveals the overall quality of the programme is that it flew by and left me wanting more; much more. The best part of two hours is nowhere near enough to allow a deep examination of this huge topic and therefore I really hope that lots of people watch this movie, review it, tell their friends and we may see it as a pilot for a series which can go much deeper. I cannot recommend this highly enough for all viewers who are remotely interested in this most fascinating of subjects, both those with religious beliefs, those with none and those who are undecided. There's no preaching but a whole lot of learning going on."}, {"id": 40, "text": "Like religious institutes this documentary also selects specific passages from the bible. Depicting a half baked picture of the meaning of Jesus and who he is. It also quotes erroneous modern bible translations in order to appeal itself and inorganically attempts to explain circumstances, presenting them as false. For example, the show tells us Paul was visited by Jesus's Ghost, which is incorrect as it is said Jesus rose as a material being from the grave. It is often trying to find contradictions that are based on fallacious interpretations which makes them nothing more than confusions on part of those attempting to reveal it as contradiction. A thorough understanding of contextualized scripture is missing, as usual and thus a mundane interpretation is put forth which is completely inappropriate because one hundred percent of the bible is not in reference to mundane scenarios but divine ones.It would be nice to think finally, a documentary revealing the discrepancy of Christianity but that is most certainly not what you are being given, sorry."}, {"id": 41, "text": "I mean, I'm agnostic and I expected more serious documentary. Actually, this is one sided scholars documentary mixed with animated humor and cheesy music. Scholars sounds very serious and they all have same short sentences. But where is other side? Where is N.T. Whright, one of leading Biblical scholars today, along with William Lane Craig, David Bloomberg, Norman Geisler, Frank Turek, DAvid Habermas and many others catholic or protestant scholars or well readed experts today who are not so well known to academia circle. Where is Barth Erhman, an agnostic, who can also contribute to this topic since he is one of the most prolific authors on subject of early Christianity in western world.And the red flag about reviews. Most 10/10 reviews are new accounts that written only this review and that rings bells that this is marketing from crew team and producers. I have watched many documentaries and live debates about origin of Christianity and ressurection of Jesus and this documentary bringing nothing new and insightful - it's marketing for those who only just want to confirm they agnosticism or better say atheism. It's much easier to watch this fun documentary than read book tetralogy of Jesus and Paul by N.T.Wright which is more than 4000 pages long. Think about it!"}, {"id": 42, "text": "Christianity did not appear out of nowhere. On top of the obvious influences from Judaism, the influence of Greco-Roman culture, myth and society pervade the early writings of the nascent 'Jesus-cult'. Cameron Reilly has worked painstakingly to gather together some of the world's top-tier biblical scholars, including Mark Goodacre, David Fitzgerald &amp; Richard Carrier. Together with these interviews, Cameron narrates a succinct, often humorous, history of how all of the pieces from the ancient world came together to form the world religion that Christianity is today. He does this without relying solely on the Biblical sources (which often obscure the more 'human' aspects of religion), but also draws upon contemporary ancient sources to fill in the blanks often left out by the often biased ecclesiastical documents.I highly recommend this documentary, both to believers and non-believers alike. I've noticed some negative reviews from some Christian reviewers who apparently have never read the Bible or feigned to even think outside the groupthink box inculcated by their church bubble. Open your mind. Listen, learn, and maybe laugh a bit. With the ever-present influence of Christianity over society, why not learn something about the origins of this religion? You'll be a better informed human being for having done so.My only complaint is that it could have been a little bit longer."}], "reviews_amount": 43}
