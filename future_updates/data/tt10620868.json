Obviously the budget is limited so the whole movies was filmed in one city block to cut down on expenses. Decent acting but some details were missed. The boy stayed in that building for so long. And even though he had tainted short hair. And presumably ni beard hair. His look didn't change one bit. Kind of an obvious point... Other things like the the fact that zombies hear noise in an apartment several levels up from down in the street. And somehow manage to identify exactly where the noise is coming from. Even for a normal human being. That's extremely difficult. I could go on for a long time with these remarks but it's ok for a Netflix movie. Worth watching if you're a zombie film enthusiast"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Yes, it was almost like a remake of a French zombie film, The Night Eats the World, about a male survivor communicating with a female one, down to the zip-lining to the other building. But the Korean one tried to hard to be cute and romantic for its own good. Yes maybe it will be more marketable in Asia and the ending is more uplifting, however it's not better than the French one."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I enjoyed the film. The effects were hood with the infected and well acted by all......including the Zombies. Nothing too gory and the bloody letting is quite restrained really but still nasty enough to give a sense of tension etc. It's a lot more teenaged and romantically themed that the superior French original The Night Ate the World which I really enjoyed much more. But, this is still watchable. Some big plot holes aside its enjoyable and the sense of being trapped is well conveyed. More upbeat than expected. Zombies seems a little easily repelled for my liking....but I guess you can't just have the two cast members killed or film over.The fireman scene and use of a drone was interesting.Not as good as the incredible Train to Busan but worth a watch."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I rather enjoyed #Alive, it didn't feel like the average zombie movie. There seemed to be some parallels between the imagined threat here, and the very real threat, Coronavirus. There's a great scene where our man looks outside fearfully, and then looks at his food rations, something many people have done in 2020.It's very nicely acted, nicely shot, it feels very fresh and current. The moments of horror were very nicely done, and never became too silly. Some nice twists, it's never predictable.It has a real sense of doom, and terror about it, the way things gradually collapse, that said the action begins quickly, they don't hang around.It's good, 7/10."}, {"id": 4, "text": "The first act was interesting but as the story progresses the main character seems to Be dumber and dumber. The ending literally annoyed the hell out of me. Sacrificing common sense for cinematic shots omg. 6/10"}, {"id": 5, "text": "#Alive is a South Korean film by first time director Il Cho. Going into this film I expected an absolute mess, all I had seen was the horrible title. But I was pleasantly surprised with a pretty interesting take on zombie movies. For the most part.Technically I didn't think this film was anything special. No element of filmmaking was exceptional, and no element was awful. Granted there were some awful moments, like the editing when people are turning into zombies is laughable. And the cinematography during action scenes was also just dreadful. For the most part though the technical aspects were consistently, fine.The zombies were very inconsistent. If they are so sensitive to noise why are characters able to talk at all, sometimes when they speak it cuts to hordes of zombies charging in the direction of the sound and this is just forgotten half of the time. Sometimes the zombies are so strong they are able to climb buildings and other times they can't open a door because a step ladder is in the way. I believe this is because of my next point.Bad screenplay. All but two points of tension in this film are down to coincidence. The same scare is used many times, Oh will be doing something like, for example, flying his drone then there is a bang at the door, it's a zombie, at the same moment his drone runs out of battery. The chances of this happening are so slim. The fact screenwriters Il Cho and Matt Naylor use this stupid scare so many times makes me think they just didn't care when writing this film. The dialogue is bad and everything feels lazy.The constant references to pop culture to try and relate to a younger audience really began to annoy me after a while. From the title to the main character Of being a gaming streamer. But the filmmakers don't really know how technology works, holding your phone in the air does not give you more reception. I hate when films waste so much time trying to be hip and down with the kids. By doing this it sacrifices so much time the film could be using to develop characters or create a more compelling narrative.Overall, #alive is a pretty stupid movie that is just ok the whole way through. Check it out if you like zombie movies."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I'll admit that the posters for #Alive had gotten the zombie-movie fanatic within me pretty excited. The urban setting, the spectacular make-up effects, the 'few survivors vs. a massive zombie horde' storyline, and the use of modern-day gadgets - I was quite enticed by these factors. #Alive has a fantastic first act - it's all Yoo Ah-in until then, and of course, the gratifying zombie chaos taking place around his apartment complex. Add some food-related FOMO to that and we have an interesting bunch of scenes stitched together.As expected, not much is detailed about the outbreak except for the basics - these zombies are fast, cannibalistic, and attack in hordes. Things change around the 40-minute mark with the entry of a female survivor (played by Park Shin-hye) who lives across the complex in another building. Hereafter, the cliches start to pile up. They develop a vibe, a couple of walkie-talkies are conveniently found, and they even end up saving each other at different instances. Yet, it's the predictably bland final act that makes #Alive a middle-of-the-road effort.The set-pieces are all racy, hair-raising, and effective, even if one feels tempted to revisit and question how certain scenes play out. With a highly animated zombie mob hot on the trail of the protagonists from start to finish, the action has a well-choreographed feel to it. #Alive, when viewed as a quarantine film in the year 2020, can also send a message across to people that all hope is never lost and personal battles can eventually be won."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I am generous with an 8 cos i enjoyed the film, simple.

As always, Park Shin Hye's vibe adds a great contribution, I love this actress. And regarding zombies, the truth is that they are disturbing in a way and if I can consider this movie a little more morbid, you can even see how zombies take their bodies to eat them with others!

It didn't help that he looks rather odd as well, and his garish blonde hair doesn't help. This is especially a big issue because, at least for me, the film just drags so much. He acts like a teenage shut-in. It was just unbearable. I literally paused the movie several times before the introduction of the main female character.It's not until about 40 minutes into the movie that we finally are introduced to another character that survives for a long period of time (Kim Yoo-bin). I loved her character. She was smart, mature, kind, and caring. Had it not been for her, the main character literally wouldn't have survived.I do wish it was established why exactly she chose to save his life and why she didn't choose to step in earlier. I also don't understand how both she and the main character could survive for such a long period. The film really suffers from an insufferable and bumbling lead. You'd think the film's writers would make Yoo-bin the lead, since she was much more capable and charming, but for whatever reason we're stuck with an annoying lead and a great secondary lead. Last, but not least, the film really suffers because it takes place really just in that one location with the same repetitive things happening over and over. This definitely isn't at all on the same level as movies like Train to Busan and 28 Days Later; both those films outclass this film by miles. But this film, #Alive, is fun if you enjoy mindless zombie movies. Don't go in with many expectations and you shouldn't be disappointed."}, {"id": 17, "text": "The laser pointer part was weird.

Continuation there is a part in the film where the protagonist was shocked when the door was shaking. the refrigerator was stumble and the zombie was able to enter the room. the protagonist have to fight back in order for him to survive, however in some parts of the film the door was actually pulled from the outside in order for it to be open. in contrary there's one zombie that was using his hand on the lever of the door to open, hence, there's a possibility that the zombie that the protagonist have fight with maybe used is hand to open it, HOWEVER...2. the way zombies act is inconsistent i mention that there's one zombie shown in the film that used his hand to open the door, however in some parts of the film, the zombies are not mentally capable of opening the doors, they are just pushing themselves and slamming the door with their hand. it was also mention in the television that the zombies act aggressively but when both protagonist was running upon the 8th floor, it seems like some of the zombies are not that aggressive3. cuts the film is drama and adventure genre. there was a part where the main protagonist was outrageous for the lost of his family that he decided to go outside and try to let it out by fighting the zombies. he realized that he couldn't fight all of them because there are a lot of them. while he was running the camera turn in the zombies without knowing whether there's a zombie in front of the protagonist or not. the next scene was already him hinding in the corner. for some reasons they decided to cut the part where he run to hide in the corner which is very important since this is an adventure film. that little detail would help the audience feel as if they were there.4. stupid character. i don't want to explain it anymore, i don't know how they survived, they are just stupid5 cliche villain the guy was so obvious. i don't know but i already know that he is the villain, even when he made them eat the food.anyway, i was expecting it to be one of the best film about zombie apocalypse not worst"}, {"id": 20, "text": "The whole movie is how stupid and boring people are...

They kept own and while living behaviours e.g. a dead fireman climbed building with a string or a dead security guard patrolled in the corridor.Though the movie used a single appointment building as the main filming site, it wasn't boring and its topic was down to earth.

There were some really good movies and many bad ones that mostly tried to copy the already existing decent ones, but failed doing so and never tried adding anything new to refresh these types of films. Well I would go this far and say that this movie tried. It created an atmosphere, that held it somewhat authentic at first. In times where isolation and deseases are a very relevant topic, maybe more than ever, there is a chance you could hit the spot and keep your audience on the edge, because everyone is thinking about what they would do in a situation like this. And this is where the problems start with this movie. The protagonist struggles with keeping himself safe, while making dumb decisions. That's not new to the genre. Everyone who watched some zombie flicks knows that feeling What the hell is he doing? Why isn't he behaving like I would in this situation?. So you obviously can't expect a zombie expert here. That's not the problem. The decisions made his character inconsistent. He went from suicidal, to a fighter, which is ok, but when he was sure of his will to live, he still let things happen, that brought him and his newly won friend in great danger. Like letting her shoot a gun in the apartment, when they clearly didn't need to. So inconsistency is what drags the movie down. The zombies were portrayed merciless through fast and violent behavior, but had an inconsistent present. One time the protagonist was trapped in an apartment with nowhere to go and they didn't even show his way back into his own apartment.. Sometimes the floors where flooded with zombies, sometimes they were not, clearly depending on the next step, the film let the protagonist take. The composition of scenes often felt too forced triggering a chain of events trying to make the movie exciting again. But the action fell flat, especially when noticed that zombies where just growling instead of running, like when the girl came down the building, landing right in front of some of them or two ran after the police woman but only one got to her and the other one disappeared. So depending on what the writers wanted the characters to do, zombies were adjusted. The cinematography in these scenes was good and so was the acting overall. Especially in the quiet scenes, when the characters had to face themselves. But all in all there was an attempt creating a somewhat loveable dork main character and let him face the dead while connecting modern techniques and pointing out how much of a topic social media could be in a situation like this, but failing in consistent execution and lacking authentic characters."}, {"id": 54, "text": "It was well balance between a human emotions and zombies.

How does he climb up a wall using the said skinny rope? Thin ropes have very little surface area to grab onto and gravity actually does pull a man, especially a toned firefighter, pretty hard.How does the helicopter appear in the final scene? The heroes didn't hear it coming before it was 20-30 meters away behind them. Helicopters can be heard from much, much further away. Also it was flying upwards from a yard below surrounded by buildings. It would've had to have landed there or hovered for quite a while.Like that, you'll find little cause and effect from #Alive.

It tries to be a young and cool film, with references to current pop culture (like gaming and designer clothes) and also to copy some things to the classics (dawn of the dead or 28 days later), to please the old school fans, but without logic and with a terrible execution. It's full of clich\u00e9s and scandalous plot holes at times, which could be forgotten if at least the writing was good, which is not, since the lack of empathy with any of the characters, due to their (non) development and the dialogues, that are empty and shallow.

Quality. Unnecessary. It uses the same formula as all of its genre, generating suspense to hook the audience, the problem that unlike others is not constant. With good effects, two or three moments are not completely achieved, they are even caricatured at times. Predictable like all of its kind.

It's not hard to see the flaws in the film, but if you're just looking for a background watch or something relatively easy to get through then it is worth it. The acting's fine, though Yoo-Bin's character could've been developed a little more.

Not that I mind that, no, no, no. Not at all. In fact #Alive (aka #Saraitda) actually turned out to be more enjoyable and entertaining than Peninsula was. Yeah, I know, right...Anyway, I will say that #Alive is not your average run-of-the-mill zombie movie. And I love the way that the movie starts out and just throws the audience right into the action. That was just glorious. I liked that so much, because the zombie action is what is enjoyable, not the things leading up to it.The acting in #Alive was good, and the lead actor and actress managed to carry the movie quite well, especially since there were hardly any other performers in the movie with dialogue.The zombie make-up and effects were good, and taking into consideration that this was in the beginning of an outbreak, you shouldn't expect to see fully decomposed shambling corpses. Normally I am not overly keen on running and agile zombies, but I will say that it actually worked out well enough in #Alive, for some reason.If you enjoy zombie movies, then you definitely should take the time to sit down and watch the 2020 movie #Alive from writer and director Il Cho, because it does bring new contents to the zombie genre.I am rating #Alive a six out of ten star.

It is the perfect movie you need to see if a real-life pandemic alone is not enough to convince you to quarantine yourself.The film wastes not a second in jumping to the conflict and the result is non-stop action. One of the best things about the film is its action sequences: all choreographed well with a lingering sense of vulnerability that makes them more enjoyable. Yoo Ah-in and Park Shin-hye are the only leading actors, and both of them deliver fabulous performances. While there's not enough detailing of the zombie disaster going on, it's just plausible because then it puts you in the protagonist's shoes: you too know nothing, except there's lots and lots of zombies out there and the only way to survive is by killing.Further, the limited setting is another cherry on the top. #Alive just never runs out of entertainment and goes on to deliver endless fun, replete with action, drama, horror and suspense.

It's about time in another way, too, as I've never understood why in most such movies the living try to run away from fast zombies and hide from slow ones--seems backwards to me. So, kudos to Alive merely for the hiding, for the most part, from the speedy ghouls. It also allows for an unusual examination of survivalist tactics: more watching TV for news and rationing food than aiming for the head. The application of gamer skills is more iffy. Moreover, the reports on TV largely treat the outbreak as a viral epidemic. Other zombie flicks have done this, as well, though. What really stands out in this one begins in the title with the hashtag; this is a picture thoroughly wired to the age of social media, mobile phones and the internet.Ostensibly, the tacky message at the end glorifies this media, but I'd argue the scenario overall rests on an unsettling depiction of technology--to the point that the zombies are a metaphor for lives lived online. The moral depicts the military, as an extension of government, saving people by tracking them through social media. It's eerily similar to what the zombies do throughout the picture in stealing people's identities. In fact, they don't see or smell you; it's only when you make a sound that they come after you. Largely, this is through technology. Note that although the water supply is cut off, electricity somehow remains, and TV is only lost when the hero finds an unusual way to cut the cord, so to speak. In the plot, the outbreak begins when our gamer protagonist is online with his friends. Later, he sends messages to his online followers. The attention of the undead is also gained by his attempts to connect with others--whether by drones, leaning over edges with his phone attached to a selfie stick, or, by more old-fashioned methods, radio, non-electrical wire and simply yelling out to the world.The narrative goes out of its way, too, in pointing out that the characters are separated within apartments despite their urban proximity. Cannibalism, like social media and the government tracking you through it, brings these people together. I'm not going to bother wondering whether any of that is a good message, but the dichotomies are interesting: close together yet separated, hiding but calling for help, attention feared and desired, connected and disconnected. Oh, the zombie action is OK, too, if nothing especially innovative and even if the puppy-love subplot is cloying."}, {"id": 262, "text": "I've heard there was an other movie that had almost exactly the same premiss as this one, but I will not take that movie in to consideration while I review this movie.So I will start with the positives of the movie: It brought alot of new stuff to the zombie genre, like bringing in the modern area into the flick and how it could have been used in a scenario like this. So I really appreciate that part of the movie. The characters of the movie act kinda smart aswell for example drinking the spilled water from the bottle, blocking the main door and windows. (but not the hallway windows) Some stuff could have been executed better.But I would say about there the movie just did not care to give a proper solution to the problem that was at hand, it was full with cliques all around that was really predictable. The ending was really terrible and you could see it from a mile away.But all and all It was an okay watch.

The relationship between the two main survivors gives a lot of humanity to what could've been otherwise an overly lonely and depressing film.While it relies a bit too heavily on probably the most overused tropes of the zombie genre during the third act, it still succeeds at being unique enough to stand out amongs the rest, even Train to Busan.It gets minus points for having a hashtag in the title.

Locked in his house with no way to communicate with the outside world, Oh has to get creative with notifying people he's still #alive and keeping himself that way. Unlike the standard zombie, or even in Korean sister flick Train to Busan, these zombies are smart - some maintain habits from life, they can perform simple actions, and they're fast.As Oh's resources dwindle, and hallucinations of his missing family set in, the movie gets interesting in showing the horror of having to choose one of two terrible actions - risk being eaten to make it to safety (where???) or just end it with his senses intact. Happily, the movie takes a turn to the light and offers an energy boost. Sadly, it doesn't escalate to anywhere satisfying and the ending is cute, not exhilarating.

The suspense of it in every frame keeps you on your toes, and what I like about the film is that it concentrates on the use of modern civilian technology for a survivor which makes it one of creative aspects of the show, because you don't really see that concept in a zombie film.Most zombie films, be it Korean or Western, it always most likely ends up in a full-blown action sequence of events, it doesn't really portray the accurate behavioral details of a survivor in a realistic sense that which can be a most likely chosen case for anyone in that situation. Unlike the cliche zombie theme of getting straight to the action with a loaded carbine rifle, #Alive instead portrays a survivor trying to pull through an event that is hard to comprehend with the little resources he has in his apartment.Although just like any other Korean Zombie Film I've seen, details of the apocalypse ends up being non-existent, and not described well in the show. If you're that viewer that wants to know more about the background setting, then you won't really get a lot of helpful information around that.But overall, I enjoyed watching this show, it was suspenseful, thrilling and never really ends up boring, and I do recommend the film to whoever seeks a new Zombie movie to watch."}, {"id": 269, "text": "#SARAITDA AKA #ALIVE (2020) REVIEW . . \ud83d\udcdc Plot: The rapid spread of an unknown infection has left an entire city in ungovernable chaos, but one survivor remains alive in isolation and how he survives . . \ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2696\ufe0f Review : #Alive pictures the familiar fast-moving undead masses and zombie-creating virus infections portrayed in famous Korean zombie thriller like Train to Busan (2016) in past.

Apart from a heap of gut-churning excitement, it offered a surprisingly powerful emotional angle &amp; has rightly become a gold-standard for the genre. This new movie has been released ahead of Peninsula ( the sequel to TTB ) &amp; the primary hook seems to be the presence of romantic K-drama favourite Park Shin Hye as one of the leads. She's one of two normal people trapped in an apartment block during a zombie rampage, the other being a young man ( Yoo Ah In ). Will they be able to survive ? Will they fall in love ? Or eat each other ? Unfortunately, I barely cared. With the action confined to such a small area, there needed to be a lot of creativity happening &amp; there isn't. Despite a couple of good ideas &amp; a few doses of tension, there isn't a lot going on in general &amp; while YAI is suitably stressed most of the time, PSH behaves more like she scraped some paint off her BMW on a shopping trip than being zombie-fodder. And her face is absurdly flawless considering the messy/violent things she has to do. Matters pertaining to shortages of food/drink are also handled confusingly. Actually, the thought of seeing PSH getting down/dirty as a zombie is very appealing but that's a different movie. Is there any scope for genre innovation ? How about child-zombies ?

How about contrasting the real world with its real zombies with the fake game world with its fake zombies? Easy to kill something in a game but how about a real person? So how about having him save that cute girl, but the they have to divide those meager resources over two persons? How about making her pregnant, deaf, a lesbian, give her aids, make her a sociopath, make her or him fear heights or open spaces. And why zombies? What happens if you swap them out with something else? Would the story fall apart or does it not matter at all? Then why zombies? Herein lies the issue with this competently made movie.

At this point it wouldn't surprise me if he was meant to be wearing an adult nappy but unfortunately his parents aren't around to put it on him every day.It's just an incredibly underwhelming movie.

A quirky film about a Parisian who suddenly wakes up in a Paris occupied by zombies. #Alive (original title #Saraitda) is the South Korean version. The only difference is that the zombies are portrayed more explicitly here. About the French version, I said that non-zombie movie aficionados could watch it without worrying about leaving skid marks in their underwear every time such a hollow-eyed creature appears around the corner. This rule does not apply to #Alive.When Oh Joon-woo (Ah-In Yoo) wakes up early in the morning and crawls behind his PC to continue gaming, he doesn't realize that the day will turn out very differently than usual. Soon, alarming news reports are broadcasted about a strange disease that is spreading rapidly, causing people to become enraged and attacking fellow citizens with bloodshot eyes. When Joon-woo looks out the window of the apartment, he witnesses this bizarre phenomenon. The young gamer is smart enough not to rush out of the apartment in a panic. Instead, he barricades the front door, makes an inventory of what's left to eat, and tries to make contact with the outside world. It's not really a surprise that this isn't so easy to do.The largest part of the film takes place in the apartment, just like in La Nuit a d\u00e9vor\u00e9 le monde. You witness how someone has to deal with a life-threatening situation and how they desperately look for a way to escape this situation. Of course, he's faced with the inevitable. After a while, he is confronted with a lack of food and liquor. The fact that there's a fully loaded drinks cabinet with liters of spirits can provide short entertainment. But really quenching thirst with it isn't really recommended. Missing his family and the corresponding loneliness are also starting to weigh heavily. Contact with the outside world is not possible. And keeping a video diary only helps partially.Time to introduce the next protagonist. Namely the young girl Kim Yoo-bin (Shin-Hye Park) who lives in an apartment right across that from Oh Joon-woo. What follows is a primitive interaction between the two individuals using technical aids such as tablets and a drone. Both have the same goal in mind and that's surviving. Not that people who have a similar situation in other zombie films don't have this goal. But instead of going out and trying to find their way through a zombie-plagued society, the two sit quietly in their hideaway and wait for the right time.#Alive is not very original and basically shows nothing new. The zombies themselves do look extremely creepy. There are times when things are getting tense. There are also some funny situations to be seen. Towards the end, they added a separate storyline. Some will find this disruptive. On the other hand, I thought it was a successful addition. It brought a bit of variation to the overall story. Maybe the denouement was a bit over-the-top. But overall I could agree with the general tone of this movie. Ultimately, we are now in a similar situation with the COVID pandemic. Of course, there aren't any zombies. But many people haven't left their homes for quite some time in the last six months to prevent worse. So, #Alive is more than a regular zombie movie if you look at it that way. Are you a fan of zombie flicks such as La Nuit a d\u00e9vor\u00e9 le Monde? Or to a greater extent also Zoo? Well, you should give this South Korean variant a try on Netflix. It's well worth it.More reviews here: movie-freak.be"}, {"id": 275, "text": "Director: Il Cho Writers: Il Cho (screenplay), Matt Naylor Stars: Ah-In Yoo ( Oh Joon-woo), Shin-Hye Park (Kim Yoo-bin) Oh Joon-woo wakes up one morning when his parents and sister already have left the house and have left nothing for him to eat. Outside something strange is going on, people are shouting, running, screaming and attacking each other. A viral outbreak has taken place, turning the people into violent cannibals, aka zombies, who spread the virus at a rapid speed. Now Joon-woo is all by himself and has to survive a zombie apocalypse. But across the street in an other apartment building he gets noticed by Kim Yoo-bin. Together they try to reach each other and hope for the best.When Yoo-bin came to the scene, the film got a new pulse. She's a great brave character, that overcomes her fears and is smart and more up to survival than Joon-woo. She gives him a reason to live, but it must have been the same for her. It maybe doesn't bring anything new to the genre, or gives the zombies a center stage, this film is certainly up to date and shows that survival is better when you do it together.#Alive brings thrills, drama, zombies and two people together in a tale of loneliness and hope."}, {"id": 276, "text": "After the disappointing Peninsula, I stumbled upon another Korean Zombie movie. #Alive has a simple premise in that Oh Joon-woo (Yoo Ah-in) a gamer is left isolated in his families apartment when an infection leaves an entire city filled with zombies. The zombie genre is very over saturated so does this movie stand out or is just part of the horde of mediocre zombie movies.I got to praise the pacing of this movie because it gets straight into the action within the first 3 minutes. It doesn't delay with an exposition or massive setup. It knows what you're watching it for and by doing this it successfully keeps the audience engaged the moment the movie begins. For the most part, the movie maintains this pacing but it does slow at a couple of points. However, it never slows down for too long and manages to always add some new element of danger to keep the characters on their toes. The zombie action, on the whole, is generally fun to watch. They are not groundbreaking or visually insane like Train to Busan but they are generally fun looking scenes.I also like some of the ideas director Cho Il-hyung implements in this movie to make it stand out a bit. Firstly, the movie focuses primarily on one person Oh Joon-woo (Yoo Ah-in). Most zombie movies usually focus on a group of survivors with some dying but by focusing on one person it makes it easy for the audience to relate more with him and understand his loneliness. Eventually, the movie does introduce a second survivor Kim Yoo-bin (Park Shin-hye) but this adds to the theme of loneliness in this movie. Furthermore, I also enjoy that the director considered the modern setting by having wifi, social media and even modern technology like drones in the movie. It makes it feel more believable and adds some new elements into the zombie genre. The actors Yoo Ah-in and Park Shin-hye do a phenomenal job in giving emotive and convincing performances. They really sell on the desperation these characters go through.However, I do have some gripes with this movie and the first being the lack of characterisation. We the audience get some suggestions at who Oh Joon-woo is such as being a gamer but apart from that he isn't very interesting. The movie does a fairly good job at making us care for him because of his situation but it doesn't do a good job at making us really like him that much. He is very bland and generic which is probably intented to make the audience easily put themselves into his position. However, he makes a lot of really dumb decisions at time which I definitely wouldn't have done. On the other hand, Kim Yoo-bin has no characterisation whatsoever. I know almost nothing about her and they never really go into depth about who she was before the apocalypse. It baffles me why the main character never asks her about this but whatever.The third act of this movie also embodies all the cliches from a lot of zombie movies and is extremely generic which is a bit disappointing compared to the first two acts. To their credit the ending is still satisfying despite being cliche. The story is also incredibly predictable and there also very predictable jump scares as well (although the jump scares are very few).Overall, it's an all right zombie movie. It isn't groundbreaking but what it does, it does very well. It tackles the zombie genre with a clear theme of loneliness and it explores this theme well. Additionally, I also appreciate that the zombie apocalypse isn't on a country scale as a lot of zombie movies do this and seeing a more competent government is quite refreshing. This also plays a part into the theme as well. I came into this movie to have an enjoyable time and this movie most definitely succeed in that."}, {"id": 277, "text": "#Alive or #Saraitda is a thrilling and engaging zombie movie that manages to stand out from the crowded field thanks to its creative use of a largely singular location and some effective commentary on our incrasingly technology reliant world. The movie follows Jun-u a gaming livestreamer who finds himself trapped in his apartment after a zombie outbreak leaves him isolated with little supplies and even less hope of rescue, the stress of isolation, hunger, and despair becomes too much to bear but once neighbor Yoo-bin makes contact after her own ordeal Jun-u he becomes determined to survive.The movie charges right out of the gate and doesn't let up until the very end. For the first half-hour or so this is very much a one man show as we see Jun-u trying his best to keep his spirits up even as he's under constant assault from rampaging hordes snarling in streets and running rampant through the apartment complex. The movie does a great job at building upon its elements in a way that keeps the story feeling like its moving forward and also keeping the audience engaged. Once Jun-u meets Yoo-Bin we have some very clever usage of the added location her apartment with Jun-u's including a humorous scene of them eating dinner together via walkie-talkie that provides some welcome levity that doesn't completely destroy the tone. Technology and its presence in our lives is a recurring theme throughout the film from Jun-u's status as a live streamer to his usage of drones, smart phones, selfie sticks, laptops, and TVs to try to keep informed and sane throughout the chaotic proceedings, but it never feels overly ham-handed like various other movies that try to tackle the subject. In a way #Alive's approach is not too dissimilar from George Romero's take on consumer culture he satirized in the 1970s Dawn of the Dead that while funny managed to integrate well with the horror never feeling too jarring.#Alive is a welcome addition to the zombie sub-genre of horror and a must see for any zombie fan. It's an intense ride from start to finish and thanks to a brisk runtime that makes efficient use of itself there's never a point where the audience becomes antsy or checks the remaining time. Highly recommended"}, {"id": 278, "text": "This movie must be a comedy right? I'm so tired of watching these zombie movies of late where the characters are complete idiots. That's all they seem to be now. I miss the days in Romero films where the male leads were actually men, resourceful and smart.

The stupid actions of the guy made this very hard to finish because I kept complaining to myself about how stupid his actions are. I don't want to watch a zombie movie to complain about the actions of the characters.Many of these stupid actions just feel forced to make something happen or to try and give an emotion response.

Please don't try to present gamers in current year as ignorant when it comes down to zombie apocalypse or survival scenarios. I'm absolutely sure that any decent gamer (especially those that are somewhat doing this professionally as streamers) can easily come up with various ideas on how to survive in this kind of situation.Also the spreading was way to fast here. Apparently 99% of the local population in this town don't know how to use doors or their cars properly.Oh and I had to laugh pretty hard in one scene where explosions are shown in the city while apparently over a week into the outbreak there is heavy car traffic still going on in the city.

And why do people think that humans are some sort of awesome predator with out weapons? We don't have claws, we don't have sharp teeth. Have you ever tried to eat a raw steak?

Fixated entirely on the survival aspect of few rather than going full on mayhem with swarm of undead! Albeit lacking in several segments, on the whole it more or less pulled off an appeasing outcome.Without going into much details about how and why, it zeroed in on the aspect of deep-rooted human instinct as survivalists. It deals with lonesomeness, desolation. Tests our moral compass in dire consequences through inconspicuous ways. It also sheds some light on the positive impacts of technological advancements and its useful application for the people in need. The interpretation here goes much deeper if you can perceive its pertinence.Technically it was a powerhouse. The Cinematography endowed by atmospheric awareness, fastidious Sound work and apparent attention to details; collectively manage to create an unnerving ambience. Performances too helping them in that regard. Ah-In Yoo &amp; Park Shin-Hye; both of them being credible in their respective acts.Storywise, as I stated earlier; they had taken quite an aberrant route. The plot heavily invests in adrenaline pumping moments &amp; genuinely scary situations. With a modest presence of emotions and humour underneath which worked fractionally to be brutally honest. It loses a chunk of momentum in the second act due to a rather unsuccessful attempt at getting too dramatic. However, in the third act; it regains its predominant pace and concludes itself in triumphant fashion.

With the window blocked out day, night and time becomes irrelevant.There's virtually no dialogue for the first 50 minutes and the characters become increasingly isolated physically, socially and also electronically.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it's very entertaining, it's like Train to Busan but in a room. I think we can all relate to the idea that the main character was stucked in his apartment, in his case it was zombie apocalypse but in ours was Covid-19. Due to that reason, I feel some kinda connectivity to the characters' struggle through out the film. Someone mentioned that it was dumb that the character broke his TV and all but it actually make sense, it's called cabin fever, when you're confined in a place for an extended amount of time, you start to feel restless and annoying at almost everything, you'll want to break anything. The characters, nevertheless, made some awful choices throughout the film, but without those mistakes how else is the plot going to move forward? I think it's pretty common in most zombie movies or survival movies in whole for characters to make dumb choices in favor of the plot. The film became more engaging when a girl living in the opposite apartment saved our protagonist from commiting suicide, they developed a tender relationship and together, they continue to make awful decisions until they were saved at the end in some kinda Deus ex machina style. They were saved at the end but who's gonna save us.......from Covid?

I wouldn't pay too much attention to the negative reviews if you like well made zombie flicks. Neither would I pay too much attention to the reviews stating it's a remake of a French movie as it doesn't matter. What matters is that it is entertaining and that you enjoy it. I thought the make-up artists did a very good job with their scary looking zombies. Other reviewers state that Train To Busan (or Busanhaeng from 2016) was better but here again it doesn't matter to compare it. It's a different story, even though it's also a zombie movie. To be honest I liked both of them equally. In Alive you basically only have two characters to follow but both did a great job playing their character. Ah-In Yoo and Shin-Hye Park were very convincing in their roles and that's a bonus as with Asian movies it's not always the case. Korean movies are by far the best from what comes from that part of the world. Koreans know how to make quality movies, rarely the typical overacting like in other Asian countries.

Along the way as you'd expect he comes across issues with his mental health living in fear of zombie attacks, having to worry about food and water, and also as an important part of the film with his loneliness (although probably unintentional, it has pretty interesting parallels with Covid). The way it oscillates from hope to despair and back is also very effective in propelling the story and creating a pacing that doesn't bore you. All of this sounds sort of heavy handed but the film manages to address all this without being brooding. What helps is the acting of the main character who is very dynamic and lively. He has the archetype of the lovable bonehead and he portrays it really well. The other main character also has very good chemistry with the main character and acts sort of as a foil to him.The music and visuals are also absolutely excellent.

One of its more unique aspects is the fact that it mostly takes place inside a single apartment, seeing our protagonist struggle with low-supplies whilst in terrified isolation.

This subtext isn't exactly overt, though; the affair can be enjoyed as a straight genre piece. The experience feels more 'street level' than a lot of similar fare and, aside from one or two strained plot-points, it plays out in a relatively 'realistic' sort of way. It has a handful of exciting and suspenseful sequences, but it isn't exactly scary (to the point that scares don't even seem to have been all that important to the filmmakers) and it has a couple of problems with tone.

Among the more enjoyable aspects of this one is the immediacy of the film to drop us into the zombie apocalypse. The pre-credits sequence showing how he gets isolated with the TV news reports and live-action scenes showing the creatures overrunning the area grabbing and biting everyone they come across gets us into the film exceptionally quickly. That the ferocity and intensity of their actions are given rather early on makes for a much more thrilling and intimidating threat through these impressive sequences is fun with the way it sets the film going. Moreover, this early build-up causes the film plenty to like when it comes to the attempts at out-maneuvering the creatures later on. With either the shots of survivors getting overwhelmed as he can't help them in time or the various encounters that emerge later on when both he and the neighbor across the street are forced to deal with the creatures trying to get into their apartments, the second half here picks up on the action nicely which sets up the fantastic finale. Featuring their escape into the complex and dash to get away before the final series of battles to get out of the apartment. Combined with the stellar zombie make-up and effects, these are the film's positives. This one does have some flaws with it. One of the biggest issues is the fact that so much of the film seems to consist of useless padding to beef up a running time that still goes on way too long. The idea of what he does by himself while he's alone isn't that interesting, from struggling to get a signal for his devices, record videos for an internet channel that doesn't exist anymore or acting as an excitable idiot around the girl which don't bring anything new or interesting to these type of scenes. These are commonly utilized in these kinds of films, building up plenty of cliches and suspected moments that highlight how utterly stupid the character is. The other flaw to be had here is the film's highly problematic final half which is quite chaotic and meandering. There's little need to introduce yet a third survivor into the mix simply to pull out a series of random twists with the character to then to just dismiss it all with a resolution that alerts the creatures to them and making their escape all the more difficult because it has to keep up the inclusion of this completely doesn't need to be there and could've been taken out completely to shave off time and the typically overdone and useless Korean melodrama.
