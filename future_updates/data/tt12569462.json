{"name": "White Noise", "titleId": "tt12569462", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "This was really just a journey into the lives of three or four individuals. The doc doesn't really do a deep dive into the views of the Alt-Right. I think a documentary solely about Bannon alone would probably give us more insight. I don't recommend paying for this. If it is free, I still don't necessarily recommend."}, {"id": 1, "text": "If you're looking to pat yourself on the back for not liking the subjects of rather boring effort, this is for you. If you're looking for insightful, well made documentary that doesn't rely on awkward editing of interviews to manufacture a narrative you might want to look elsewhere."}, {"id": 2, "text": "White Noise takes a raw and up-close look at the alt-right movement as it gained significant momentum in 2016 through present-day. The level of access to some of the movement's most high-profile figures is stupefying.Lombroso presents a largely nonpartisan narrative that truly allows the viewer to make their own verdict on the impact and effects of alt-right movement. Ultimately it lifts the cover on the unifying power of vitriol and hatred, and shows the path to power of this largely cast-aside movement."}, {"id": 3, "text": "WHITE NOISE is a shocking and extremely timely documentary that takes viewers inside the alt-right through multi-year discussions with leaders of the movement. The film is unique and powerful in offering unparalleled access to what seems to be becoming a not-so-fringe movement and unusually candid conversations with its members and leadership. Lombroso has created a significant historical document that should be required viewing in schools, for law enforcement, etc."}, {"id": 4, "text": "A fascinating, unbiased character study of three distinct alt-right influencers. It's clear to see the progression of trust building between director Daniel Lombroso and the three prominent alt-right figures. Their motivations and desire for the spotlight candidly unravel as the film, and the movement, progress. Highly recommend for an objective, humorous look at the alt-right."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Oh boy where to begin.Former alt-right idol Lauren Southern sells out the alt-right, that's what you're hoping this is right? Yeah, not even close.It's a documentary about how one pretty white attention-something... said some racist things and advocated for racist beliefs, got too much negative attention and couldn't find a boyfriend who was nice. Years later she finally found one, but there's a problem, he's a different race and the type of person who she was openly racist towards for years. Realizing there's no way this would end up well, she proceeded to delete absolutely everything about her online presence and hope that the world would forget her as quickly as possible.But it doesn't end there, because there's no way anyone would let her get away with disappearing after setting back race relations by about a hundred years. So!She's now right back vying for attention again, but this time she's claiming to be one of the very same type of victims she spent SIX YEARS trying to convince people that no, those victims DIDN'T EXIST. Honestly, it should be criminal to be this much of a drama queen and provocateur and then literally swap sides and play the victim.The only legitimate reason anyone should watch this is to learn how successful and idolised you can get by being a racist. Then by lying and claiming to be a victim of the very ideology you spent years tirelessly trying to push.In this criminally bad documentary, she explains about how she was a totally innocent, normal person who was quite simply tricked by men. Yep, that's it. That's her simple story. She was tricked (by men of course), fooled into being one of the most famous racists of the 20th century! Who would have thought!?What follows is her own attempt at a smear campaign and has literally none of the guilt or real evidence befitting a truly reformed person. It's a performance that doesn't deserve the first handful of microwave popcorn waiting in your cupboard.I am literally dumbfounded that people are watching this and take any of it for fact. The girl quite simply loved being an icon of the alt-right, loved being admired, loved being a sex symbol and when she found the man that she wanted to be with. Well all that negative attention she was getting suddenly had no place in her life. The only way out was to swap sides, feign ignorance and blame everyone else.If you've ever seen a real doco, you'll instantly realise this is not one."}, {"id": 6, "text": "White Noise provides thought-provoking insight into the alt-right movement. By profiling several of the leaders of the right in an objective, comprehensive way, Lombroso has given viewers a rare and in-depth view into this movement that is fueled by hatred and fear. This subject of this documentary has never seemed more relevant."}, {"id": 7, "text": "An unsettling look into the rise and transformation of the alt-right, Lombroso gets unfettered access to the movement's most divisive and popular pioneers. A cautionary tale about the pernicious nature of racial bigotry in today's internet age, this documentary is powerful, pertinent and impartial allowing the viewer to draw his or her conclusions about the future of the alt-right."}, {"id": 8, "text": "From the moment it begins, White Noise hooks you in and doesn't let go. You are floored by the secret Nazi chants, the casual, unchecked misogynistic and racist rants, the scandalous high-level sexual solicitation, and ultimately, the wild realization that white nationalists walk among us, even in cities where we assume they couldn't possibly thrive or survive.But ironically, what makes White Noise truly special is its humanity. There is a palpable level of candor and unexpected intimacy between Lombroso and his subjects, who you hate and yet are forced to acknowledge as real human beings with their own self-doubts, contradictions, and inner turmoil that we can't help but find ourselves relating to. What Lombroso does as a director and a cinematographer is far more interesting than just infiltrating a hate movement and exposing their worst behavior; rather, he explores the cracks in the psyches of people who come to identify with such movements. Layer by layer, he reveals their vulnerabilities, and the identity crises that are encompassed so perfectly with the James Baldwin quote at the beginning of the film:I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.Well done."}, {"id": 9, "text": "White Noise was an excellent film! The film provided a truly unique view of the alt-right movement only possible with the access and trust director Daniel Lombroso built with the main characters over the years. Journalistic masterpiece. Stylistically, the film is filled with stunning shots and powerful music in a way that we can appreciate the artistic value of the film even while the subject matter is intense. Lastly, the film really tells a narrative-- the rise and fall of three prominent figures in the alt-right movement, and the psychological motivations of hate, sadness, and search for meaning underlying their drive for the spotlight. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend."}, {"id": 10, "text": "I don't think it would be endearing to put such an emphasis on that, what does it matter to me, a stunning turn from the alt-right ice Queen. Cernovich the pill pushing huckster and Spencer the former theater director's in his mother's Whitefish mansion, just unreal."}, {"id": 11, "text": "As a person who was not familiar with the alt-right, this doc allowed me to be a fly on the way which I absolutely loved because I was able to formulate my own opinion. The director shot scenes in a very personable way (I.e shot in cars a lot) and lingered on certain moments made me feel like I was actually there, which made me feel even more disgusted that it's possible for people to create and amplify a movement like this. This film is so relevant to the current climate, it couldn't have come out at a better time. I can't wait for this film to be on streaming services because it should be shared with everyone."}, {"id": 12, "text": "If you're looking to understand the world of the alt-right, you should watch this movie. The director does an excellent job contextualizing the neo-nazi movement to familiar and unfamiliar viewers alike, without giving alt-right activists a new platform. It's at times horrifying and funny or amusing at others. Leaves people understanding the movement as dangerous yet hollow and vincible. Must-watch."}, {"id": 13, "text": "This is an important documentary that I strongly recommend to anyone that wants to understand how radical, hateful ideas can develop and propagate in the age of social media. Far from the obscure - YouTube just shut down Richard Spencer's channel yesterday for violating its hate speech policies - this journalism reports on a trend that must be taken seriously."}, {"id": 14, "text": "A well-done narrative that brings you up to speed with the current alt-right movement. Brings together three spokespeople who are using the nationalist movement to push their agendas and monetize the momentum from the 2016 election. Years of research and interviews weave together an alternative perspective on the leaders behind the movement. Recommend to those who want to understand the current white supremacy climate and those that profit from it."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Daniel brought together a tautly-wound, riveting and occasionally hilarious character study of three pundits associated with the alt-right. An insightful and necessary piece!"}, {"id": 16, "text": "What an excellent film. It's so important for people to see this type of content that explores the humans behind the keyboard / internet spaces. Our country is shifting and we need stories like this explored and exposed. Excellent"}, {"id": 17, "text": "Unsettling, yet absolutely fascinating look at the alt-right. Truly outstanding work by Lombroso and crew--cannot recommend enough!"}, {"id": 18, "text": "The portrayal of these people ultimately as grifters and influence peddlers without any actual beliefs is very good. It should be shown to the people who find these people inspiring or insightful."}, {"id": 19, "text": "The most amazing part of this film is the way Lombroso allows the subjects to guide the story authentically. The subject is engrossing (especially in this political climate), the characters are as compelling as they come, but what this film exceptional is the unprecedented access Lombroso had to leading minds of the alt right, allowing the film to feel personal, unfiltered, and incredibly honest."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Lombroso does a great job of immersing the viewer in the dark alt-right movement growing in the US. The film tells a fascinating story and exposes contradictions within the movement without bias and opinion based commentary. A must watch for sure!"}, {"id": 21, "text": "White Noise offers the incredible opportunity to get into the heads of three important characters in the story of the rise of the alt-right. I was riveted for the duration. Lombroso gives his subjects space to tell their own stories, stepping only in to pull on loose threads and highlight inconsistencies inherent in the characters' worldviews. The result is a fascinating and affective work. White Noise offers the audience tremendous access into the lives of its subjects; you'll find yourself asking, but how did anyone get this footage!? nearly constantly. I can't imagine the amount of work that must have gone into building the necessary relationships with the characters. Lombroso is unquestionably a skilled storyteller, and I've recommended White Noise to everyone I've spoken to since seeing it."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Incredible film that gives insight into the white nationalist movement, white supremacy and the alt-right group. It captures some of the pivotal moments in the movement as well as the day-to-day personal life of a few major players of the alt-right. Daniel Lombroso was in the room where Richard Spencer had the whole room hailing Trump, a terrifying moment and one that is so important for people to see and understand the direction and severity of the alt-right. Lombroso also captures moments with Lauren Southern, a young anti-feminist/anti-immigration YouTube star who we see grow conflicted over some of the values of the movement that she so passionately represents and fights for. Over the years, Lombroso follows these individuals all over the world and sees the development of the movement. This is a must watch, especially at this point in history. Daniel Lombroso and The Atlantic did a phenomenal job with White Noise!"}, {"id": 23, "text": "Although it's a documentary, White Noise plays like the best feature film: gripping, character-driven and totally immersive. Lombroso gained unparalleled access to a subculture that has utilized social media to drive home a dangerous message - and energize millions to promote the racist rhetoric that is tearing apart our country. Beautifully shot, with a haunting soundtrack, White Noise demands to be viewed more than once. Watch it again, and you'll see something you missed the first time. An Oscar-worthy film for our troubled times. Superb!"}, {"id": 24, "text": "A well-composed documentary, White Noise provides insight into the alt-right , their motives, and psychology behind the movement in modern day. The feature follows three prominent alt-right figures in an intimate setting - Lombroso's work is conscientious and penetrative, with a slow-burn that reveals the thick underbelly of white supremacy in our society today."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Wow. I just watched this film and it blew me away. Daniel is an incredible filmmaker and bravo to The Atlantic for taking on such a complex topic. This is a must watch, especially now!!"}, {"id": 26, "text": "The first feature-length documentary by The Atlantic shines as it exposes the darkness behind the alt-right movement. Through the focus on 3 of its prominent figures, Director Daniel Lombroso allows the viewer to consider its political influence, dissonance, and fear-driven hatred.Never is there a dull moment as every dialogue, interview, and video graphic feels intentional. From beginning to end, the film is as harrowing as it is enthralling."}, {"id": 27, "text": "White Noise documented the rise and fall of the alt-right movement over the course of 4 years. The documentary provides an unusual perspective into the 3 main leaders of the movement. To me, I'm especially attracted to Lauren Southern's journey, which was filled with nuances and surprises. Over the time, the film has becoming more and more relevant."}, {"id": 28, "text": "White Noise begins at an unparalleled precipice in American history: immediately after the election of Donald Trump, when the alt-right is at peak boldness. Capturing the uniquely electric and terrifying energy of this moment in time, the film follows the meteoric rise and subsequently mixed trajectory of a movement that is both laughable and horrifying, as well as the very human characters driving it from the top.In addition to showing moments that truly shock - notably the viral conference scene in which attendees Hail Trump! and brandish Nazi salutes - the film explores the insidious ways that violently racist ideas can be cloaked in rational, innocuous, or humorous messaging, particularly via social media. An intimate portrait of the figures it follows, the film moreover gives the viewer the sense of having an exclusive backstage pass into their innerworkings and family lives, for which Lombroso deserves great commendation. We see them as far more vulnerable, and full of contradictions to the prescriptive worldview they supposedly espouse, than they would ever admit publicly.The viewer is left to puzzle both at what will become of the alt-right, and why, in this modern age, such a movement can catch on like wildfire. Though its leaders prove to be fallible, their worldview may not retreat so easily. While it may be baffling how in the 21st century neo-Nazism can capture the hearts and minds of so many ordinary and young people in the U.S. and worldwide, White Noise provides an essential window into the motives and the cognitive dissonance of those who benefit most from it. The film dismantles the illusion that the alt-right truly provides a bolstering worldview, even for its most vocal adherents."}, {"id": 29, "text": "White Noise provides an in-depth look at the rise and lives of three prominent figures within the ever-growing Alt Right. The film's director spent a total of three years with these characters and provides a unique look into how they think and behave off screen.It is both eye opening for individuals who are unfamiliar with the Alt Right and proves a brilliant character piece for those who are well aware of the threat of such political thought. Throughout the film there is a blend of disturbing scenes but a host of laugh out loud funny moments captured as well. Kudos to the director for having it sync up so well.I would also like to point out that the film does a fantastic job of remaining objective throughout, while also not providing these individuals an additional platform to spread their propaganda. The film is a raw look at who these people truly are.I will be recommending this film as essential viewing for friends and family. While individuals rise and fall from grace, it is their ideas that remain alive and dangerous - it is important to educate ourselves and be aware. This film could not have come out at a more timely moment. Well done"}, {"id": 30, "text": "This film draws viewers in right from the beginning. A captivating storyteller and cinematographer, Daniel Lombroso thoroughly and artfully examines white nationalism as a contemporary paradigm while tying to the historical context of institutional racism in the United States. The film closely follows three activists deeply embedded in the movement and their personal journeys in influencing white supremacy. The film directs the viewer's attention to the most powerful moments through lingering shots and seamless transitions. The film is a call to all of us, whether on the left or the right, to open our eyes and be aware of the omnipresent vision for a white nation, a desire coming not just from rural areas but particularly from the largest metropolitan areas in the western world. In light of recent atrocities to the black community, this film highlights the incredible power of the white nationalist movement and its leaders to foment hate amongst millions of people, which can lead to these atrocities, even if the original intention is not to kill. This is an essential film and we all need to open our minds to the fact that white nationalism is alive and well."}], "reviews_amount": 31}
