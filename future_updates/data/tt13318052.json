This film has everything that I want from it but it lacks the main ingredients of chemistry, direction and dialogue delivery which makes a film... A film! I felt like someone just read a book and transferred the great plot of the book onto the screen quiet literally page by page. The male lead did his best but he and his co-star just had no chemistry... I mean for a moment I thought maybe this film is going towards the direction where they both realize that they are better off as best friends. They both looked perfectly happy being best friends if the plot didn't tell me as an audience via every other character that they are meant to be and how much they have always loved each other, I probably would've never known."}, {"id": 1, "text": "The writing was good, the actors (most of them) are talented, the leads have chemistry but then......it fizzles. Who's fault is it when that happens? Director?The story is interesting enough to get you through to the cute ending but it leaves you with the feeling it could have been much better."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I'll keep it very simple. If you are the kind of person who loves Christmas movies and watches a handful of those cheesy Hallmark Christmas movies each year, then this movie is definitely for you because it is absolutely, positively better than about 9 out of 10 of those. If you don't enjoy that genre, then this probably wouldn't be the one to win you over. Personally, I'm always looking for the next Xmas gem as they start to roll out a little after Halloween (sometimes sooner). Most of them are forgettable, but short and sweet. This one snuck up on me and I really enjoyed it. And the two leads (especially the male) were quite good. 87 minutes of a cute and fun, albeit cliched, romance set to a Xmas background....nothing wrong with that in my opinion."}, {"id": 3, "text": "My son told me he was watching this so I decided to watch it too. I'm not sure i would of picked it otherwise but im happy I watched it.I thought it was a really good movie. Sweet and a nice feel good to it.The leads and cast were great too. Although it was set after Christmas day, it was still festive enough.This is number 36 out of 100 for my 100 Christmas movies before Christmas day challenge with 45 days to go. Can I do this challenge?This is a good movie and I will watch this again."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Cute Christmas aesthetic. The plot was there. The male lead made this movie bearable. If it wasn't for his acting I would have stopped the movie in the first fifteen minutes. Complete lack of chemistry. The dialogue was so bad and I am sure it was hard for the actors to deliver those lines naturally. Which leads me to my last and most important conclusion on movies. If the director doesn't do his job well this is the outcome. This is candy for your eyes and not a single drop of content. This is not art in no way, shape or form. I'm sorry I know this is just a Christmas movie but that doesn't mean it can't be or it doesn't have to be meaningful (ex love actually, the grinch etc)."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Yes, it's quite predictable as a holiday movie, but Evan Williams more than saves the day! Great sense of timing, priceless face expression, very good acting in general and there you go! He really delivers and carries the movie."}, {"id": 6, "text": "A romantic Christmas comedy. It's about the best friends who have a radio show and in it they talk about how difficult it is to introduce their partners to their families, so they decide to make it massive because of publicity, but everything goes wrong when they don't accept and decide to pretend they are a couple. Entertaining A movie for television. Performances that are good. Organic jokes that are more focused on an audience in their thirties, as well as the main characters are seen very everyday. The leading couple have chemistry on screen. Talk about expressing how we feel to the person we love. Nice Sunday."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Nice romantic story. Family friendly, but entertaining for adults!"}, {"id": 8, "text": "I tried to give it at least a 4 but it is so bad that even a 3 is stretching it. The first noticeable thing is how bad the acting is followed closely by how bad the script is and I gave it a half hour thinking it might just get better. Even the 'music', the same ongoing music, is ... well you get it. There is just nothing to compel a person to stick around. Low budget I guess to fill some time during the pandemic. But watching paint dry is more fun."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I wasn't so sure when I clicked this on NETFLIX. These Christmas style movies tend to be awful bad acting and or boring, but, I loved this the second it started playing and the jazz music started coming in.. It's upbeat, quick and moves at an entertaining pace. This movie was everything I wanted to be and more .Two fun leads, silly banter and a whole lot of best friends falling in love during the holidays. The leads I thought were perfectly cast. The male wasn't your typical play it safe guy and the female lead also had such a charming presence and personality who was incredibly relatable. This ended up being a hit for me and just what the doctor ordered .. even though I spent the last 15 minutes crying my eyes out. I was shocked I enjoyed this"}, {"id": 10, "text": "This movie is beyond predictable and the acting is atrocious! I know holiday movies (especially of the romantic nature) are supposed to be cheesy and campy, but this one was almost painful to watch, it was that bad! Gee, we are best friends who do everything and know everything about one another, our families are besties too. Why would they say we should be together? Clueless moron and I fell for it. Waited for it to get better. But no, It sucked right up to the end. Spoiler alert: they discover they really do have feelings and get together and yadda yadda.

It's a family driven story with solid characters and great chemistry between the whole cast. I loved Natalie Hall.

At one point, the mom is supposed to be crying and she motioned.like she was wiping a tear away... from her very dry face. The worst. They then cut back to her as if her emotional reaction was going to win this an Oscar. It was hysterically bad.However, it is the exact cheesy RomCom that Netflix is known and loved for, especially during the holidays.

How does this stuff get made????"}, {"id": 22, "text": "MovieMom1973 here!! yes!! with midnight at the magnolia, Hallmark has shown once again why they are the #bestinthebusiness when it comes to christmas movies!! i can't wait to share how absolutely magical it was, and i only just finished watching it with my husband, my two teenage daughters, and my #MOMMYJUICE!!so the first thing you notice right away in this movie is that the main actress has her life very put together based on how she is up early before her alarm and ready to go and prepares stacks of avocado slices with halves of halves of cherry tomatoes that she doesn't eat, while the main actor drags himself out of bed only after the alarm has gone off and can't press his own coffee and has to eat boxes of cereal!! as soon as i saw that i turned to my husband and said, those two have a lot of contrasts, i bet if they end up in the same scene then they will be really mismatched!! i also loved that the radio station they worked at is called 98.8 fm breeze which is close to freeze which is appropriate because it is really cold outside in this movie!!anyway it turns out that these two actually do share a scene together very quickly because they host a radio show together!! they banter like a morning talk show and you get to see the subtle nuances of how they really do have lots of contrasts!! and then they talk in the break room and we all noticed something right away, which was that there was fake snow on the stairs leading upstairs outside the breakroom!! also the guy started insulting the girl's boyfriend because he wears sweater vests!! my husband and i immediately paused the movie and had a long talk with our daughters about how putting fake snow that's probably just cotton on the stairs is dangerous because you can slip and also about how you know that a guy is not dangerous BECAUSE he wears sweater vests!! my husband wears them all the time and that's how i knew it was okay to take him home to my parents when we were dating!! take notes boys!!after that their boss tells them that their show started something called #windycitywakeup. my daughters explained to me what a hashtag is and i really love the concept!! #youlearnsomethingneweveryday!!so the main girl's boyfriend takes her out for coffee at a goat shop and he's a bit concerned that she and the main guy might have feelings for each other because of their long history together, and i have to admit that i had been wondering if there was something between them but then she says that there isn't and compliments her boyfriend on his sweater vest, so it seems like she is really committed to her current boyfriend!!the main characters' families have been friends for a long time which is very sweet and then they all have a nice dinner together and one of their dads says they should all have a group hug to celebrate the success of the radio show!! i thought that was such a nice thing to see because so much of what comes out of hollywood these days is less group hug and more group shoot out!! #rockthegrouphug!!anyway it actually turns out that both of the main characters' partners break up with them because of how close they are and it happens in this coincidental way because the sweater vest boyfriend calls the girl to break up with her right as the guy shows up to tell her that his girlfriend broke up with him!! the girl tells the guy and he says that that makes it the cherry on top, but really it was more like the half of a half of a cherry tomato on top!! #sadso then it turns out that they have to pretend to be in a relationship because that is going to help save their show and save their dads' live jazz club!! and we all thought that there was no way they could ever convince anyone that they were really together because of how mismatched they are but it turns out that people actually do believe it!! the story really gets crazy!! #oppositesattract??i don't wan't to spoil the whole movie of course but there are other interesting things to note!! like how when they go to a fancy dinner the girl has white wine and the guy has red wine and it matches how she is blonde and he has darker hair!!i really do have to say just how so sweet it is that these two souls find their way to each other in the end because i want my daughters to find their way to a man like that like jack someday because you could tell he really loves maggie because he took her mother's engagement ring and apologized to her for how neither of them wanted to date each other before until she realized she had loved him and he didn't know he had loved her too!! #SWOON!!so in conclusion this one of the absolute best Hallmark movies i have seen to date!! don't pay attention to the FAKE reviews that clearly have not watched this movie because it is such a relatable romance that they clearly have NOT watched the same movie!! okay!!

And this includes a number of Christmas movies. So, my expectations were adjusted accordingly. That said, I enjoyed this Christmas movie. The story was fun and cute. The script/dialogue was good. The acting was strong. And the scenery, props and sets were of the same quality of a typical Hallmark or Lifetime Christmas movie, well-polished and festive. I might have even shed a tear or two at the New Year's Eve party at the Magnolia (near the end of the movie). In short, the movie pulled me in quite quickly; at no point was I, e.g., looking for my iPad. In terms of acting, this is the second Christmas movie that I have seen Natalie Hall in this 2020 Christmas movie season. She was also in A Very Charming Christmas Town (a Lifetime original Christmas movie), which was of the same quality to this one. I think she performs well in this genre of film, so when I saw her at the top of the bill, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Overall, I thought she had a strong performance as Maggie; it was convincing. Evan Williams (as Jack) was also pretty good in this one, though I thought he was a bit less convincing towards the end, the scene where his future father-in-law (played by Steve Cumyn) gave him the ring. What stands out for me is their dialogue, their interaction, their banter. Unlike some reviewers on here, I thought they had good chemistry. It was one of the elements of the movie I enjoyed most.

As for this whole radio show thing, what even..? Who on earth would be interested in a meet the parents segment... ON NYE? Not I, said the cat.The acting coming from the side characters is horrendous. When they made an announcement that was supposedly really big, the wows coming from the family was not convincing at all.As for the positives, I thought that Jack was a model love interest for these types of films.

It is one of the first *good friends turn into more* movies where I bought the *good friends* way better than the romance. The move has two characters who have been friends forever and happen to have an AM radio show in Chicago. But this doesn't quite work for me. How does that happen? Ie. your best friend from childhood gets a hosting job with you on radio? Seems improbable. Since all their listeners want them together anyway, they get the great idea to pretend to be a couple to boost ratings and get a syndication deal. The only problem is that this movie failed to provide any hint of a romance. The main male character, Jack, is wonderful but he doesn't do any of the particular things men in love do. No long looks at his beautiful best friend. No jealousy at other people looking at his hot BFF. In fact he doesn't seem to be interested in the female lead at all. The female lead is not particularly a great actress but I do buy that she has always had a thing for Jack which is getting in the way of other relationships.

The acting was TERRIBLE...it was very difficult to watch, in my opinion, and just highlighted the issues with the script.National frenzy to see two local-market MORNING RADIO hosts host a TELEVISED nighttime New Years Eve party? When the duo had been airing in the national MORNING market for less than a week? With the premise for the sold out get-together being to watch those radio hosts introduce their families to their significant others? I am not sure what these people think folks do on NYE, but it's not this.The parents' failing jazz club is selected as the party venue, but somehow the strugglingckub owners are responsible for paying the high dollar entertainment booked by the radio syndicate. Yet somehowthe syndicate handles the ticket sales. The daughter encourages her father to buy a new tux literally seconds after telling him to watch expenses and stay on budget.I'm sure it all wound up happily ever after...hopefully including payment for the dads and a revival for their club.
