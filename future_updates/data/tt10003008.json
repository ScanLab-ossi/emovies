A waste of money, time and talent (Stevens and Brie.)"}, {"id": 2, "text": "I wanted to like the movie, but sadly it's been done before and better with the movies in my title. That said the cast is great, I think Dan Stevens is one of the best actors around.So In my opinion it just doesn't do anything new and the ending was also poor, let's hope Mr Franco can come back with something a little more original next time."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The first half was about relationships that I couldn't care less about, and the other half some sterile killings, like slaughtering animals. And once again no conclusion. What is the director trying to do? Propaganda against Airbnb, so that people use agencies and pay their taxes?"}, {"id": 4, "text": "It was decently directed by Dave Franco and the cast is great but the writing is a bit meh. I will never understand why people like to hide bodies, avoid cops, get crazy over hidden cameras but also not want to solve the situation. So many things could have gone better but the characters are always dumbed-down for entertainment or story progression. Also who murders someone (or believe they murdered someone) and gets rid of the body but then gets upset over their partner cheating? Like hello your short temper just almost killed someone and you are ready to fight again like have you not learned your lesson? He easily would have killed his brother and girlfriend and dumped their bodies too with that short temper of his."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Two brothers and their significant others spend a weekend in a beautiful beachfront villa. What could possibly go wrong?Dave Franco does a decent job for a first time director. The Movie is beautifully shot, atmospheric and moody as all hell. The cast is awesome, I always enjoy Dan Stevens and he's a delight here, but so is everyone else. I almost loved this movie but sadly the whole thing falls apart in the third act. Its as if a tense thriller is interrupted by a slasher film and its as abrupt and awkward as it sounds. That said the movie does not go where you expect it to and it is shocking and surprising."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Way better than the ratings. It keeps the intrigue for the first part and the rest has a good rhythm. Pretty decent directing by Franco. I don't see it lower than at least a 6. It is one of the lowest ratings compared to the quality of the film I have seen in my whole life."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I didn't like a single character in this movie. A complete waste of talent!!! The characters were boring, stupid, selfish, and immature. I had really high hopes for this movie. It was pointless. Absolutely no closure. I didn't care if a single character lived or died. There are soooooooo many wasted moments that leave you wandering why. They should have used teenagers. At least it would have justified their stupidity."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Whilst this is a decent effort for a directional debut with a constant feeling of tension and uncomfortability, the R18+ rating and horror genre classification seems misplaced.There's a real longing for a decent new horror film, and this isn't it.If you've seen every other horror film and have nothing better to do with time to kill, then give this film a watch... but if you don't get a chance to watch it, you're not really missing anything great."}, {"id": 9, "text": "My oh my...The beginning is kinda OK despite the unpleasant characters and the empty dialog. But it takes a long time for anything to happen, and when it happens it is so cliched and anticlimatic one wonders what the writer was thinking about.The ending is one of these facepalm moments when one realizes that one has wasted precious time on a bland, toothless, generic pseudo horror film.The Rental is a semi-slasher film where instead of idiot teenagers being killed one by one after doing stupid things we have four woke grown ups being killed one by one after doing stupid things. The difference is that in The Rental all the killings occur in the third act.It is not worth your time."}, {"id": 10, "text": "This movie is just awful, I don't know what anyone working on this film thought they were making but the plot twists are ridiculous and only come about as a result of them all doing the stupidest stuff.

I am such a fan of Allison Bre so I was excited to see this movie considering it is Dave Franco's directing debut. I was not disappointed in the film. It starts off pretty slow, but halfway through the movie it gets so much better. Unpredictable flick. I was the most impressed with Shelia Vands performance and I'm excited to see her take on more mainstream roles!"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Honestly, I was expecting more from Dave, there's a lot of wasted talent in this film. I kept an open mind about it, but overall was poorly executed. If you want something similar, but better I recommend 13 Cameras, Open House, and 14 Cameras. The only good actor was reggie."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Even though the film is a long way from being perfect, I think it can defenitly open a modern slasher franchise, with great and uniqe storytelling for this ganre.

They created dilemmas, but no epiphanies... They just kinda ended the movie lolGood actors wins an extra star."}, {"id": 30, "text": "The Rental tries too hard to be something it's not and let me tell you, it's not a great effort.In this horror film, two couples on an oceanside getaway grow suspicious that the host of their rental house may be spying on them.Co-writer and director Dave Franco attempts his hand at being a filmmaker in this somewhat horror, maybe a thriller flick, and I felt absolutely nothing throughout. The four characters are one more annoying than the other and the overall The Rental is a flop. How this film is doing well amongst other critics is beyond me. The final outcome also raises the question; but what's the point of all this?. I won't break my head to find out.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!"}, {"id": 31, "text": "This was really good. I'm not a psycho or anything \ud83d\ude02 but finally I was craving for a movie where the serial killer gets away with it and Kills everyone.

I never got bored and enjoyed it a lot."}, {"id": 32, "text": "The movie is very slow events, the characters aren't that interesting, normal people with drama, it has a drama all the way, fighting, and mysteries, but I wouldn't say I was not interested to know what behind the door, with the code which is locked but moving on, at first, they were going in some far place to have some holiday or relaxing or whatever, not sure why they go to far place that no service there, or anything, it's like they want bad things to happen to them, anyway, I wouldn't spoil the end of the movie but many things which are not natural on the story and atmosphere here, well at the end it's a good movie to waste your time end, it wouldn't last a day or two remember this, as it's not going to hang in your memory for much of time."}, {"id": 33, "text": "It's about a group of four friends who decide to spend their weekend in a rented mansion, oblivious to the chaos that follows. The plot was a bit slow placed, nothing really petrifying or eerie takes place into the first 30 minutes of the film. Mediocre acting by the cast which was subdued by an intriguing plot. Well, I expected a lot from Dave Franco and he could have done better. The ending however was startling. brownie points for that! In nutshell, it's an enjoyable one time watch, so show some love and support for Davey y'all as it was a great attempt at making a thriller!"}, {"id": 34, "text": "This movie could have been good. But. Then there was no plot and no ending. Just a bunch of starters that you want to follow through, but end up leading nowhere. After watching it, I still cannot answer those questions?: who's the killer? Why is he/she doing this? What's gonna happen next? Why are the characters all imbeciles? I just don't know what this movie was about? A bit disappointing."}, {"id": 35, "text": "I don't understand the negativity here. This is a great crime movie. One that could even lead to series 2. The monotone and yet intense mood, that's very hard to portrait via screen but they managed to do it here. Not many crime movies or horror movies can do that these days. Perhaps low rating is because they watched this movie during day light? Classic inexperienced mistake."}, {"id": 36, "text": "I'm sorry, $crew the haters. D.

Honestly...the best part of this movie is the French Bulldog and he only appears three or four times. If you are planning to watch this movie, just think back to the last movie you wasted two hours of your life watching and then go do something productive like clean your bathroom, bake a cake, or spray for ants. When I read the reviews for this movie, Ifeel like I live in an alternate reality where there are no decent movies being made. Perhaps I traveled through time and I am the only one that remembers what a plot is and it's no longer important to today's movie-goers. I think, What if no one remembers movies from my time... I grow sad, but then I realize that I can still access these movies with my special time travel dvd collection of amazing movies. I fear talking about these because if I am traveling through time, maybe I don't want people to know...reading this is probably making you scratch your head. That's what this movie left me doing...I heard Dave Franco wants to leave us guessing at the end because PLOT TWIST the dude doing the killing is a former renter. Wow! That had to take hours or seconds to come up with that brilliant storyline. Honestly, this gives me hope that all of my ideas for writing a script will be the next Harry Potter or Star Wars series of blockbuster movies. I mean...as long as they're allowing this guy to direct movies any one of you reading this right now have a shot at fame.Honest Y, Dave Franco should quit this job and spend the rest of his time renting actual houses in Oregon.

Not worth a watch for any reason,"}, {"id": 43, "text": "I liked it. The premise is of course not especially original (some friends for the weekend go to a vacation house and are being harassed by strange phenomena and brutal force from un unknown source), but within this genre it's a fine movie with a solid story and pretty good acting. All four characters get some personal depth, the tension is slowly being built up and when things definitely go awry the pace is high and the violent goings-on are pretty scary.After the climax of the movie, there's some sort of epilogue that in a calm and matter-of-fact way shows how things can (and will) happen again, with the cynical message that it can happen to any of us. But this takes like five minutes of very slow images, so after all the turmoil it feels a bit as an anti-climax. Although partly incorporating the closing credits in these images was a nice touch."}, {"id": 44, "text": "OK so I was digging it, until the ending. That was the worst ending that I've ever seen that I can remember of &amp; I have seen a lot of movies. I think Dave Franco do not understand the meaning of the word Why. Why did the killer killed everyone why, there is no answer. I am sitting here like I could have watched absolutely anything but not this. Anyone reading please do not waste Ur time. Everyone's time is valuable. This movie is just a complete facade. Dave Franco just don't do this. I have never felt so strongly about any movie before then this one."}, {"id": 45, "text": "It's a slasher movie, is what it is. Friday the 13th? Halloween? Prom Night? Hundreds of others? This film is PRECISELY like those movies, complete with crazed, faceless killer stalking the young, good-looking cast in and around a wooded cabin (or rental house, in this case) and picking them off one by one.Allison Brie is a good actress, and does what she can in the thankless role of an initially loyal, then confused, then hysterical young wife. But she is the movie's only saving grace. It sure isn't imaginative, or believable, or scary.Again: It is EXACTLY like those slasher movies of yesterday, but with a lower budget, crummier photography, and more modern, millennial pretensions (e.g., the subject of racism is addressed, naturally).This film is actually getting some pretty good notices. Now THAT'S terrifying. The only explanation I can think of is that commercial filmmaking (and audience expectations of what a good movie looks like) has degraded dramatically in the last 25 years. Literally nothing else could account for it."}, {"id": 46, "text": "It feels like such a huge waste of time when you finish this. Do yourself a favor and skip this."}, {"id": 47, "text": "Biggest waste of time I have had in a long time watching a movie. The acting wasn't terrible but there is no substance to the movie at all. First half of the movie you wait for something to happen and it never delivers. The story is just bad. Sometimes the ending can redeem a bad movie but not this time. Might give this 3/10 for acting at least, but since the overall score is so high (5.8 atm), it has to be lowered so people don't think this is worth their time. Sorry Dave Franco, try again.

The movie ends with scenes of new couples waiting to be trapped and killed. Serial killing as some kind of career-choice. It's not shocking anymore - it's just starts to be a little repetitive. I'm beginning to long after the traditional endings where justice actually prevails. As always a lot of things could go wrong with these set-ups in real life. But in the movie-script everything runs smoothly according to the serial killers wishes. Of course.Besides above, it's a reasonably good run-of-the-mill movie in this genre.

It's their opinion I know, but here is mine: The film kept me watching the whole time without a second of boredom and that's a very rare thing these days. I liked it, what can I say? Yes, it's been done before but this movie is well directed and it has a slow but really catching pace that makes you want to see the whole thing. The 4 main characters are well written and it's impressive how I didn't want a single of them to die, most of the time in horror movies there are characters that are just annoying or don't have anything to add but in this film everyone plays an important part in building up the tension.

Of course when they arrive, one of the women(Hispanic i presume) makes a big deal of the fact she wasn't accepted but her 'brother-in-law' who attempted a booking minutes later, was. From then on she claims the guy who rents the place is a racist, because...well, it's 2020. Of course our protagonist's girlfriend is neurotic and paranoid throughout because...well, she's a woman. Drama unfolds because otherwise it would just be two couples at a 'beach' house, there literally is no other reason for it. and then murders start to happen, because something has to at least attempt to put some life into this. Of course there's the well known trope of killer manages to wipe out everyone with total ease other than the last 'victim' whom he has to have some kind of struggle with or it's not a psycho killer film. Yeah this was ok, no better than that, no worse. There were no surprises, nothing shocked, nothing happened that you couldn't have seen coming if you've watched any 'isolated' horror before in your life. All boxes were ticked, it's just getting really tiresome now though. There's so many scenarios which could be used in horror, but we keep getting force fed the same bland fare time after time.

The overall concept centers around a fear that is nothing new in horror/thriller films, however Dave Franco adds some fairly novel twists that makes this movie stand out.

Once again it seems that neckbeards and basement dweller virgins are negative bombing something the Franco brothers, do out of envy.The movie begins with two couples on a retreat, the characters are genuine, in the sense that we all know people like this (if you have ever had college friends). The movie goes on threough their common and expected issues between couples and friends before it takes several twists and turns that leave you wondering where is this really going to go.After the troubles with the landlord we are left uncertain to his involvement in everything that's happening, and that's when we see the real antagonist, a serial killer who kills, if for nothing else, out of pleasure. This guy is no nonsense, he doesn't play with his victims nor does he take 30 mins to track them down (looking at you Jason Vorhees) and the best part is that, unlike every single other slasher and scary movie, this guy doesn't get killed by some random teens.We later see that this is a regular activity, his MO is shown to us throughout the credits while he takes on other victims.Being filmed, mugged, killed or just be subjected to any kind of danger is something that is always in the back of our minds when we go to a hotel or to an airbnb, Dave takes this fear and shows us the worst csse scenario.My only criticisms are first, that there are some scenes that feel too much like fillers, I feel that there could've been a bit more character development and second, some of the suspense sounds were a bit too much for me, it made it feel cheesy."}, {"id": 76, "text": "I enjoyed this and thrillers are my thing.

I saw the meager rating on here before I started the movie and I went in with low expectations, but I was more than surprised, especially with the ending..As soon as the credits rolled I knew, clearly, why people have an issue with this movie. It did two things that turn off mainstream audiences, but I actually find refreshing. 1. It took its time and developed characters, whether you found them likable and care whether they live or not, is subjective. 2. The ambiguous ending. There was also a third component; not a storytelling device, but a plot point and turn in the story. 3. Why wouldn't you just own up to cheating and call the police immediately?Who was he?!! Why do we need to know anything about him or why he does what he does? Isn't that more frightening? Did we need confirmation that he did, in fact, have a heinous childhood? I think it was clear that this person is a psychopathic murderer that preys for pleasure and sport. The faceless killer (and winner in the end!) doesn't need more story. If you were secretly observed, stalked, mentally tortured and ultimately murdered by a masked person, you would never know who they were or why they did it.Some people say, it's slow and went nowhere. I disagree. We got to know the characters, infer their personality types, and see their strengths and weaknesses. Why didn't Charlie &amp; Mina come clean, admit their mistake and save the day? I don't know, maybe they're self-centered narcissists? Sometimes unrealistic decisions can be picked apart as a plot failure, but in this case I think that's just who those people were. They'd rather gamble and protect their assumed respective appearance. You don't have to like and respect all characters.Also, they did a great job capitalizing on a contemporary trope with Airbnb. This may have already been used in another movie at this point, but I thought it was a great choice, especially for a confined horror film. How much is staying in a strangers home worth it for the price and location?Great job, Dave Franco.

It's a nether thriller by James Franco's brother Dave and yeah, I never knew the dude was even a director. Not great but not too bad for his first go-around.Anyhow, 2020's Rental is my latest review. It was released in July of this year and was shot in the lush cities of Bandon and Portland, Oregon. In truth, Dave Franco knows where to put the camera in regards to The Rental. He creates a flick that is somewhat Hitchcockian, somewhat Brian De Palma, cloaked in frankness, and darkly atmospheric in its tack.Watching Rental, you might think twice about spending time in a seaside home for a weekend. That's especially if someone is secretly filming you making dampened whoopee in a shower (yikes).Starring Jeremy Allen White from Showtime's Shameless, featuring a disarming closing credits hook, and running a slight eighty-eight minutes, The Rental possesses two unlikable characters that are nonchalant about the concept of infidelity. One of said characters is even cheating on his wife with his brother's would-be girlfriend. Talk about cutting it close (ha-ha).So yeah, Rental is all about sardonic friction from the word go. The problem is that its antagonist is unknown, speechless, robotic, and without any clear motive. Who is this Mr. Clean-style killer? What is his stone-faced deal? And why does he feel the need to off some la-di-da millennials along with his D-bag associate?The Rental chronicles two couples who rent a home and are terrorized by a veritable, invasion of privacy wacko. This wacko also runs like a deer and seems palled on because he doesn't have anything else to do. Me, well if I'm in the lurch I write reviews just like this mixed one. Rent-a-cop-out."}, {"id": 87, "text": "Better than many movies we have seen, however the ending sucks. Lip and actors were decent. Oregon coast is gorgeous. Glad we rented it on Redbox instead of paying for prime video."}, {"id": 88, "text": "The many one-star reviews here provide an interesting glimpse into popular taste. Apparently, a movie about psychopathy is supposed to end with some Scooby Doo unmasking, where the crazed maniac who has just murdered the entire cast unmasks himself and reveals some perfectly reasonable, linear motivation for his behavior which, upon looking back, the viewer will realize has been cleverly foreshadowed by the filmmakers all along. This is the convention--oh, so that's what caused all this mayhem!--and of course it's sometimes satisfying, but more often than not it renders the film cheap, tidy, and forgettable. And the lengths filmmakers will go to in order to sufficiently shock you--the red herrings, the duplicitous sociopath best friends--is often quite awful. It's been decades since I saw the original BONE COLLECTOR movie, but I'll never forget my bafflement and utter disappointment when the big twisty reveal happened and all I and my companion could think was, Who the heck is that? Honestly, it would have been better if the killer had just been a random person.Which, I'm pretty sure, is how serial murder often works. The idea that some narrative bow is going to tie everything up at the end of a bloodbath is, well, disrespectful to the victims of the unfortunate number of real-life bloodbaths this country bears witness to. Sometimes people are just violent and deranged and like to watch people suffer, and though they probably have reasons for their behavior, that behavior probably has little or nothing to do with their victims. Would it have made things better if you learned at the end of THE RENTAL that the killer was the caretaker's brother, and that he had been cheated on by his wife, and that that's why he murdered anyone any time he witnessed a sexual transgression? Would that make it okay? Would that make their murders sensible and satisfying?That said, this isn't a great movie. I like the fresh, anarchic randomness of the conclusion, and Toby Huss and Jeremy Allen White are standouts in the cast, but the screenplay suffers from some implausible depictions of psychology and behavior--which is to say, too often the characters make choices that just seem terribly stupid and unnatural, and it seems like they only do what they do because the plot demands it and not because actual people would behave that way.So, yes, this was neither an excellent nor an awful way to spend 89 minutes, but anyone suggesting that a review of more than 4 stars is a paid promotion has an extremely narrow view of what a movie is allowed to be like."}, {"id": 89, "text": "I would have given more that 1 star if i hadn't all ready seen Welcome Home with Aaron Paul and Emily Ratajkowski.

While relying on genre tropes (fog, wide shots to see something just on the horizon lurking, a pet in peril etc.) the story takes its time from a complex character study into full on terror with surprising restraint in say gore or exploitation.

I don't what they expect from a horror thriller like The Rental. I thought that for this genre it was a pretty decent movie. It won't win prizes or so but it's certainly entertaining. There is some good tension building and the acting wasn't bad either. I only know Jeremy Allen White from the excellent series Shameless, the rest of the cast was unknown to me but they all did a decent job. As for the horror it's mild but yet effective. All in all it wasn't a bad movie, certainly better than I expected for a movie in this genre."}, {"id": 147, "text": "This may not be one of the best films of the year, but to be honest, I consider it an enjoyable one, elegantly executed, with certain tributes to the Thriller genre, an interesting acting exercise, considering the situation in which the characters are involved and how they should react to these.

The last 10 minutes are really surprising! And final scene is wow!"}, {"id": 149, "text": "Firstly I'll just say I liked this film, it was an entertaining way to spend a Sunday afternoon with a slight hangover. It's not particularly original (gang of people on a holiday weekend being stalked by a stranger) and it didn't offer anything new, but it's still an ok watch.So, the soap opera bit, two couples - brothers with their wife and girlfriend - go off to a ludicrously posh weekend rental. Creepyish manager had previously refused to rent to Mina (she's a Muslim woman) but then happily rented to Charlie, her brother in law and business partner, an hour later. And there we have the PC, 'let's be woke' element which, in reality, doesn't really go anywhere except for Mina huffing around for a while and disliking aforementioned creepy manager. They unpack, Michelle (the only likeable character who I actually rooted for) has brought some 'Molly' which she gives to the others, she doesn't take any because she wants to hike to a waterfall the next day. Best of luck with that Michelle. Michelle goes to bed, the other three stay up, get high and drunk. Josh, Mina's boyfriend and Charlie's brother passes out. Mina and Charlie jump in the hot tun, things get a bit heated and you can guess the rest. They end up having sex in the shower whilst their other - better - halves sleep.Next day Mina and Charlie claim hangovers and stay in the huge house whilst Michelle and Josh go off on the hike. During the day Mina discovers a camera in the shower head, throwing her and Charlie into shock in case Michelle and Josh find out. On the hike Josh gives Michelle a few home truths about Charlie, which upsets her and she is cold to him when they return to the house. This is the point where the movie actually starts to move, because up until now it's been nothing more than a soap opera at best.Charlie and Mina now set about finding and disposing of the evidence. Michelle - upset, high and drunk - rings creepy manager to fix hot tub, and the whole thriller starts. Accusations, a fight, a body (the cliff scene is ridiculous), road spikes, a missing dog, remote controlled showers, and a few more ludicrous elements all come into play. It's pretty effective, the stalking and violence are well done. Like I said, the only person I gave a damn about was Michelle. The characters are pretty awful people, shallow and predictable. It's an ok way to spend a couple of hours, just don't expect too much.

The French bulldog was a fun touch which also worked. The only thing that spoilt this movie was the silly ending.

The voyeur aspect served well to draw out the tension and had the movie remained on this track it would have been an interesting dialogue into people dealing with progressively worse decision making. It could have stayed with the voyeur theme but instead tries to quickly turn onto a slasher and it honestly doesn't work here.I couldn't help but find myself only really rooting for one of the four as she continued to make smart decisions that followed a moral compass and stayed grounded. It would have been interesting to see this play out from the standpoint of someone knowing what they were doing and pushing them to see how far they take the lie before it collapses but instead we get a rushed killer who makes quick work of the cast and it's this decision that I think is driving majority of the negativity.

That's a neat trick, especially for Franco's first time out as a director.In regards to the spate of really poor reviews: there's a new kind of amateur film critic {let's be clear, I'm one too, we all are} who views anything at all that isn't patiently explained in exposition to be an indication that the movie is bad and 'unrealistic'. I blame yout*be reviewers tearing into every movie looking for ways to fill time, but the result is that those viewers encounter a film like this - which is calm and patient and engrossing, but which chooses to explain *nothing* about itself, and these new amateur critics decide the movie is bad because of that choice, while thinking it was the result of mistakes in making the movie.I really, really dug this, and heartily recommend it."}, {"id": 186, "text": "I liked it, one of the better 2020 horror movies around and there haven't been many this year.

It is watchable and has some entertainment value. It takes a little while to get going, then it delivers some good thrills and chills. Not a lot, but enough. And I watch all horror movies. The reason behind the 1 or 2 star reviews is the fact the movie exposes racism.

The payoff at the end of the film can either be seen for what it is, an extremely smart twist leaving the classic teen horror trope behind, or as what a lot of reviewers want it to be, a bad take on a tired genre.Dave Franco's directorial debut starts as a classic horror movie, with a slasher character that borderline copies Halloween's Michael Myers, but where the movie takes a turn is when you learn our murderer has no vendetta against these teens, and just happens to find the airbnb a convenient method of finding serial victims.

First, someone said that it seemed as if Dave Franco was trying to do too much (ie directing, writing, producing) with this movie and that he sometimes got sloppy on one or the other. There's a scene in the movie where Mina (discount Nasim Pedrad) tries to show the maintenance man that a hidden camera is in their shower head. This is an example of sloppy directing because they never show the shower head, and the character never points and the maintenance man looks away while talking!! So, this must be what the reviewer was talking about: very poor and inexcusable directing!!! Next, this movie seems to be divided into two pieces: the first half is almost like a teen romance-drama, which turns into a horror-thriller in the second half. It is almost like Full Metal Jacket in that sense. Another thing about this is, there's a McGuffin regarding the identity of the villain/killer/pervert, which the viewer is left to think is the maintenance man. Again, half way through, this is revealed to be wrong. Let's go back to the beginning for a full synopsis. Four urban professionals decide to book a rental property as a weekend vacation due to the stresses of work. Mina (Discount Nasim Pedrad) and her boyfriend, Discount Jacob Weber, are suspicious that the landlord is racist because of how he talks to Discount Nasim Pedrad, who has a Muslim sounding name. So, Mina and the other guy have an affair in the shower, and later discover that it was recorded on hidden cam. Now, they must think of a way to cover it up, but can't come up with a good plan. The other girl is having trouble with her man, who just had the affair. They party a little bit, have a good time, then the story turns dark in the second half. Near the end the characters start getting knocked off one by one. The film ends with the villain winning. It's not as if it's bad, it's just average. As someone who grew up in the 80's, I find the whole dialogue of this generation in 2020 to be distracting, because this generation just doesn't feel like home to me. The main criticism is the unevenness of the whole thing. Maybe I'm being a little harsh. I'm sure that Dave Franco was trying to do something a little different. We never get to see the killer's actual face. This has a different type of motion to it which some might find a little distracting.

The timely suspense was escalating the tension, from the moment it starts the tightness never stopped and loved every second of it. How terrifying it is to think that this could really happen and how also it rings of truth on relationship problems. A common situation in which surrounds the saying what goes around comes around gets an effective judgment. The ending sequence was flawless and terrifying, there is no better way to end it plus a sharp execution towards the music.I'm amazed by the composers Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans! they really know how to get in your skin with their music!

Also much-love attention to Sheila Vand, what a beauty and outstanding performance, she needs to do more movies in lead roles like this one."}, {"id": 282, "text": "I really wanted to like this movie, unfortunately, there was nothing at all to like. A big calling point of this, for many, will be to see the directional debut of Dave Franco.Well, where to begin? This is yet another 2020 horror film that should not even be classed as a horror film at all. When over 75% of the movie is a drama, then it should be classed that way. There is hardly anything horrifying or thrilling about this one, well, except for the awful production itself. There's hardly any horror elements except for in the very latter part of the movie, even those are poorly executed.None of the characters here are likeable, there's a reason to dislike all of them. I found myself not caring about any of them, well, except for the dog. The pace is slow and the acting is mediocre. The concept itself is familiar and I couldn't help but think that I've seen this before, just executed a hell of a lot better in other movies.It feels like Dave Franco was going for a slow burn type horror that had a stunning conclusion. This is so much of a slow burner that by the time any of the action happened, I was completely disinterested. I stuck around, waiting for the climax and felt greatly let down. The conclusion, is confusing and doesn't offer any real resolve. It's a waste of time and feels like a kick in the teeth after sitting through the rest.The killer himself only gets a few minutes of actual screen time and those happen towards the very end of the film. You find out no information about him, his motive or his purpose. The kills are very weak and not at all graphic.There's literally nothing interesting here at all. A complete lack of atmosphere and tension, it feels very amateurish.

There is a lot to like about this movie even though it's not a perfect movie. First of the cast in this movie all do a great job in there respected roles but the 2 main stand outs of this movie have to be Dan Stevens and Alison Brie are both really great in this movie. The music in this movie honestly is really good to and it plays a great part in setting up the creepy autmosphere in this movie. This movie also has pretty good cinematography and also is a really pretty movie. The scares in this movie are very little but when they happen they are very well done and honestly had a chill going down my spine. The movie also doesn't overstay it's welcome it's only a 90 minute movie and that is perfect runtime for this movie. The movie is also a lot of fun to watch. But this is not a perfect movie at all and it does have some problems to it. The characters in this movie are not likeable at all they are all jerks yes Stevens and Brie's characters are the only decent characters in this movie but they are still jerks. The movies also has a lot of horror movie cliches that can't be escaped. Also, this movie does have a lot of interesting plot points that just don't get any looking into which sucks because they were really interesting.

Only to be stalked by a creeper.The film does have a slow building suspense build up. Charlie (Dan Stevens) and his wife Michelle (Allison Brie) going with his brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White) and his girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand).

Yet with COVID-19 restrictions and what not, an abundance of time and lack of options led me to this. For sixty-minutes of this film, the drama, character building, story... basically every element of a horror film that is, all so often, done wrong... this had all that. For sixty-minutes I witnessed four characters with motives and moral dilemma's, indifferences and affection, pour out in front of me. Let's say this wasn't a horror film, but a drama about moral decisions and character studies, this would have been a hit. But then the last thirty minutes takes everything you have loved about these characters, condenses it completely and ties a lovely generic horror ending bow on top. This is still a six, this IS a film worth watching for that sixty-minutes of fantastic scripting and acting, but you will be disappointed with the ending.

Cynical, tense and twisted, The Rental is a slow, violent romp around the worst parts of couple vacations.Although it takes its time getting to its brutal denouement, the film wastes no time in painting its four leads as horribly as possible. When chaos ensues, their addictions, malaises and secrets cause enough of a maelstrom that their inability to see what's happening before its way too late makes sense. Scenes of fake domestic bliss, close ups of roving eyes, guilty faces in the background and careless slips of tongue keep tension from ever ebbing as the situation worsens.A great first flick from Dave Franco, with a great cast ready to be awful. Definitely recommend if you ever wished you'd been invited out to the cabin in the woods."}, {"id": 287, "text": "SYNOPSIS: Charlie (Dan Stevens), his brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White) and they girlfriends decide to take a weekend trip out to a very nice house in the hills. What was supposed to be a celebratory get-away begins to get darker and darker.REVIEW: In case you didn't understand my title, it's a reference to the Showtime TV Series Shameless where Jeremy Allen White plays a character name Lip (short for Philip) and it's really nice to see him a part of another film since he is my absolute favorite character from Shameless.The Rental is Dave Franco's directorial debut and I will say that I can see potential in his ability. This film felt like a film that was supposed to be 2-hours, but was forced to cut 40 minutes out of the runtime. I'm not saying that 2 hours would've serviced this film, but it just felt rushed. The acting is this is done well as you'd expect from the cast, however, the story itself was just bland. It was a simple premise that's been used a million times and I'm not saying it can't be done well, but what Franco tries to do here, doesn't add anything. In fact, I'd say it took away from the sub genre. For being less than an hour and a half, it felt like it took forever for anything thrilling began to happen and when it finally did, there was 10 minutes left in the film and so it was rushed. Now, the twist they were going for could've worked in a film that moved at a faster pace or in a film with a long runtime. This idea of not knowing is the scariest part only works when you have time to build a connection. A perfect example is Michael Myers in Halloween. We have no idea what his motive is, but we have a connection to him. We know who he is and through the runtime in the original 1978 Carpenter version, we're with him and the main character long enough to build the tension. It allows us to connect to the main character and for us to be interested in this hunter and hunted story. A film that is able to encapsulate this well in a short amount of time is Hush. A very well made cat and mouse, where we don't know the motive, which in turn makes it a more impactful horror.At the end of the day, I could see Dave Franco as a talented director and this as his first lesson. I do hope he tries again and writes a script that captures what he was looking for in a more affective way. 4/10."}, {"id": 288, "text": "Taking the slasher formula, applying it to the Airbnb terrain, and still failing to bring anything new to the table, The Rental is a run-of-the-mill horror-thriller that takes a conventional approach to a premise that packed plenty of potential &amp; promise, and settles for far less than what it was capable of despite there being so many options to explore right in front of it.Co-written &amp; directed by Dave Franco in what's his directorial debut, the story does score points for its neat production design, excellent use of camera &amp; portent score but then, it also loses some for taking a fresh idea and creating the most unoriginal, generic &amp; derivative narrative out of it. Instead of subverting the genre conventions, it decides to play by the established set of norms.Every time an opportunity opens up to take the story into interesting places, Franco opts for the least impressive choice available. Add to that, all the characters remain just as unappealing despite the talent involved. The chosen camera angles evoke a sense of being watched, plus the epilogue alone is better than rest of the story. And for some inexplicable reason, even the gleeful violence is toned down in this.Overall, The Rental is competently crafted for a first time effort but it still finishes as yet another middling entry in a subgenre that's filled to the brim with such middle-of-the-road examples. Offering nothing that we haven't seen before, it is as predictable as I feared, and with no characters to root for, the interest starts to fizzle out at a far quicker rate than expected. In short, a mediocre at best home-invasion slasher film."}, {"id": 289, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The Rental is Dave Franco's debut as both director and screenwriter of a feature film. Making a successful horror movie was never an easy task, but I believe it's even harder nowadays. This genre has evolved in so many ways by delving into distinct subgenres and helping new directors deliver brilliant horror stories. Of course, every year has dozens of awful horror films, and most of the Worst Movies of the Year lists possess more than one horror flick. However, I firmly defend horror is reaching audiences like never before, and I genuinely believe that it's a matter of time until a Best Picture award goes to this genre.So, is The Rental one of the better ones or not so much? Well, it's as okay as it can be. I find it hard to heavily criticize a film that doesn't really give me much to actually analyze. It's a straightforward story with barely any complexity. Four characters with clear yet generic motivations. Their relationships and how they handle each romantic bond is surprisingly the most interesting aspect of the movie. Still, besides being somewhat predictable, it seems more captivating than what it truly is because one particular screenplay element fails to deliver a compelling narrative.The main (and honestly, only) horror component of the story is no more than a hollow attempt at creating a franchise. Now, there's nothing wrong with teasing an overarching story in the first film of a saga, but if this tease plays the entire horror role, then the only feeling Franco is getting from the audience is disappointment. Viewers might look forward to jumpscares and creepy sequences, but if the questions the movie makes are left unanswered, chances are people will dislike the ambiguity.I'd be interested in a sequel because this first film creates a really intriguing mystery that I'd love to see developed and eventually solved. However, this comes at the cost of sacrificing the latter flick since it basically uses the whole runtime to introduce the overarching character/element. The Rental follows the usual friends in a vacation house where things are not what they seem formula, which doesn't really set up Franco as a horror director to follow closely. He shows a bit of skill, the uneasy atmosphere is well-established, and he lets the actors play off their dialogues without too many cuts, something I deeply enjoy.Technically, it's quite good, to be honest. It's a very dark movie, but I could see everything clearly, which is usually a problem in this type of horror film. The third act might be partially a letdown, but its execution holds the necessary tension and suspense. Dan Stevens and Sheila Vand deliver two great performances, showing remarkable chemistry. Alison Brie and Jeremy Allen White are also good, but the previous duo steals the spotlight. I wish it had more horror-like sequences, even though I appreciate the focus on the character's relationships and dynamics.All in all, The Rental is a clear attempt at creating a new horror franchise, and honestly, it partially works. If success means getting the viewers interested in a sequel, then mission accomplished. However, sacrificing the first movie of a possible saga to just introduce its main horror element doesn't quite work as Dave Franco might have thought. In his directorial debut, Franco focuses on the characters and their relationships, which are undoubtedly the most captivating aspects of the film, also thanks to a fantastic cast. Despite some neat technical attributes, the formulaic screenplay and its predictable developments are far from being entertaining enough to hold my attention. The dozens of unanswered questions definitely leave an open door to produce a genuinely compelling sequel, but this first installment will always feel more like a prologue than an actual movie. If you're just looking for a simple horror flick to spend your extra time, this one won't surprise you, but it might be a good, inoffensive Saturday night pick.Rating: C"}, {"id": 290, "text": "While watching 'The Rental' I kept wondering to myself who the director was, because the film was made with a lot of class clearly. Then the credits rolled and I saw Dave Franco's name appear and I thought it must have been a mistake. I knew he was married to the film's star Alison Brie, but I also knew that he had never directed anything before, let alone a film this good. This is an incredible debut from him, and not only did he direct it but he wrote it too. Anyone who can breathe fresh life into a genre as tired as the horror one is deserves a lot of credit. Perhaps his future is held behind the camera rather than in front of it.The film blew me away by how patient it was. It only runs for 88 minutes, yet it was so happy to slowly set the story up, all the while only giving us small hints as to what the actual danger was to these characters. There is a cheap jump-scare or two early on that the film could have done without, but otherwise the first half of this film is extremely well done in the sense that we know there is danger, but we don't know who, how or what. It adds a mysterious element to the film that I absolutely loved.Then the final act kicks into gear and the film goes into overdrive. Very rarely anymore is a film able to raise my heart-rate or get me on the edge of my seat, but 'The Rental' did both. The scare sequences aren't conventional and I think that's why they worked. It was impossible to predict exactly what was coming next. I had a terrific time with this film and would highly recommend people give it a watch."}, {"id": 291, "text": "The pandemic has me wanting to get out and see a movie so I checked IMDB reviews and watched the trailer only to be a bit disappointed. Screw it! Went anyway.Ok, yes it's kinda' predictable with unknown to me actors but why was it getting me to talk at the characters in the theater (the theater was empty) as the plot slowly and casually unfolded with a dark and brooding atmosphere and creepy POV's by both the director and cinematographer? it's a very well acted, beautifully photographed slow paced mature interpretation of the thriller genre. And after it ended I felt I saw a very good movie because I was thoroughly entertained. HUH?! Was I being hypnotized into liking what appears to be a contrived movie?I mean every preconception and logical conclusion associated with this movie genre were displayed on screen but setup, presented and resolved with a quick delivery that defied all of this. Things aren't as they obviously appear which is even more evident at the end of the movie that had me scratching my head days after when it finally dawned on me this was a clever way to loop back to dash even further the audience's preconceptions of what they thought they saw and at the same time what it implies about short term vacation rentals like AirBnB.There's an antagonist that later appears you think is who he's suppose to be, motivated by actions you conclude is obvious revenge or entrapment as events and circumstances slowly unfold to prevent the renters from calling the police. No. That wouldn't make sense due to it conflicting with the screwed up relationships between the two couples that create more complex motivations and intent. How is this going to be resolved without police intervention?The writer, director and cinematographer appear to be guiding the audience using familiar short and brief scenes mixed with long contemplative camera angles and odd out of focus close ups that sneaks up on the audience to vaguely reveal a dark figure right of screen so you're not sure what it is but have to obviously conclude is the antagonist, or the landlord? And of course it's not WHO the audience thinks it is. Or is it? It's a very intelligently told thriller. I highly recommend it."}, {"id": 292, "text": "To start off, I liked quite a few things about The Rental, Dave Franco's directorial debut. While it deals with the concepts of racial discrimination and voyeurism that have been handled better in other films, The Rental adds a layer of sophisticated relationship chemistry between the four protagonists. They're flawed and vulnerable the way all young people are. While they display composure at first, when the situation starts to turn on them, they lose their cool and start making naive decisions. This complexity being explored to a great extent is what made me like The Rental.The performances are good across the board - Dan Stevens, Alison Brie, Sheila Vand, and Jeremy Allen White - all of them did a neat job with their respective roles. The beautiful hilltop house (with splendid views of the ocean), the foggy night atmosphere, the tension-inducing background score, and the overall restlessness of the screenplay certainly work in the film's favor. From the 30-minute mark, it's mostly an intense, thrill-filled ride all the way. Except for the rather bland climax, I suppose. I really wish there was more to the bad guy and his motive. The Rental may not be the best voyeur thriller out there, but it does make you rethink staying in countryside BnBs or at least, just be a little more careful in that regard."}, {"id": 293, "text": "Dave Franco's writing and directorial debut, The Rental, is a good entry to his portfolio as a new film-maker. It's not a bad start by any means and with further development and experience, I can only imagine that he'll get better. The Rental is a horror/thriller in the style of The Strangers, Last House on The Left, or When a Stranger Calls. The story follows two couples who rent a seaside home for a short vacation and discover that they are being watched by a mysterious presence. The film painstakingly develops each of the characters so that they're not just expendable victims like in other films, this is both good and bad as it explains who these people are, why they are there, and what motives and personality traits they have. However, this intricate process of character development causes the film to take too long to get to the violent tension at the climax of the story. Throughout the duration of the film we're provided with minor details and nuances that hint at a presence or some mysterious event that will eventually unfold. For instance, a locked door, strange items, or a feeling that they're being watched someone somewhere. When all of these things come together and the true story is revealed, the payoff isn't really that great. Alot of the violence is perpetrated offscreen and the ending leaves more to be desired. I would define this are more of a character study set within the backdrop of a home invasion thriller. In that regard, it's OK, if that was the intention."}, {"id": 294, "text": "The Rental is a doer upper with potential...This is a basic but functional horror film with a simple framework that's in need of a little extra TLC. In short, it gets the basic's right with a workable premise but delivers mostly perfunctory, rather than spine chilling scares.In the latter half of the film, you really get the feeling to a degree, that its going through the motions. That said, It does have its moments. The scene with the car window and the end to the final pursuit, work extremely well.I suspect this film leaves the door open to a second or third house call. Indeed, I hope they pursue this further, taking a little extra time, to craft more of the nail biting and jump scare's, horror viewers crave.6/10."}, {"id": 295, "text": "Well, this is my first review here, and I hardly care to even if I like the movie. Reason being is that I think 'complaining' has become the audience's norm these days. Too much available consumption and little time to appreciate. I had to literary unsubscribe from two long time movie review channels on YouTube for putting this movie down.If you care to hear me out, let me explain:1) If you've ever traveled enough times to find yourself worried about being watched in an airbnb (especially abroad), you will love this movie. Tackling the subject with a horror / thriller genre just hit home for be.2) Let's talk about directing. For a first time directer; fantastic. The scene in the end with Mina by the cliff is the most subtle 'hold your breath' I've seen this year. I mean the few seconds you need to understand what really happened. Wow. Not only was it surprising and metaphorical, but it actually flipped the genre on its head.3) Let's talk acting. I believed everyone. Not to say I loved them. This isn't that kind of movie. People are real, stupid and selfish like all of us. But are they underdeveloped? Hell no. I didn't need to know more about them. I understood them perfectly that their decisions in the last few minutes came natural to me.4) And now let's talk the two things I liked the most about the movie: a - Tension. Tension. Tension. Sometimes inconsistent or slow, and sometimes you're not sure whether this is a thriller or horror or drama (though you do in the last ten minutes) but I enjoyed every moment. b - The ending. It's not that big reveal or twist, but the way it's presented, that's the horror. Again two strikes in one. You get to have an unusual and different ending and (don't want to spoil anything) it's terrifying because of what it MEANS, not what you SEE.I lOVED this movie and will watch it again.In the end, I always remind myself that The Shining was a flop when it was first released. Is the Rental as good, not there, yet. But If Dave Franco grows into two more movies of this caliber, he will come up with something as good. You can sense it.

The cinematography is great, and the movie doesn't rush shots, which I very much like. Some shots just linger, waiting to show something, not cutting away, not yet revealing the next information either. Direction and cinematography are seriously great. Sadly, the script and acting are not.Two couples go on a weekend-long trip away. At the rented oceanfront house, they discover that they are being watched.The idea isn't original, but it doesn't have to be. There are many movies out there that follow a simple or unoriginal premise, but still turn out to be great. The Rental is not one of these movies, despite my initial praise.The buildup takes a bit too long for my taste. I don't mind a slow burn, but this movie really takes its time. There's a tense atmosphere built throughout the movie. The slightly desaturated look, the dark music, the shots looking off into the grey distance, all convey a sense of dread.Then, there's the exposition. God, is it awful. The way information about the characters or their intentions are revealed, especially in the first half, is ridiculously bad.Speaking of the characters, they are really bland. The movie tries to give them distinct personalities, but fails to make any of them really likeable or interesting. Part of that is the writing, the other is the acting. Alison Brie does a good enough job with what she has to work with. Dan Stevens, Sheila Vand and Jeremy Allen White are between mediocre and bad. There is no chemistry. All relationships feel forced. The dialogue is mostly not believable.All in all, the great direction by Franco and cinematography by Christian Sprenger are let down by a bad script (also by Franco) and mostly mediocre acting.

Many things in this make no sense but I don't want to get into spoilers. The weirdest thing, probably, was the awkward racism and misogyny commentaries, these felt really out of place.Why I gave this 7 instead of a 4 or 5 is because I'm almost sure that due to the way the ending was shot, this film is not a case of the creators messing up, this was quite intentional and was made in this specific way to emphasize certain key points.I can't say this though about the whole film, since it is very inconsistent and barely believable at times, but the core idea, again, if intentional, is worth it. I can't really discuss it without diving into spoilers, but I loved the vibe that makes you feel like you're watching a crime mystery documentary. I love how methodical and cold it got in the end (powered by a great soundtrack). I really hope that the message I got from this film was the one the creators wanted me to understand.Thus, in my head, this film came all the way from garbage to an interesting experience.P.S.

For the rest of us who merely want a straightforward depiction about what can go wrong with two couples vacationing together on the Oregon coast, satisfaction is within reach.Relative depth of characterization and expert acting supported by reasonable suspense reveal what we really know and how we react to the unknown. Case in point: Charlie (Dan Stevens) and Michele (Alison Brie) are experiencing Charlie's business success, and his brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White) and his wife, Charlie's new partner, Mina (Sheila Vand), join them in a typically stylish coastal rental to celebrate.Franco smartly distributes his exposition before disclosing the identity of the genre-requisite stalker. More so does he slowly expose the real stalker-the attraction of Charlie and Mina, which leads to indiscretion that leads to mayhem between the couples. What Franco is careful to preserve is the realism of dissembling characters and the effects of their ill-considered actions.While a surveillance motif is prominent-cameras all over the house most notably in the shower (several Hitchcock similarities)-it is within the consciences of the miscreants that the disclosure of their secrets weighs most heavily. The utterly human urge to sin and hide the disclosure is more potent than the suspicion that the property manager, Taylor (Toby Huss), is a wacko stalker.The first hour and 10 minutes or so are expertly low-key, building to naughtiness and death with an unusually small set of jump scares and red herrings. Franco remains true to the operative motif that mining information and letting it go is the most lethal act of all.The Rental outstrips star Kevin Bacon's recent You Should Have Left if for nothing else because it's the fraught relationships that menace, not the stalkers.

They're a bunch of mediocre characters that will just annoy you.

It has decent acting, a few cinematic shots, some original ideas based on which it was marketed. But as the movie progresses, the story becomes complacent and predictable.If the writers actually wanted to make points about race and the current culture of staying in other peoples houses as rentals... why go the already done route and make it a slasher? Instead I think race was just used as a check mark on diversity and add a layer into characters which clearly lacked any. It's like there were sparks of originality in the beginning but eventually succumbed to the tried and tested route of the slasher genre. Having characters with more nuance would have helped. A critic actually compared it to a Haneke movie(I don't agree) but it brings up the point of how an effective movie actually builds on tension instead of releasing it. Maybe keeping the smaller sub points of race and relationships subtly woven into the story to add tension instead of being used as a distraction would have helped. Instead it feels like it started as a different genre but turned into a slasher. Building an atmosphere goes beyond just adding a few shots of natural landscape and a little foreshadowing. It has to be felt through the characters or else It's just surface level.

You might stick into this film because it has enough entertaining concepts that you want to believe it, but in the end you do not believe the people and you do not care about them and you do not think that any of this is possible.That said, it may not help you sleep.The biggest disappointment here is that someone came across an interesting concept and whoever actually executed on this concept failed everyone.3.5/10."}, {"id": 304, "text": "I wouldn't say I had high hopes for this film, but when the trailers released and Alison Brie and Dan Stevens showed up I did put this on my calendar.I enjoy a good horror/thriller and having two more or less A-listers in the main cast gave me hope for some elevated material.Despite solid dialog and acting I'm afraid the entire affair was largely hohum. I don't think I'm spoiling anything to say the plot revolves around a cast who rent a summer home for the weekend and something something serial killer stalker etc.In order to avoid yawning through these genre features you really just need one of two things; either an interesting dynamic between the prey or an interesting antagonist. This lacked both. The cast is largely unlikable, there's no one interesting here. The villain, while given a somewhat interesting twist at the end, is largely one note. It was just all very milquetoast.It's a shame really, I noticed this is Dave Francos writing and directorial debut so that may account for the lack of polish. I hope a respected colleague can point him towards one of the experts like Mike Flanagan (HUSH) to beef up the script for the next outing. I did like the twist. It just needed..more."}], "reviews_amount": 305}
