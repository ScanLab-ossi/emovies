I mean she at last did take up justice into her hand by killing the antagonist, isn't it the same reason the antagonist was killed for? That's a really good question to be asked"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Good movie,cast acting is mind blowing undoubtly anushka is best is this film ,the suspence ,twists are good but climax not upto mark overall a good one time watvh movie"}, {"id": 2, "text": "Great movie.

Shalini Pandey acting is good and most of the story ruled by Shalini Pandey is the captain character is the most interesting character in this film.

Its time to watch and appreciate movies of this type. Indian people are blindfolded by the age-old common template of thriller, horror, masala and blockbuster films. Not every film has to adapt the template. If any movie crosses the common template, people go crazy and start giving reviews as its not nice or waste f time movie. Nishabdham is a fantastic movie for Indian cinema. Story and screenplay is giving edge-of-seat experience. Every character holds a value or story or lesson to understand here.

Credit goes to director Hemant Madhukar who did a phenomenal job in elevating the characters and showed his expertise in presenting them on screen. I did not feel disappointed or useless about any character unlike some films where the cast will be used only for screen presence. Songs are so adapted into film and elevated the plot. Anjali, Michael Madsen, Madhavan, Subbaraju, Shalini, Avasarala Srinivas perfectly fitted to their assigned roles. And their characters added value to the film. After long time, subbaraju got such a good role and he deserves it.

Don't expect much.One can understand at the movie beginning who the villain is it's shouldn't be like that director should have take care about this. While watching the thrillers the first question should be for the viewers was who the villain is? Atleast upto to interval viewer shouldn't find the answer for that question but in this film we will easily find out the the villain at the very beginning and the only question and purpose to watch the full film is just why he done that? When u find why? In the climax it might bring you some dissatisfaction so that's why don't watch the movie with high expectations it's not a edge of the seat thriller one type.

Also, no explanation as to how Michael Madsen's character became friends with Madhavan's or what history they shared with each other. If the writers had worked on this, probably some semblance of logic and clarity could have been obtained. Anushka Shetty was ok types, Shalini Pandey literally irritates me in every frame she's present.

Very poor script and in a couple of scenes it looked as if the face of Madhavan was digitally remastered. The title song was good and opening scene was good, rest of the movie did not make any sense.

The movie is a musical as out of the 120 minutes runtime some 100 minutes have a background score. A few songs don't hurt but excessive playback drains the thrill out of it. 2. Around the half time, an officer is strangulated by the chief in front of dozens of people but no one sees him. Since the death was unnatural there must have been an autopsy which would have shown the officer died not because of falling down. Plus there must have been marks on the victim's neck which was ignored. 3. Maha turns out to be a know-it-all cop who can decide the killer just by finding a piece of yarn in the victim's hand 4. Maha is a terrible spy yet is never caught. A bunch of times she is real close to being busted but is saved predictably . I mean who talks on phone during a spying mission 5. There are some small predictable sub plots but nothing that will deter your experience. Overall the cinematography could have been better.Pros- 1. It has anushka shetty. 2. A good script and you will never feel that the story is unnecessarily stretched. 3. The cello playback will keep you engrossed. 4.Most of the major questions get answers by the end. 5.

Though the narration was not great but the mysterious moments make you to the seat edges watch. All the suspicious moments were got broke on the last few minutes. Though they tried to get you thrilled enough, they lost it when it comes to story. The story was not too impressive, Madhavan and anushka does the great work in the pre climax scenes.

This movie has too many problems! I'll go one by one1.Lack of Relatability None of these characters have any backstory except Antonys which mind you is so superficial, but at least he had one. All the others just exist out of nowhere..for example Sakshi and Sonali are orphans who were both raised in an orphanage in US and for some extremely random reason, have Indian names and know Tamil/ Telugu/Malayalam!! And one wonders why the detective in Seattle PD speaks with an Indian accent, if she's a migrant who recently went to the US and has not learnt to speak the way they do, how did she get a job in the Police Department?? In fact this movie has no relevance in being set in the US! Could have just been set in any city in India without altering anything- that could have made the movie more bearable, since they could have avoided subjecting the audience to the cringe worthy acting of all the foreigners in this movie (yes! Including Madsen.. I don't know what he thought while signing up for this). No movie could not be more unrelatable than this one!I rest my case by saying this, there is a scene in the movie where an American cop translates the Tamil into sign language for Sakshi (she is mute). Seriously?? Are we unaware of some kind of Tamil education the people of US receive to become cops?Plot Its rubbish, it seems like the writers just wanted to add a few twists, thought out what they were and came up with most lazy and underwhelming story to connect the twists.Characters *Spoilers* Don't even get me started on the backstory of Antony (Madhavan), it's absolute nonsense - he starts killing women who cheat because his wife cheated on him? I understand it if they showed that he had some mental issues and that his wife cheating on him, somehow triggered his psychosis..but noo, this movie wants to show him as the victim, poor guy only mangles women's heads because he thinks they want to cheat ..That's just super shallow, ridiculous and a dangerous message!!! Also the glorified relationship between Sonali and Sakshi is just so toxic. Sonali does not like it when anything good happens in Sakshis life (when she gets s new job, or a boyfriend)? And they're best friends it seems, they show it like it's just so normal.All in all the movie sucks big time! Don't waste your time or brain space on it.

Why does every story have to have revenge and anger in them. When you chose to make the story abt a serial killer keep it that way. Then there is the storytelling again. It starts with one person speaking and with no explanation shifts to another. Director sir forgot it is a thriller and started serving everything to on a platinum platter.The worst part of this story is how the director has ised a deaf and mute character. When a character is speaking in sign language why not put a couple of lines down for the audience to read. Imagine this Character 1 - (sign language) Character 2 - are you saying the you will go there and get settled and then take me there? Character 1 - (sign language) Character 2 - are you saying yes? What is this?? If this is the llkind of storyline and direction we get from a director. I have one word for him. SILENCE(NISHABDHAM)OH!!! Sorry honorary mention. Mr.Madsen!!! He didn't want to be a part of this movie or if he did he wanted to do it drunk and out of his mind. He is sleep walking thru the movie and not acting."}], "reviews_amount": 183}
