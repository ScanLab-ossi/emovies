RELIC reveals the agony of dementia in a dark and twisted atmospheric visual and audio assault of the senses in a nightmarish tone.Kay visits her neglected mother, Edna, who has gone missing. Kay's daughter, Sam, tags along and they are greeted with an old large home, perfect for a haunting. Edna's home has a life of its own, as seen through effective dark visuals and eerie sounds that mother and daughter encounter. They also notice hints of Edna's forgetfulness with post-it note reminders around the home.A search begins for Edna, who eventually appears after a few days, just like coming out of a stint in the prison of dementia. Edna cannot recall her whereabouts, so mother and daughter quietly put it down to the beginning of Edna's mental disintegration.This sets the motion of conflict between mother and daughter with issues of caring and the dreaded decision making of nursing homes. Meanwhile, Edna's mental state deteriorates as she eats away at the memories of photos and buries a photo album in the forest. Just like her memories being buried by the black muck that is growing through her body.Edna's granddaughter is confronted by the horrors of the onset of her grandmother's dementia. Confused and frustrated she investigates the dark hole of the disease and finds herself trapped in a horrid maze within the nightmare realm of the home. In actual fact, Sam has fallen into the mind of her grandmother's dementia, experiencing the state of confusion and horror of the dreaded disease while fighting through scattered dead memories boxed up in the thin corridors of memories.Kay has been observing Edna's onset of dementia in a silent stupor. Eventually she is forced to act in order to not only save her daughter, but Edna from self-harming. Mother and daughter manage to fight through the confronting maze of dementia, only to see Edna succumb to it and become an unrecognisable empty shell, similar to a monster. Kay is unable to walk away from it and accepts the outcome of Edna's now full-blown dementia.Sam does not recognise her grandmother anymore, as is the effect of the disease. But what Sam discovers is the dark murky stain that was growing on her grandmother's body has now appeared on her mother, stating that this disease is hereditary, which is the real horror to this tale!RELIC is a journey through the mindset of dementia, not only for the victim but for the loved ones coming to terms with it. All this delivered in a highly intelligent and subliminal work of perfect filmmaking."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Another one of these films where most reviews here say a lot more about the reviewer than the film.This is quite an intelligent debut. Not a masterpiece, but obviously not the worst movie ever or incredibly boringIt's just a bit more original than the average Blumhouse blueprinted copycat."}, {"id": 2, "text": "The 4 out of 10 stars is generous. The acting was great, that's it. Let me save you some trouble here. The whole movie is a metaphor for Alzheimers. I give one star because I can connect in that I had a grandmother with Alzheimer's, and it was an accurate protrayl, but my grandmother was far less boring. All the questions they ask have very vague answers, and I don't think many people could guess the answers to them. I could list 3 somewhat spooky things that happen, but why they happened? I don't know, either black mold or Alzheimer's, maybe both. This movie isn't scary, it isn't clever, and it draaaagged. An hour and a half long movie. 5 minutes of blank staring and 3 minutes of dream sequences that have little point. This movie makes me want to have Alzheimer's so I can forget I watched it."}, {"id": 3, "text": "It's so rare that anyone uses the horror genre to tell you something you needed to know about life. I'm absolutely overwhelmed at how elegantly this film horrified me, how totally it drew me in, and the *work* being done by the cast.A really beautiful, touching, absolutely terrifying movie, that hit me across nearly every note. My gosh. Worth a watch."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Honestly couldn't see half of what was going on. Greatly overrated, which is sad because I love a good Australian movie."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Apparently this one is not for everyone but I found it terrifying. This descent into dementia is both troubling and shocking. It portrays the overtaking of this disorienting madness creeping on the victim leaving them into a state of decrepitude and their powerless loved ones left to watch. It's a different kind of horror, one that suggests how a disease slowly seeps and infects everything until the inevitable end. Everything familiar gets corrupted by an overpowering darkness that parasites the afflicted until they're unrecognizable, a shadow of their former selves. It rots all identifiable elements of who they were until all is left is a bare core. A vessel submerged by a lifetime accumulation of stuff, a demented mess hunted by the only thing that remains, the sum of all its fears. It's scary because it's inevitable and the poisoned gift transcends time like a curse raking havoc and destruction throughout generations."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I'm literally going through this with a family member and it really made me think. Is this what she goes through everyday? It's scary. More of a thriller than a horror movie, but I liked it. For all the people giving it a crappy rating, for not explaining, it was explained, it was just over your head. They stepped into what she was seeing. Every rotted piece, was another memory forgotten. The walls closing in, in her mind. The way she saw her home, now. Symbolism, people, symbolism. I wouldn't say, it was a 10/10, but it did shine a light on the ugliness that waits for some of us."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Here we go again....Another attempt of a slow burn horror but the only thing that burnt out was my patience. I mean it's one thing if after all the build up made suspense we would actually get some genuine scares but here it is just not there. Nothing, Nada, not a single moment of fear.At the end of the day the movie can look good, have fine actors and possess a decent story but it would be nothing without the actually horror which turns out to be the title of the genre.Avoid."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Slow and boring right up until the end is all i can say about this movie.Almost nothing happens, and even in the end we are left wondering what happen, and why....."}, {"id": 9, "text": "A young director clearly inspired by the great Aronofsky writes and directs a masterpiece about death and loss using craftily symbolisms.The movie is not for everybody to comprehend and clearly has an average of 6/10 cause most people expecting to see a cliche haunted house story."}, {"id": 10, "text": "This is well done and I can't say I have seen anything like it. The actors are very good and the script is creative and well timed. It's a fairly slow burn but not enough to lose your attention. I love a good horror but this one hit too close to home. I couldn't handle it. That's never happened before. When I was a teenager, my best friend and I, used to get rocked and go see movies like The Exorcist. So, when I say I couldn't handle THIS movie, that says something. If you love a good horror and you are the target audience, this one will give you nightmares. If you're not the target audience, it probably won't phase you. For instance, if you are afraid of flying, then movies about aircraft accidents will effect you. If you are not afraid of flying you can mentally step back and not get nervous watching a movie about airplane accidents. It's like that. If something like this has even remotely touched your life, this movie will rattle your cage big time."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Why do these awful artsy fartsy contrived dramas keep being passed as horror when they're absolutely not. Are critics just that clueless and deluded? This plays by the numbers like so many other critically hailed horror films of the last decade. Apparently to get great reviews you can just follow the same dry uninspired formula of symmetrical camerawork and supposed dread inducing overacting. Then add a deep metaphorical message that is just as effective as an actual visual monster because  what you can't see is scarier. No that isn't true horror. It's drama. It's just such a miserably lazy film even though Mortimer salvages it from being truly terrible."}, {"id": 12, "text": "A solid debut for Natalie James. This is a slow burn horror that builds with each minute, and by the third act is full blown terror. All of the acting was surprisingly phenomenal, extremely impressed by Bella Heathcote. The third act is a fun ride, claustrophobic and even a little gore. Give it a shot, you wont be disappointed."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Then the plot takes turn into an uninteresting inexplainable mess.

Anyone who has a friend or relative afflicted with dementia knows it's often like living in a real life horror film. It's frustrating and claustrophobic and guilt-inducing and above all, frightening. The first feature film from director Natalie Erika James deals with dementia, amongst other topics, in the guise of a horror film. Is it a haunted house movie? Is it a demonic presence movie? Well, yes to both. The script from Ms. James and Christian White blends multiple familiar aspects of horror films into something that ends up quite original.Ends up is the key, because the first two-thirds of the story moves slower than a glacier in the middle of winter. Don't get me wrong, the film looks great - the house and the atmosphere are ultra-creepy. It's just that almost nothing happens during that span, and that's an eternity for set up. Kay (Emily Mortimer) receives a call that a neighbor hasn't seen her mother in a while. Kay and her 20ish daughter Sam (Bella Heathcote, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES, 2016) take the drive over the hills and through the woods to grandmother's house. Their initial measured walk-thru of the house tells them (and us) much. Post-it notes are stuck everywhere, including one that says Don't follow it. Spoiled fruit on the counter, a favorite chair moved, and food for a pet long ago passed, are all indicators that something is off. If that's not enough, the house that grandma is missing from has mold on the walls and ceiling, and strange locks on doors.After an unsuccessful search party through the nearby woods, Grandma Edna (Robyn Nevin) reappears with no recollection of where she's been. Of course, this doesn't really improve things for anyone. We sense that workaholic Kay and her mother have never really been close, and the same can be said for Kay and Sam. Generational disconnect is on display. And poor Edna has lost her husband, her pet dog, and most of her essence ... except for the few moments when she snaps back to lucidity.Dread and impending doom dominate every scene for the first hour. Kay has dreams of an old cabin from her past, and Edna has an unexplained bruise on her chest. The stained glass window on the front door is a key, and the sounds coming from the walls are unable to be tracked down. As disoriented as Edna is, the house itself has that impact on us and Sam. Is it the house that's haunted, or the characters?The cinematography from Charlie Sarroff plays well off the stillness and unknown, and the sound design and music (Brian Reitzell) work hand-in-hand in establishing the creepy atmosphere. The three actresses are superb, and I especially enjoyed Ms. Nevin and her piercing eyes, as she is known mostly for her live theatre work (and also as Councillor Dillard in The Matrix movies). For her first feature, Ms. James has delivered a high-concept Australian horror/suspense film with a very original (and weird) ending. Others may be a bit higher on the film, but we likely all agree that Ms. James is an intriguing filmmaker."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Granma gets lost in the woods. Daughter looks for her. Granma comes back after 3 days. Absolutely nothing happenes next 2 weeks. Granddaughter drops LSD and start tripping in the house. Granma attacks everyone with a knife but gets her ass kicked instead. Daughter forgets about the bad LSD trip instantly and acts like nothing happened. Granma turns into an alien mummy. Everybody fall asleep because it was a busy day. Still better than the Last Jedi."}, {"id": 21, "text": "The movie is good in the sense that it makes you feel how does it to have a family member who has dementia illness, alzheimer.The movie depicts the feelings of being lost, and helplessness in the face of an illness that can turn a person into something else, to a different person. And it also teaches you to deal with it, you need to embrace it.Good visual scenes, and sound effects. Normally, I don't like movies like this but I liked this one."}, {"id": 22, "text": "The story in this movie is allegory to mental disease such as dementia or Alzheimer's. Dealing with a family member that transforms from a person you knew your whole life into a creature that doesn't remember its own name IS a horror in real life. So although idea of this movie is not bad, the execution could be better. I agree with others: it is too slow and dull. And, no, it is not really a horror flick, i am sure many horror fans will agree. I still recommend it for home viewing. Another spoiler: the fact that they show three generations of women in the same family kind of suggest that disease is hereditary (like Alzheimer's), that is why in the end the daughter has a black spot too, meaning it will happen to her like it did to her parents."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Any negative reviews come from people who do not have a real appreciation for cinema.

Don't use any lights on set, and make pointless metaphors about old age and neglect. That'll surely scare people! And yes, Don't reveal what's the big mystery because it's deep, just like The Babadook. Utter Trash. Thankfully, IMDb ratings/reviews will save us from paid/clueless Metascore."}, {"id": 25, "text": "I am so tired of horror movies where the characters move to a new house and walk in dark corridors for 80 minutes. What's that sound? Oh it's a washing machine. It doesn't matter. What's that sound? Oh it's just grandma being a weirdo. Go to bed grandma. What's that-- It's all a meaningless barrage of random nonsense. We need the first 80 minutes of the movie to get to the actual reason why this movie was made - the pretentious last 10 minutes. Just release that allegory for dementia/depression as a stand alone short film and don't waste my time with filler."}, {"id": 26, "text": "It's a metaphor for dementia, but as a die-hard Horror fan, it's missing what I crave: unsettling atmosphere, chilling imagery, well-executed scares (if necessary to story and style), and a true sense of dread. I never felt any sense of peril and I found myself not really caring about the characters, despite how well-acted they are. If strong female performances is what you crave, go for it.

No plot, slow. waste of time and money"}, {"id": 29, "text": "Making movies for today's horror audience is a tricky proposition, but Relic impressed me with it's commitment to telling an emotional story that resonates with issues which you may recognise from our lives outside of the fantasy-horror tropes. The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a less is more approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I just saw this at Sundance 2020 world premiere I didn't realize I was sitting behind the filmmaker! it was truly great! very great deep scary compassionate true blue #trueblueep #hummingbullrising"}, {"id": 31, "text": "Hey Natalie Erika James (director), learn how to LIGHT your scenes. I gave up bothering trying to see what you were trying to show when something supposedly creepy was happening.What was truly insufferable was your actors WALKING AT A SNAILS PACE in every scene. Its been done to death, does not create any tension and you just abused it to stretch out the films running time. Not impressed. Sick to death of lame characters walking in slow mo. Hurry the F up and get on with it.A 50 year old and 20 something year old are over powered by an 80 year old, and then run terrified from her. Seriously? LOL. I was itching for the old bag to die, I really was. I could not stomach her.Constant mum...mum...mum....mum....mum? dialogue then playing cat and mouse. It truly gets BORING watching the daughter and grand daughter walk in slow mo after the old bag over and over and over.This movie is a 'The Babadook wannabe (which wasn't that great either), using pretentious metaphors for depression and Alzheimers. Yawn. Also, the tilting camera shot of the hallway has been done to death and SUCKS.The dream sequences were nonsensical and the grannys dementia materialized as an entity/whatever in the house was never fully utilized in my humble opinion.The ending? Shes a shell of her former self I take it and her sanity dead in the water. Everything that was her has gone, leaving a corpse. Again, made no sense.Also, couldn't stand Bella Heathcote (Sam). Typical millennial bore with zero charisma. Emily Mortimer (Kay) phones in her performance.An utter dog turd from start to finish. Have a nice day.

People say it's to slow and boring, but i think it does it well. The first 2 thirds of the movie take some time and tell the story with a lot of creepy scenes sprinkled in, and the final 30 minutes go all out, and i love that. The last few minutes where kay is peeling off edna's skin is a great metaphor for how dementia slowly turns the person you love into someone that barely remembers you. It made me cry thinking about it. In real life it really is like the skin of that person is peeling off, and they've turned into a different person that can barely remember their family and live on their own.

Relic is pretty much well directed and the acting is decent, but for the first hour just drag, and the rest of the time is kind good but still, a movie is always about the beginning, middle, and ending.

It's a dud."}, {"id": 48, "text": "Absolutely boring!!!!Totally waste of time, definitely one of the worst I've ever seen!"}, {"id": 49, "text": "Firstly - I was so frustrated and annoyed by the end of this movie that I actually created an IMDB account to leave feedback -- I feel so robbed of time I'll never get back!So the biggest issue is actually the way this film was shot - the director has tried to evoke a certain tone - I'm not sure if they were going for Lynch overtones but the fact that nearly every single bloody shot was in darkness - oftentimes you couldn't even SEE the actor's faces/reactions at all as they were enshrouded in so much darkness, it was ridiculous. My husband and I probably spent the best part of 30 minutes!! trying to improve the brightness, contrast, color - anything we could to make the movie more watchable so we could tell what the hell was going on! but to no avail. We went back and watched the trailer and that had clearly been edited as that was entirely watchable. We ended up trying it on two different screens but we couldn't significantly improve the display.So in a nutshell, the director truly sacrificed the film (and her actors' performances - which overall, were fairly solid) in order to present a nearly unwatchable film purely because of how dark it was. There were moments we presumed were meant to be scary - but we couldn't tell - we couldn't see a bloody thing! Or providing us with visual information -- i.e. when Nan turned around in the kitchen and we had the camera angle on her feet. We could not discern if her feet were dirty or bloody etc... the lighting made it impossible! This happened so many times throughout the film it rendered the entire thing utterly impossible to enjoy (or follow properly).And by the end we still had no clue as to what had happened. Was this a haunting as the log line had hinted at? If so, it did not appear so. Was Nan possessed? We didn't think so. Only AFTER the film finished and I googled did I read that essentially the house was a manifestation of the old lady's dementia. That said, it didn't make sense as to why the other now has been afflicted with the same 'rot' (per the end of the film) and WTF dear ol' Nan turned into at the end.We couldn't tell what Kay was doing with her mother on the bed - was she trying to destroy the creature, remove layers of rotten flesh -- we couldn't see it, only hear it and see dark outlines.And frankly, in the actions of Nan in the third act, when her increased acts of dementia had escalated, it made absolutely NO sense that her daughter wouldn't at least pick up the phone and appeal for medical intervention or at the very least, a medical evaluation.Oh, this movie was so dreadful on so many levels. My only positive comment is that Emily Mortimer transcended the material she was given with her strong performance.But overall, just woeful.Also, I live close to Ballarat so know Creswick quite well... it was a cute homage to a town not really known that well outside of the Western Grampian region, even if the house (and the area, looked nothing like Creswick).I don't mean to sound so negative but I was soooo looking forward to getting behind this film and supporting it, especially having heard so much hype and of course, hearing how well it was received on the festival circuit.TBH, I feel the lighting hurt the movie more than even the poor script. IF we could have actually SEEN what was going on - including and importantly, key moments where the audience needs to know or understand something via a reveal, or an actor's visual response - it might have made for a better film.Hoping the director's next work allows their DP to light the scenes properly."}, {"id": 50, "text": "The movie has potential but in the end does not deliver.

The faith in loved ones lost, the distrust, the anger and frustration; but most of all, the unconditional love that is thrust upon you, particularly during times of family turmoil. This film is riddled with metaphors and analogies of the disease dementia, plaguing even the most sound of minds to the point that the sane viwers doubt themselves, yet it is done in such a subtle methodology that you will be doubting your own sanity.

So very disappointing."}, {"id": 81, "text": "The ultimate scene of this horror film recalls the ending to the highly influential feature film 'Under the Skin', in which it is revealed that Scarlett Johansson's character is merely wearing the visage of humanity, and is in fact a matte-skinned alien humanoid. Like Edna, the alien of Under the Skin reaches across a chasm in search of human connection - an effort that seems doomed. Though Under the Skin is not overtly a horror movie, its imagery has found its way into many successful works in the genre, such as Get Out and Stranger Things.I think the biggest challenge this film faces is the establishment of a solid thematic basis. This shaky foundation manifests in an obscure backstory of the apparent similar fate of the older generation of the family, and the confused metaphysics of the labyrinth, which feels tacked on to the third act rather than embedded in the total story. Is the house inside the mind of Edna, or is the house haunted? Ambiguity isn't a negative necessarily, but in films like 'The Shining' (a touchstone to recent so-called 'elevated horror' films like the influential 'Hereditary') the ambiguity is constructed in such a way that the viewer can provide multiple poetic interpretations. If the mystery is resolved (they literally broke out of the decaying haunted house of Edna's mind) then it shuts out the viewer's imagination.The image is rendered excessively dark at times, to the point that it becomes difficult to see what is happening. This may have been done to smooth over bumps in production however at times it forces the view to strain to comprehend the scene.I want the Australian film and TV industry to generate excellent genre films, because industry is founded on such work. I fear that many will come to this film hoping for a scare and feel baited by this film that can be successfully marketed as one thing while being another. Yes, horror can be profitable, and that is because it is founded on that dedicated part of the audience who like to be put in a state of fear and dread, who willingly suspend their disbelief in a supernatural scenario that holds meaning. Stories can mean things, but not when they are overt: 'we inherit the relics of the older generation, whether we like to or not'. If the audience can walk out of the experience and quickly do the math in their head that 'the the real monster was the dementia' then what you have is a personal essay, not a story.Australian filmmakers have been coached into embedding signposted cultural virtue into their films in order that government bodies can make a moral argument for film financing, rather than a financial one.

What makes some scream makes others snore. Those who crave horror movies awash in gallons of fake blood and gore will abhor the scarcity of splatter in freshman Japanese-Australian director Natalie James' Relic. starring Emily Mortimer, Bela Heathcote, and Robyn Nevin. This creepy, claustrophobic, but credible psychological chiller affects three generations of women in the same family. Confined under the same roof, they are menaced by an unknown entity sowing evil like the pestilent black mold that has infested their ancestral home. Basically, Relic is an allegory about the hereditary nature of Alzheimer's disease. Eighty-year-old Edna (Robyn Nevin of The Matrix Reloaded) suffers from bouts of Alzheimer's and lives in a perpetual state of paranoia. She insists an anonymous presence has been lurking around in her secluded two-story house. Edna's middle-aged daughter Kay (Emily Mortimer of Shutter Island) and her twentysomething granddaughter Samantha (Bella Heathcote of Dark Shadows) move in with her to supervise the octogenarian's daily regimen. The first 30-minutes tackles strictly procedural problems, with Kay and Sam arriving at Edna's house and the local constable interviewing Kay. Afterwards, everything goes to Hell for these dames, before a contrived but surreal finale that seems wholly incompatible with the events preceding it. James makes an auspicious directorial debut with Relic and cultivates a mood of dread throughout this macabre yarn should keep audiences on tenterhooks. Clocking in at an eerie 89 minutes, The Relic smolders with a mesmerizing slow-burn intensity that underlines its spooky aura of unease. James knows the grief and the guilt that relatives face when one of their own is stricken by this insidious brain disorder. Apart from serving as a primer about Alzheimer's and an inventory of the symptoms, Relic ranks as a better-than-average horror about a genuinely horrible disease.Relic opens in large, two-story house ablaze with a constellation of colored Christmas lights. Meantime, water gushes ominously from a bathtub faucet, overflowing the tub, rolling like a tide across the floor, running out of the bathroom door, along the hall, down the stairs, and finally pooling in the living room. Standing in her living room at night clad only in a towel is an 80-year-old, white-haired matriarch. This marks the first time we see Edna, the lady of the house. Beyond the living room window on the periphery of the screen, something presumably human approaches the Christmas tree with considerable stealth. The first time you see Relic you might overlook the evil silhouette because the image is so fleeting. Considering the extent of the damage done when she forgot to turn off the bathtub faucet, it is surprising Edna's daughter Kay didn't have her committed to a nursing home. Of course, if Kay had put Edna away, there would not have been a movie. Later, when Kay and Samantha explore the house, both have close encounters with this mute evil humanoid. This silent intruder and the malignant evil that it appears to spawn in the house generates most of the hysteria in this Gothic style tale. No, you don't have to worry about cheap, obnoxious jump scares startling you like in a shallow, teen-oriented, PG-13 nail biter. Instead, James and White immerse us in the narrative, and we experience the old woman's anxiety and find ourselves in a fight or flight narrative. Mind you, just because the horror may be something truly plausible doesn't mean that it is any less traumatic than the horror in either outlandish creature features or a slasher sagas. The horror in Relic develops just as gradually as the protagonists realize it isn't entirely a figment of Edna's dementia. Rather than tangling with gut-munching zombies or maniacs wielding razor-sharp kitchen cutlery, the protagonists struggle not only to save their mother but also to survive the ordeal themselves.Relic is in every way a subtle, sophisticated, but eloquent, sleight of hand horror movie that builds up to its surprising finale by suspensefully parceling out its chills. You can only truly appreciate this head scratcher of yarn when you've watched it a couple of times and spotted things you might possibly have overlooked initially. Anybody who succumbs to the spell of this white-knuckled chiller will feel the icy talons of fear penetrate their flesh and paralyze their muscles. After Kay learns her mother Edna has been reported 'missing' from the local constable, she rushes to the police station. Later, she participates dutifully in a search party. A large party of searchers fan out to comb the terrain beneath lofty pine trees towering overhead. A couple of days after Samantha and her daughter have moved in Edna's home, Kay awakens to discover Edna standing in the kitchen. She is brewing tea as if nothing catastrophe had occurred. Kay notices that Edna's feet are filthy from having roamed barefoot in the woods. Edna has no idea about the great commotion she has caused. Initially, she behaves as if Kay and Samantha are encroaching on her life. Later, Kay tours a prospective 24/7 assisted living facility for Edna. In the long run, however, this alternative doesn't turn out to be a viable option.Director Natalie James doesn't wield horror like a cudgel to scare the daylights out of us. Instead, she relies on Edna's deteriorating condition to generate the kind of horror you've seen in demonic possession movies. Comparably, demon possessed victims do share considerable similarity with Alzheimer's patients who end up deprived of any shred of rational thinking and can often turn homicidal. Sadly, the grand finale-as incredibly spectacular as it is--sacrifices all pretense of authenticity and the film concludes with evil far from vanquished. Anybody who has seen director Adam Robitel's The Taking Of Deborah Logan (2014) will discover a lot in common with Relic. Ultimately, James and co-scripter Christian White have fashioned an unforgettable saga which benefits from not only Steven Jones-Evans's evocative production designs but also Charlie Sarroff's sinister widescreen cinematography."}, {"id": 101, "text": "Relic: An old woman goes missing.

The movie is very good in some areas: the cast does an excellent job, the light and color fits the atmosphere and the atmosphere created is perfect.On the other hand, it feels like there is no story behind.

Mix it all and serve it cold.At some point it seems like the movie is about a haunted house, at some other points it seems like it is about spirits possessing the people. You will never know.I would never say this is a horror movie. But there is no scare or horror scenes whatsoever. The most scary scene is when they discover a moldy wall and when the niece gets trapped inside the house which, at this point it felt more like she took some drugs and tripped (because this is the only moment the movie suggests the house may be haunted).The movie may be read as a metaphor for Alzheimer, probably, but it still doesn't fit with the haunted house scene or the terrifying mold.You end up feeling they didn't tell you any story and you just watched a random and unconnected pieces of footage with no purpose.It could have made a fine short movie, but this is too long for such an empty and vague story."}, {"id": 108, "text": "This movie unfortunately caught my attention for all of the wrong reason.

Where it does fail, as is to be expected is the overall plot as it is riddled with holes which the director seems to have almost purposefully ignored in order to deliver their message.The movie is really two different movies into one. The first part is pretty engaging, ambitious and even clever at times as a psychological horror. The second part is the movie's intellectual capitulation and devolution into a zombie horror as it realizes it cannot coherently finish the message from the first part.In part one we get introduced to the family with a grandma suffering from dementia and her daughter and granddaughter who try to figure out how to help her. Of course here you have your pretentious violin shredding, uncomfortable close-ups and dark shots of the interrior meant to make you wonder if every shadow isn't something else. The grandmother engages in erratic and disturbing behavior so it definitely creates tension, although I would not credit the movie with it since even a documentary of a person with dementia is pretty unsettling without being a horror movie. This is where the movie sets up good imagery - a stained-glass window represents the clarity of the mind and in several shots we see it slowly get overtaken by a dark rot. the house itself has patches of the same rot spreading to represent the advancing disease. The grandma's hobby is to carve wax candles, representing her struggle to maintain her light in the encroaching darkness of dementia. Cool stuff so far. But here's also where the movie just shrugs and doesn't know where to go from that point. First the grandmother sees a human-shaped shadow moving in the house - OK it's her mind slipping. But then her daughter and granddaughter also see it? OK, maybe they also suffer dementia? But it isn't hereditary in the vast majority of cases, let alone three straight generations...Also it does not manifest in 20-something year olds. And just as you're ready to overlook this you see a few shots when only the audience can see the shadow, giving it credibility for being real...unless the movie means WE ALL suffer from dementia? There's even a doctor that comes in to examine the grandmother and sees a patch of rotting flesh on her chest, calling it a bruise, leading us to believe that it is in fact real and not just an illusion (more on that later). OK, plot holes aside let's see where it goes.The second part of the movie is when the granddaughter finds a somewhat hidden section of the house and explores it. Here reality breaks down, halls start shifting, doors disappear, walls block previously accessible paths and push her further and further into a narrowing corridor which eventually becomes the size of a coffin. Pretty cool sequence, except it completely does not fit with the tone of the movie so far. If the supernatural effects are real then we're not talking about a metaphor for dementia. And if it isn't real, why does a third generation 20 year old experience this? Soon the mother joins her and experiences it the exact same way, leading us all tot believe it is in fact real. Here the movie, having written itself into a corner, decides to double down and portrays the grandmother as a rotting zombie. She breaks a leg, revealing a rotting black bone, stabs herself with a knife, dropping pieces of rotting flesh, crawls jerkily towards the other two while growling and making Zerg sounds. I thought this was all a metaphor, so how can everyone experience the same? Long story short they beat the zombie-grandma up and just as they leave the mother has a fit of conscience and decides to stay and care for her anyway. What follows is a disturbing sequence of the mother peeling away the rotting flesh of the grandmother to reveal a shriveled mummified (but living) corpse underneath. They embrace lovingly, the daughter joining in to represent three generations together, and she discovers the same black rotting patch starting to form on her mother's back as well. But...it's not hereditary! But the doctor saw it! But if it's real then it's an evil entity in the house and not a metaphor for dementia! Oh who cares, don't think about it too much and just enjoy the pretentious cinematography!I won't fault the movie too much as it does undertake a fairly ambitious task and an important message to deliver, and in the end it's better to try and fail than to stick to simple and pretentious with no message in sight. It just tackles a topic well above its pay-grade and ends up flopping in its delivery as it teeter-totters between the multiple things it tries to be."}, {"id": 110, "text": "Natalie Erika James' debut feature 'Relic' is a journey through the mindset of dementia - not only for the victim but for the loved ones coming to terms with it.

That fact that it she is getting more and more bruises and the house is getting more and more rotten, i think symbolises that the alzheimers is taking more over. And the part when the granddaughter got lost in that room i think symbolises the disorientation and how scary it is from alzheimers. And that the room she is in and where the grandmother does not want to go inside is where the alzheimers evolved. Where all the forgotten things are.The strange ending where they all was laying on the bed, and the daughter had ripped all the grandmothers skin of and ended all black-\u00abskinned\u00bb i think represent that she peeled off the old her, and now she was just dying of illness, and that the daughter finally excepted it. The last seconds the granddaughter sees a small black bruise on her mothers shoulder, that could represent that alzheimers is an inherited disease, and she will also develop it over time.So good and cool idea, but could maybe have been done in an other way to make it scarier and better.

What a beautiful and haunting portrayal of the affects of dementia as it creeps in to a family member.If you have ever had someone you know go through this horrible condition, Relic will leave you both terrified and saddened by the end. The actors do an amazing job of portraying their emotions of dealing with a family member who transfroms into someone unrecognisable and their own guilt and fear of how to take proper care of them.The cinematography was also stunning throughout, the water coming down the stairs in the beginning was gorgeously shot and the scenes in the forest were ghostly atmospheric.Also the moment where the house becomes a labyrinth and the corridors get tighter and smaller was so clever!

When Edna reappears, Kay begins to not be able to tell if she's slipping into dementia or something more sinister.The last 20 minutes had me absolutely riveted and holding my breath from the tension.

As a typical good horror film the timing of the film is excellent.

Some people that I really do respect in the horror community were speaking highly of it. It was interesting that I was going to watch another 2020 horror film for this week on my podcast, but when I saw this movie fit better with the 1950 movie I picked, I asked Jaime if she was interested and we gave this a viewing instead. The synopsis here is a daughter, mother and grandmother are haunted by a manifestation of dementia that consumes their family's home.We start this movie with what looks like Christmas lights. It shows us a bathtub overflowing and then to a naked old woman. It then shows us a figure in all black pop up in the background, but it is blurry.The movie then takes us to Kay (Emily Mortimer) and Sam (Bella Heathcote) heading out to a house in a small town. They're looking for Kay's mother and Sam is her daughter. They break into the house and there's no sign of her. They check around and eventually have to involve the police in a search of her in the woods.Kay begins to have a nightmare of a cabin and of an old man inside of it. He is being consumed by mold where we see him pass away. We then learn later, this cabin was what was originally on this property the house now sits. The stain glass that is in the front door was also on the front door then and was preserved.Then as if nothing happened, Edna (Robyn Nevin) shows back up. She is making tea that morning and Kay asks where she had been. Edna seems annoyed that she is asked, but it is ignored when Sam comes into the room to hug her. This then becomes a struggle of Kay wanting to help her mother, but her mother resisting. She doesn't want to give up her house or her way of life. Sam offers an alternative and Kay struggles with doing what is best for her life as well as what would be best for her mother. There is also this entity that Edna is seeing. Is it real or is it something else?That's where I want to leave my recap as that gets you up to speed with what the movie is really about without going into spoilers. What I really dug about this movie though is the underlying allegory that it is trying to relay. I will admit that I did read an interview of the director/co-writer of this movie, Natalie Erika James, so I'm going to incorporate aspects that were relayed in my analysis. I did pick up on some of things, but there was more that I didn't correlate that helped to deepen what I enjoy.The first thing that I really liked with this movie is that we have three generations of women in this family. Edna is living alone since her husband passed away. She is dealing with Alzheimer's and has to leave notes to remind her of the mundane tasks of daily life. She's at a difficult age where she wants to continue her way of life, but she's losing that ability.Then we have Kay. She's a busy woman that has her own life. She can't 'babysit' her mother and she needs more intensive care. It is a difficult decision, but she's looking at nursing homes for her mother. This causes her to butt heads with Sam, who is willing to take on the burden. She no longer wants to go to college and is currently working at a bar. Her mother wants what is best for her, but is doing that motherly thing where she is interjecting her thoughts on what her daughter should be doing with her life.Without going into spoilers here, since I'll do a spoiler section later, we have the entity that keeps popping up. I'm not going to lie, I thought what they did here was effective in having it be seen by us and not the characters in the story. I know not everyone is a fan of this, but it is creepy to me for sure. What I also like is they play with other dimensions a bit as well. There's a closet where Edna believes it started. Sam goes into it and we see a mirror of the house that is in worse shape. It is covered in mold and it seems this world is bleeding into ours. What I like here though, Edna claimed earlier that the house seems too big now that her husband is gone. There might be some truth to this.Since I've already moved into it, I thought the effects of this movie were well done. Everything was done practical for the most part. The allegory of the mold we are seeing was one I really dug and if there was CGI, it was used seamlessly in my opinion. The entity we see creeped me out as well. Influences are of Asian cinema and I know while watching this I said I had the vibe of like Ju-on or Ringu so that makes a lot of sense. I do need to give credit to the cinematography as well. It was shot very well and I enjoyed the use of mirrors. It plays in with the other world as an allegory as well.Next I want to take this to the acting of the movie. This is really a cast of three with some support from others. Mortimer was really good as this middle generation that has her own life and is trying to do right by the woman that raised her. She is just a solid actress in general and I'm not sure I've seen in her a bad role. Nevin is really good as the old woman. I love how natural she plays this as someone who has Alzheimer's. She is one person and then different in the next scene which is in line with what I've heard about this condition. Heathcote is interesting as well in her role. She does some investigation, but I also like that she's not jaded by the world yet.Now with that said, I really dug what this movie was doing. I will say that I had my expectations a little bit high as I heard how scary this was. I even braced Jaime for it. I did find that it had creepy parts, but it definitely wasn't as scary as I was expecting. That is not to say I was disappointed or anything like that. I think there are some really good concepts and I dig the underlying allegory. The effects were good and I thought the acting was as well. The soundtrack fit for what was needed and the use of sounds from things in the movie did help make scenes even creepier in my opinion. Overall I would say this is movie is good. I will probably try to give this another viewing before the year ends to see if this is a contender for my final year end list.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10SPOILERS:The truth of what we're getting here is that Edna has dementia. This isn't new as it is in the synopsis. What it is though the entity we're seeing is a manifestation of her disease attacking her and trying to take over her body. I found this to be rather interesting as James was dealing with the grief of her grandmother who dealt with same type of ordeal and what decision needed to be made.To take this even farther, I believe that the hallway that Sam goes down is a representation of going into the mind of Edna. This hallway and the other house is where she as missing when they got there. When Edna goes back in, she completely succumbs to the disease. She isn't the same person that she was when she went in. I also like that there's a bruise on her chest when was found earlier in the movie. It is spreading and she is stabbing herself later, pulling off skin. This is her trying to stop it, but finally giving in.The last bit that made me tear up here is Kay and Sam finds their way back as well as the new Edna. They go to leave, Edna says Kay's name. This causes her to stay, as her Great Grandfather passed away alone. Kay helps remove the skin and comes to terms with her new mother. She won't let her die alone. Sam also joins them and we see that Kay has a mark on her back, signifying this ordeal will carry on in the next generation. It is an interesting movie dealing with grief and the struggles of someone changing due to dementia."}, {"id": 192, "text": "Slow burn horror, right?

This movie is clearly a drama about fear of death, guilt, solitude etc. probably it was a short story at first. But of course it would be so dull and some horror elements added to make it more..Some other poster said ending might be explained as accepting change (one idea). But it doesn't explain the place inside the walls and shadowy figure that grandma scares a lot. Dark figure might be grandpa, alright but why no one can see it except grandma. In the end grandma becomes one and in order to justify this problem, dark figure was hiding under the bed at one scene. But mother didn't see it or see it and ignore it, we don't know. So it might be real or grandma's hallucination, we'll never know. Cheap manouver if you ask me. Also if it was all about change, why grandmother was attacking them, almost to kill. Her daughter got those bruises at the end. How about her granddaughter? I mean list goes on and on.Genre doesn't matter at all. After you watch something for 90 minutes, you want it to be fulfilled.

The house itself evolved becoming more and more frightening as well.I cannot say I enjoyed the movie but I'll be thinking on it instead of sleeping.

You're dealing with a subject that every single person on Earth will suffer with, the death of a parent. To some, this is the worst day of their life, and while I'm a massive horror fan, the fact that they made a mockery of the death scene rubs me wrong.

Scary and sad. The acting was very powerful and sound was used in such a way to make up for the dark lighting throughout. You must suspend your disveirkd to watch this, not expect jump scares and just settle in for the ride. If you're expecting a horror with lots of murder/blood and guts - THIS IS NOT IT.I was expecting it to be about some kind of entity for most of the movie, especially with the reference to the window from the old house that was put on the new, and the primordial clicking/throat noises throughout, but as time wore on it became apparent that this was more like the Babadook and cemented in the horrors of dementia.So brilliantly done with the earlier generational aspects of the family. I think the decay/moul/rotting is a metaphor for the decay of the mind, the weird corridors making the viewer feel like the walls are closing in and gravity is shifting, we don't know which way is up or down.What Sam experiences in there is a physical expression of what her Gran is going through, and she can likely look forward to. She'll go through this with her mother first and then it will be her.I was most frightened during the corridor scenes, I stared feeling all Blair Witch panicky when Sam was first lost in there and then it kept getting worse, I felt so claustrophobic and sick- what about you? Brilliant of the writer/director to make me be able to experience a bit of what it feels like having dementia.Poor Gran/Edna. I just wanted to hug her when she was asking Sam where everyone has gone.I think the James, the neighbour with Down syndrome served 2 purposes: 1. To throw us off the trail and keep thinking it was an entity. Like when Sam asks him in the house and he acts scared and says no and 2. To help Sam's journey in realising what is going on with her Gran. The story about him being locked in the cupboard makes us, the viewers, angry at Gran, and when she calls him the name', in the same way it does to Sam. And before all of that Sam was stubbornly siding against her mother with her Gran. And poor Sam is weighed down with burdens and doesn't know what to do, but is trying her best, even with no one on her side.The dreams that Kay was having about the old house (and the great grandpa who died the same way, that also throws us off trail) are her fears of the same, being much closer to the time. And that's why she can't leave her Mum there in the end, she shows compassion not only because she loves her mum, but she realises the weight of all of this, it's her future.I loved the use of the window as a symbol of heritage &amp; family.So in the end there is no entity, despite the gory reveal of what's beneath Gran's decaying skin. I love the juxtaposition of emotion in this scene: how repulsive the skin peeling is, and how lovingly Kay pulls it away, finally accepting that this is now what her mother is.The very end where they all lay on the bed and Sam finds the bruise on her Mum is such a great finish, the three generations of women laying there, exhausted, frightened but still wanting to care for each other."}, {"id": 210, "text": "There are very few movies that everyone loves.

Doesn't mean it will float your boat or that youl will like the movie, especially considering the slow pace.Having said all that and with 3 female leads, this can annoy some people for different reasons. It would be a shame though, because if you are in the right mindset, you will be scared, entertained and have some food for thought too. Great performances all along from everyone involved. Try to go with the slow flow to get the most of it"}, {"id": 223, "text": "I really liked the first half of the movie - it was dark, atmospheric and unsettling, however it quickly fell apart in the second part as it threw all the plot and realism out of the window in order to be artistic and metaphoric, which might be ok in some movies, but in this one I just didn't feel it.Scenes, which should have been unsettling started to drag and became almost comical. I just couldn't get over the fact, that characters were not reacting to what's going on like real people and in the end it all felt like one drawn out dream sequence.I'd still give a soft recommendation if you like atmospheric horror, not riddled with jump scares and copious amounts of gore, but have in mind, that overall this is a very hit and miss experience."}, {"id": 224, "text": "Watched this with my cancer stricken 59 year old mom and 22 year old younger sister.One day we will all grow old and crazy.The character's names are Kay (Mother), Sam (daughter) and Edna (Grandmother)The story centers around a an Australian family.

The only thing I really missed (for such kind of movies), are some intense horrifying scenes or goosebumps moments, that I got e.g. in the first Conjuring movie - but maybe as a strong connoisseur of everything regarding the art of horrors, my nerves are too hardened by watching too much horror, but on the other hand, getting some terror in the hearts and minds of your audience is in my opinion the true art of making a horror movie. Anyway, Relic is a solid contribution to the genre and for sure you can waste your time on many far less entertaining movies.Last note: of course, one could take the story of Relic as a metaphor to dementia or such kind of illnesses (or just getting old: the last scene reminds me strongly of the Triple Goddess: the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone), but this would not change my rate or my review in general."}, {"id": 227, "text": "Disturbing and suspenseful. That house creepy. Acting was great. I'm not sure if it is a real condition that exists but it is sad"}, {"id": 228, "text": "This is a movie that's been my radar all year long. It's got solid reviews, it's a horror movie, and it's a movie that seems like one that is handled with complete class. Where the director-writer cares about what they are making.And after watching the movie I can safely say that the movie definitely was handled with class. Let's first start out with the acting, everyone is this one movie is incredibly solid. With the actress playing the Grandmother probably being my favorite of the main three. She really manages to perfectly convey the complete emotional and mental swings that a person with dementia goes through. One moment she's her normal self and absolutely refuses any help from her daughter or granddaughter, and the next she seems like she's barely there and she almost is like in limbo. Where she's alive and breathing but her mind is in a completely different place.Next, let's talk about the cinematography. While I liked the cinematography quite a bit, I will admit that these low-budget classy horror movies nowadays seem to always follow the perfect center of framing shots. While I'm not complaining as I love cinematography that seems well-planned out and has some structure to it (as I do for screenplays), it's just that I guess I would like some variety in how the shots are framed. But, overall a very well-shot movie that is also very well-lit, too.And of course let's talk about the writing and screenplay of the movie. Every character is well set-up in this movie, with each character having their motivations, and the audience getting to know where they are in their lives and how their relationships are with one another. But one of the best parts of the screenplay for me is definitely the underlying metaphorical stuff that is written into the script.While yes there are people out there that will want to and will interpret this movie as a literal horror movie, it most definitely isn't. With both the Grandmother's body/skin and the house serving as physical representations of dementia and decaying of the mind. And while I don't want to get too personal, I will say that the themes of this movie certainly hit incredibly close to home, to the point of the movie bringing genuine fear and emotion out of me.And there are some people who will be confused by the ending, as well. I'm not a big brained individual, so if I got the message/ending of this movie I'm certain most people will, too. With the overall message and ending being that with dementia comes a complete new version of that person, which is why Grandma turns into a completely different being when all of her skin is pealed off. And the daughter decides to stay with her, saying that they cannot leave her, and she finally comes to terms with her mother's dementia and accepts it (like the final stage of grief).Overall, this movie is very well-acted, well-shot, well-written, and just overall well-made. I would very much recommend it to people who are into dark character dramatic movies, but I would not to people who want a horror movie like a It:Chapter Two.Final Rating: Flip flopping between a 7 or 8, and it will probably take me awhile to decide."}, {"id": 229, "text": "Just watch the last 30 minutes from the end trust me the early are wasted"}, {"id": 230, "text": "The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars was because it was I focus.

Get over yourself. Watch a movie and appreciate it for what it is and the story it tells, not just it's special effects and scare factor. I watch plenty of movies that move fast and have scary scenes that suck because the story had no purpose and didn't make sense. This one did. It showed the journey of a women and her daughter and grand daughter slowly being affected by her undiagnosed Alzheimer's Disease. It is represented by a creature like entity taking over her and her house transforming into a strange dark place the longer they stay there. It was satisfyingly eerie. I would say it is similar to Aronofsky (who also usually doesn't get great reviews because most people that watch his stuff, it flies right over their heads, and how are you expected to like something you didn't even grasp?

Film buffies get excited over movies that have a deeper, socially relevantunderlying message. The irony is that when buffies get a truly intelligent, profound movie they don't seem to get it; such a film goes way above their heads. They only like metaphors for the simple-to-understand, common every-day things such as dementia, which many people may have been in contact with through a relative.Me, I am not that bothered with the underlying layers of this film, let alone its social relevance. Dementia is such a depressing subject, why would I want to muse on it during a 90-minute haunted house flick?The film opens eerily, quickly establishing music and especially sound as its main communication devices. Most horror film directors underestimate the effectiveness of SOUND, which often can be far more unnerving than blurry clich\u00e9 images of shadowy figures moving through a house. The use of sound is the best thing about the movie.The use of almost colourless, drab grey tones, however, places it squarely into generic ugly modern horror movie territory. There was no need to do that. You can apply colorful images for a drab, gloomy story, but I guess most directors are too insecure about their own abilities hence resort to playing it safe by making the movie look crap and depressing to reflect the mood and the themes. So stupid and unnecessary.The beginning is good, and most of the conclusion (all the running through mazes), but the script gets lost in-between which is when it kind of meanders somewhat aimlessly as a basic female drama as much as a haunted house film.I'm not too crazy about the last scenes though. Ugly and depressing, but not in a fascinating horror way, more in a dreary sort of let's accept that granny is now a monster kind of way. Still, the ending is original, I'll give them that.The movie stays away from annoying jump-scares and other such garbage, and features a Down Syndrome actor which I found interesting and refreshing."}, {"id": 240, "text": "This unexceptional and pointless horror attempts to combine the fear of an unknown and malicious entity with the terror of having to care for an aging parent.

The movie does a great job initially, ratcheting up the tension and creating a strange, ominous vibe, but it doesn't take it anywhere.

There are no jump scares here, no heavy handed soundtrack, blood and gore or horrifying monsters, or even, with the exception of the ending, really all too much action at all. What it has is carefully crafted atmosphere slowly dished out until the claustrophobia is palpable and the loss and despair is oozing from every surface, and remarkable performances by the leads that make us really believe the drama as it unfolds and make us invested in their lives. It also has, at its core, subject matter that may be all too personal for anybody who has dealt with the slow decline of a loved one, so I want to clearly warn any possible viewer that this is, in a manner of speaking, a commonly true story that might be very uncomfortable for some viewers.On the surface the tale is a familiar one... a house under a curse passed on through generations. The cinematographic elements are carefully chosen to make the home genuinely feel aged, imposingly looming, inevitably encroaching, and in a specific way, hungry. All of this is done with just directorial choices; well framed camera angles, creaks and shadows, the occasional off center lurking entities which you might even miss if you aren't looking in the right place. Our characters... 3 generations of women in a family, have come together when they thought the eldest one had gone missing, and once she is found they play out their relationships trying to deal with the obvious impending decline of her. The subtleties of this drama is, like real family dynamics usually are, told more through subtle observations of body language than any direct narrative devices, and all the while the house figures heavily into every aspect of it. At this level alone it is a superbly executed ghost story of sorts... but it is not this level that brings the real meat.I don't want to say too much about this deeper level but I need to say something since this aspect increasingly becomes so engrossing, so I will try to make it as enigmatic as I can. The house and the elder's decline are linked... the house is changing along with the state of its master, the forgotten passageways molding and becoming labyrinthine, and it becomes obvious escape is somehow essential. But how can someone escape the decline of age? Can you preserve anything from ultimately being lost: as time consumes all is there anything that can be salvaged? This is a tale of love and loss, memory and forgetting, pride and degradation, and time... and entropy. It is a depiction of a kind of relentless horror, saturated into everything around us... in the very atmosphere. It is what lies beneath our busy lives and our all too human skins. It is honest, horrific, and even, at times, beautiful from a certain perspective. I strongly recommend it to anyone who is wanting to slip into something deeper and darker than the average haunted house tale.

It had that depth of darkness and a feeling of realness to it that I look for in a good horror film. Relic explores the subject of dementia in a unique fashion that will pull at your heart strings. Especially for those that have dealt with the illness first hand.Relic is essentially a drama which disguises itself as a horror film by using a few of the classic horror conventions and clich\u00e9s. The metaphors provide the real horror here.The three main actors do a great job of conveying the story and deliver a wonderful performance that will leave you emotionally gripped throughout. Where Relic lacks, is in pace. At times it can be rather dull, long winded and only finally picks up in the last 1/3rd of the film.The climax of the film will have you on the edge of your seat and is easily the best part of the film. Those that don't like thought provoking, symbolic conclusions will probably want to stay clear of this one. Still, it's one of the more memorable endings to a film I've seen in a while and undoubtedly uncomfortable.This one is worth the runtime just for the brilliant score, ambiance and composition. You definitely need a decent pair of headphones or a nice sound system to get the most out of this one. The film is very dark, visually, it can be hard to make out specific details in most scenes. Obviously this is done to expand the creepy and unpredictable atmosphere but if anything, makes the film seem duller.It's not a 10/10 movie by any means but it does serve as a mildly entertaining way to pass an hour and a half of time.

Twenty minutes in and I wanted to watch the movie sped up, it felt slow and nothing was really happening, I think that it was trying to go for a slow build-up but it just didn't work for me. I didn't care about the characters, I knew little to nothing about the ghost or whatever the whole black ash stuff was, and there was really nothing new or unique about this movie, sorry that this seems harsh but I felt like I watched a live-action version of a run-of-the-mill indie horror game. The dream sequences felt like they meant nothing and they were just repeats of the same thing, a cabin in the woods, a glass window, and the grandmother. I'm just disappointed and confused about how this movie I wasted money on got so much praise.It would've been fine as a short, indie, horror game, whispering voices, a few jump scares, and a few TURN BACK notes, and then an ending with a jumpscare. I get that it's supposed to also be a metaphor for Alzheimer's but I didn't really get to know the grandmothers past enough to feel bad for her memory loss, no flashbacks, pictures, or videos. I completely think that this movie would've been better off being a drama about a woman and her daughter dealing with the grandmother's Alzheimers instead of this weird supernatural mess. A good example of a movie that was able to perfectly do family drama and horror is Hereditary, there were enough arguments and somber moments to keep your attention as a family drama and there were enough creepy moments to keep you interested in how the horror was going to play out. However, hereditary is a movie that took a lot of detail, money, and had a lot more behind it than this movie probably had, no offense of course.But the director didn't use what they had to their best ability. On a positive note, I did think that there was one good emotional moment that displayed Alzheimer's, and I kind of liked the last scene in the movie even if I didn't understand what the hell it meant.

Probably I would throw empty cans of soda at the actors for doing nothing because I paid for a play and nothing happens.Excuse me people Im retiring to the toilet where I have more fun there.

This movie dragged me in, peaking my curiosity with all of the flashbacks, weird sounds, and an older woman who you think in the beginning has been through some traumatic event and emerges out of nowhere without explanation. Pretty good setup. The acting is awesome from all characters involved. The plot is a slow burn, but you feel it building up to something although you're not given a clue as to what. Which brings me to my problem with the movie and why I only gave it a 7. It left way too many things unexplained satisfactorily to me. Just when I think we're getting to the climax of the movie, and things earlier in the film are going to make sense, well, they just don't. Not to me, anyway. And the gratuitous, suspenseful very last moment of the movie threw the entire alzheimer's premise out of the old cabin window. Why was that even necessary to add to the ending? Too many questions unexplained, so I assume it's either over my head or some things could have been left on the editing room floor."}, {"id": 277, "text": "I didn't really know what to expect when I sat down to watch Relic from writers Natalie Erika James and Christian White, aside from it being a horror movie of sorts. And a horror movie was all that was needed to make me sit down and watch this 2020 movie.Well, now that the movie has finished, I must admit that I am left with an overwhelming sense of 'was that really it'' and a feeling of having sat through an ordeal that felt like 5 hours and not just an hour and 29 minutes. Yeah, this movie was incredibly slow paced. And it wasn't really before 1 hour and 10 minutes into the ordeal before anything even remotely worthwhile happened. And by that time, it simply was too late; I had grown severely bored with the storyline. And with less than 20 minutes left of the movie, I can't say that the events that transpired then were enough to make up for the previous 70 minutes of slow paced torture.Now, I will say that the acting in the movie was really, really good, especially by actress Robyn Nevin - she really carried the movie phenomenally with her performance. It was just a shame that the storyline was such a mundane drag to get through.It should be noted, however, that there is a great atmosphere throughout the movie, one that the film makers were able to maintain throughout the course of the entire movie.Visually, Relic was adequate. Now, it wasn't an outstanding movie by any means. But I did like the make-up effects in the closing segment of the movie. But again, it was too little, too late.There is a good production value to the movie, if that matters on any account or level.I am rating it a mere three out of ten stars, and I do feel slightly generous here actually. I wasn't particularly impressed with Relic and it was just simply way too uneventful for my liking. This is by no means a movie that I will be returning to watch again."}, {"id": 278, "text": "Just when I wasn't sure where horror could go next we get Relic to show us a way. Natalie Erika James has smashed it into next week. This is one of the best horror films of the past decade. An Australian answer to Ari Astor and Robert Eggers, and as brilliant a debut film as Jennifer Kent's Babadook. These two women are the gods of Australian horror today. Relic is a film to be experienced! Firing on all cylinders and in total control. The dance between audio and visual is glorious. The intense, pulsing sound design with it's guttural mix pulls you into another reality, while the gorgeous cinematography plucks your goddam eyeballs out and and uses them like motion-controlled go pros. The shallow depth of field and masterful play of light and shadow throughout narrows your world into sharp focus. The editing has a palpable rhythm to it, knowing just when to linger, and when to cut away. The whole film breathes in concert of it's parts. The performances are nuanced and intense, particularly the incomparable Robyn Nevin who rides a fine line, often needing to say so much with the merest lingering of an eye. And that goddam ending! There is so much to unpack throughout this film but it's impossible to do so without spoilers. But folks, I am not embarrassed to tell you I fist bumped the air. A number of times. Because this film went all the places I hoped it would and I just had to punch something. Fellow humans; please, if you love horror just stop all the things and go hit play for this experience. Lights off. Phones off. Sound up. Base speaker under your couch cushion, and remember to breathe. Do with my hyperbole as you will. Just see it."}, {"id": 279, "text": "Relic is a new horror film directed and partly written by Natalie Erika James, the director of the horror short films Drum Wave and Cresswick. In the film, mother Kay (Emily Mortimer) and her daughter Sam (Bella Heathcote) travel to Kay's old family home, because Kay's mother Edna (Robyn Nevin) has gone missing. Together with local residents they try to find Edna. When Edna suddenly reappears without being able to tell where she was, Kay and Sam wonder if she's getting dementia. Kay goes to look for a suitable nursing home for her mother, while Sam keeps an eye on her grandmother. Sam sees her grandmother starting to act strangely and wonders if there's something supernatural going on with her. When she tries to convince her mother of this, the two must decide what can be the best help for their (grand) mother. This horror film is very similar in story to the 2014 horror film The Babadook, which was directed and written by Jennifer Kent. Coincidentally, both of these films were made by Australian directors and script writers. Jennifer Kent just seemed to have more of an idea where she wanted to go with her movie and what the real purpose of the movie was. Natalie Erika James seems a bit hesitant with Relic. She has had personal experience with Alzheimer's and dementia in her family. However, it is not clear enough whether or not the film tries to tell a hidden message about this as a metaphor. The film may appeal to people who have had to deal with or are still dealing with this a bit more. As a viewer you can be left with some unanswered questions after the end of the film. If Natalie Erika had given James some clearer information, the film would have been a bit more comprehensible and less lengthy. For a horror movie they only know how to bring out some horror moments by using certain sounds and shadows. Thanks to a suitable film set, they know how to create a spooky atmosphere. Lack of further explanation of some of these moments leaves you with some unanswered questions. Of the cast, Robyn Nevin delivers the best acting. Just like the other characters, she knows how to make you doubt whether she suffers from dementia or whether she is possessed by something. Emily Mortimer and Bella Heathcote also do good acting, as her concerned relatives. Because they are both insecure about Edna's condition, they and their characters sometimes seem a bit insecure, so that as a viewer you do not always know what to think of them and their situation."}, {"id": 280, "text": "This movie clearly personifies the guilt a mother feels as she realizes she was not there for her mother as dementia sets in. The guilt the young woman feels is glaringly apparent in the first few minutes when she could not even bear to tell the police officer the last time she saw her because it had been too long. As her guilt progresses, so does the elderly woman's condition. There are some creepy manifestations throughout the film, although cinematography was bad - many scenes were too dark to view. The young woman begins to research 'retirement homes' and the elderly woman finds out about it. Of course, this begins an even deeper rift. The grandaughter decides to move in to help out and is a source of light and hope in the movie, reminding her mother that we must care for our aging parents if we can; they changed our nappies, and one day we are to change theirs. They stay in the house and things get very strange. The vibrant, pretty elderly woman becomes not herself and begins to age rapidly. The young woman's guilt spirals; I am sorry I wasn't there for you. The ending is deeply profound, chilling and beautiful.

The story is about a daughter, a mother, and a grandmother being haunted, and how it consumes them. This was one of the brilliant ways to show a perspective of a terrible disease set with a horror atmosphere. The way it unraveled had a creepy pace and it kept me with a great tension of fear in which never disappeared. I loved the way it was thorough on grasping every aspect of it, and how terrifying it was to be able to have a sense of what this disease does. Also in this kind of genre, it made it feel a version of realness because the disease is true horror. This movie had one of the best opening scenes and the ending as it was beautiful it was also frightening in an incredibly disturbing emotional way.The composer Brian Reitzell brought this film to its brilliance as well due to his music. The horror atmosphere never strayed away not even for a second because the music never faltered to bring the hair-raising element in every corner.The cast, Bella Heathcote, Emily Mortimer, and Robyn Nevin were breathtaking, all of them deserve to praised. Their characters were fantastically written and acted, all of them projected the complexity and fear of being in that situation.

One of the most frustrating and boring movies I've seen in recent years.As for the screenplay, it's poorly written, average at best, with no attempt to be engaging or entertaining for its audience.The direction is worse. Sadly, the director just doesn't have the skills to make this movie work. The director lacks the ability to make interesting and engaging moments happen on screen. The poor script doesn't help, but a better director would have at least been able to make the most of a poor foundation. Unfortunately, the directors attempt to be artistic, just comes across as self-indulgent filmmaking. The dark, sometimes pitch-black, visual choices are a significant obstacle for the viewer.Against all odds, a couple of acting performances help claw back some integrity but its too little too late. There's really just nothing enjoyable about Relic at all.It was an interesting idea but unfortunately poorly executed, leaving the viewer frustrated and unsatisfied."}, {"id": 283, "text": "Not everyone is frightened by ghosts, not everyone is frightened by brain-gobbling hordes of zombies, and the recent wannabe-edgy hype around serial killers has made for damn sure that not everyone's scared of those either. For more universal and inescapably real fears, we have horror films as stirring and remorseless as Relic.Slowly but surely losing a loved one, especially during their proverbial sunset years, is something we all must face - a claim I cannot make as confidently about ghost attacks and scary monsters. It is difficult to imagine anyone being spared of this experience; the grief, the rage, and yes, the insurmountable fear (accompanying the realization that we all share the same final destination, no matter what manner of sequel we've been promised by -INSERT BELIEF SYSTEM HERE-).If you, like everyone else on the planet right now, are peckish for something new to enjoy in this unprecedented summer-movie drought, here comes a unique Australian horror movie to hopefully hold you over. Then again, I cannot guarantee you'll enjoy it per se, as it's a harsh one to process.This film is remarkably well-made and nifty in its communication as it is, but since it also constitutes Natalie Erika James' moviemaking debut, some additional applause is in order. The way the shots are framed and moved; the increasingly maddening editing and production design; the sounds that suck us in further... you name it and James has probably got it. The biggest strength, however, may be that of the three leading actresses (Robyn Nevin, Emily Mortimer, Bella Heathcote), each of a different generation with a different approach to the facts of the world; the elder woman vanishes for a brief time and confounding sights reveal themselves upon her return.Even at its most fantastical, Relic functions as a parable for losing someone to the confusions and rough realities of age. Even as the character of Edna seems to briefly pass into another plane of existence, surely that's not too different from how those final years often seem to us onlookers (soon to be given our own dues by Father Time)?The most effective parts of the movie have major influences from Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves (which occupies my Top 3 books of all time alongside Cloud Atlas and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but the maddening maze we're thrust into may yet represent the maze of the human mind, doomed to be impossible to navigate, or retrace, once we all reach that point. This is one of those films where I hope the younger and more mainstream horror fans stay clear, both for their own innocence's sake and for the sake of mature viewers' enjoyment.Much like The Lighthouse and It Comes At Night, this is a horror film that goes beyond what most are used to; it's not about weird monsters and gore, but about the fears and anxieties that we all share in common and yet might make us hate each other (at least in the case of those other two films, which concerned paranoia, isolation, and distrust). This is what horror can do to us if we let it. It needn't all be ghouls, masks, and pop scares - not that I mind the more simple entertainment within the genre, if it's done well.The pacing of Relic isn't the most fine-tuned and there are a few cheesy and inevitably clich\u00e9d moments; we do need to endure a few jump-scares but they are surprisingly effective here. A horror-based take on age and dementia is certainly an interesting one - even if the best movie on the subject will always be Haneke's Amour, which is more of a love story and an ultimate one at that.Still, by Jove, James needs to continue making movies and continue to tap into the fears that unite us all."}, {"id": 284, "text": "Natalie Erika James has crafted a well made, purposeful, horror movie.When Edna (Robin Nevin) has not been heard from for a few days, her daughter Kay (Emily Mortimer) and her granddaughter Sam (Bella Heathcote) leave Melbourne to check on Enda at her house in the rural countryside. Edna is found only to see that her mental state is deteriorating as it starts to physically manifest itself within the house.Relic depicts the deterioration of the mind of an elderly woman and asks what would this be like if this manifested physically outside ones psyche. This movie is similar to The Babadook as it takes a mental illness and depicts it physically in the confines of the created world. This works very well at times creating a very suspenseful atmosphere and an engaging story. Where this movie falters however, is it breaks it's own physical rules that it establishes. Edna's daughter and granddaughter begin to experience some of the similar things that she is experiencing. I get this is trying to depict that mental illnesses such as dementia are hereditary, but in some instances what happened in the movie does not work. In The Babadook, the creature is a manifestation of the main characters depression that only physically effects her and everyone else experiences the direct result or direct effects of that depression. In this movie, the mental deterioration physically effects everyone else as well.This movie does create a very eerie atmosphere that carries the movie. This is complemented with good cinematography and a mostly haunting score that can sometimes be derogatory. The performances are mostly good but Robin Nevin, who plays the deteriorating old lady, gives a very creepy and dark performance. The movie is at its most interesting when exploring the effects of her mental state.The best thing going for Relic is it's suspenseful atmosphere combined with its engaging story.

I get that this is a horror film and darkness can be a powerful tool but here I found it overkill to the point that it really hindered the viewing experience.I won't give away spoilers but I think that the ending could have been executed a little better.

In this movie, the literal monster is the mother herself, and the claustrophobic, haunted house atmosphere is meant to be a visual representation of her daughter's and granddaughter's desperation and fear. But this movie is a total slog, a slow burn that never actually ignites into a fire, but instead peters out into a smolder. It consists of what feels like endless scenes of either the mother or daughter wandering around the house going Mom? Mom? or Gran? Gran? and sometimes finding something a little weird or off, but many other times not finding anything at all. There are all sorts of creepy images thrown in here and there that tempt us with the places this film is going to go and the secrets it will reveal, but none of them cohere into anything at all and the film feels like a lot of buildup for a climax that never comes. Most of the movie feels like filler to qualify it as a feature length movie. I wonder how this would have fared as a short film.I usually like Emily Mortimer a lot, and really mostly watched this on the basis of her being in it, but she doesn't get much to do. She certainly doesn't get to create a character -- no one does, at least not characters that we learn anything about.What a dud.Grade: D"}, {"id": 291, "text": "Relic begins in unassuming fashion. A mysterious disappearance. An empty house. Unsettling dreams. A malicious presence. It's nothing horror fans haven't seen many times before, though it has a tender restraint and steady-handed direction which promise something greater than the traditional setup would suggest.Low and behold, it delivers on that promise. As it draws near its finale, the film deftly veers away from the supernatural and warps into a disorienting, surrealistic portrait of dementia. The house itself becomes a clever metaphor for the declining psyche with maze-like corridors littered with misplaced memories and shards of personal history. The family of the affected wander the labyrinth, desperately seeking an impossible connection with their unrecognizable loved one. Eventually, it builds to a hauntingly somber, wordless sequence in which the profound despair of the loss is articulated entirely through visuals. It's a powerful conclusion which solidifies Relic as a resonant and effective addition to the psychological horror cannon.Strong 4/5"}, {"id": 292, "text": "Relic (2020) is not a horror film in the classical sense of the word. It's not a haunted house film and it's not a ghost story. Despite the fact that the film is very atmospheric, full of interesting events and good acting, most of the film does not indicate that something is going on at all and that the plot is progressing (except through Edna's deterioration).The film itself is short but slow, and since the acting was really good, I'd enjoy more character stuff in this instead of semi-dream sequences (even though I know why they are there).I did understand and relate to this because I've had my experience with my grands slowly aging and eventually dying. This is an interesting take which is done relatively well. Even the 'horror' element is used interestingly in this. I loved the way aging, family, house and inheritance was handled in this.This might sound arrogantly, but this film clearly is not for everyone. Just open your mind and don't approach this as a horror story. It's not perfect but it is well done after all."}, {"id": 293, "text": "Firstly, just to address all the 1 star reviews. I fully accept that people like different things, and I have no problem with those who don't like the style, direction of pace of the movie. Horror means something very different to different people.However, a lot of these reviews claim the movie is nonsensical with a completely random ending, that nothing happens, and similar statements.None of this is true - even if you don't like the film as a whole - if you actually think about the plot and ending in the context of what the movie is really about, it does make sense. In a really disturbing way.Now, the movie itself - just amazing, an expertly crafted slow burn that really gets under your skin and lingers long after the movie has ended. I'm not going to say much about it as it's best watched blind and I don't want to give any spoilers, even mild ones.But it is one of my favorite horrors of recent years now alongside Hereditary and Midsommar. Again, those types of movies aren't for all horror fans, so there is a good chance that if you disliked those movies, this one won't fully work for you either.But really, giving it 1/10 is just incredibly unfair. I completely respect the reasoned 4/10, 5/10, reviews, and appreciate different tastes.But 1/10 is wrong. There are plenty of films I don't get even within the horror genre that are immensely popular, but I wouldn't consider them 1/10 simply because they didn't gel with me."}, {"id": 294, "text": "No it's not a metaphor for dementia. A metaphor is one situation or statement that passes for another. Or a hidden meaning. Relic lays it out for all to see within the first few minutes.It fails because despite a subject matter worth exploring, we really know little about the grandmother's prior life. We can't feel for her loss of memory and self without knowing the type of life she has led. For that matter we learn literally nothing about the daughters too.If this film had some story or some actions that took you on a journey or something of any relevancy to pass the time, the lack of backstory might not matter so much. Where are the men for example? What happened to them? Does anyone care? What do they do with their lives that they can so easily give up to hang around in rural Victoria?Sadly the first five minutes is no different than from minute 55 to 60. The writer/director tries the old red herring about a cabin in the woods (cliche), to throw us off track. That perhaps this is really a horror after all and a haunting is in place. It's a rookie error. Hitchcock called it the McGuffin, though even in his films, it didn't exist without some meaning. Here it's just a purposeless device.The last fifteen minutes is very good. Especially the last shot. But the audience is far too bored by then to really care. Unless they, like some reviewers, think they're so intellectual, because it's a 'metaphor for dementia', and people who don't like it must be stupid. There's some irony. It's pure arrogance. No metaphor here. Just a lack of content.Emily Mortimer is a great actress but is given nothing to worth with. The relationships between all three are not developed in any way. It's style over substance. Yet there's really nothing that hasn't been seen in a hundred horror films, so the style in and of itself, is not enough.There was potentially a great film here but it's underdeveloped and shows a lack of experience and foresight. It might have worked as a short film or even a short story but its prompt setup and subsequent meanderings is its undoing."}, {"id": 295, "text": "This movie is such a slow burn it gets boring real quick.I don't know if i watch too many horror movies but the old people who have a mental health issue becoming demonic/crazy trope (but it's actually a metaphor DUHHH!!!!) are being annoying real quick to me.Dosen't feel original at all.The movie is very slow i feel i watched it for 3 hours when it's a 1h30 movie.The acting isn't bad the effects aren't bad like nothing is really bad about this movie.. it's just meh..and pretty boring if you take out the ending which more stuff happen and it get actually suspensefulSaw many people compare this to like hereditary and i don't agree not even close.5/10 the ending is good the whole movie tho bore fest."}, {"id": 296, "text": "This movie doesn't know what genre it falls under.

Otherwise avoid it."}, {"id": 297, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)COVID-19 impacted the number of movies released in 2020, but the horror genre didn't seem to really suffer from it. Quality will always be subjective, but in my opinion, this year has examples at every point of the spectrum. I've witnessed some shockingly awful horror flicks (Fantasy Island, The Grudge, The Turning, You Should Have Left), a few wasted potential examples (Gretel &amp; Hansel, The Rental, The New Mutants), some pretty decent ones (Underwater, Antebellum, Come Play), and more than just a couple of incredible films, some might even end up in my Top10 of the year (The Invisible Man, The Lodge). I didn't know much about Relic, but its premise got me interested.This is Natalie Erika James' directorial debut, as well as her first feature-length screenplay, co-written with the also first-timer Christian White. Boasting a relatively unknown cast (to me, at least), I can't hide my surprise regarding how much I enjoy this film. Ambiguous horror movies with underlying themes are far from being an audience-favorite subgenre, much on the contrary. Usually, this type of film possesses traits that a regular moviegoer doesn't really look forward to: a slow pace, a series of suspenseful sequences that don't lead to the generic jumpscare, and finally, an ending that apparently might miss some sort of explanation, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed.Well, guess what? I love this subgenre, especially when it really hits me in the heart. It has all the ingredients above that I know will make most people think this didn't make any sense, it's so boring. Many viewers will expect just another spooky, supernatural, psychological horror flick, and disappointment will meet them at the end. However, its narrative carries so much more than what's on the surface, and honestly, this is made clear pretty early in the movie. At its core, Relic is quite a realistic depiction of what happens to the older members of some families (unfortunately, more than what it should be), and it approaches extremely sensitive themes such as dementia and the abandonment of old people in nursing homes.Natalie and Christian's screenplay doesn't hide from delivering a few messages concerning these two topics. Dementia is a terrible disease that, amongst other things, makes people lose what makes them unique, what makes them human, and forget who they truly are. If our parents take care of us throughout our young life, it's only fitting that we take care of them when/if they begin to fail to do so themselves. Not only should we do this because they already did the same for us when we were young, but also due to the possibility that our descendants might have to do the same when we grow old. It's a variation of the known circle of life.Love should always be present, no matter the circumstances. A little piece of my personal life: my grandfather wasn't quite there at the end. He gradually became unable to drive, walk, and eventually speak. I chose to not see him as much as I did in his last few weeks, simply because I didn't want to remember him as someone he wasn't. My memory of him is intact with the best moments I've spent with him, and not that depressing phase at a nursing home, just laying in bed, waiting for his time to leave our world... It's a small portion of my life that I share with you, so you understand how Relic can impact so many viewers if people give it a legitimate chance with adequate expectations.The acting is phenomenal across the board. Robyn Nevin can be scary as the grandmother Edna, but in the end, she's the emotional trigger that made me tear up. There are little nuances in her expressions that elevate her overall performance. Emily Mortimer is also outstanding as the mom, Kay, who has to go through all stages in dealing with a parent with dementia. From rejection and separation to acceptance and unconditional love, Kay is the character that gets a more significant focus. Bella Heathcote might have less screentime than the other two, but she's also fantastic as Sam, particularly in the horror sequences. Nevertheless, it's precisely this last point that hurts the film.The house's atmosphere is incredibly suspenseful, but the third act brings out an unexpected level of horror, which I believe to be exaggerated. The balance between horror and family drama was excellent throughout the first two acts, except for short periods here and there, but the last twenty minutes go through such an over-the-top, eerie, extremely fictional path that ultimately ruins that near-perfect balance. It's almost like the producers came in and said we need more horror, so they filmed a bunch of crazy, mind-bending, physics-defying scenes. This movie didn't need any of that, and it should have stuck with the intriguing drama instead of forcing the disturbing horror.Technically, Charlie Sarroff's camera work is impeccable. With the help of Denise Haratzi and Sean Lahiff's editing, long takes strongly improve the build-up to the scary sequences, generating exceptional levels of tension and suspense. Brian Reitzell's score is interesting, but there's a point in the film where it gets a bit awkward, having in mind the scene taking place, but it doesn't hurt his overall work. Great pacing control, adequate runtime, and a beautiful, heartfelt, relevant ending that, unfortunately, some viewers won't be able to see past its apparently underwhelming climax.All in all, Relic is one of those typical horror movies that will divide critics and audiences all around the world. This time, only false expectations can lead to disappointment. Natalie Erika James' directorial debut is far from being a generic horror flick, but a family drama with a very sensitive matter at its core. With the help of the also debutant Christian White, both deliver an exceptionally well-written, genuinely sad yet realistic story about dementia and how old people are treated once they can't live by themselves anymore. A remarkably ambiguous narrative filled with underlying themes leads to an emotionally powerful ending if the viewer is able to understand the implicit messages spread across the runtime. Emily Mortimer, Robyn Nevin, and Bella Heathcote all deliver exceptional performances. Technically, the lingering cinematography plus seamless editing create an extraordinarily suspenseful environment. However, the third act dives into horror way too much, holding unnecessary sequences that only ruin the film's tone, raising questions that don't belong in the movie. Still, I sincerely recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of film, but please manage your expectations as fair as possible.Rating: B+"}, {"id": 298, "text": "Not a bad one, that reminds me of 'Babadook' a lot.In the end there are two stories running here, the demonic possession and transformation of an old lady into something evil... and on the other hand a metaphor for dementia.

When I heard dementia, I expected to compare this to Deborah Logan, but the experience is entirely different.The editing and score/sound design are excellent, with good performances and skilfully laid clues, so the story is atmospheric, well paced, and sets up promising developments. Also, the dialogue is smart, as you find out the relationship between the three women without being told. The dementia is gentle, with the odd flash of insanity, and what really seems to drive the story are the relics of a dark past.Does it elevate into horror? The dream sequences definitely lay the ground, and at about the hour mark we go through the looking glass - but that sequence feels like a climax, with 20 mins still to go. My guess was we'd calm down, then suck it up and go again, but the whole thing just glides to a comforting end. It is a touching reflection on death and the generations, but I was really puzzled by the restraint, and by the failure to follow through on the other dimension foreshadowed by the dark secret in the cabin in the woods. Maybe I missed it - or maybe the resolve was absent. There is the comparison with The Babadook, which I found too metaphorical and shying away from horror's freedom to make things literal - to go from thinking about it, to screaming over it. Here, the metaphor is brought to life - how convincingly depends on your taste.I noticed the cinematography was also restrained, with a few lighting effects passed over - the christmas tree should have revealed the ghostliness of the figure, and the reveals from switched on lights had no effect. No jump scares either - I know, I know they're cheap, but they do get the adrenalin going, especially with skilful sound design. But then there's an excellent effect in a scene descending the stairs, where it feels every moment a fall is going to come, and when we go through the looking glass the light switches to candle and torch.You could compare this to Hereditary, which has a similar family dynamic. In that movie they do lay on the horror effects, but overrun the tarmac with the engine roaring. Here, it's like they took the key out of the ignition and ended up on the side of the road.Overall: Quality drama that dips its toe into horror, then shakes its head."}, {"id": 301, "text": "Natalie Erika James, who made her directing debut, put on a metaphorical, yet powerful horror film. Erika James has this beautiful sense of direction, by giving us a few unanswered questions from the start, crafting this meaningful story into one of the best films of the year. The premise of the film wasn't the most original, borrowing some aspects from films in the past, but Erika James utilized a lot of nifty twists and turns to keep the narrative as original as possible. The most successful aspect to this film was the consistent unsettling tone &amp; score that was set right from the beginning, giving each scene great depth, other than relying on jump scares.The performances by our three female leads were great! They showed great emotion with every piece of dialogue, making you actually care for them, and how they turn out.The only things I can take away from this film would be that some scenes were a little weird &amp; overkill; also, if you went into this film looking for a definite villain, with a clear cut message, you're probably not going to enjoy it that much; If you sit back and break down each event, you would see that the story was well structured, with great heart."}, {"id": 302, "text": "There's at least 3 times in this movie where the characters in it do something completely unrealistic ie. seeing a ghost/demon/zombie and then just acting like nothing out of the ordinary has happened... that extremely unrealistic since no logical, normal, ordinary person would react in the same way... and if the characters in your movie are going to NOT act in a realistic and believable way to the events that happen around them, then you're left with an audience that doesn't believe your entire film... and THEN, you're left with an audience that will not get scared at whatever they're seeing on screen, because they know it's not real (realistic).And the characters in this movie simply act in non-believable ways too often, for anyone who's watching the film to get scared at all. IF the characters in the film reacted logically and normally to the events shown in the film, then the film would have been over at the 35minute mark already...Overall, it's a semi-scary horror film dealing with a supernatural theme, but the viewer is shown one impossible event after another, and that turns this semi-scary horror movie into an absurdist 'what-if-i-had-horse-blinders-on' film... 5/10, just skip this film completely and watch an actually scary horror film like Devil (2010) or Shutter (2004)."}, {"id": 303, "text": "Natalie Erika James makes her feature film debut with Relic, a horror film that, like many films of the genre, offer more if you scratch beneath the surface. When Edna (Robyn Nevin), the demented and widowed matriarch of the family, goes missing, her daugter Kay (Emily Mortimer) and granddaughter Sam (Bella Heathcote) travel to their family home to try and find her. What they find upon arrival is a sinister presence haunting the house and slowly taking control of Edna.Obvious comparisons can be drawn with Ari Aster's Hereditary but then again it definitely deserves to be judged on its own merit because Relic certainly does enough to stray away from being labelled an exact replica. Natalie Erika James possesses the ability to create a tense and haunting atmosphere that lingers over proceedings, making the impending sense of dread predictable but shocking nonetheless.The fact you can see where the film is going doesn't take away from the film as a whole, Relic being a predictable yet impactful depiction of how dementia inhabits and tears away at the people we love. It's not just the people either, as the family home deteriorates too, James ensuring it becomes a character as much as the female trio that take centre stage.Coming to the performances, Relic features three very diiferent but equally strong performances from Robyn Nevin, Emily Mortimer and Bella Heathcote. Each of them bring different qualities to a generational horror that culminates in a beautifully fitting and muted manner.So, consider me impressed by Natalie Erika James' first feature film and her effective approach to covering such a condition as dementia. There's plenty of things that go bump in the night and darkened corners in every room but it's the real heart of the narrative that make Relic such a haunting piece of work."}, {"id": 304, "text": "A dark, disturbing &amp; disquieting horror that offers an unsettling take on the curses we may have inherited from our parents, Relic relies on its slow-building &amp; silently escalating atmosphere of dread &amp; delusions, and makes for a thoroughly arresting &amp; consistently chilling cinematic ride that's neatly crafted, skilfully told &amp; is finely steered by a trio of sincere performances.Co-written &amp; directed by Natalie Erika James in what's her directorial debut, the story at first appears to be cut from the same fabric as Ari Aster's Hereditary but develops into a different kind of nightmare as it progresses. Erika James' direction exhibits poise &amp; tenacity, and the way she allows the foreboding mood to set up gradually &amp; permeate every frame shows the clarity &amp; confidence she has in her script.The remote setting, muted colour tones &amp; quiet camerawork do ratchet up the tension to an extent but the glacial pace at which the plot unfolds is going to test the patience of many and may leave some viewers frustrated. Robyn Nevin, Emily Mortimer &amp; Bella Heathcote play three generations of a family, and they all chip in with fab inputs in their respective roles, with Mortimer impressing the most among the trio.Overall, Relic is a slow-burn chiller that's going to fascinate some and infuriate others with its snail-paced narration but it nonetheless serves as a promising start for its debutant filmmaker. Very slow &amp; a tad too dimly lit yet gripping for the most part if not all, this story of family, guilt &amp; dementia advertised as a haunted house horror is as moving &amp; heartbreaking as it is menacing &amp; unnerving.

It was a tale of a demonic presence, and while Kent was very clear with her spooky intent, she was also painting a portrait of parenthood, which is often an experience of unrelenting horror. It was a sharp, stunning feature with a delicious claustrophobic atmosphere. The type of viewing experience is found in Relic, which turns its attention to the various challenges of dementia and how the personal experience of such degeneration greatly taxes all those involved. Co-writer Natalie Erika James impressively merges the real-world agony of aging with a haunted house story, coming up with a complex film that's richly detailed and performed, reaching above and beyond a simple ghost story to tap into deep emotions involving the nightmarish decline of a once vibrant loved one.Stunning performances from all three women. Robyn Nevin and Bella Heathcote really steal the film for me. Robyn as matriarch Edna, missing for days only to turn up out of the blue disheveled and battleworn. Bella as Sam, the innocent granddaughter who uncovers the truth of the situation. Emily Mortimer as Kay is also great here but she's given the mission of distraught daughter unsure of what is going on.The last 30 minutes are just...beautiful. Impressively cinematic .

Even now while writing this I am torn as to what a fair rating should be. You see, I love the concept of what 'Relic' was trying to portray, but I didn't know it was portraying that until the final moments of the film (and even then I wasn't 100% sure). It was around the halfway point in the film where I thought to myself - what exactly is the concept behind the movie I'm watching here? In fact at that point I wasn't even entirely sure what I was watching could be considered horror.This is a pure slow-burn of a movie. There are very few jump-scares through the movie. The horror, particularly early in the film, come from a creepy looking old lady doing odd things, and from random bizarre things happening around the house. None of it is really all that scary to be honest, but it does set things up for when the film picks up the pace more towards the end.Dementia is a horrible disease, and whatever the film puts on screen, that will always be the true horror here. I liked the idea behind this, in a similar way to 'The Babadook' being related to depression. I might have liked to see it executed a little differently in an ideal world, but I can also understand why it is a very tricky thing to get right. Australian's tend to make very good horror movies, and while 'Relic' isn't going to find itself in the top echelon of those films, it is still well worth a look."}, {"id": 307, "text": "This is a non BS review for anyone with a bit of common sense.This is yet another heavy handed allegorical horror movie for folk who love to state the obvious and have the obvious stated to them.He's the rub; no spoilers here.

With no clue where she is, they decide to stay and clean up the house that has fallen into severe disrepair. Just as suddenly as she disappeared, Edna comes back, sporting some ugly wounds and quickly deteriorating in mind. As her condition worsens, the younger generations are caught up in a power play, and the undeniable sensation that something is in the house with them.Slow burn is an understatement. But Australian director Natalie James keeps the pressure constant from the first entrance into the house until the final, haunting, yet breathtaking, tableau. Dank, dark and damp, the house they inhabit has as much character as the cast, and is just as able to reveal secrets as it is to indulge in claustrophobic horror. The combination of the house's decay and the increasingly erratic behaviour of Edna creates a dread of what's buried under it all. A nightmarish sequence involving an ever encroaching crawlspace will make any slight claustrophobic person shudder and reach for the remote.That's not all the film offers, though. Quite simply, the movie shows the horrific nature of a family coming to terms with mental illness - the frustration, the fights, the confusion, the ignorance, the moments of catharsis. Even as it goes balls to the haunted house walls in its closing moments, Relic remains a movie about family and the bonds that cannot be broken, no matter the horror we are put through."}, {"id": 309, "text": "A mother and a daughter return to their family home to take care of their grandmother, who is being possessed by a manifestation of her own dementia.Relic is a horror film about dementia. In conventional circumstances, the topic of dementia would be explored in the independent film drama genre. Someone slowly losing their own identity is something that would seem heartbreaking in a drama is now subverted to being something horrific in a horror movie. It's a great concept. However, Relic struggles to put its audience through its intended scares.The underlit murky cinematography made the scare sequences very hard to follow. At first, your imagination takes over and you scare yourself for a while in the dark until you realize it was a technical miscalculation. The camera would often track behind the characters slowly walking through hallways but as the actors make their turn at the corner, I couldn't distinguish the darkness from the walls to see the turn. The cinematography ruined this film.The atmospheric sound design provides a lot of the scares but is eventually overly relied upon. Initially, the soundscape was unnerving in a David Lynch type way. The first five minutes of the film was actually the scariest part of the entire film. You are put right into a creepy space filled with ominous sounds not knowing what's happening. However, the film took such a long time in communicating its allegory and establishing its monster that in the latter sequences, the impact of the sound design wore off. It's a shame because the sound design was effectively creepy.The film had solid technical foundations to build its scares but didn't know how to progress them to build suspense. Filming the backside of an old lady doing something ominous can only be tense so many times before the effect wears out. This brings me to the core problem of Relic: the grandmother character is just not scary. Creepy? Yes. Sinister? Sure. Scary? No.The three actresses, Emily Mortimer, Bella Heathcote, and Robyn Nevin, give convincing solid performances that would have otherwise belonged in an indie drama about dementia. They work hard trying to sell the film's allegory but are undermined by the oddly timed script. The slow build ended up killing the suspense instead of building it up. It's too much setup and too little payoff.First-time director Natalie Erika James has nice concepts but needs to time and punctuate her stories more precisely. I like the horror allegory of using an old lady's dementia as an evil entity. Watching a loved one deteriorate into a shell of their former self is horrifying. However, the monster in this film is not well defined or how it works. Which one is the actual monster, the grandmother, or the physical manifestation of dementia?

I appreciated the willingness of the film to make me sit uncomfortably with my emotions and the subtle reveals throughout that made it more difficult to do so.I think my biggest issue here is that like others have noted, this film does feel very slow at times.

While it's not a bad movie by any means, Relic is the definition of a film that you shouldn't judge by its cover. It's mentioned as both a drama and a horror on many of the entertainment websites and although there are some eerie scenes and a few chills to be had, this is first and foremost, a psychological drama from beginning to end. This was actually jarring to me as it really does seem like a pretty scary film on its surface. If you're looking for a film to simply scare the hell out of you, this isn't that, but some viewers may find the dramatic aspect to be quite fulfilling.Relic begins with a mother and daughter living in the grandmother's house, as they search for her whereabouts. After she mysteriously and randomly shows up back home, she doesn't seem right. Dementia has clearly overtaken her in a severe way and it's not only affecting her daughter and granddaughter but the house they are in may just be expressing the side effects of that dementia to them all, creating visions and dreams that may or may not actually be there. I could see what they were going for here and the movie ends on a note that felt very strange, yet earned at the same time, but I walked away wishing that more had been done with the premise overall.Writer/director Natalie Erika James has crafted a very well-rounded story with a lot of character development. The thing that impressed me the most was that I was able to retrieve a lot of that character development, simply due to the images being shown on-screen. Her writing abilities here worked wonders for the story itself, but I truly don't think the tone of the movie matched the premise all that well. I think how everything was lit just felt like a darker and scarier movie than what was given to audiences. That was a creative decision by the filmmakers, clearly, but it felt off to me.Bella Heathcote as Sam and Robyn Nevin as Edna are both terrific in their respective roles, but Emily Mortimer, who's usually always great, may have given the best performance I've seen from her yet. Her calm, concerned mood throughout the entire film never once waivered. I was completely enthralled by her performance, even though she probably could've been given more to do. This film feels like a much larger story wants to break through the cracks of this well-done drama. I just kept wondering what the point of it all was, and even though there is a point by the end, I'm not sure I cared enough by the time the film finally arrived there.Overall, Relic is a movie that's hard to rip apart, because all the right pieces are there and movie, narratively, is quite effective. Sadly, the horror aspect was a huge failure for me and the tone of the movie in comparison with what was actually going on was a little too dark to latch onto. The cast is very solid, as well as the direction and screenwriting, but nothing about this movie felt special enough to praise more than that. This is a very watchable movie that feels its length at even 90-minutes, but if you're up for some psychological sequences and a solid little story, this one may be for you.
