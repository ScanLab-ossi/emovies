{"name": "The King of Staten Island", "titleId": "tt09686708", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "This film is a true gem. I went into it not expecting much, but I was disappointed when the movie was over. Not many films I've seen recently left me feeling that way; especially Davidson's previous film Big Time Adolescence. The King of Staten Island was funny, heartfelt, and raw at times. Personally, I've always felt like Pete Davidson was the least funny member of SNL, but this film opened my eyes to what he was about as a person and where his comedy stemmed from. I appreciate that the film doesn't pretend to be something different than what it is - Pete's semi-biographical story brought to life by a comedy directing/producing pro, Judd Apatow. The supporting cast of Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, and Steve Buscemi bring some pretty great performances to the table as well. Great story about that weird part of life in your early twenties where you're still not really sure what you're doing or where you're going on life's journey. It deals with living through loss, growing up and finding out your purpose in the world. I will recommend this to friends!"}, {"id": 1, "text": "The film is unapologetically introspective and raw. It feels amateurish at times, but overall it really works for the story that is being told. More of a drama than a comedy, but with some truly funny moments."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Bill Burr and Pete Davidson are an amazing duo. I know this is not a type of movie where they would have a part 2. But I would throughly enjoying watching this story continue on with all these characters. It was a little long but you would really feel the emotion between Bill and Pete."}, {"id": 3, "text": "King of Staten Island is a deeper dive into Pete Davidson, a mostly autobiographical look at why he is the way he is. Well done and well written and a great supporting cast from Bill Burr, Marissa Tomei and Steve Buscemi all were steller in supporting roles.Be prepared, it is dark and not funny ha-ha, but definitely uses humor to deflect uncomfortable situations. Pete's always been an intriguing character to me, so this was a great way to pull the layers back, it's not always pretty, but I think it is definitely worth the price."}, {"id": 4, "text": "A great addition to the Judd Apatow's comedy and sentimental work. Happy to see Pete Davidson succeed in this role. Really happy with this movie!!"}, {"id": 5, "text": "I love this! One thing I didn't like tho tho was they never showed if he fed his friends cat sprinkles if he did I missed it or much else about that situation the fate of his friends for such a crime n him getting off Scott free &amp; him seeming not to feel bad about his friends at all...,"}, {"id": 6, "text": "Original,sincere,relatable,painful &amp; funny at same time.This slice-of-life comedy is about self-discovery,abt not judging a book by its cover &amp; chronicle of life.Pete davidson as the unemployed drug addict youth whose firefighter father died at work is brilliant alongwith every other cast members.Director takes his sweet time to buildup but after staying till end u will find a good execution with huge transformation in storyline &amp; character development.Its not without flaws as it might be 5-10 minutes shorter,needed better editing.Music is good.Camerawork is ok.But Overall it's a really great movie with life lessons."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I'll be honest...I liked this movie way more than I expected I possibly could. Pete Davidson is great in this and the film is well-written, funny, and touching. Highly recommended weekend viewing."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This films intention, is to take you on a journey. It presents itself initially, as a simple character study. As it divulges though. You begin to see that it's actually an examination of the people that interact with the lead and how they effect and are effected by his actions.The quick cuts and edits are a perfect representation, of the ebb and flow of real life and are in no way unintentional or a mistake.The premise and subject matter is not easily digested but at the core is a story of a young man stricken by grief who wants to contribute and find where he belongs.Funny, heartwarming, original and will leave you satisfied after viewing"}, {"id": 9, "text": "What a fantastic feel good film ! It's a movie about hope and a second chance at life ! It's funny and heartfelt and the entire cast is fantastic! I can't wait to see Pete Davidson in more films !"}, {"id": 10, "text": "If you're in any way a fan of Pete Davidson or Bill Burr, see this movie. Both absolute crush it by pretty much playing themselves. If you're not a fan of Pete, see this movie. He'll completely change your mind. The anorexic panda that he is."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I was excited about this movie simply because it's an Apatow product, AND, I'm a somewhat, new, fan of Davidson. I cried through the first viewing, laughed more, but still cried, through the second viewing of my 48hr rental. Well done. Thank you for sharing your story in such a cerebral, human way. I will purchase it as soon as it's available for purchase."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I enjoyed the cast and was mildly looking forward to this film. But it was way too long and didn't really achieve anything. The love interest. The father and son thing. Living at home. And the mums new boyfriend. But I didn't care about any of it.There are some funny lines in this. Some caring interactions. And an attempt to do things different. But it was a long slog to get to the end. Then when the end did come it really wasn't worth the wait.This is watchable but you won't get too much from it. I suspect a lot of the high ratings here are PR campaign boosters. This is not a high scoring film at all. Disappointing."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Three big problems: 1) Pete Davidson's acting was very distracting - Everyone else was great, but his reactions didn't match their actions. 2) Pete's character was way too much of a self-pity cliche - Meh, I'm broken, please feel bad for me. 3) Forgettable - Nothing deep, special, or very interesting happens, and there's not enough funny to make up for it."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Seriously Mr. Apatow... 136 minutes of too much filler, not enough substance? This was way too long and way too slow. The only reason I didn't fall asleep, was Davidson's fine balance of pathos and humor throughout the film. His story was very relatable and he performed/portrayed it quite well. The supporting cast was great as well. Had this film been cut/edited down to approx 90 mins with better pacing, and some crazier and funnier moments, it would've been a real hit. Still, mad props to Davidson for telling his story so well. Too bad Apatow didn't write and direct it better."}, {"id": 15, "text": "It's watchable when you have nothing to do, but it's wayyyyy too long. I feel like they lost themselves in totally unnecessary sub plots."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Proper regally good film and story, genuinely engaging characters, outstanding performances all round. You have to learn to live and grow around your circumstances no matter how old or who you are - and that's what happens here."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Hard to sit through this film in its entirety. Ineffective one liners. Grungy looking characters. What a waste of time. I should have been paid to watch."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Loved this movie, funny,sad,happy, serious and more. Never knowing how it might end, so it left you wanting more. Great characters and enjoyable experience and left me with a great sense of humanity and chilled out feeling."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Wow did this movie drag. I kept waiting for it to get funny and engaging...but nope. On top of that, Pete was incredibly unlikeable. I kept waiting for his character to morph and learn...but it just didn't happen. Too bad though, I was really hopeful for this movie."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I get the direction in which this movie was trying to go, but it missed horribly. I'm not going to blame any of the actors, but someone is to blame for this swing and miss. Under funded, and a completely unrealistic story... tried twice to watch it and couldn't do it. Really bad."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Really enjoy this it's easy watching but not boring! I thought it wouldn't be great so I would now say give it a watch"}, {"id": 22, "text": "A very well made film by Judd Apatow with a series of excellent performances by all the actors, especially Pete Davidson, Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, Bel Powley and Steve Buscemi.This coming of age story has a lot of heart at its centre, and it explores the protagonist's feelings towards his late father very beautifully. Especially the scene where the firefighters exchange stories at the bar is wonderfully acted, directed and written.This is a definite breakthrough into films for Davidson, and he fully delivers in the role. Some great work done by everyone involved."}, {"id": 23, "text": "I've liked some of Judd Apatow's films. I have not seen one thing that Pete Davidson has done that is good OR funny. Even on SNL his humor is sophomoric and imbecillic. Casting him in this feels like it was done more out of sympathy rather than talent. And this was not one of Mr. Apatow's finer writing efforts. Once Pete's tattoos start fading along with his 'career,' you'll likely catch him manning the fry station at Burger King."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Pete is the King of Animal Farm, where all the animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. Nobody gets more sympathy, love, pity, adulation, and money than King Swine, but it is never enough. Watch him feel sorry for himself for two hours. Feel his pain. Undeserved stardom and popularity. Millions of dollars. Worse than being a bank robber.Feel sorry for King Swine. He is very sad. Only your praise and applause can make him feel better, but only for a little while."}, {"id": 25, "text": "God this movie is garbage! Pete should be on his knees thanking ALL the SNL alum that made it possible for him to make this piece of crap. Pete can't act, he's not funny and he's really just a big goofy loser. He needs to go back and watch Chevy, Bill, Belushi and Akroyd to learn how comedy is done. Whatta maroon."}, {"id": 26, "text": "Why is this being marketed as a comedy? It's over two hours of disgusting, meaningless banter, none of which is remotely humorous or entertaining, performed by perhaps the ugliest bunch of wannabe actors (or over the hill, as with poor Steve Buscemi, who has never said No to being on screen) ever assembled.I made I through the extended scene involving the abuse of a nine-year-old child, lost in the forest looking for a friend, but lured by a bunch of lowlife stoners into submitting to having his arm tattooed. That action sets the plot in motion, and by calling it a plot I am giving it undue credit for its totally unnecessary existence.Once that was cleared up - after about 37 minutes - I began to fast-forward. I never found anything on which to linger, but I gave it its rightful chance until the credits started to roll.I have enjoyed some of Apatow's work, but then he had some excellent actors: Steve Carrell and Seth Rogen at the top of the list. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this overlong slop to even make you consider smiling or caring about anyone. Utterly repulsive on every conceivable level."}, {"id": 27, "text": "It's as if every actor here is in a different movie. They are different levels and you can feel it. The writing and story are okay, but there is such a lack of cohesiveness. It's very strange and the effect is a very uneven, unwatchable movie."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Don't listen to some of the trolls who reviewed this film. Writing, acting, and directing were phenomenal. Very memorable movie. It's been a while since I've rooted for a main character so much. Great movie."}, {"id": 29, "text": "I'm conflicted because it was a truly likable movie. On the other hand the editing seemed rushed and all over the place. I really liked the idea of the film and I wish it was better executed. Regardless it was enjoyable"}, {"id": 30, "text": "Typical American family. been seeing this for the past 30 years and still the same. Dad died or having and affair. Divorced, kid can't accept it. Do drugs and blah blah blah....shut boring"}, {"id": 31, "text": "Just going off of the previews, I thought this was going to have a gritty, indie vibe. Way wrong, just a neutered PG film not worth your time or money. A lot of good acting from the support characters, especially Bill Burr, but the lead tall goofy actor (don't know his name, was told he's from SNL), is not a good actor. Someone with more talent might have been able to save this movie from being so dull. Tim Dillon probably could have pulled it off."}, {"id": 32, "text": "I admit, only about 40min in before I just turned it off. Maybe good for someone from the area, but damn this movie was slow and boring, I think I smiled once, but other than that, this just felt very depressing without any real 'focus'If it cannot snag your attention in the first 10-15minutes, its likely not going to get a full view. Maybe next time?"}, {"id": 33, "text": "Steve Buscemi is a True American Hero. Pete Davidson and Judd Apatow are the exact opposite"}, {"id": 34, "text": "I feel that I should receive a check for making it through the first 20 minutes. Awful"}, {"id": 35, "text": "This movie actually made me laugh in several places which almost never happens.Really an excellent comedy slash drama."}, {"id": 36, "text": "There's a lot of heart and humor put into this movie. Just knowing Pete Davidson was one of the writers on this semi-autobiographical film makes everything seem a lot more real and wholesome. Well directed and unlike any other film Judd Apatow has directed in the past, I think people will enjoy the sappy and meaningful moments throughout it. If your a fan of Pete Davidson or Judd Apatow this'll be a rewatch able movie by the time it's placed on a stream. Overall score 84/100"}, {"id": 37, "text": "Judd Apatow strikes again. He's evidently very good at writing juvenile humor (I can't stand most of his work, but lots of people seem to think it's hilarious, for some reason, so I'll give him that.) In this movie, he seems to be trying to write something serious, and his apparent internal-struggle is painful to watch. Unlikeable characters, A near-meaningless plot, and a lead actor character that you just want to punch in the face. Seriously, I wanted to punch this guy in the face even more than I want to punch Shia LaBouf in the face, every time he's on screen, and I REALL want to punch Shia in the face. Avoid this movie, unless you just need background noise while you do your taxes, or the laundry. It's meaningless, depressing, and immediately forgettable."}, {"id": 38, "text": "Okay so the ending of this movie isn't so bad. It's supposed to be a feel-good movie where you learn something valuable about life, right? Well over half the movie you just sit there being pissed off and annoyed, not really understanding where the movie is supposed to go. What is the storyline here? The script is all over the place, and seems like it's just half-puzzled together to get somewhere by the end. I only give it any stars at all because it made me smile at the end, after spending the rest of the movie annoyed. That and because Bill Burr is awesome."}, {"id": 39, "text": "The King of Staten Island is just one of the freshest movie of these years. It comes with a soft / balanced story, intense, written and directed with dedication and intention, without going outside the edges. Pete Davidson stole the whole scene with his semi-serious acting (in a massive potive way) and regardless the movie is all around him, the cast, little by little craft a strong narrative building, creating all togheter something unforgettable. The king has just arised."}, {"id": 40, "text": "If Pete never does another movie he should be really proud of what he's accomplished. As someone who lost his father young &amp; has his own mental health issues, this movie really hit home with me. It might not be for everyone but it was fantastic to me. Bill Burr, Marisa Tomei, Steve Buscemi &amp; the others were really good too. Great movie!"}, {"id": 41, "text": "Sadly, the story went nowhere for me. Tells about the lives of a few that do nothing and have no ambitions. These stories have been told a million times before. Not something I'll watch again. I already wasted time viewing this film. I did enjoy the acting and the actors, they did well."}, {"id": 42, "text": "Urgh what is with Judd making these semi self auto biographical rubbish movies? Train wreck was 5/10 funny (max) this is 0/10 funny. Avoid."}, {"id": 43, "text": "Judd Apatow's silly type of comedy was juxtaposed with dark content haphazardly and didn't work. Pete's acting was distracting. Bill Burr was incredible and it was great to see him in a bigger role. I felt bad for Marisa Tomei because she really tried but suffered from lack of investment in a compelling story arch. There were way too many sub stories that exist for one moment and gone forever the next and they didn't add any greater meaning or have impactful resolution. Pete's character really could have had a moment that would have pulled everything in but instead he is basically the same as he was from the beginning. It seems like at the end, the movie wanted you to cheer for him, but his character remains unlikable throughout. After two hours you're still wondering what the movie is really focusing on. Music choices were cheesy and outdated. Writing was not memorable or ever laugh out loud funny. Cinematography was apathetic and straightforward. I basically am giving all of my stars to Burr, Tomei, and supporting cast for effort."}, {"id": 44, "text": "Remember that guy from HS who smoked dope and did his own tattoos. This is that loser at 30, living in mama's basement, playing video games all day and smoking weed. Two-hour pity parry"}, {"id": 45, "text": "This is the story of Scott who has no direction for his future. He is kind of lost in ordinary life with his friends. I saw a lot of good acting from Pete Davidson, Bel Powley, and Marisa Tomei. However, the story could have a single flow. Don't get me wrong. This movie worth watching. However, the story is changing direction and you become lost in which direction it goes next. The story is happening in different locations. I liked the background music. There are lessons to learn from the story. In summary, I recommend watching this movie to comedy and drama fans."}, {"id": 46, "text": "Ok, so this movie is like 4 hours long. It has no clear plot. It's not funny, jokes don't hit. No endearing qualities, I literally hate everyone by the end. Just meanders along, like why am I still here? It feels as though the film was finished by 5 zoom meetings, it's unfinished. Don't waste your time. Completely embarrassed I forked over $20 to rent this garbage pile. Wait to watch it for free on tv in 20 years. I'm serious, it's that bad. The fact that it has a collective rating over 7 right now is mind boggling. Girls was Judd apatow's demise, very sad."}, {"id": 47, "text": "I didn't pay for the movie...and i STILL want my money back ! I had such high hopes for this too ! A Judd Apatow movie with Pete Davidson, Bill Burr and Steve Buscemi.....it HAS to be funny right ??? NOPE ! 2 hours and 17 mins of complete blahhhhhh."}, {"id": 48, "text": "It was okay. it is extremely mediocre. almost as if they are normalize being a bum. that too is not done well :/"}, {"id": 49, "text": "This felt as if each scene was more interested in serving a singular punchline than moving any characters, plot, or story forward. The collections of punchlines were then strung together to formulate a narrative."}, {"id": 50, "text": "Had to switch it off quite early on, literally no comedy in this what so ever, unlikeable characters, not a clue as to how it has such a high rating."}, {"id": 51, "text": "I started into this movie feeling ambivalent about Pete Davidson as an actor. I watched mostly out of curiosity; to see if it lived up to the expectations set by the trailers. I was pleasantly surprised by the combination of the storyline, scriptwork, and acting. A movie well worth watching."}, {"id": 52, "text": "I have no explanation for the good reviews that appear for this movie. Pete is a 24 year-old who acts more like he's 14. This movie did a good job in making me hate his character and wish the movie would end already. The ending feels false and doesn't nearly make up for the agony of sitting through what came before it."}, {"id": 53, "text": "Did not work.I like Pete Davison, but he is not a leading man.The character in this and his friends are all idiots which I guess is the point but there is no redemption. Just as the resolution was coming due the film ended."}, {"id": 54, "text": "I wonder why he doesn't do a movie about frogs? Remember Hell Comes to Frogtown with Roddy Piper? Pete Davidson can do the sequel, King of Frogtown. Depressed Canadian frogs visit Staten Island to start a new depressing town, and they pick King Peter as their depressing leader, the King of Frogtown."}, {"id": 55, "text": "In short if you like Pete from SN' chances are you'll like this if you like him enough for 20$ and it was a lot longer and sadder then i thought it was gonna be but the trailer was pretty sad so should have seen that coming someone should also check in on Pete cause this isint a documentary but Pete Davidson In real life has his dad die and is a drug addict I give a solid recommendation for this support Davidson's first big movie directed by comedy director longed Judd apatow solid recommendation"}, {"id": 56, "text": "After 45 mins of remorseless stoney silence, we binned this comedy drama(?). Main guy is such an arse that even if he redeems himself in the second half, you don't care.Would rather watch a movie about Marisa Tomei's character than this idiot. He is just too annoying for any audience outside his comedy circle, definitely shows no ability as a film actor."}, {"id": 57, "text": "What an hilarious waste of a solid script-Davidson, despite his confidence in his abilities-is not strong enough to carry a movie.This could have been great with Andy Samberg in the lead. Stop inflating Pete's ego, he's neither good or relevant."}, {"id": 58, "text": "One of the most entertaining movies for years. Drama doesnt take the fun out of it. Small touches make this movie a real work of art. Must see"}, {"id": 59, "text": "This is insane. This is a 6 at best if you really like everything about this movie and laugh at unfunny jokes and punchlines etc.I do get through Covid we're all bored but this move is not good. So-so at best. Even my girl said she would watch it on the lifetime Chanel but not recommend anyone to pay for it.I tried to rent a movie we both can like because we have fairly dissimilar taste in movies. She didn't like it. I didn't like it.Stale acting. Unbelievable characters and choices. 4/10 in my book. Hard pass"}, {"id": 60, "text": "Ok film, that's painfully long. Funny at times and good characters. But boring at times due to bad editing. In saying that, check it out if your prepared to watch it while your pain is drying."}, {"id": 61, "text": "This movie had me laughing so hard that I probably missed some important parts. The jokes are definitely current, new, and inventive. I guess some people might just not have the same sense of humor as me, but I loved it. It was also a pretty engaging film on and emotional level. As a 24 year old myself, this movie was spot on with a lot of things in my own life. Bravo jud apatow and pete Davidson!"}, {"id": 62, "text": "Great performance from Pete Davidson's and Billy freckles."}, {"id": 63, "text": "And ended up watching the rest a few days later just to finish it, but I wasn't greatly looking forward to it, and the feeling was justified when I finally did finish it. Others are saying to stick it out and that the ending is worth it. So, basically 2 hours of crap for a 5 minute ending is worth it in others' opinions. Pete Davidson is so freaking annoying, he is this generations' David Schwimmer... everything he says or does is just idiotic and you want to punch him every time you see him. Frankly, I just don't see the positives in this one that the others seem to have found. Many other choices out there where the first 2 hrs are more watchable and enjoyable. There really were no surprises here."}, {"id": 64, "text": "What a wonderful crazy movie! Didn't know what to expect but I like Pete on SNL so I was determined to see this one. Great portrayal of firefighters and their families with the stress and issues that affect them. Well done Pete and Judd. Thanks for sharing this experience"}, {"id": 65, "text": "An Apatow Classic! This is a way for you to look at life from a different perspective. Change your prospective, change your world."}, {"id": 66, "text": "I am very impressed with this movie. From minute one it makes you smile non-stop. The characters and never stereotypical, very well rounded! Great writing for sure. The cinematography ist beautiful as well and coupled with the music it really lets you know this is not just a silly comedy, but a story about real (fictional) people. The casting is also very well done and the actors really disappear into their performance (despite some popular faces). Also out of all of Judd's movies this one is the most genuine. Who knew Pete was his muse all along. Talking about Pete, he is doing a fantastic job. He is very talented and by telling this story in this way not only has he shed light on the brave but he filled us with empathy and understanding for those who struggle. The movie does by no means glamorize sacrifice but is certainly does emphasize the need for compassion."}, {"id": 67, "text": "The King of Staten Island is A LOT better than I thought it was going to be, being one of the biggest surprises of 2020 so far. The King of Staten Island had great emotions, having a few deep, heartfelt moments, as well as being just so damn entertaining! The soundtrack was super fitting, having greatly placed pop culture music. All of the characters were big fun, putting on genuine performances with charming character development. The coming of age script was so free, doing and saying whatever they wanted, but keeping everything as tight as possible, not just shooting out aimless, subjective comedy."}, {"id": 68, "text": "Everyone else worked, and this guy comes with his sad story as an excuse to be the horrible person he is around everyone. Like atleast give people with same bad lack but with talent the same chances, he has received! Worst Judd Apatow movie and how can with world function with a horrible human being like Pete Davidson taking roles from talented people"}, {"id": 69, "text": "The King of Staten Island is a sweet and relatable coming of age story. We can all relate in one way or another to Pete Davidson's character struggling to let go of the past as life forces him to grow up, even if he's already an adult. The subtle and natural comedy sprinkled throughout enhances the dramatic themes of the film, which make for an at times melancholy, yet ultimately uplifting story."}, {"id": 70, "text": "The King of Staten Island was boring, depressing and reaching with its comedy. I didn't think they could take two comedians (Pete Davidson and Bill Burr) and make them so unfunny, I love comedians moving into drama as they seem to have enough pain in their lives to evoke emotions. This movie however, conveyed a drought of emotion, leaving only a wallowing of nothing.One to be missed."}, {"id": 71, "text": "I'll tell you why... because they are well meaning with solid core stories, but incessantly meander to the point that any good story telling is marred by how far the filmmaker takes us from the central plot. Clean it up, Judd, accept help from editors. You don't weave stories as masterfully as you think you do.Aside from that, this film contains wonderful performances from its cast, in particular Mr. Davidson who despite portraying an out of control character who makes bad choices over and over again keeps his place in the viewers heart. Marissa Tomei turns in a strong performance, though the writers of the film seem to let her down about three quarters of the way through."}, {"id": 72, "text": "I liked this film it had a good script I liked the constant flow of the dialogue and the actors bouncing off each other. There is a lot of good characters and actors in this film and I liked the story too. Overall a enjoyable comedy drama."}, {"id": 73, "text": "This movie shows Pete Davidson can act, and is loosely based on his life. It is a long movie that moves slow at times, however, the casting was spot on, and the cast had great chemistry. Marissa Tomei is her usual amazing self. My only issue with the movie was the absolutely horrible ending, of leaves you hanging, as if the writers did not know how to tie everything together and just end the movie, think of the disappointment of the Sopranos ending."}, {"id": 74, "text": "Judd Apatow dramatizes the tragedy/comedy of Pete Davidson's past history - and ongoing - thoughtfully. It's an interesting exercise to explore a life that is well-known and I applaud Apatow's effort to squeeze as much from this story as he did. That's also a credit to the cast he assembled, that being Marasia Romei, Bill Burr and Maude Apatow. Davidson's vulnerability is on full display but his charm is prime reason you feel comfortable watching.A few scenes drag on a bit too long with awkward dialogue when it should've been paced better according to how interesting what they were talking about was. That's my only complaint: that it could've been a streamlined two-hour movie without characters explaining every moment three times over. That usually detracts the drama.I like Judds directing of the dramatic moment when Scott decides not to forgo his friends botched robbery but still maintaining the comedy aspect. The music and close-up on Davidson's face was an impressive turning point in his character arc.The best moment is the realization Scott has when other people with equally life-altering problems somehow have an equilibrium that he's missing. That was a positively unexpected lesson and one that showed him despite his serious problems, he can function like anyone else.Though he's not perfect and a young guy, after watching, I have sympathy for Pete. The public opinion, I think, is usually undeserved in his case considering where he's coming from and the fact that he's not really a completely deplorable human.After exiting my living room, I felt satisfied."}, {"id": 75, "text": "To make this simple, I believe Pete Davidson is a great actor and seems to be able to transition his comedy with real life. This movie hits a variety of generations and talks about depression and anxiety in a way where its taken serious but also made to be funny so others can feel open to talk and know its ok to feel that way.Great movie and not just a comedy."}, {"id": 76, "text": "Pete Davidson is a great fit for this. Makes sense since the movie is dedicated to his father.This movie is funny, heartfelt, and always cracks a good joke at the right time.Loved this movie even though there wasn't a ton of depth at times."}, {"id": 77, "text": "Just brutal. Bad acting, lame story. Trying way to hard"}, {"id": 78, "text": "This is such a great movie! Great acting, funny, and very touching story.

The character development in this movie was really well done. Not usually a huge fan of Pete Davidson but I will admit the he did a great job in this film.

Most everyone does a great job and portrays their respective characters very well. Pete Davidson and Bill Burr are easily the best parts about this film. I've never been a huge fan of Davidson but he really fits here. Burr brings his usual funny attitude here but shows a more sympathetic and kindhearted side which is nice to see. The biggest issue with this film is the screenplay. It feels like the first draft which means some of the dialogue is pretty rough. Some of the characters dialogue feels awkward and unnatural. I definitely would have enjoyed this film more if they had spent more time on the screenplay. The film is also about 30 minutes too long and that's a complaint I've heard about a lot of Judd Apatow movies. A lot of moments could have either been cut out or just shortened.

At one point I was trying to hold back a tear, in which I can only compare to Brian's song. The movie is an epic poem to the memory of Pete's father; it goes through all the stages of grief, while providing the hope for growth in any adolescent male. The director is able to being awareness to mental health in a new profound way that does not seem cliche like other recent movies.

Skip it and thank me later."}, {"id": 94, "text": "2020's The King of Staten Island is my latest write-up. And no, I'm not talking about Staten Island residents like Gene Simmons, Vernon Reid, and Method Man. Staten is about a twentysomething who lives with his mom and doesn't really have a career or direction in his life. It also doesn't help that his firefighter father died when he was seven leaving him distraught with low self-esteem, a pot-smoking habit, and ADHD.Semi-autobiographical in its approach and blunt to the nth degree, The King of Staten Island is Judd Apatow at his most Apatow (yup, he's the director). Judd without the ability to yell cut, gives us his usual trademarks. We're talking long-winded scenes, longer than normal running times for comedy/dramas, and improvisation to the max. Staten with a wandering and bloated eye, feels like the film Apatow was born to make. No one probably refused him final cut and I'm sure that made big Judd real happy.Starring the likes of Marisa Tomei, Steve Buscemi, and Pete Davidson (he plays the troubled lead in Scott Carlin), Staten follows the Apatow badge in which an unknown trouper gets a chance to break out as a main character in a big studio flick. Seth Rogen did it in Knocked Up while Amy Schumer did it in Trainwreck. Davidson does it raw here in Staten as a sort of life-imitating-art suitor. He's perfectly cast but you don't quite root for him because his life courses of action and paths aren't fully defined (the romanticized yet pat ending is proof of that).Much like the journey Davidson's Scott takes, The King of Staten Island as a film feels jumbled and a little haphazard as well. I liked the authenticity of Staten Island's culture depicted and most of the actors in peaking in, slice-of-life mode, are ones you gravitate to. Still, Staten proves that Apatow can push the envelope but only in a drifting manner. Funny at times, depressing, and kinda touching, The King of Staten Island is no court jester but it's no crowned head either.

For his first movie he gives a very strong performance.Even though they wisely chose to give him a very good supporting cast. Pamela Adlon is always great and Bel Powley was great ever since she did Carrie Pilby and Marisa Tomei is likable as always. But the real gravitas of course is given by Steve Buscemi.

Cheers!"}, {"id": 113, "text": "One of the best movies of 2020. The actors are great as well as the director"}, {"id": 114, "text": "King of Staten Island follows Scott (named after Pete Davidson's real father), a deadbeat stoner in his early twenties who lives with his mum, has dreams of becoming a tattoo artist, and brings the grief and trauma of his father's untimely death around with him everywhere. An untimely death that mirrors his own fathers, making this a somewhat autobiographical story by Davidson himself. And that's roughly it. As far as plot goes, King of Staten Island just aimlessly meanders around as plot points snowball and develop into new plot points. As an example a kid wanders out of the woods on to the beach Scott and his friends are hanging out on, and Scott tattoos a line on the kids arm before the kid bails. Of course the kids father comes knocking on his door, one thing leads to another, and the father and Scott's mother start dating. The kids father being a firefighter, like Scott's father, dregs up some unwanted feelings for Scott and he endeavours to sabotage their relationship. This gets him kicked out the house, so he has to find somewhere to live, eventually falling into the local fire department where he learns about camaraderie, responsibility, and caring for others. It's just a series of plot points turning into new plot points like seeing a dull butterfly effect in action.But what about the story? Plot and story are different things entirely, so what story is King of Staten Island wanting to tell through these plot points? Honestly, I'm not really sure. Is this meant to be a movie about grief and trauma? About the arrested development of a grown man-child? And to what end? I stuck with it to see if the answers would come to me in the movie's final moments as everything gets tied together, but it just ends without much resolution at all. In fact it feels like it ends just as we're about to get that kind of resolution. He learns about responsibility, how to care for others, and how to express himself to those close to him, but there's no implication that this will have long-lasting effects. Him bonding with a bunch of firefighters who worked with his father doesn't mean he'll become a firefighter. Him helping a random guy on the street who was stabbed doesn't mean he's going to go into the emergency services. Him professing his love for his on-off girlfriend doesn't mean they'll have much of a relationship. Him finally being able to talk to his mother about his fathers death doesn't necessarily mean he's come to terms with it. He still suffers from the ADD and Bipolar the traumatic event has given him. He's still homeless and jobless. In fact not a whole lot has changed for him between the start and the end of the movie. He's still largely spinning in the exact same spots he was before the movie started. So as the credits rolled, I was left with the feeling of what was the point of all that?As I mentioned before, the comparison to Funny People is a pretty decent one to make. I remember back when that movie came out, it was heavily criticised for being too long and not funny enough, but that was kind of the point. It was about the misery and difficulties faced by comedians; that they're not all intrinsically happy people. King of Staten Island similarly prefers to focus on characters and the drama between them than on jokes and laughs. What jokes and comedy there are here are used to add flavour to the drama, rather than the other way round. There's some good ones for sure, such as Scott antagonising a white supremacist getting a tattoo, Steve Buscemi regaling unheroic stories about Scott's father to him, the choices and executions of some of Scott's tattoo work, and the dark humour of the various dead dad jokes. However for the large part I felt like I just wasn't American enough, or worse not New-Yorker enough, to understand half the jokes. Jokes about comparing Staten Island to Brooklyn and New Jersey meant nothing to me, jokes about American sporting teams meant nothing to me. Hell even the super important closing detail of the entire movie was lost on me simply because I'm not from New York City (Scott gazing up at the building his father (and Davidson's own father) died in). It would be like if I made jokes comparing Soho to Battersea or Lewisham and just expecting everyone who isn't a Brit (or worse a Londoner) to understand how funny I am. All right, yeah, we do make those kind of regional jokes over here too, so King of Staten Island just obviously wasn't aimed at me in the same way Mock the Week isn't exactly a show to recommend to Americans. But when such a large portion of your comedy is so specifically regional, in a movie with obviously international reach and interest to it, something's gone amiss.In truth, I was entertained through almost the entire movie's runtime. The relationship between Scott and Kelsey is a definite high point, in the way that true, humanistic relationships always are in Apatow movies. You just can't but root for every character in this movie, even those as unlikeable as Ray, Ricky, and especially Scott himself. He's narcissistic, self-absorbed, pathetic, lazy, and shirks any amount of responsibility, and yet you can't help but feel sympathy for his character and hope he finds a way to turn his life around. Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, and Steve Buscemi all give great performances as well. It just felt like a deeply unsatisfactory movie that lacked direction and didn't really have a whole lot to say. It dangled so many potentials, but didn't capitalise on any of them. I give King of Staten Island a just fine 6/10."}, {"id": 115, "text": "It has a sweet ending but this was hard to sit through.

Director Judd Apatow delivers the goods with his patented way of mixing humor and heart with Davidson (who collaborated on the script with him and Dave Sirus) as a slacker facing the moment of truth to become something in his life whatever that entails including aspirations of being a tattoo artist while his mother (Tomei) begins a new relationship long after the loss of his firefighter father, whose memory hangs like a cloud over them both. Davidson shines in his first big role onscreen outside of SNL and has potential to be an even bigger comedy star in the making."}, {"id": 166, "text": "I think because this is a Judd Apatow movie that we go in with high expectations for a laugh fest, hijinks, great banter, degenerate but hilarious man-boys/girls. Most of these things either don't exist in this film or they are sparse. It reminds me more a small film such as Britany Runs a Marathon (recommend!) which is a sweet little film in a small NY setting with a simple but emotionally appealing character arc. Pete Davidson is definitely a competent actor and he looks good and healthy. (for Pete) Call me old fashioned, but his tats are so ugly, pure bodily chaos - and I like tattoos. They distracted me. There were so many throw away plot lines and it was too long, unnecessarily. I enjoyed the chemistry between Roy and Scott, I did not get the chemistry with the girl/love interest and the abrupt resolution to that story. Overall, I enjoyed it - enough and recommend it."}, {"id": 167, "text": "I didn't think to much going into this movie because I'm (unfortunately) only familier with Pete Davidson because the time he spent in the tabloids.

I found this story so beautifuly told and heart warm without being sappy. The comedic parts were very funny especially with Scott's friends. Pete Davidson's acting was very good and I noticed really strong chemistry between and anyone he shared a scene with! My fav part of the movie was that the main character wasn't the main love story. The growth we got to see with this character while he accepted his mother's relationship and found himself &amp; then the last scene was his love scene... idk I call that writing perfection.

There is a really nice character development and you can see the gradual transformation from an irresponsible person, into a man that acknowledged the fact that is an adult and need to grow up, by stopping living in the past. The movie in fact is slow paced to appreciate this evolution, but in my opinion it was slightly too long. It would be perfect if it lasted 2 hours, the ending is a little bit dragged out.Cast is solid and I was surprised to see Steve Buscemi in this kind of production.

Tbh, I can see his charm under the facade.I thought that the movie would be more than what it was. It seemed like if it went a bit deeper it would have been more heartfelt.I loved the interactions with the children. It was pretty cute.There was absolutely no chemistry between Pete's character and the love interest. It didn't even seem like he was remotely interested in her, treated her like a friend that he had sex with only (didn't even seem like he enjoyed having sex with her either)... But by the end he said he loved her? (I think? By the end I was getting bored and playing on my phone) I didn't really buy that at all. Plus, the girl seemed pretty pathetic to put up with it and Then keep trying to get attention when he just didn't respond to it. But then he loved her and was scared? Boyfriend material right there! LololAnyway, back to the real plot of Scott's issues with dealing with his father's death in 9/11. That really sounds like a good storyline but it just stays too shallow for me to really care. And I wanted to care more. I wanted to cry I felt at sad... But I didn't! I cry at everything I watch these days but not this.. I know it's a truly Heartfelt to me when I get all choked up and/or cry.I did laugh a few times but this movie either needed to be more funny or more sad or both. Ie Ricky Gervais's Afterlife - I laughed, I cried... It was heartfelt. Or Schitt's Creek.. I laughed, I cried, it was heartfelt. This movie I laughed a little.Also, why does Staten Island seem like it's in the wrong decade? Marisa Tomei looked like she was in the early 80s with that hair and the glasses. I honestly didn't even recognize her at first. That hair cut was god awful! She's hot... She just played Aunt Mae in Spiderman and was super hot... And in this I could not get passed the haircut.Also, that guy Ray seemed weird and I agreed with Scott that his mother should not date him! First, I knew he would be back to hit on her because she said her husband was dead. (predatory behavior in my opinion) Then he makes Scott take his kids to school after Scott tattooed his son. Ray does not notify his ex wife or the school that a strange man would be doing this. That's bizarre to me. Also, he lied to Marisa Tomei that he was living in the fire house. Also weird. To me, he was manipulative and trying to worm his way into her house to have a place to stay and having Scott be kicked out. Not cool, Ray!I guess there's a happy ending? I honestly don't remember today. (I saw it last night) It was too long for not that much going on in the plot.But, I sorta like Pete Davidson now.This did not seem like a Judd Apatow movie aside from having his daughter in this playing Scott's sister.

But all in all, a really nice film!"}, {"id": 213, "text": "What can i say, the king of staten island is a great movie. It's a story about a guy in his mid 20's who's suffering from ADD and the pressure his environment puts on him to do something with his life. His sister is going to college and his deceased dad was a hero-firefighter, this resulting in putting even more pressure onto him to do something important. His dream is to become a tattoo artist, but things just don't seem to work out for him (he's also lacking human canvas to practice on ;-) ). Because of him failing to find a human canvas, he decides to tattoo a random 8 year old boy in the woods; but he doesn't get further than a single line. This leads to the boys dad visiting their house and getting into a relationship with the wannabe-tattoo-artists mother. The problem here is; his mothers new 'boyfriend' is a firefighter too, he puts more pressure on the guy, and acts like he's trying to fill in the 'father-role-gap' which the family was missing. All this results in a hot mess filled with prejudices about each others current and past lifestyle.The King Of Staten Island has a very clear message; never judge a book by its cover. It's all about being open, supporting each other and giving people a chance to prove themselves. Where tattoos can seem to give off a 'dangerous' vibe, they can also be seen as the clearest and most functional way of communication there is. The movie tackles the differences between people in the way they express themselves; where our main character is very (negatively) outspoken and filled with tattoos - his mothers new boyfriend is the complete opposite (acting very positive and has 0 tattoos). The truth is they both kinda suck(ed) in life, but they communicate it to the outside world in a very different way, leading to frustration between the two.Openness and communication is key in life, it brings opportunity and chances. The way you choose to communicate (for example through tattoos) is up to you, as long as you don't judge people for not expressing themselves in the same way (our main character for example surrounds himself with people who are just like him, rather than spending time with his mom or sister who really care about him but express themselves in a different way).The King Of Staten Island talks about these subjects in a very exciting, funny and entertaining way. It knows what its going for and doesn't try to be more than it is. It basically succeeds in what it's trying to achieve. It has a few scenes which eventually go nowhere and have 0 purpose, but they didn't bother me that much. Don't expect top notch acting or an amazing story, just a decent enjoyable movie!"}, {"id": 214, "text": "Ever since his dad died in a firefighter incident, Scott's life hasn't managed to go anywhere. He spends every day smoking pot and talks about opening a tattoo resturant (but never follows through on it), plus has a case of ADD and Crohns disease. He also has to take care of his mother by himself when his sister goes away for college. But one day a seemingly minor event changes everything...Besides Judd Apatow's brand of humor, I didn't know what to expect from this film. Not a lot of interesting movies were playing in theaters, so I thought I might as well give this one a chance.I had never seen Pete Davidson in anything before this, but after his performance in this film I won't forget him. While at first Scott doesnt seem like much more than a crazy manchild, I really started to feel affectionate for the guy after a while. You laugh at his inappropriately timed comments and shortsighted decisions, but Davidson also portrays how his impulsive behavior makes him doubt his own selfworth, that maybe he's too stupid to ever reach any higher.The conflict that stirs up after his mom (superbly played by Marisa Tomei) hooks up with a new boyfriend doesn't feel clich\u00e9 in any way. You understand Scotts worry once he learns hes not only someone he got off with on the wrong foot, but is also a firefighter just like his dad. His stubborn inability to give him a chance to the fear of going through another loss or the idea that she goes for the same type just as a vain replacement for his father feels justified. We're shown Ray doesn't think highly of him either, judging by the conversation with Margie where he dismisses the tattoo resturant concept and thinks he'll never amount to anything. The fact that she doesn't even defend her son is even sadder, like there might be some truth in what he says.Since I mentioned Ray, I should also talk about Bill Burr. Even though his face looked familiar, not once did I recognize that was him since he completely disappeared into the character. He walks the line between likable and kind of arrogant, which is hard to pull off, but he manages to do so perfectly.But while the movie does get heavy, it's also hilarious much of the time. Not just Davidson, but also Burr, Tomei, Pamela Adlon, Steve Buscemi and the actors playing Scott's friend circle get moments to shine in terms of comedy. At times silly, other times deadpan, the humor always feel natural to the characters and progression of the story. It feels very hangout in terms of tone, where you are just observing these people sharing laughs and poking fun at each other. Additionally, there are times where it can get uncomfortable and funny at the same time, most of those momens owed to Davidson.Apatow's daughter Maude does a very good job as Scott's sister Claire. She's kind of a regular in his films, but this is her most memorable part so far.Does the plot take expected turns? Sure. Every relationship gets a happy ending, everyone gets along in the end (except for Ray and his ex-wife Gina) and even Igor's potential catfish girlfriend is actually real. But none of that matters as long as you're having a good time, which I certainly did.The King Of Staten Island isn't Apatow's most serious film (that would be Funny People), but I do think it's his most sincere. Whether you know who Pete Davidson is or not, I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a good laugh along with engaging characters."}, {"id": 215, "text": "The story of a 24 year old guy that lives with his mother, and whose father had died a hero rescuing lives in his work as a fireman.

Feel like his daughter should have to work for her roles instead of just being privileged and getting them handed to her by her father.

So funny to watch, loved it."}, {"id": 222, "text": "Considering I am squarely in the camp of Pete Davidson cannot act (watch him try to say any lines on SNL, this guy definitely benefits from the multiple takes available to movie actors), me rating this film as highly as I have is saying something.The film itself is semi-biographical of Pete's own life, although it (surprisingly) excises the fact that Pete's real dad died on 9/11, although I'm guessing this was due to timing (this film was set in modern day, although the real Pete would've been living on Staten Island (as portrayed) in the 00's).What follows is a pretty by-the-numbers coming-of-age tale, despite the real connection, it's no different than many loser finds purpose stories that have been told a million times before.However, the story itself is told in a truly heartfelt way, and there are some minor laughs, so it's not a complete waste.2 points of contention:1) As much as I make fun of Pete's acting, in comparison to the woman playing his sister, Maude Apatow (the director's daughter), Pete is Tom Hanks, because she simply cannot act, her Staten Island accent is so thick and overdone it's painful to listen to. This trend of directors casting their no-talent kids in films (I'm looking at you, Kevin Smith), needs to stop. Yay for nepotism!2) The film could've used some heavy handed editing, it definitely didn't need to be nearly as long as it was. Judd Apatow is famous for making very long comedies, but I don't think some of the scenes really add anything to the film, in the end. They just drag.Is this film worth seeing? Yes. Paying the full price theater-to-home streaming option? Probably not. Wait until it's free on Netflix, would be my suggestion."}, {"id": 223, "text": "Such an awesome movie!!

They seemed quite flat and in need of some more character development. Pete Davidson seemed very real, probably because this story is very personal to him. I was worried that Bill Burr may seem out of place but he was surprisingly tame throughout the movie. He never went over the top which helped the film a great deal. The only gripe that I had with the movie is it's runtime. It is 2 hours and 16 minutes and you can feel every second. If the movie was cut to around 1 hour and 45 minutes, it would be great.

Even the women (except the sister) are allowed to be funny. Excellent acting all around. Examples of what I think is funny: Get Him To the Greek, Silicon Valley, The Heat, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Greener Grass, Nanette. Examples of what I don't think is funny: The 40-Year-Old Virgin, everything with Adam Sandler (and the whole slew of movies/series like that).

Like I get it, he's had a rough life but enough with that stuff. If I were an actor I would wanna pursue things that were creative as opposed to creating things that were based on my real life.

The story is very intriguing, keeps you engage, while also having feelings for the main characters.Overall I would say this is one of Judd Apatow's best works from a theatrical standpoint as it has a good blend between comedy and drama.

Scott does have ADHD and Crohn's desease, which he uses both as excuse and badge of honour to dodge even the remotest opportunities to straighten up.The Staten Island connotation may not register fully outside the Big Apple. Think sub-suburban no man's land, a 15 minute ferry ride to Manhattan but for all you know you could be in North Dakota. Apatow, to his credit, brings it to life, or rather lets it live, as he does Scott, who carries on with aloof and amused indifference to all who don't realise there is nothing wrong with him being who he is.

I guess this movie is based on Davidson's real life(surprising? Haha) growing up. It's got all the hallmarks of an Apatow film. Kinda deep at times, heartwarming and pretty funny at several points to not make you feel guilty about actually feeling real human emotions. The ensemble cast he always puts together so well, he has done so again. Marissa Tomei is always beautiful and awesome. Steve Buscemi is great in a small role. Bill Burr is both funny and touching.

He was so relatable and oddly likeable, that I now want to have a joint with him and laugh until my cheeks hurt (and I don't smoke pot). It wasn't a role far from who he is, and I don't really think Pete could ever be a great character actor, that wasn't the intent.

Like every Judd Apatow movie, there's no reason for it to be two hours and sixteen minutes. The guy has no idea how to end a movie on time.Marisa Tomei again shows why she really did deserve that Oscar and wow, Bill Burr was a revelation. The guy is so natural and perfect here, as is Bel Powley as Davidson's love interest.Pamela Adlon, who plays Burr's ex-wife, is actually the voice of Bobby Hill on King of the Hill, which is a shock.

There was good and there was bad as with any other movie. So let's start with the good. The characters were excellent and well casted. Pete Davidson and his posse were great. The best part about Pete Davidson's character was his character arc. Bill Burr did an excellent job despite not being the comic relief and his character src is very well done. The story was good as well. It was funny at times yet dramatic and heartwarming at other times. And the film had a good message. But with any film there is the bad. Luckily the list of things that are bad about this film aren't too long. You could tell the budget was slim considering the lack of depth when it came to the sets and a large number of B list actors. This didn't make the film suffer too much, but those better actors would've been better in those dramatic situations. All in all it was a good film. I enjoyed it and I am not a Pete Davidson fan.

I wanted to see it in theaters but renting it for 20 dollars in my living room was my only option for now.Pete has proved himself to be a funny guy and a competent actor, and even though he's playing a similar character to his role in Big Time Adolescence, this is a big step forward in his career.I think this movie will probably receive criticism for not being as funny as some of Judd Appatows other movies, but I don't think this movie was aiming for a the same thing as Superbad and The 40 year old virgin. Judd often talks about how the key to making a good comedy is to make a good drama and add humor to it, this is the perfect example.Pete's story is intriguing and feels completely worthy of a movie like this. Some people wanting a non stop laugh fest maybe not like it, and it does have flaws, but I really enjoyed it.This is probably Judds best movie in 10 years. And I highly recommend giving it a watch."}, {"id": 308, "text": "It is a fine day for something funny, relatable and wholesome &amp; The King of Staten Island delivers a rather enjoyable package in that department. Judd Apatow's most famous include The 40-Year-Old Virgin (which I loved) and Knocked Up, and the last before last, whole 5 years ago, was Trainwreck, which I happened to catch on the big screen, it was okay but not a fan... This time around Apatow directs a story co-written with its standout star Pete Davidson, dedicated to his dad Scott Davidson, and quite heavily inspired by Pete's own life. Though not without its flaws, I can tell You The King of Staten Island is easily my favorite Judd Apatow piece since 2005.To most probably known as a member of SNL, now rising comic, actor and cool dude Pete Davidson is portraying Scott, a 24 year old who has been a case of ADD ever since his firefighter dad died when he was seven. Jobless and living with mom, Scott spends his days smoking bud, hanging out with friends and dreaming of being a tattoo artist. When some new characters enter his life, he is forced to grapple grief, trauma and take his first steps towards redemption. In real life, Pete Davidson's father was a firefighter who died in the line of duty, rescuing victims of the 9/11 attack. Cast member Steve Buscemi used to be a firefighter in the wake of the 80's, and returned to help on the day of the same tragedy.The King of Staten Island is mainly a story about growing up, finding the good things, learning to accept those good things, and taking responsibility over one's life. There's genuine sentiment in its heart, which rests in just the right place, and it can also be legitimately funny. It's not structurally perfect, and can feel a little too scenic, focusing on the quality of separate sequences that do not add a lot of story. The big turning point starts manifesting itself as late as 100 minutes into the movie, and in the end the 2 hour and 17 minute runtime is a little too tall. Having said that, it is a dramedy that's never boring, always pleasantly amusing. This kind of plot, I believe, is pretty predictable by default, so enjoy the substitute, the always-present-low-key-charm. As a 23 year currently stuck in my hometown and great friends with Mary Jane, I felt like an appropriate audience member for The King of Staten Island, and that's what I meant with relatable and wholesome. Some might say that a big part of this movie isn't about a whole lot of anything, but I beg to differ, perhaps the idyllic view on such simplicities tells a lot.I think it's apparent Pete Davidson is a pivotal part of why the movie works so well. In what might very likely be his best performance to date, he plays a likeable, decent guy with a good heart and some troubles in it, plays him so authentically one could guess some of it comes from a place of past pain. But that's not it, the supporting cast delivers well above average performances as well - do not miss the chance to see Bill Burr in a bigger role and rocking an impressive moustache, and the female counterparts for both - Bel Powley and Marisa Tomei, anchor the balance perfectly.Judd Apatow is arguably one of Hollywood Heavyweights, making a film with a cast that don't fall back all that much, so the level of these ingredients resemble themselves also in every technical and aesthetical department. It's visually very well orchestrated, subtle and perfect in its simplicity, never once anything distracting catches the eye. Soundtrack has a couple of real nice tunes in it, of which one dear-to-my-heart nostalgia song ended the film, but I won't spoil it.Even now I wonder why not more, because I really, really dug it, but I believe that it deserves a good, flavorful, perhaps even memorable 7/10. I recommend it, well, just about everyone who's not too young for it, even one point of intrigue is enough."}, {"id": 309, "text": "Not really a fan of Pete Davidson prior to this film and frankly still not a fan of him after it, but I respect his transformation in this movie. If you don't know (which at this point, I'm not sure how you couldn't) Pete's real dad was FDNY and died on 9/11. Whether or not he was able to use this to catapult his comedic career is something I don't know, but I never found him particularly funny. When he first got to SNL I thought he was going to be the next Andy Samberg, but his appearances seemed to fizzle and he was often relegated to doing pre-recorded bits on the show. It made me a little sad because I think his potential was and is wasted at SNL but perhaps it's one of those situations where they can't really fire him due to FDNY connections. I know it sounds kinda conspiracy theory-ish but those are my personal thoughts.Now back to this film. I absolutely hated the first 30-45 minutes and was regretting my decision to watch the film, but I eventually finished it and I actually thought it was a decent story about personal transformation, something I definitely could relate to. Seeing the cherry picked reviews about how it was so funny and Apatow's best film are now confusing as it is neither hilarious or Apatow's best, but still very good. If you're like me and think the first half of the movie is awful, just hang in there and finish it. Everything comes together at the end so the beginning of the movie doesn't seem as awful as it is."}, {"id": 310, "text": "Don't let the fake, 1-week old accounts rating this 9's and 10's fool you, this is a stinker. File this under movies that didn't need to be made. The King of Staten Island is slow, uneventful, but even worse it is a waste of a solid core cast of veterans. Unfortunately, casting Davidson, in what appears to be some sort of ill-advised vanity project, as the lead doomed this movie from the start. How Davidson landed a role on SNL is baffling enough, but how Apatow then thought he was fit to star on the big screen can only be explained away as Apatow owing Lorne Michael a big favor for some past transaction.The rest of the cast didn't fair much better, with the fiery (no pun intended) firefighter played by Bill Burr being the exception. Tomei, who is usually a guaranteed casting choice if for nothing else than the stability her experience provides, also falls flat. Perhaps that's due to the weak writing of which Davidson also took part, or perhaps the film just sucked the life out of her like it sucked the life out of me while watching it. Finally, the pacing of the movie was sluggish, if not at a crawl at times, and the 2+ hour runtime starts to feel more like 4 hours. It's quite clear that a lot of reviewers (the real ones, not the brand new ones created solely to boost the film's rating) are trying their best to justify the fact that they spent $20 to watch this on their couch... That justification will likely never come for them, but it doesn't have to come for you.Skip this stinker. 4.3/10"}, {"id": 311, "text": "Expecting more of a crass story, with an rough and unlikable character - happily I was wrong!The movie isn't a laugh a minute but instead has a very realistic flow that one could find if you had a temporary look into someone's life. Sometimes there are funny, light, silly moments but there are also sad, frustrating and regrettable ones too. Such is life. They balanced it beautifully.My biggest worry was that the main character (Scott played by Pete Davidson) would be wildly unlikable as that is often the case with these types of films. To sit through 2 hours of a movie you have to enjoy the character enough to root for them. Luckily that is the case. Scott is played as a thoughtful, sensitive, funny guy who truly wants to do the right thing. When he does screw up it's not to an extent where you dislike him. Few actors know how to show that balance in a movie like this. They often oversell their ugly moments so well that the redeeming or sweet ones don't make up for it. Pete does a perfect job at presenting a likable guy who is just a bit lost, in doing so is endearing and relatable. By the end of the movie he felt like a friend, someone you can't help but cheer on.The whole cast was perfectly placed, authentic and enjoyable.I thought the length would be complete overkill as is so often the case with movies today. However I can happily admit, I didn't notice the time. It flowed well, didn't linger on one thing too long and felt light.A surprisingly sweet movie that is more heart than 'har har'. I'll remember this one."}, {"id": 312, "text": "Everyone knows director Judd Apatow for his movies The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up (rightfully so), but I've always appreciated some of his other outings as well, like Funny People, Trainwreck, and for creating the Netflix series Love. This may seem like a big statement and I've only just watched his newest film The King of Staten Island, but I believe it may be my favourite film of his. Full of sharp comedy, raw emotions, and packing a strong punch of reality, I was sucked in from start to finish. With such a touchy subject that may even offend some viewers, this movie chooses a slightly comedic take on loss and I thought that made the film even better. Here's why I highly, highly recommend The King of Staten Island.Beginning with the fact that Scott (Pete Davidson) has not gotten over the death of his father, he sits around all day, doing nothing except smoke weed and hang out with friends. With his sister off to college and his mom beginning to date someone he doesn't approve of, his hardships become even deeper. Slowly learning ways to cope and move on, he discovers things about himself that were hidden. This film hit me really hard. Not because I related to him in any way, but the fact that Pete Davidson also had a hand in the screenplay, spoke volumes.In real life, Pete Davidson lost his father in the fires of 9/11. While names, scenarios, and overall lifestyle of Scott in the film was changed to fit a feature film, every line of the dialogue felt like it came from the heart. I could feel the inner pain very present throughout the entire duration and his central performance brought me to tears by the end. The way he handles his grief and bottles it up, trying to make everything into a joke, felt very authentic. I've only ever seen his appearances on Saturday Night Live, but if he's able to channel emotions and comedic chops in other projects like this, I can't wait to see more of him.Now, this may be slightly biased, but I'm a huge fan of movies that are done well, with hardly any score. The characters are what make this movie what it is and the lengthy 136-minute run time flew by for me. From the terrific direction by Judd Apatow, to the supporting cast like Marisa Tomei and Bill Burr holding up the raw, central performance by Davidson, I just found myself engulfed in the emotion of it all. Yes, I laughed on multiple occasions as well, as this really is a comedy at its core, but it's so much more than that. While not a lot happens other than the arc that Scott goes through, The King of Staten Island had a lot to say.In the end, looking back on the film as a whole, I don't really have anything that I would say took me out of my experience. The care taken to the subtlety of the camerawork by Robert Elswit was also a nice addition. His work in the past has won many awards though, so that shouldn't come as a surprise. This may seem like a review of something gushing about all the best elements of a movie and not even choosing to touch on a negative, but that's because any minor issues I may have had aren't even worth it. I loved every second of this character study and not only do I believe it's Apatow's best and not authentic film to date, but it's also my favourite film of 2020 so far. I haven't been this positive about a film in 2020 yet, so I believe a round of applause for the entire cast and crew on this one is in order. I can't recommend this one enough."}, {"id": 313, "text": "It has been five years since Judd Apatow directed a film, with 2015's Trainwreck, and eight years since he had written and directed a film, with 2012's This is 40. Apatow has a great return to form here as the jokes hit for the most part in an overstretched 137 minute runtime. This is more or less customary in any Apatow film made in the past 15 years. This time, he collaborated with the up and coming talent of Pete Davidson who is most notably famous for his stint on SNL for the past five years. Pete Davidson is fresh off of the success of Big Time Adolescence, a Hulu film that showed he has tremendous talent, even if his performances feel very one-aided. There are excellent performances all throughout the film with Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, Steve Buscemi, Maude Apatow, and Bel Powley. The semi-autobiographical story is a strong, genuine, and heartfelt film that shows the struggle and grief that a young adolescent can carry when they lose a parent. This is echoed brilliantly in Maude Apatow's performance who never met her father and was young enough to not be broken by the accident. This is a strong film and something that I would recommend as being worth the $20 to rent."}, {"id": 314, "text": "This was confusing. Performances are solid all around, there's nice, subtle character growth and I actually found myself enjoying a Davidson performance, which I never thought would happen.By all accounts, this should be better than the pretty middling affair it is.It's reported at 137 minutes but I would've swore it was 6 hours. I think that's the biggest problem, the people behind the camera lacked discipline. This thing is a bloated, meandering and overindulgent snooze ride that doesn't really go anywhere. Everyone's solid in front of the camera, so I don't necessarily mind seeing them but around 2/3 of the way through I just wanted it to be done.There's no big revelations, no climactic moments, no grand finale. Stuff just keeps happening until it stops. It'sa nice exploration of a man's life and it shows his journey, it just doesn't make for overly compelling narrative as it's presented.I feel like I want to recommend it, but at the same time I can't blame anyone for not wanting to bother. You won't miss anything if you skip it, can't say you'll gain much if you watch it, which I suppose is the issue. It feels like something should be here and it's just not.

The last 30 minutes become really enjoyable as Scott Carlin finally sees some character progression for the better, as well as concluding with a suitably uplifting tone.Cons: 1. Pete Davidson's performance is inconsistent, as at times it feels like he's forcing the intimate emotions. He's better when acting jovially, or nonchalantly. 2. Some of the comedy feels pointlessly inserted for cheap laughs, which mostly fails anyway. 3. The cinematography is incredibly flat and stale. 4. The plot device which sets up the third act is conveniently and idiotically placed, wherein Ray Bishop and Margie Carlin (Marisa Tomei) openly disparage Scott Carlin in front of him. 5. The relationship between Scott Carlin and Kelsey (Bel Powley) is boring, poorly developed, and takes up far too much screen-time. 6. The cameo of Machine Gun Kelly (Tattoo Shop Owner) is massively distracting because the entire scene is pointless, and thus it only revolves around shoving him into the film. 7. The character of Scott Carlin is unlikable and uninteresting as he is irresponsible, lazy, and pig-headed for the majority of the movie (1 hour and 40 minutes), and only sees some character progression in the last 30 minutes."}, {"id": 316, "text": "Judd Apatow has a new film out called The King of Staten Island where he collaborated and wrote it along with SNL's Pete Davidson.

He doesn't have anything lined up in his life, even though his dream is to be a tattoo artist. He just hangs out with his friends and drinks and smoke weed. He has a hidden relationship with one of them, Kelsey (The Diary of a Teenage Girl's Bel Powley), that is his childhood friend. When she tries to take it to the next level, he can't handle it and gets anxiety knowing that he has to acknowledge it.This film was well cast making all the characters believable. Apatow is trying to capture something raw and poignant with comedy around it, but it doesn't quite get there, which it should with a runtime of 137 minutes. Pete Davidson's acting is fine, but the film starts out with him driving down a freeway with his eyes closed obviously having suicidal tendencies, but you never see him crying or having a breaking point about his father. That would have given the film grit and substance. It's probably exactly how he has been about the situation his whole life, but since he is playing a fictional character, maybe if it had something more moving, it would be the endearing film that I think Apatow truly wanted to capture. What's wrong with making a drama about depression with some comic relief here and there? But it's quite the opposite and they kept it light. It almost felt like it is an extension of Big Time Adolescence, which Davidson did last year which had more of an emotional tone. Bel Powley added to the humor and was one of the most interesting characters. And Tomei perfectly played opposite of Davidson. - Ken The Critic, CBS Austin"}, {"id": 317, "text": "I was looking forward to this release knowing it was a Judd Apatow pic. We need some laughs and levity in this time. I sat through the first third or so waiting for the funny that never came. The movie had a few chuckles but soon descended into unremitting self pity as the lead character whined and moaned about how hard his life was even though he did absolutely nothing to stop the downfall. His problems were everyone else's to solve. This situation could have been good fodder for humor, but the jokes never came.When Bill Burr appeared I thought 'alright! here we go!' but his talents as a comedian were never utilized and anyone could have played his character.The acting is good, but story lines like the best friends that seemed to be so important to the main character in the beginning are just dropped. Did this a-hole just let his best pals rot and the one friend's cat die? Why put that into the movie if you don't ever mention it again?I found the main character to be a disgusting waste of time through most of the film but in the end was glad just to see him put some effort into something...anything! Of course he had to be practically forced into it.I guess the message is that everyone around you needs to pull you up so that you can have a fruitful life. Not a message I want to see rewarded. We all have troubles - life's hard - but the only way out is to work through it. I don't know why Judd Apatow thought it worth boring and annoying his audience with this guy. Even his family had had enough of him when we meet him.The acting is great from supporting characters, and especially the firehouse guys and Marisa Tormei, but in particular, Bel Powley who is a real bright spark in a fairly bleak movie. Although God knows why she loves this guy.Give this a miss if you think you are getting a comedy, or even a tragicomic film. If you want to see an entire community pull together to help a guy who can't be bothered to put in a modicum of effort into his own life while he pulls the energy out of everyone around him, this is a film for you!"}, {"id": 318, "text": "Some people will describe this basically as a what could have been narrative about Pete Davidson's life if he ended up as an adult stoner with no purpose in life and still living at home.

It can also be dramatic and touching at times. There's also a bit of coming-of-age thrown in there as well.As for the acting, despite what people say about Pete Davidson and his comedy, I actually thought his acting was pretty spot on in this. The lovely Marisa Tomei is excellent as usual and Bill Burr brings quite a few laughs to the table, as well as Steve Buscemi in a small role with one in particular impactful scene that Steve nails.It's definitely far from a perfect movie. The editing could have been done better, some plot holes, and probably 30 minutes too long. On the other hand, it didn't seem to strike a false cord one single time. All of the characters seemed real to life and the actions they took weren't far-fetched or overly dramatic which is a relief to see.Overall, if you enjoy Pete's dark sense of humor combined with Bill Burr's comedy along with a solid supporting cast in addition to a movie that pays tribute to those who gave and still give their lives to save others everyday, then I'd say you'll have a positive and enjoyable experience with this one."}, {"id": 319, "text": "Well, I don't know how to start this, or even from where to start it...

So spectacular, I didn't blink an eye at the outrageously high $20 it cost to rent the movie.I'm a huge Pete Davidson fan, and before viewing the movie, I was inspired by the fact that this fictional movie closely resembled the actual story of Pete Davidson himself. The finished result did a great job taking what was almost an autobiography of Davidson himself, injecting strategic inclusion of metaphoric, encrypted details that put the viewer in the shoes Davidson wears in real life.I believe the intentions and vision of the movie was to take the comedic genre to a new level, being the first dramatic comedy that revolves around an actor that wasn't truly acting. This movie was Pete Davidson, and his performance was his true self.However, I was left disappointed with the end result. The comedy aspect was spot on; I rarely invest time in a comedy that makes me laugh out loud, and this movie left me laughing the whole way through.I felt as if the original vision was robbed of the end result. The movie felt very dry all the way throughout, and the emotional journey I had been convinced I would endeavor was truly disappointing.

It's extremely slow and dry to the level where I almost turned it off about an hour into it.The writing was terrible through the majority of it besides where I could tell Bill Burr gave himself some good jokes.Judd throws some of his family and Pete Davidson's friends into it so they make some money; and while their acting wasn't bad, most of their parts and scenes with them were unnecessary like this entire movie.I thought it was going to be about a drug dealer's rise in Staten Island or something more interesting like that, but it turns out to be Pete Davidson's life story which I felt was boring and didn't need to be told.There might be some kids who have never heard some of these jokes before that find them funny or relate to a main character with so many problems (ADHD, depression, etc), but most of the character's problems are due to himself just like many of the kids who relate. Using a depressant when you're already depressed isn't going to make your life any better. It'll lead to you sitting around on your couch watching cartoons or movies like this. I suggest you watch the cartoons instead since they're funnier and more entertaining.Cue Pursuit of Happiness at the end and roll credits.

Well they clearly lack any sort of self awareness, because this girl is not a good actress. Honestly, someone needs to tell her that she's just not good.3. Other than that the writing and plot construction was abysmal. And they did not effectively utilize the acting skills of Marissa Tomei.4. Bill Burr and Buscemi were pretty good, I enjoy them a lot.

I still like Pete Davidson but I have to be honest here."}, {"id": 325, "text": "The King of Staten Island has Judd Apatow written all over it-witty, warm, affectionate, and wildly eccentric. Scott (Pete Davidson: full bore confessional humor straight from SNL) is a 24-year old arrested-development slacker with a smart mouth, charming smile, and dreams of opening a tattoo restaurant called Ruby Tattuesday's.He lives with his youthful mom, Margie (Marisa Tomei, a go-to Oscar-winning actress for this kind of role). For her he's a blessing and a curse.Although nothing that happens to Scott is ordinary, Apatow makes it Seinfeld believable-nothing into something. While Scott rebels against just about everything, he displays a big heart (see him walk the kids to school) and rapidly fires off some humorous lines.Smoking weed in his basement with stoner buddies (Ricky Velez and Moises Arias are especially funny) is typical low-brow Apatow humor. They may be lines not as memorable as in Knocked Up but still warmly funny. Because Davidson co-wrote the script, it has a real-life energy and melancholic tone influenced by the death of his fireman dad.The plot energizes with the arrival of his mom's new boyfriend, Ray (Bill Burr), who is as mouthy and loving as Scott and reminiscent of Scott's deceased dad. That Davidson's real-life FDNY dad gave his life in a 9/11 rescue only adds to the authentic feel for an almost self-parody. The arc of Scott and Ray's relationship can be seen long before the denouement, resisting formula through the talents of the actors to make the characters fresh and likeable.Because many of those around Scott are, like him, out of alignment with where other white guys are fast heading, Apatow captures a sweet longing for the characters to belong even if their humor is better when they are outlaws. In a pandemic when the audience's developments are arrested, it's nice to view The King of Staten Island as everyone's story as well, only with more laughs.On Prime"}, {"id": 326, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Judd Apatow has directed/produced some hilarious pieces of cinema: Trainwreck, Bridesmaids, Superbad, Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin... He's got quite the filmography, there's no way of denying it. Therefore, his name alone is enough to grab my attention when a comedy co-written and directed by him comes along. Add Pete Davidson as a co-writer and the main star, plus a really fascinating cast with Marisa Tomei and Bill Burr, and I'm definitely interested. The King of Staten Island holds a formulaic premise (the whole dead parent entails a bad kid who needs to learn how to be a better person has been done to exhaustion), but is it able to elevate it in some way?First of all, the dark humor really works for me. For anyone who doesn't appreciate this type of comedy, Apatow's film might be too excessive. Tons of unrestrained jokes about the most sensitive subjects, and characters with no limits to where they can go with their wicked sense of humor. So, if you're not a fan of dark comedy, this movie might turn out to be a very unpleasant experience. However, if you have no issues with laughing at a bad joke, this comedy might just work well enough for you to have a good time. I had really good laughs.Scott takes the bad kid who does bad stuff to a quite terrible (and sometimes illegal) level. He possesses all kinds of psychological issues that you can think of plus some more. He says the most depressing, sad, offensive things to anyone that crosses his path. Pete Davidson absolutely shines in this role, it really feels like he's having an outstanding amount of fun. However, his character goes through such an overlong and exaggerated route that I could neither relate to nor feel sorry for him. This will make or break the film for any viewer: your emotional connection with the protagonist.As I said in the beginning, the narrative follows a pretty cliche story that people have seen thousands of times. So, from the get-go, it's fairly easy to understand where the movie is going, what's going to change within the characters, and how it's going to end. Screenplay surprises don't come often in this genre, and even when they do, very rarely, they're able to impact the audience in a way that completely changes our perspective on the film or its characters. The King of Staten Island is a movie that tells its viewers everything they need to know in the first ten to fifteen minutes, and then there's nothing remotely new throughout.It's just way too long. A bit over two hours seeing someone trying to figure out what he's going to do with his life is not exactly the best entertainment ever. There's more than one way to try to relate to Pete Davidson's character, but I really needed to dig deep to find one. As people probably know, Davidson's father was also a firefighter who died in the 9/11 attacks, and this film clearly takes inspiration from Davidson's life. It's not his biography, but he definitely puts a lot of his own personal issues into Scott's personality. Some people even state that he's just portraying himself, and that's not that far from the truth.In my opinion, the best aspect of the movie is undoubtedly the incredibly realistic dialogues. It genuinely feels like the characters are having real conversations. The editing is so impeccable that I forgot I was watching a film for a couple of moments. The chemistry between every member of the cast is so vibrant that every single dialogue between any two characters always feels extremely lifelike. Marisa Tomei and Bill Burr are astonishing, they truly are. I wish more time was given to develop a bit more of Bel Powley's personal subplot, but I understand that she's far from being one of the most relevant characters.In the end, The King of Staten Island employs a very well-known (and a bit overused) formula that goes on for way too long, but Judd Apatow balances it with a hilariously dark sense of humor, with the help of his co-writers, Pete Davidson and Dave Sirus. Most of the comedy really works, which helped to get through the least entertaining (and predictable) portions of the narrative. Davidson shines in a role that many addressed as he's just playing himself, but I find him incredibly engaging and captivating to watch, even though I can't quite relate to his character. The emotional attachment to the protagonist is the major component that's either going to make you love this flick or spend a couple of hours just watching someone trying to figure out what to do with his life. The realistic dialogues (elevated by perfect editing) and the cast's phenomenal chemistry just tip the scale to the positive side. I definitely recommend it, but with the small warning that if you're not a fan of dark comedy, then it's better to skip this one.Rating: B-"}, {"id": 327, "text": "Knock-knock! Who's there? Not your dad!The first act of the movie honestly was a real slog to get through. I doubted whether I should bother to finish the film especially considering the runtime looked intimidating for its tone. It didn't help that it wasn't particularly funny either. Worst still, it wasn't for lack of trying. Most of the jokes just didn't land, which became a worrying trend throughout the movie. However, once the first act was over, I realised there was something more to this movie. The characters started taking center stage. An important transition that allowed the film's more mature moments. It's then that the movie became gripping, soulful in a way and gave it heart. It's where you can really experience King of Staten Island's core, and where some of the comedy started to flow naturally too. Which really leads me to believe the film should've fully committed itself to its character driven narrative right from the get-go and allowed its comedy to come second.Extra Note: The music was pretty hit or miss with me too"}, {"id": 328, "text": "I absolutely love Pete Davidson and Judd Apatow's,  The King Of Staten Island. I honestly didn't know what to expect, but I did find myself laughing out loud throughout the movie. Yes, there's a few poignant moments, but the film never gets too maudlin. I'm sure they did their best not to get too syrupy. Although, this real life meets art presentation must have been great therapy for Pete Davidson. I've always enjoyed him on SNL, but you just can't help but love the guy here. Seriously, this is a wonderful, well-written dramedy. I wouldn't be surprised if Marisa Tomei gets another supporting actress Oscar nomination. She is adorable in this film.. she's perfect as Pete's mom. Pamela Adlon, popping up in a couple of scenes was a nice surprise too! Bill Burr's strong performance is deserving of a special mention too. The movie gives plenty of room for his character to grown on you. In fact, there's of great performances throughout the entire film. Moises Arias is instantly lovable...as is Steve Buscemi.

Scott is a troubled adolescent man child who's only motivation is to become a tatoo artist. He lives on the island with his Mother Margi played by the delightful Marisa Tomei in another excellent performance. Scott's Sister Claire leaves home to go to College and Margi gets romantically involved with a homeless Firefighter Ray Bishop(Bill Burr) . Scott who is still feeling and dealing with grief at the loss of his Firefighter Father killed in action while fighting a fire feels abandoned and this leads to more rebellious behaviour. This film is semi autobiographical because Pete Davidson who plays our main character Scott also tragically lost his father Scott Davidson a firefighter who died in the line of duty. The story is based in-part on Pete Davidson's life, depicting what it might have been like if he had not become a comedian. Pete's father Scott Davidson's unit, Ladder Company 118 in Brooklyn Heights, responded to the call to the World Trade Center after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. They were rescuing people in the Marriott World Trade Center Hotel when the tower collapsed on the building. Pete was seven years old. The role of Grandpa is played by Pete Davidson's grandfather, Stephen Davidson. The other link to a FireFighter in this movie I was surprised to read is Actor Steve Buscemi in a supporting role as Papa . Steve Buscemi was a New York City firefighter before becoming an actor. In November 2000, Buscemi told Salon interviewer Stephen Lemons that he was with Engine 55 in Manhattan's Little Italy for four years in the early 1980s. He took acting classes after about a year on the job, and stayed with the FDNY while acting in plays and movies. Buscemi quit firefighting in 1984 to pursue acting full-time. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, he returned to his old fire station to help search for survivors in the rubble of the World Trade Center. Steve Buscemi has some good scenes in this film as he helps Scott gain more confidence and convinces the other Firefighters that he shows promise and helps him find a community and learn more about his Dad. It's a good script written by Pete Davidson, Judd Apato ,who also directed the film and Dave Sirus and I really enjoyed it."}, {"id": 330, "text": "The King of Staten Island (5 out of 5 stars).The King of Staten Island is a great comedy drama film.

I feel that the reason for this, unfortunately, is because Hollywood and casual viewers have been brainwashed by decades of how a movie must be formatted. I don't want another neatly packaged, happy, unrealistic swamp monster...This movie was damn good. I never felt i was losing the plot because, in the best way possible, there really isn't one. Its a story with many sub-plots and quite simply, a linear story with insight into FDNY (or all FD) culture, what it is to be a Man, strong Woman, black/white... and like most movies with top comedians, the idea that gender and race roles really have no impact on our daily lives.I am totally fine with The extra run time; it really added to the fun.

The performances by Marisa Tomei (almost in the focus of the movie) and Steve Buscemi (very short though it may be) are amazing.I might have missed some subtle details as I am not a New Yorker, and I am sure people will be poing them out.It is an ordinary story of everyday people on Earth who happen to reside in Staten Island.Having watched this, you will either love it or hate it.Possible Oscar nominations for: Best actress in a supporting role (Tomei); Best actor in a supporting role (Buscemi); Best original screenplay; Best editing; Best cinematography.Editing &amp; adding: I am going to watch it again for Bill Burr!"}, {"id": 333, "text": "He is my new favourite , because like buster keaton did, he has it in the eyes, and wouldve been a star like lloyd, keaton and chaplin in the slapstick silent movie era...just a hint for future products.in addition to that he has a cataclysmal verbalistic talent, along with loads of the others in the large main cast, and thats newage comedy, usually i dont like that linguistic workout in comedies, but this was a nice exception.its also about a man with a set of bad genes in the mental framework, and it has a load of ad/hd in its demeanors. ad the group dynamics of weed puffing group of friends you are really in for a yum yum.the only drawback to this flick is the ver long playtime, not that it isnt nescesarry, but it can be tiring at the late night attendance. but the rest 90 % of the film are just a race over the life of a man on staten island n.y., its filled with surprise and a lot of laughter, for some even tears.so the grumpy old man had a good time, you wont regret a view, and mr davidson will be on my notepad for the years to come. a big recommend"}, {"id": 334, "text": "The King of Staten Island has some issues, mostly having to do with tonality. The film is classified as a comedy but it delves into some very serious human issues, and every so often the acting goes from serious to comedic. I think the humor was great in this film, I laughed numerous times but the humor should be introduced when it should and not moments after a street fight for example.Thank goodness it barely happens in the film but it does from time to time and it feels like the film has two separate tones to it. Minor gripes aside, the script was fantastic. It's heartfelt and very human. I loved this film more because I was raised on Staten Island and still live here and that many moments of the film reminded me of when I was in my 20s, living a similar life to this movie's protagonist. Despite my bias, it's a film that everyone seems to be enjoying and I'm glad! I hope Pete Davidson gets the career he deserves. He's a natural.

Every Judd Apatow movie I watch there's this sweet spot I hit where I'm in absolute love with it, but then I realize there's still 45 minutes left and I'm scratching my head on why he it insists for things to keep going. That's really the only negative thing I can say about this movie otherwise I honestly loved it. I feel how personal this story is to Pete Davidson and he gives such a real and genuine performance that doesn't feel sappy but doesn't feel fake either. When we deal with grief, we look to the things that help articulate our feelings and for me that's looking to art, this spoke to me on that level really profoundly. Davidson has a really dark sense of humor but you realize that's how he copes with tragedy and I really respect him for that. This movie was genuinely heartfelt, funny, and human. Even if the plot wasn't moving fast, I felt engaged strictly based on the character interactions and that's worth a praise in my book. Apatow knows how to write people and make them feel real so that's very present here, but man just edit the films down a tad, there's no reason for his movies to go above 2 hours, not for me at least. The King of Staten Island is a true reminder of what it means to cope with grief, pursue what you love, and find the good moments in the little things, it's absolutely one of my favorite movies of the year so far, even if it runs a little overlong in length. 8/10."}, {"id": 337, "text": "The King of Staten Island - B+ (Memorable)I'll be honest, I wasn't keen on watching Pete Davidson being King of anything maybe due to media's attention to his private life. I find the guy funny but more lost and feel lots of SNL and Standup stuff above average but not memorable. I am glad to see that I was proven wrong as it's not a piece glorifying drugs or recreational marijuana usage. The movie dealt with being a guy whose is lost, weird and has no direction per societal standards but still is a Human. He doesn't hurt people purposely and tries to be perfect but unfortunately not considered normal as the choices he makes is not being committed to social norms of perfection like education, house, girlfriend etc etc etc.Pete Davidson is pleasant to watch, he is not only playing himself but makes you understand that guys who don't want normal stuff may have issues but it doesn't make them Heartless they do deserve chance and understanding from family, friends and society. Talk about perfect casting is Marissa Tomei and Bill Burr as they bring the perfect humour and care to the story. The scene Pete goes back to Marissa his mom that he learned his lesson after cleaning and cooking for firies was hilarious, how moms do this day after day but rarely gets acknowledgement.The only thing I think movie would have benefited from making it under 2HRS, as it felt bit long maybe due to being on VOD directors can go with their cut instead of theatre.

So, knowing what I know about his brand of comedy, I was expecting to be entertained; if also a little weirded out. I'm pleased to say, I found this to be even better than I had expected. The trailer paints Staten Island as a quirky/sentimental dramedy, which I think is a totally refreshing light for Pete Davidson. He's kind of kooky, foul-mouthed and inappropriate, but he's got heart, and he brings his own personal history to this movie. King of Staten Island is R rated, and has that casual indie vibe, but I would've expected a lot more graphic content here, given the fact it's a Judd Apatow project. Instead, we are treated to a good helping of sincerity, and soul: a beautiful surprise.I fully expect Pete Davidson to book some more major roles now; after this truly affecting gem!"}, {"id": 339, "text": "This film hit demand last week and I have now had the chance to watch The King Of Staten Island and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees A 24 year old weed smoker Tatooist with no ambition have to face his grief and try and make a step forward in his future. Main Character I feel that Pete Davidson is one of those people that comes across as either a love or hate mentality and honestly I find him really funny and I thought he really worked for this film. Yes he basically plays himself, but I found him really interesting here and I felt plenty of sympathy for him as a character. I like his dark humour here and it is clearly seen as a defence mechanism which just adds to his performance and character. Supporting Characters Marisa Tomei plays his mother in the film and she is fantastic, the chemistry the two of them have together is really good and I actually felt a bond between these two as in they were believable as mother and son. She is such an important part of his life and so nice that you see Davidson's point of view and want to just see her go the film and be happy. Bill Burr plays her love interest and he is awesome here too, he has great chemistry with Tomei and they just have a really nice relationship here and you want to see everything work out. His dynamic with Davidson is also a real highlight and does a great job of pushing both of their story arcs. Steve Buscemi has a smaller role here and he does a really good job in the role adding quality to his character. Story The story of trying to see Davidson's character trying to get his life together is the driving force of this film. You do sympathise with him and you really want to see him get his life started and turned around and that is the real highlight here. However, this film's first act takes a bit to get going and tehre are some parts of the story that aren't concluded and feel open ended with a bit of an abrupt ending to boot. Script The script is really good, there is just fun dialogue. Not a lot of really funny moments but this film is consistently chuckle worthy and that is enough to get you through easily. Plus there is a suprisingly large amount of heart and drama here that rises this above a pretty generic comedy that they make plenty of. Style The film just looks really cool, it has a fun style mixed with some really tension filled moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat. However, this film is way too long, it could easily have had 20/30 mins chopped off and it would have been paced perfectly but it just ends up dragging at times. Overall Overall, this is a great suprise for me and is easily a great film to watch. If you are looking for a fun comedy with a bit of heart to it then The King Of Staten Island is worth a watch."}, {"id": 340, "text": "SYNOPSIS: Scott (Pete Davidson) is a 24-year old living at home having trouble figuring out what he wants to do in life other than sit comfortable and smoke weed. After his mom starts dating Ray (Bill Burr), Scott is forced to start figuring out his life.REVIEW: I knew that I was going to like this movie due to it being Pete Davidson and honestly it felt like something he really needed to get out. A film for himself to vent. If you know Pete Davidson, you know he's had his fair share of mental struggles and it was clear he was lost for a while. This gives fans like myself a look into how his life was and what he struggled with. As far as aspects of the film, I'm not so sure why there was a choice to change the story of how his father died, maybe it wouldn't have meshed well with the rest of the film (which then I'd totally agree with the change) or maybe because 9/11 is a touchy subject. That could've been a decision on Universal's part, I'm not sure. I thought the acting was really good. Obviously, from Marisa Tomei, but I was really surprised with how well Bill Burr did. I thought he played the role as Ray, perfectly. Then you had some smaller roles like Bel Powley as Kelsey and Maude Apatow as Claire who had very wonderful performances. It's funny, however, that for some reason I feel like Pete Davidson... didn't act too well. Crazy to think since he was literally playing himself and so it's quite possible that it was a perfect performance, but some notions just didn't seem genuine. Maybe that's exactly how he is and if that's how he is in private than he was spectacular. He did give a good representation that he may not always know where he's going in life, but he truly has a kind heart and it's a very passionate person.

Since I first discovered him on SNL, I have always been a fan of Pete Davidson's work as well as his standup, and seeing him act in this film- along with his other great coming of age story this year Big Time Adolescence truly shows how talented of a performer he can be. Not only is he funny and sweet throughout, but he provides a very clear view of growing up, letting go, and the emotions that come with it. I also enjoyed Bill Burr's performance as Ray Bishop, as well as several other performances, although none quite stick out as much as Davidson. The film is long, but that isn't to say its boring in anyway, it has its slower moments about 2/3 of the way through, but for the most part I was rather entertained and delightfully amused at how funny this film was, as well as how grounded the story was in general. What I like about Apatow's direction in this, similarly to the likes of his other film Knocked Up, is that he takes somewhat absurd situations and provides a platform for them to be realistic and grounded, which I feel is very important in any film, especially a comedy today.

This one's about a 24-year-old weed-smoking, conventionally good-for-nothing manchild named Scott (played by SNL's Pete Davidson, who's also co-writer). All he does is chill with his mates, smoke pot, play games, and conduct tattooing experiments on his friends.That opening scene was a major curveball though - I was thinking this is Apatow trying to tackle the much-talked-about subject of depression. But, in a matter of minutes, we get to Apatow's familiar playground. The dialogues are almost always the best thing about his movies, and The King of Staten Island is yet another example in that regard. It's filled with authentic, self-deprecating, situational humor that keeps things engaging even with a runtime of 137 minutes.Scott, a semi-biographical version of Davidson himself, throws the harshest comebacks every single time he's cornered, like it's the only skill he's got, apart from creating art with his tattoos. He is surrounded by many equally well-written characters such as his widowed mom (a stupendous Marisa Tomei), her new boyfriend (Bill Burr, who gets a meaty role and makes good of it), his friend-with-benefits Kelsey (Bel Powley, who steals every scene that she's in), and a mentor-of-sorts in Papa (the ever-reliable Steve Buscemi). While it's Scott's issues that form the centerpiece of the film, it's also about how all these characters are affected by his presence around them, at various points.And needless to say, Apatow uses his films to offer fascinating social commentary. He takes a dig at nepotism, makes an old-timer exclaim that reputed colleges nurtured people like Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, and Ted Bundy but college is also where youngsters have the 'time of their lives'. Heck, there's even a Jay-Z joke that'll make you more than just chuckle. Along with that opening scene, there's also a bizarre, out-of-place robbery scene that clashes tonally with the rest of the film. Disregard these minor problems and you have one of the finest loser learns to live life films out there that I'd love to see a sequel to, sometime in the future.

It's his bruised charisma that compensates for the frustrations of pace.It has heart. Bucketfulls of it.

It's definitely interesting to learn a little backstory on Davidson, and understand him a bit more. cons: it's definitely not a laugh fest, in fact it is probably one of Apatow's least funny movies.Cast - 7/10 pros: Davidson is surprisingly good in this. I've always felt he was the type of comedian that tried just a little too hard, but Apatow definitely reigned him in and he provided some surprisingly touching moments in this film. Tomei continuing to embrace the second half of her career does well in the mom role, and Bill Burr turns from actor that you know his face into an actor that deserves you to know him by name as well. cons: there's some nepotism with Maude Apatow playing Davidson's sister.Direction - 7.5/10 pros: This is probably Apatow's best work as a director. It almost appears as though he takes a step back as this film in a lot of ways feels more like a first time director lower budget indie movie type thing, but that more raw authentic feel to this movie goes a long way in grounding such a huge personality like Davidson. Apatow is unafraid to linger in a moment or extend a beat to make it feel real, maybe something in the past he has shied away from going for the quick entertainment instead. cons: maybe I was expecting a little more comedy and was surprised by what the movie actually was, not sure that's a negative just more of a preconception that took me a second to get used to.Pace - 7/10 pros: the movie is rather long, but never felt like it was plodding along. Apatow extends moments and really grounds the movie into a very powerful truth that seemed real and authentic. For normally such a comedic duo (Apatow/Davidson) you might expect fast paced jokes stacked on top of each other, but instead Apatow takes his time and lets moments and environments live out and thereby creates a very believable and heartfelt world. cons: it is a long movie coming in at 2 hours and 16 minutes, but for the most part earns that time or the story needed it.Atmosphere - 7/10 pros: everything felt incredibly authentic and genuine to this movie. You totally believed the small town feel and people that lived in it. The camera work was simple but appropriate and allowed performances to come to life. The sets, costumes, and decor all seemed perfectly authentic and in place and helped ground the world. cons: the world felt a little small, but that is also what the story called for and needed.Overall 7 out of 10, worth the rental price but not an all time classic rewatch."}, {"id": 347, "text": "Having seen Judd Apatow's previous directed films and knowing his type of comedic humor, and after seeing the trailer of this film, had somewhat an expectation as what to expect.The King of Staten Island is quite apparently a semi autobiographical film about the upcomings of Pete Davidson's life. With that in mind, it was expected as he would deliver a great performance as this film may have a deep meaning to him.With an original intended theatrical release, this film was unfortunately slated to straight to streaming. Perhaps they could have waited several months later to release this in theaters- as it would have don't more justice.As a film, very solid doses of comedy and drama which Apatow is always great at. There are many light hearted funny scenes, but also sad and touching scenes. There is a good balance. And as a story there are enough little subplots to keep engaged all the way though start to finish.This is the film which may be responsible for Pete Davidson becoming a star, although with its limited release the question still remains. Perhaps in 2-3 years from now we will have our answer."}, {"id": 348, "text": "If you have money, why would you ever live in Staten Island?Not gonna lie, I wasn't sure if a movie starring Pete Davidson would be any good. I like him enough on SNL but he never seemed like leading man material to me. But who else could they have got to play, what is basically, a version of Pete Davidson? He's really exceptional in a movie that squeezes you in the feels and is awkwardly relatable on several levels.Davidson helped put this together, it's based on his own life. He seems like a goofball, and he is, but he makes you really care as well. Bill Burr is so good as the fireman dating his widowed mother, his best role yet. You get a bit of his stand up mixed with F Is For Family in this character. Marisa Tomei as the mother is believable and genuine. Director and co-writer, Judd Apatow, has combined all this and more to make a memorable dramedy that deserves to be seen, let's hope it reaches an audience in this strange year for new movies."}, {"id": 349, "text": "The King Of Staten Island is so raw and real, I feel like I grew up with these characters. And I'm not even from Staten Island.Maybe because the story is inspired by Pete Davidson's life-or maybe it's just the superior screenplay-but all the characters live and breathe and do sweet, random funny things that made me laugh out loud nearly every minute. Marisa Tomei and Davidson are outstanding. It's another iconic portrayal by Tomei.Davidson distinguishes himself as the voice of a generation with a new take on the loveable druggy loser character that we all know (or are). There's a lot of subtlety and avoidance of obvious turns here that hooked me right in.Bill Burr shines too. Even though I wanted to punch his character, I ended up rooting for him... and his kids and ex-wife too. Brilliant. Then, mid-movie the film morphs into a Steve Buscemi/firefighter flick and somehow, I loved that too!Bottom line: if you are looking for har dee har type throwaway laughs, this isn't for you. If you are looking for a great film with great characters and funny moments that stick with you after its done, The King Of Staten Island is the loveable underdog you want to be friends with."}], "reviews_amount": 350}
