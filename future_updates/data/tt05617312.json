I'm still a bit confused how the kid died but don't care enough to watch it again."}, {"id": 2, "text": "It's annoying when film makers think we won't notice fake plastic babies and cushions imitating pregnancies... but they still pull these stunts thinking we're too dumb to notice! This effort is no different.The story is a convoluted mess, the twins can't act and the characters are just ridiculous and do ridiculous things.Apart from a couple of nice shots of the bay, there's nothing else to watch."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Horrible acting (not a surprise in Kurilenko's case, but WTF, Brian Cox?), disjointed narrative, ridiculous scenes...avoid it at all cost!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "This is a drama driven film that delves deep in a seemingly happily married woman's life that endure some hardship...It is not the type of film I normally watch so struggled to relate or sympathise with the 2 antagonists. The female lead descends into a mental break down and the last 15 minutes included a plot twist to make her more sympathetic.I found this film to be very long and I just wanted it to end. The storyline grinded me in a bad way and thus made me disconnected from the 2 leads. It is like an extended soap opera set in the country side and fails to win me over..."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I have never reviewed a movie before, but this movie infuriated me so much, I decided I needed to. This is single-handedly the most awkward, contrived film I have seen in 22 years on this planet. From the forced, uncomfortable dialogue, to the non-sensical storyline, not a single thing, with the exception of the acting, is redeemable about this movie. The plot makes zero sense while trying to be 5 different things at the same time. It introduces storylines that have no bearing on the story and ultimately have no resolution and no explanation. From introducing a secret-dead twin subplot for the first 20-30 minutes of the movie, that is then effectively dropped with no more explanation on it, to having a pointless the nanny must have done it subplot for another 20 minutes and some change, this film does absolutely nothing correctly. Any subject matter it tries to handle, it utterly fumbles and fails to do any sort of justice to any of the characters. From the opening line of the movie, which YES was Shhhh we're in the bay of silence to the closing line of the movie, which yes was also shhh we're in the bay of silence not a single good decision by the director, screenwriter or editor was made. ultimately one of the biggest travesties in film making I have ever witnessed. An utter waste of talent. 0/10 would not recommend, would recommend driving your car off a cliff before I ever recommend this movie to anyone."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I find the plot engaging at first, but towards the middle I got really confused. The plot twists too much, and some characters are not introduced properly."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Intense and gripping, this psychological thriller fills in the right tones in its Gothic stylish narrative. A mind bending puzzle involving murderous twists and a mysterious cult."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This was as mysterious a thriller as I have seen this year. Keeps you involved and wanting more with its unique combination of music, photography and script it is hard to describe as there are not many films that can conjure up the atmosphere that this director has with a seemingly straightforward script yet make it into the most mysterious of mysteries that will keep you guessing and actually wondering what the heck am I actually watching; from the scene in the french house on the edge of the cliff to the buried baby it was most original and stylish of the year so far and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to the very finish - A solid 7/10!"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Yes it seemed a bit disjointed but it's explained, if you don't manage to work it out. Sensitive subject but it eventually becomes obvious. Strangely filmed in Gateshead, not the most exotic location with a bit of Europe thrown in \ud83d\ude01"}, {"id": 10, "text": "A very good story, a promising start then turns to a huge disappointment with bad direction, poor cinematography and cheesy acting."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I don't know why this movie has such a low rating.The story is engaging and the acting is superb from all the cast, including the kids.Probably not a movie for you if you have the attention span of a flea, it is one you need to actually watch to get the experience from it."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I loved this film!! It kept me on the edge of my seat!! Well written, awesome actors. Claes Bang is such a strong actor, amazing in this movie!!! I was entertained from beginning to end !! I've watched it 3 times!!"}, {"id": 13, "text": "A protogonist's wife suddenly become a crazy and killed their own son.And he try to find the truth behind her.. Not worthable movie..."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Do not watch this film everything does not make sense."}, {"id": 15, "text": "The beginning is very promising, but then the movie turns to be not good. Twisted but stupid. Olga looks beautiful."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Superb acting on the part of Claes Bang and Brian Cox in particular carries this gripping, if harrowing drama. Bang in particular carries the film in his very fine performance. Worth watching, but be forewarned that the film does feature some very harrowing scenes involving the death of an infant. Again, I can't praise Claes Bang highly enough. He is the anchor that holds a very tricky drama together."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Though story seems suspense and thriller, it only last till climax . At the end we discover a meaningless past suspense and all fearful situations turned in right place within last 10 minutes. Wow ! Then what is about our 1 and over hour watching for a good suspense? Reveling at end.is Hopeless and make movie lower ratings. One thing is notable that Olga Kurylenkoy is just looking charming and slim young beauty like a new actress while she did many movies before. Movie is worth to watch her."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Excellent cast. Enjoyed the movie from beginning to end."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This film start with a girl running away, and the introduction of a couple(Will and Rosalind) scene! As turnout, this film is about Rosalind having depression after rape by Milton, and eventually Milton's crime been expose by Pierre! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the capture photo scene, overuse of the eating medicine scene, overuse of the blackout scene, overuse of the dreaming scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching things scene, and overuse of the driving scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Rosalind shot at Milton at the end of the film! At the end, Milton die alongside the photo of Rosalind! That's it! Wasting time to watch!"}, {"id": 20, "text": "This was an absolute outstanding drama thriller, Cleas Bang as Will was an outstanding choice in actor, Brian Cox nailed it as he always does, I was blown away from the story.."}, {"id": 21, "text": "It is not confusing or sophisticated, like some reviewers noticed...It is morose, empty, veeeeeery slow...nothing burger. Really. Don't waste your time - it wan't entertain you in any possible way."}, {"id": 22, "text": "I lasted 20 minutes and believe me that was an endurance. Nothing makes sense, no acts like these weird creepy people. Probably one of the worst films I've half seen. Avoid"}, {"id": 23, "text": "Same dull British accent which gives a monotone performance like in so many British films lately. Why do we keep churning out films like this that are not worth wasting time over."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Olga Kurylenko, having been in the film industry for such a long time, did not learn acting for the same reason that penguins did not learn to fly. Penguins cannot fly due to their nature. Olga Kurylenko cannot play because she is a cover model. The ''movie'' is so bad, that sometimes it seems that I would rather listen to an aspiring drummer for an hour and a half with an aspiring violinist, than watching this.Another disappointment 2020."}, {"id": 25, "text": "The plot of this movie makes absolutely no sense at all its so all over the place it frustrates me so much. Please don't waste your time!"}, {"id": 26, "text": "I enjoyed this film. Great cast and Claes Band is a brilliant actor in all I've seen him in.

I actually enjoyed the film and thought it was well acted."}, {"id": 28, "text": "This film has received a lot of negative reviews but when you consider the details of the plot line (schizophrenic medication/secrecy and deception etc.) This film draws the viewer into that world. The director does a fantastic job of replicating the on screen situations onto the viewing audience. Try it"}, {"id": 29, "text": "The idea behind this film is good. It's starts off promising. But I disagree with the husbands response to her actions and find the majority of characters disagreeable. The only people that you come out of the film liking is Pierre and the baby!Really disappointing"}, {"id": 30, "text": "Basically a story of a schizophrenic lady wrapped up in multiple unbelievable events."}], "reviews_amount": 31}
