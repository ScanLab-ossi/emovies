It was interesting to find some facts about the city, religious rituals. Racial problem. In one episode the black man even in Mecca suffers because of his color in Mecca in the tent of his countrymen, therefore he decides to leave it. Also it was interesting to see satellite photos, religious Western paintings associated with famous religious figures associated with Mecca, also comments by the religious which were used in this movie."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Very disappointing by National Geographic, very low quality from all perspectives as a movie. can't you at least choose a music that is more related to the context? why in such a crowded context we hear only the voice of 3 people? can't you reflect and give more time to the event as a total? you are calling the movie Inside Mecca, so reflect it all and not only the personal story of 3 people. it's also obvious you brought all the negative connotations in Mecca and emphasized them. did you make the movie to criticize the whole thing? then why not telling it clearly and name the movie something like errors of hajj?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q_LcqbvKI This short film in the link, made by a normal person using a home video camera reflect it to me better that National Geographic, congratulations!!!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "As I watched this documentary, I was struck by how difficult it must have been to make this film. After all, the religious authorities in Mecca would not allow non-Muslims to film there and I am pretty sure there must have been TONS of logistical difficulties getting this thing made. So, I really appreciate all the hard work that went into making this one.This film is about the Hajj--the Islamic pilgrimage that Muslims do in Mecca each year. However, before arriving in this Arabian city, the film begins in three different countries--and follows three different believers (from the US, South Africa and Malaysia) throughout their journey. As the journey progresses, the narrator does an excellent job of explaining each step and its significance. Overall, a one of a kind experience--one that is really well made and fascinating throughout. A must for anyone--not just if they are Muslim."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The National Geographic documentary Inside Mecca follows three pilgrims from Malaysia, South Africa, and the United States on their sacred journey to Mecca for the Hajj. Overall this film is very informative, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the rituals practiced in the Islam.Before watching the documentary I had little education and experience with the religion Islam. I knew that one of the five pillars of Islam was the hajj and it is required of all who can manage it, however I didn't understand the complicity this pillar embodied. What amazed me was how challenging yet personal the hajj journey is. In fact while watching this film, you feel somewhat connected to the three totally different lives of the Muslims being followed. In fact, you even get a sense of the claustrophobic feel experience during their pilgrimage.The contrast between the three lives followed shows how personal this journey is. Although the ultimate goal of the Hajj is the same (honoring the covenant), each non-traditional Muslim experienced the five-day quest for salvation differently. For example, not only is trekking through the hot deserts long and tiring, but having to deal with discrimination on arrival due to ethnicity and looks was another struggle both Fidelma and Khalil handled. Overall however this journey is about personal faith. Everyone is there for the same reason, they are all coming from different backgrounds, but they are all equal. This film informed us of the procedure upon entering the holy city. Before entering the holy city, pilgrims undergo a ritual cleansing and declaration of intent to enter ihram, a state of spiritual readiness. All pilgrims dress in simple, uniform attire\u2014two white sheets for men, loose dresses, and head scarves for women. By looking similar and through this process, their goal is to become equal in the eyes of God. My favorite quote states, All races, all nationalities, all people in one place, concentrated, all in one direction worshipping the one God. Overall this personal journey illustrates the immense faith a religion produces."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Islam is one of the largest religions in the world with its followers are spread all over the world. Having an origin of Abrahamic religions, Islamic religion recognizes the existence of the one God. Like most of other religions, there is also a sacred place in Islam. Mecca is considered as the Holy or Sacred city for all Muslims since there is a Kaaba which is considered as a House of God in Islam. The sacredness of the Kaaba for Muslims can be also seen from their religious traditions which they perform during their life. Five times prayer in Islamic religion is performed by facing the direction in Kaaba. Moreover, pilgrims to this sacred place is one of the Five Pillars in this religion. The documentary film Inside Mecca by Anisa Mehdi is based on pilgrimage stories of three Muslim people from different parts of the world in order to demonstrate most of the insights and rituals of Islam. Reenacted story of the rituals during the pilgrimage demonstrates the Abrahamic origin many rituals in the Islam; also, pilgrimage involving a lot of people highlights one of the main insights of this religion that everyone is equal under the God. Most of the rituals which are performed by pilgrims during the hajj reenacts the story of Abraham. It is believed that Islam is one of the Abrahamic religions. The documentary shows several religious rituals during the pilgrimages and connects it to the Abraham's story. First of all, the whole pilgrimage itself is thought to take the origin from pilgrimage of Abraham. It is also believed that the Kaaba was rebuilt by Abraham when he came to Mecca. It is important here to mention that the son of Abraham - Ishmael was sent there with his mother Hagar. Ishmael is believed to be the ancestor of Arabs who received the revelation which give the emergence to Islamic religion by prophet Muhammed. Secondly, Islamic religious rituals like Jumrah, Feast of the Sacrifice reenacts the story of sacrifice of Abraham's own son Isaac (or Ismail). According to this story, Abraham had to sacrifice his son Isaac by the command of God. Ibn Ishaq also mentions this revelation of God to Abraham, where he said: O my son, verily I saw in a dream that I must sacrifice thee. On the ritual Jumrah, the pilgrims have to throw stones to pillar which symbolizes Satan or devil. This stoning ritual reenacts Abraham's story when he threw stones to pillars or devil which were trying to make him refuse the sacrifice of his son. The next ritual of sacrificing sheeps/ or animals also restores this story when the angel stops Abrahams and lets him to sacrifice the sheep instead of his son. The ritual of running Sa'I in search of water is also explained with the story of Hagar and Ismail who were in search of water in the desert. So, it can be seen that most of the rituals performed by Abraham is restored and kept in Islamic religious practices. Another important concept which is emphasized in the movie is that the despite the difference in social status, wealth, nation and even race, everyone is equal before the one God. This concept can be seen at the very start of the pilgrimage when people are preparing for it. In order to do pilgrimage, it is stated that all Muslims need to enter the state of ihram, which is based on the cleansing and clothing which they wear during the pilgrimage and all rituals. In the documentary it is said that very simple state: with two sheets of white clothes to men, and with the coverage of head for women, is required in order to be equal in the House of God. Also, the emphasis is given to the pilgrim from South Africa, Khalil, who experienced racial inequality in his life, believed that this pilgrimage was his chance to see the world without any discrimination. The equality of people can be seen from his words: God doesn't look your face, God doesn't look to a body, God doesn't look whoever you are millionaire or what, God is looking forward your heart. Even though he experiences some difficulties about discrimination, he believes that he should keep his patience and concentrate on the main goal of pilgrimage. In addition, the pilgrimage and the prayer itself are the example of equality. Many Muslims from all parts of the world come to Mecca, all of them, despite their nationality, identity, race, are gathered in one place, with one goal, also, they all face to Kaaba. The illustration of prayer time when everyone, even the workers of shops who were not pilgrims, stopped and prayed can be also attributed to the equality concept in Islamic religion. Lastly, the language which is used in Quran, and in prayer, is the same for every Muslim. The original Arabic language should not be translated since translations will include human judgement. Accordingly, this single language of prayers related all Muslims and can corresponds to equality. Overall, the documentary which is based on the major Islamic traditions and rituals provides many insights and concepts about one of the largest religions in the world. The demonstration of annual pilgrimage highlights the Abrahamic origin of the monotheistic belief, and its relation and influence to the Islam. The important building in Mecca is the Kaaba, which is known as House of God, and the site of Muslim's prayer. The Abrahamic stories which is related to the Islamic rituals illustrated in the stories of Kaaba's construction, in the rituals like Jumrah, making sacrifice, and in pilgrimage itself. Moreover, the belief in equality of every person before the God, in the House of God is also shown as the one of the important religious concepts."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Inside Mecca is a documentary film directed by Anisa Mehdi, who tried to show one of the five pillars of Islam, the spiritual process of a lifetime and sacred pilgrimage of the Muslim people to Mecca known as a hajj. In general, the documentary film has focused on showing the process of pilgrimage of 3 different people from 3 different countries, the difficulties they faced during that time, the way of how the Islam brings the people from different geographical and even social positions together. Of course the main idea probably was to introduce and allow the viewer to look at the process of pilgrimage and the fundamental principles of Islam from different point of views. However, it could be argued that any documentary film or speech regarding the hajj could not fully show the sacred pilgrimage unless someone will not do it by themselves. So this essay will try to show that despite the fact that the film could not fully convey the feeling of doing the sacred pilgrimage, it could give the viewer the idea about the universal principles of Islam, show and be prepared to the difficulties which could be faced during the pilgrimage and help the viewer to look at the hajj from different perspectives. First of all, everything starts from planning, especially if it is one of the most important things in the life of Muslim people - hajj. From the documentary film it can be clearly seen that difficulties could appear even in this stage. For example, one of the main characters was Fidelma O'Leary from Texas, who had to ask written permission from her son or husband in order to be able to go to the Mecca and do the hajj. This could be explained by the fact that women in the Islam are usually considered as a weak segment of a community. It was clearly illustrated in the Major Themes of Quran (p 46), where it was written that Quran aimed at strengthening the weaker segments of the community: the poor, the orphans, women, slaves, those chronically in debt or Men are in charge of women because God has given some humans excellence over others and because men have the liability of expenditure (on women). (p 49). However, by considering Fidelma's situation it could be seen that she has divorced, although she has a son, it was not clarified if he was working and consequently it could be assumed that she is the only breadwinner of the family. Moreover, as it was stated in the Major Themes of Quran as long as women becomes economically sufficient and starts contributing to the household expenses, the male's excellence over the females will be reduced to that extent. As a result, Fidelma has divorced, it was assumed that she is the only person in the family who works and earns the money, so it could be concluded that she has 100 percent contribution to the household expenses. Logically she should be completely independent from male's in her family and be able to travel alone. Hence, it was not clear to the Fidelma to what Islamic rule was based this request from the Saudi government. Another thing that could be seen from the documentary film is the equality of people in the Islam. In the film it could be seen that all Muslims who go to the hajj, should enter the sacred state called ihram. In order to do so, they wear a special clothing, while male's clothing consists of two parts and could leave some parts of the body naked, female's body have to be completely hidden, except their faces and arms. This clothing has to be wore by everyone, it does not matter if he or she is wealthy or poor, is in the high position or just a laborer. Hence it helps people to look identical during the hajj and serves as an equalizer. The idea about the equality is also supported by Rahman in the Major Themes of Quran where it was written that Quran's goal is egalitarian social order, which is generally the idea of equality of all human beings , and that it criticizes the gross socioeconomic disparities that equally rested on and perpetuated a pernicious divisiveness of mankind(p. 38). As a result, despite the fact that in the documentary film there could be found some minor differences in the attitude of the Saudi government to the main characters, it could be concluded that they were equally considered by the Saudi government and more important by other Muslims. To sum up, it could be said that Inside Mecca documentary film have successfully illustrated the universal principles of Islam, the importance of hajj and city of Mecca to the Muslims, the relationship between Muslims from different races/social positions/regions and three different viewpoints from the main characters to the hajj."}, {"id": 6, "text": "As we know, Mecca has been possessing exceptional historical significance for the whole world, not only for the Muslims, as from ancient times it played a substantial role within all the Arabian states. The informative movie Inside Mecca tells us the three pilgrims' personal stories regarding their experience of the holy city's visit in order to do the Hajj, the rituals' series taking place in and around Mecca executed between the eighth and thirteenth days of the Islamic calendar's last month, which must end up with the most important act of the circling around the religion's essential center or as Eliade says, axis mundi, universal pillar connecting and supporting heaven and earth, named Kaaba, which is supposed to be initially built by Adam and then reconstructed by Ibrahim and Ismail. The film introduces us to the various aspects of Islam through such a five-day-long quest testing the pilgrims' body and soul for redemption. In this essay, we are going to analyze what religious tradition the above-mentioned cinema highlights, criticizes, and explains as well as whether it does do effectively or rather not. First of all, the movie shows us the interviewers' lives with different social classes, jobs, interests, and overall mentality, originating from the distinct countries that nevertheless realized the religion's truth to such a degree that they decided to perform the fifth of the main Islamic pillars along with the creed Shahada, fasting Siyam, alms Zakah and mandatory prayers Namaz. The divorced mother of two and at the same time neuroscience's professor Fidelma O'Leary from America, diligent and successful Malaysian businessman Ismail Mahbob, South African preacher and radio host Khalil Mandhlazi will trace the Prophet's footsteps in the place called the celestial house of God Himself revealing the faith's depths and facing other convinced believers as they are. Moreover, it reveals to the watchers the history of both the Hajj and the location where it is always carried out, including even the pre-Islamic period. Besides that, the emphasis is made on the difficulties with logistics part for the foreigners, comprising of the specifics of the flight, bus travel and eventual long walking under uneasy circumstances of heat, constant prayers, sleep's deprivation so that the extreme patience, solid moral principles, and persistence are needed to accomplish the rite. Kaaba itself is represented as a large building with a cube's shape and where all the Muslim prayers should be directed to. Obviously, its value for the worshippers is inexpressible, because it symbolizes the region where Islam emerged. Furthermore, since attending Mecca and Kaaba, in particular, to pray thoroughly is the third best thing after the strong belief in Allah and His Prophet and constant fight on His way a believer could do as a Fard, referring to the obligations sent by God, it is not a surprise that a lot of Muslims tend to get to there at least once in their lifetime to perform a pilgrimage of either Hajj, characterized by the visit at a certain date during the holy period of Ramadan according to the Islamic lunar calendar Hijri, or Umrah, which in turn means the journey there undertaken anytime, thus, of course, the former is more valuable than the latter due to both the greater requirement's amount and the general conditions' distinction. Nonetheless, Tawaf, the rounding about Kaaba in a counterclockwise direction seven times in a row thereby showing the Muslim supporters' oneness must be made in both cases. Additionally, this stone's cleaning ceremony is also quite considerable, as even the high-ranking individuals participate and look at the large-scale process. Talking of the ritual, it starts with Tawaf, followed by the walk between the Safa and Marwah hills and drinking from the holy Zamzam Well, proceeding to the mountain of the utmost significance, Arafat, which Prophet Muhammed described as the Hajj's embodiment, believed to be the place where Adam and Eva met each other and where the so-called Judgement Day's rehearsal or reminder takes place. After spending a night in Muzdalifa, the symbolical devil's stoning at the columns, designed to serve as a demonstration of the evil Shaitans' exile, occurs. Throughout the pilgrimage's final stage, the animals' sacrifice, mostly including sheep, cows, or camels, accompanied by the heads' shave of the pilgrims for their sins to be forgiven before the sacred space's final leave. To sum up, the film involves almost all Islamic aspects, although some of them implicitly, owing to Kaaba and Mecca being the whole faith's crucial part, since the region is deeply connected to the two primary Prophets Muhammed and Ibrahim who experienced God's hierophany. Due to the movie's shortness, it was impossible for it to tell us every ritual's technique and meaning, but I think that the task of letting the world know what exactly happens inside the Arabian center has been done very well. After watching, the audience should understand that despite being surrounded by the tens of thousands of people in there, everyone stays face to face with God, as a result of becoming more emotional than usually via seeking for forgiveness or asking for something private."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Every person needs support that will give him hope, faith, strength, as well as an explanation of some of the things that he does not understand. People find this strength and support in religion, and this is the main thing that helps to develop a person's worldview. The same characteristics of religion, in particular Islam, can be seen in the National Geographic documentary Inside Mecca, directed by Anisa Mehdi in 2003. The film tells the story of three pilgrims: Khalil from South Africa, Fidelma from the United States and Ismail from Malaysia. They joined two million of their fellow Muslims during the great Hajj in Mecca, spending several days following the journey of the Prophet Muhammad. The documentary effectively presents the main idea of the Hajj - the cleaning from sins and the establishment of faith. Besides, there are unique images which provide a rare opportunity to get familiarized with important structural landmarks of Mecca, the center of pilgrimage, which cannot be observed by representatives of other faiths because the law of Saudi Arabia prohibits those who do not profess Islam from entering the Holy City. In this review, I want to highlight different conceptions of Islam, such as the notion of equality and peace, reverence of the Prophet Muhammad, the significance of dark power that I have noticed while watching this movie. First of all, Islam is the direction of humanity on the right path leading to peace and holiness, indicating what the meaning of life is. By making a pilgrimage to Holy places, Muslims express their love, obedience and humility to God. It emphasizes the concept of human equality as the participation in the Hajj is collective worship. During the trip, people tend to temporarily abandon the everyday hustle and bustle, worries, privileges of civilization, social status, race and entirely devote themselves to praying (namaz) and worship of Allah. In Islam, the most important is the strong belief in one God and the morals of the Quran in a person's heart. As we could see, men were dressed in white attire, ihram, which makes all of them look the same and be equal, despite various economic and educational accomplishments. For example, before his trip, Ismail took only a few clothes to Mecca as his pilgrimage was not about material merits but more spiritual salvation. Despite the considerable difference in the origin and social status of pilgrims, there will be almost no quarrels and misunderstandings among them, because in the Quran, it is written that Whoever intends to perform the Hajj during these months should not engage in sexual intercourse, commit sins, or engage in disputes during the Hajj (Surah al-Baqarah, verse 197). Also, in the reading Major Themes of the Quran by Rahman, it is written that concerning distributive justice, the Qur'an laid down the principle that wealth should not circulate only among the rich ... these words were spoken in the context of the distribution of booty among the poor Meccan immigrants (p.41) which states that it is crucial to help low classes so they will not feel disadvantaged. It is essential to do this not only for the sake of God but also from honest intentions. In the movie, Khalil was bringing the food for those in need. He says that charity is one of the tenets of Islam and Allah asks people to take care of others as much as possible. Therefore, in the end, it was shown that after the rite of throwing the stones, it is advisable to make a sacrifice. The sacrifice is performed in Mecca and is distributed to the poor around the world, showing Islam as giving hope for the forgiveness and mercy of Allah through the right intentions and actions of people. Secondly, with respect for Prophet Muhammad, the follower spiritually reborn and wants to be closer to him during the Hajj because Prophet is considered as a messenger of Allah. As it was shown in the movie, according to traditions, each pilgrim must perform the tawaf during the Hajj, which is the going round the Kaaba counterclockwise seven times as did Prophet Muhammad. This rite symbolizes a unity, monotheism and harmony of the world. Also, people should go to Medina where Prophet Muhammad is buried to feel closer to the Prophet and pray beside him. Moreover, in order to forgive their sins, they go to Jabal ar Rahman which is a small mountain in the Arafat Valley. The mountain was known because the Prophet prayed there and said that the best prayers were offered on Arafat and that Arafat is Hajj. According to the Cambridge Companion of the Quran, by enhancing himself with the knowledge of the Prophet's good deeds, a Muslim becomes able to carry the ideas of his religion to others in order to establish goodness, harmony, integration and justice, by not paying attention to those who ridiculed or insulted him. It was shown when African pilgrim said in the end that God is great. I thank him for bringing me this place, to see where all these events happened. When I return home, I must give away what I learned with others. The next function of Islam is giving protection, guidance, hope and support for people in their lives. It is no accident that people, as a rule, in difficult moments of life turn to religion, which helps to drive away anxiety, sorrow and other dark forces. For example, the film showed how pilgrims in Mash'ar al-Haram collect stones and prepare for the rite of Stoning Satan. In Major themes of Quran is written that Satan works as an anti-man force trying to seduce a man from 'straight' (right) path instructed by God (p.18). That is why by throwing stones at the idols of Satan, at this stage of the Hajj, the pilgrims clean themselves of any deception, debauchery, and satanic forces. Although their weapons are insignificant, the grandiose wave unity defeats the enemy, no matter how strong he may be. The pilgrims thus reproduce the struggle of Ibrahim with Satan. According to the lectures, Ibrahim underwent the most difficult trials from God as he had to sacrifice for the sake of God his beloved son Ismail. Satan tempted Ibrahim three times to abandon the Lord's decree. However, he, in order to drive away satanic temptations, seven times threw stones in his direction. Therefore, a pilgrim should get to know his inner and outer devils, and with all his might remove from himself that which prevents him from clearness and approaching the God. To sum up, this movie impressed me in an immeasurable way and gave a better understanding of Islamic beliefs. It supremely transmits the emotions and concerns of characters that help to understand the significance of Hajj in the life of Muslims by describing the standard Hajj practices and traditions interestingly through the prism of specific stories of Fidelma, Khalil, and Ismail. The movie shows that religion represents self-control, faith, and spiritual satisfaction for a person. I recommend this movie because it has such power which illustrates the religion in the way of the purpose of life and a tool of a person's attitude toward the world. It demonstrates that religion is essential for people in terms of spiritual development because by creating religious ideals for themselves, people begin to help others gratuitously, selflessly, and become kinder and fairer, despite the sneers from the outside."}, {"id": 8, "text": "The movie Inside Mecca explains Islamic rituals, by showing journeys of pilgrims with various backgrounds. Particularly, the movie highlights information about the hajj, pilgrimage of Muslims. I think that the movie does not effectively explain the hadj and other related Islamic rituals, since it lacks explanations of some crucial Islamic concepts. Moreover, not all descriptions and explanations of religious rituals in these movies are credible and reliable. First of all, the movie begins with a description of Kaaba's importance. It says that ..before creation, there was a holy place, celestial house of God, called Kaaba. The narrator continues saying that Kaaba's replica on Earth is located in Mecca. However, reliable theologists' papers do not confirm it, in other words, there is no information about the existence of God's celestial house in documents related to Islam. Secondly, the movie includes some important facts. For instance, the movie presents that although the majority of the Meccan pilgrims are Muslims, also Jews and Christians go on pilgrimage to Kaaba. Professor Fred Donner agrees with it, saying that even from early ages Muslims considered some jews and Christians their society, i.e. Muslims defined people of Books as one society with them. Additionally, when the movie offers some history behind the Kaaba and the black stone, the narrator highlights that the stories are myths. Since there is no reliable evidence for such stories as Abraham using the black stone in construction work, it is important to mention that stories are mythical. Mainly, the information from the movie mentioned above are important, and the narrator effectively presented it. Mainly, Dr Umar in the movie claims that Kaaba is the centre of Muslims' religious mentality. There is no enough evidence to claim it, as the central concept of Muslims' mentality is worshipping God, which should not necessarily be done near Kaaba. Although all Muslims pray in the direction of Kaaba, their mentality's centre is the concept of taqwa, which can be translated as piety and fear of God (Rahman, 28). In addition, it is noted in the movie that Islam propagates wearing the modest clothing and that in Saudi Arabia female modest outfit includes covering hair. There is no clear evidence to claim that covering a woman's hair should be done only according to Saudi Arabian standards of modesty. Covering hair is also practised in other countries, so it is not about standards of modesty of certain society, and majority Muslim scholars states that it is obligatory (azan.kz, umma.ru). Additionally, the narrator refers to Muslims' verbal praise of God as songs, which is not a linguistically suitable word for describing this. It is important to note that at the beginning of the movie they tell about travelling rules of Saudi Arabia, especially the requirement for women to bring the permission document by a male relative. They say that it is illogical, and also the narrator does not explain this requirement. Rahman states that, according to Islam, men are responsible for their female relatives. Particularly, he says that economic sufficiency of woman reduces the superiority of her husband over her and that such male superiority over women has purely functional nature. Rahman refers to Qur'an's 4:36 verse on this matter (Rahman, 49). Although, the movie clearly described every stage of the hajj process, and offer several theories about their historical basis; the movie failed to completely explain the importance of hajj. The reason is that pilgrims in hajj aim to not only relive the experience of prophets, and this worship has its mental philosophy.Rahman says that wholistic view of Islam is an inseparable part of Muslims' salvation, and only physical movements of prayer are count as full worshipping process. I think that movie should have added more information about religious terms, such as jihad or taqwa. For instance, jihad is considered the main obligation of a Muslim, and this term means total endeavour to please God, which is written in Quran as with your wealth and lives...to make God's cause succeed 9:40 (Rahman, 64). So, I think that the lack of explanation of such spiritual concepts in Islam is the main disadvantage of the movie since these spiritual concepts are a crucial part of hajj and other Islamic rituals. In conclusion, the movie described all stages of hajj in some historical details, mentioning that some of these historical theories are mythical. The move showed hajj, pilgrimage, of 3 Muslims with different backgrounds, which lead to differences in the hajj experience. Generally, some Islamic ideas and certain parts of its religious practice were shown and explained. However, since some claims do not have credible evidence, and the movie did not include an explanation of some crucial concepts of Islam, the movie does not effectively explain and describe the hajj and other Islamic rituals."}, {"id": 9, "text": "The following review is focused on analyzing the National Geographic documentary film by Anisa Mehdi (2003) that effectively shows the Muslim world and variety of nuances in a very unique and personal way. I can clearly say that this film can be quite beneficial for a wide range of audience, as even myself, culturally raised Muslim (but not religious myself) learned a lot from it. What is more, is that the way how Mehdi was able to dive the audience into this world via 3 POVs of completely different people from social, cultural and economic layers which makes it even more valuable, as it owns objective manner without any biased opinion (e.g. only from the POV of Muslim person). All in all, this film review aims at pointing aspects of Islam as brotherhood, equality in front of God, the importance of Kaaba, its characteristic of being the one of the monotheistic and helping those in need. And the last aspect that was quite surprising for me is its modern perspective that makes it understandable for the audience of current era. Firstly, I would like to begin with short notice of what Kaaba is, so that rest of things that will be described later can be more understandable. Basically, Mecca is a place that is annually visited by people (Muslim believers) so that they can fulfil their duty as Muslims believers in front of Allah. Aside from just fulfilling what they are required to do according to the five pillars of Islam, they also hope to redeem their sins, feel close to God and dive into this journey as a faithful people in the holy place that is considered to create somewhat a unique experience of feeling the power of Islam. The thing that will mentioned as Kaaba is the special construction in Mecca that is the ultimate place of this worship and pilgrimage. Kaaba is large black square stone located in the center of the Masjid al-Haram mosque and according to he Muslim traditions and history, it was put there directly from the heavenly world and as there were plenty of sinner people, by the touch of them, the sacred Kaaba turned black. However, it is also considered that Allah himself ordered prophet Abraham to build it as a centre for the faithful so that they can pray and worship. Back to the film, I would highlight the way how it shows the sense of brotherhood and equality that Muslim religious traditions also about. The first POV that the film incorporates is the journey of the South African radio host Khalil Mandhlazi that experience this two aspects noted above. He meets the issue of inequality in a way that is treated as a foreigner because of his race/skin color. This surprises Khalil as he learn that basic principle of Islam is that all faithful people are equal before God without any limitation as skin color, ethnicity, race or socio-economic class. This is very true, as according to Uranic verses this is what makes all believers brothers as they are all faithful to one God - Allah. Fazlur Rahman mentions this in his Major Themes of Quran (page 45), stating that this quality of all races in front of Allah is the ultimate essence in Islam. He says that the only thing that differentiates those people is the virtue they possess. During this POV of Khalil, the documentary successfully incorporates another value on Islam religious tradition which is helping those in need, usually in materialistic means as money, products - basically donating and doing charity. One of the pilgrims shares his devotion to donating and practicing charity when he can. This is quite true, as Rahman also addresses this on his work (around 38-39) confirming that Quran states that believers must practice helping those in need in the cause of Allah so they will be replayed in the afterlife. In this sense, I would strongly argue that the documentary is not superficial and it shows actual and original values of Islam and it core virtues and practices that all believers are expected to do. On the other hand, not like Khalil, another pilgrim Fidelma O'Leary - the US citizen of the European descent working as a science professor - truly experiences this sense of brotherhood while other Msuslim people show their respect and care by helping and advising her to successfully reach the goal of her religious path. This situation surprises Fidelma as she is a white woman who was also raised Catholic and had somewhat of a pressure from her family; it is almost finding true close people and family for her and I really liked the way that showed the sense of brotherhood towards such a typically foreign person. When it comes to the aspect of monotheism of Islamic religion, Mehdi also portrayed this in the Inside Mecca showing that those Muslim traditions are also addressed and practiced for one supreme God - Allah. This is quite the truth, as Islam is monotheistic Abrahamic religion just like Christianity and Judaism. This can also found in Fred Doner's lecture works (How Islam began) where he states Quran verses address faithful people as believers of God and not necessarily Muslims - showing its monotheistic aspect. The film shows historical facts depicting the role of Kaaba and tying it to monotheism. According of he Lecture The Origins of Islam, Mohammad the prophet aimed to make Kaaba this central geographical place of pilgrimage and return its monotheistic tradition after the pre-Islamic era. I would totally say that Mehmed as a director did a strong work by also noting the role that Abraham played in Islam. Another theme that was raised in the movie and what I also find pretty unique and interesting is the way how it portrayed the holy journey that those pilgrims can go through and the way how closeness to their faith can impact them and sometimes even change for the good. The third pilgrim Ismail Mahbob - a businessman from Malaysia - encounters quite an out of comfort zone experience being a person from the upper class that probably built her inner ego and the way he treats people and also his pride and arrogance. The film shows that the journey to Kaaba is not the easiest one in the world and you will encounter lots of difficulties to reach your goal. This can be shows in the scenes when he feels strange by covering all the body parts and dressing in the same clothing as all the believers (which is also refers to the sense of equality before god, no rich values incorporated as brands or etc.). Another scene is the crowd of billions of pilgrims around the Kaaba and even farther that makes him compare it to the wide and comfort Malaysian streets. Nevertheless, by the end of his pilgrimage, Ismail truly understands the meaning of Islam and this weakness and sins that people possess and practice daily. This is what makes the film unique, as I don't see any documentary about religion incorporating such modern and up=to=date issues as materialistic stuff and richness ending in these qualities as arrogance etc. In conclusion, I would say that I totally suggest this to both religious Muslim people and those that are absolute beginners in this topic to have a better understanding of Islam and its deep and core values. This film was also shot from the perspective of 3 different people and it can relatable and easy to understand for a wide audience. Mehdi as a director nailed the effective representation of the journey that Muslim people experience daily and also to the Kaaba."}, {"id": 10, "text": "The film Inside Mecca centres on how three people take their hajj - the Islamic pilgrimage trip to the city of Mecca. Understanding Islam and its origins as a religion should come together with the understanding of the people who practice it, so this documentary was a wonderful insight that allowed me to learn about some aspects of Islam I was unfamiliar with. Inside Mecca highlights the emphasis on faith over identity in Islam by showing the equality of people of different backgrounds before God. In the lecture Formation of Islamic law and Hadith, Professor Garipova described how Islam has incorporated the customary law (adat) when it arrived to the steppe. I think that the same idea of inclusivity of Islam as a world religion was also transmitted in the film, where despite the territory being controlled by Arabs, people of different backgrounds, social status and nationalities have found communion on their hajj. This implicates the universal spread of Islam and it shows the viewers that the religion evolves and adapts to the different believers and how they to which it found its way. Similarly, even though hajj is encouraged, there is a recognition that it is a physically and monetarily costly activity, so it is meant only for the people who can do it. In Islam, all people are equal before God and are judged by their deeds. The film depicts that the more well-off people have the options of extra accommodations on the journey. As we have discussed in the seminar, Islam does not condemn the wealthy as long as they are pious. Ultimately, though, they still perform the symbolic rituals, praying near the Kaaba as Muhammad did, throwing stones at the Satan like Abraham, and striving across the desert as Hagar in her pursuit for water. The film describes the protocols that people who want to do a hajj have to follow. The prerequisites include travelling in groups, wearing traditional clothes (ihram), and proving one's Muslim-ness to the authorities of Saudi Arabia. The film goes into detail about the Kaaba and how much it means for the Muslims. Kaaba is placed in the House of God on Earth, the words that Mircea Eliade used to define a sacred place. We see in the movie the sacredness of Mecca and Kaaba to Muslims, the rituals and spirituality that surround them. It is cathartic for Muslims to be able to see these places, the places in direction of which they have been praying every day of their lives. In the film, we see pilgrims crying when they arrive at Mecca and see it for the first time, and how sad they are to say goodbye to it. The hajj consists of five days and it is physically challenging for many to be walking in a large crowd in the heat of the desert, yet people are content in their faith and they stay calm. They are exhausted on the journey, but they are elevated spiritually in the crowd with their fellow believers. This follows the Islamic notion that although God is too great to understand or depict him, there is a way to be close to understanding him through faith and good acts. Interestingly, Fred Donner in his lecture How Islam Began spoke about the initial unity of the believers in the one Abrahamic god and the later need of the Muslims to separate themselves as a distinct and true religion. Also, in one of our readings, Ibn Ishaq (p. 85-86) described the re-building of Kaaba and mentioned the foundation of Abraham, and the presence of Jews on the site. But, even though the Jews and Christians are supposedly worshipping that same God whose house on Earth is Kaaba, the Muslims claim the exclusive rights to it through the prophet Muhammad. It is highlighted in the film that only Muslims are allowed to go on hajj. Another idea that is explored in the film is charity. Meat from the ritual sacrifice that is a part of hajj is distributed to the poor, and we're also shown how one of the pilgrims, Khalil Mandhlazi from South Africa, buys food for the locals who live outside Mecca. In the film, this scene has a double meaning, as it both shows the charity done by Khalil and highlights that no one has similarly helped these people before. In conclusion, the film Inside Mecca expands understanding of Islam through the depiction and explanation of the Islamic tradition of Hajj. It broadens the understanding of the Islamic traditions by challenging the widespread theories and highlighting the intersectionality of worshippers, and their unity."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Inside Mecca is a documentary movie produced by National Geographic in the year 2003. It presents a holy city Mecca, located in Saudi Arabia, that is a place of destination for all Muslims around the globe. It is worth mentioning that only Muslims are allowed to visit this sacred place. The movie shows three pilgrims who travel to Mecca to perform annual Hajj. There are five pillars of Islam, one of which is the Hajj pilgrimage during the visit to Mecca. Hajj is performed in Kaaba, that is a sacred place (Lecture on Early Islam). In details, it shows how three people whose names are, Khalil Mandhlazi, Fidelma O'Leary and Ismail, from three different parts of the world are united in their desire to perform Hajj and a common goal to feel the connection with God. The movie shows their feelings, thoughts during the Hajj. In the same vein, it reveals the importance of Mecca for people with various faith. This movie is based on real stories of people, therefore, it effectively shows the real Hajj with the following issues. At the same time, it provides significant principles on which Islam is based. The review will analyze how the movie presented the traditions and foundations of Islam to viewers. One of the major foundations of Islam claims that all people are equal (Rahman, Major Themes of Quran). There was a case in the movie when workers of the camp in the Mecca said that there are different conditions according to the social status. In other words, some people can afford a comfortable apartment during the journey and the rest are content with modest wards for several people. However, the fact that some people are VIP and others are not VIP does not mean that they are not equal before God. It can be seen from the clothes of pilgrims. They all have the same clothes. For men, it is white two pieces of cloth, they are forbidden to wear sewn clothes, while women should wear close clothes. Each of the main actors of the movie had a different background, nationality and issues they faced during the spiritual journey. Firstly, the movie introduces Fidelma O'Leary from the United States. Travelling to Mecca started to her from providing a certificate that proves her faith is Islam. Next, she had to ask permission from close relative male to travel to Mecca. In her case, she asked permission from her son. It is interesting to note the attitude towards Fidelma due to her appearance raises some questions for the majority. Next is Khalil Mandhlazi from South Africa. His main principle was that every person is equal and should treat each other as sister and brother. He has several situations with discrimination due to his race. However, his faith was strong that he believed that everyone is equal before God. Last is a couple from Malaysia, Ismail and Asma. They are wealthy people and came to Mecca in order to reborn and feel the cleansing of the soul and solitude with God. The movie explains many Islamic traditions with underlying stories. According to the movie, the centre of Mecca Kaaba was rebuilt by Abraham. For instance, one part of the Hajj is Jumerat, throwing stones to the pillars in order to get rid of the devil or Satan. The legend says that Abraham had a son Isaac. Then God tested him and commanded to sacrifice his only son. Abraham obeyed God and at the moment when he started sacrificing Satan stoped in order to misguide him. It is believed that Abraham throw stones to him three times. Therefore, pilgrims started conducting this ritual. In addition, it was mentioned that Abraham was the founder of pilgrimage. This film shows that a person must be prepared physically and mentally since, in connection with large crowds of people, great dangerous conditions are created. As an obvious example, the situation of throwing stones and moments during circulation. Furthermore, people have true emotions during the traditions and rituals. There were situations when all of the three participants could not contain their feelings and break forth into tears. By the way of conclusion, the review critically analyzed the documentation called Inside Mecca. It is highly recommended to watch this movie to gain a deeper knowledge about Islamic foundations and the way the Hajj is conducted through the eyes of three different people. It effectively shows the fascinating buildings, all rituals, people's beliefs and feelings, their life during Hajj. At the same time, it reveals the difficulties that appear during the journey. Despite all the problems, and crowds of people around, they try to stay alone with God. After this people are ready to find their way with a clean and new soul. This film allows you to plunge into the atmosphere of worship, but it does not replace a live visit for every Muslim, but how everyone should visit this religious place."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Inside Mecca, a National Geographic documentary film, provides a detailed overview of Hajj or the annual pilgrimage of Muslims from all around the world to the center of Islam, Mecca. While highlighting the historical background and reasoning behind this extremely important spiritual practice, the film succeeds to emphasize the unique nature of Islam as one of the world's largest religions and changes happening within the Muslim community. More precisely, the film underlines the body of law, which is central to Islam as it can be seen from many verses and passages represented in Qur'an. To begin with, the idea of Hajj is, in fact, one of the five main pillars of Islam, which every faithful Muslim is ought to practice throughout his life. However, as the film progresses, it can be seen that despite pilgrimage to Mecca being considered as one of the mandatory rules, millions of believers strive to the heart of Islam to celebrate their faith and worship the God as Prophet Muhammad did. Nevertheless, there is a set of obligatory rules, which are aimed at guiding Muslims before, during and after their pilgrimage. As it was mentioned in the film, Mecca has been a centre of pilgrimage of Muslims for more than 1400 years. Moreover, as some scholars suggest, it has attracted people of other faiths a well. However, nowadays not only Mecca does not allow arrival of non-Muslims but also controls the number of Muslims coming every year for the quest for salvation. Moreover, one must prove his or her being a faithful Muslim by providing a confirmation from a mosque he or she regularly attends. This rather a newly implemented rule is not typically associated with Prophet Muhammad himself as, for example, practice of women travelling in groups or of mahram, when women receive a permission from their husband or other male relatives to travel, are. Rather this rule is established and managed by the state authority of Saudi Arabia within which borders sacred city happens to be located. Thus, this is the example of intertwined connection between religious authority and local state authority existing in the modern era. This highlights a significant question of authority in Islam, which appeared after the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE. According to Fazlur Rahman, however, Muslims are asked to obey God, the Messenger, and those who are in authority from among yourselves duly elected or appointed authority  (Rahman, 1994, p.44). Therefore, these restrictions and rules implemented by the state of Saudi Arabia are not generally challenged or undermined by Muslim community. Apart from the rules that Muslims are faced with before the annual Hajj, there are several major rules that are depicted in the film. Most of them are centuries years old and are based on the replication of action and practices that were performed by Prophet Abraham, his wife Hagar and later by Prophet Muhammad. Thus, the legitimacy of the rules associated with them are not challenged by people arriving every year to Mecca. However, as the film has shown the modern days' Hajj evidently has some striking differences. Despite the fact that all Muslims are declared to be brothers and are expected to be together as impregnable as a building reinforced with lead (Rahman, 1994, p.42), the film has clearly highlighted the existing differentiation among Muslims coming from different financial backgrounds, races, and nationalities. As for example, one of the Muslims coming from South Africa stated, racial distinctions are in place even in the heart city of Islam. This was highly reinforced by the implementing of thousands of tents for people coming to Mecca for Hajj by the government of Saudi Arabia due to the fact that people were separated in these tents based on the regions they were coming from. Similar example is seen from the experience of the female Muslim coming from the United States to Mecca as she was constantly asked and tested on her belonging to Islam based on her appearance not only by the authority of Saudi Arabia prior to her arrival but also by fellow Muslims after. Although both of these cases can be explained by the fact that nowadays almost 80% of Muslims are not of the Arabic descend, it is still a relevant example of how Islamic teachings and practice are reflective of Another example of a newly implemented feature of nowadays' Hajj is its controversial service system, which highlights the differences between the poor and rich. As it was shown in the film, nowadays despite the fact that all Muslims coming to worship the God to Mecca are expected to appear before God in the same clothes representing that all of them are equal, in fact, they are still divided based on their financial status. For example, some people were enjoying more benefits and more comfortable stay during Hajj, while others were not. Therefore, this system of service that was implemented and sponsored by the government of Saudi Arabia to help people coming for the quest of salvation to Mecca, in fact, contradicts the very nature of Hajj, in the first place. Moreover, as it was mentioned in the film, despite the fact that charity or zakat is also one of the obligatory practices of every Muslim, and also the fact that Muslims are obligated to to give priority to needy Muslims over themselves even if they themselves are in need, and whosoever is saved from the pettiness of his own self, they are the successful ones (Rahman, 1994, p.42), charity is rarely performed during Hajj nowadays.

These three muslims are Fidelma O'Leary who is professor of neuroscience at St. Edward's University in the USA, Khalil Mandhlzai who is a black radio commentator from South Africa and executive from Malaysia Ismail Mahbob. Their ecstatic emotion and enthusiastic piety before and during the hajj, comments from religious scholars of Islam, historical Western paintings associated with figures of Abrahamic religions make this documentary movie true to life and at the same time informative.Fidelma O'Leary was herself a fascinating cast. A University professor, who was not born in a muslim family, Fidelma O'Leary converts to Islam from catholicism during her college years when she was questioning her faith. She describes her conversion to Islam by starting her story about a radio program: I was listening to a call-in radio show and some guy called in and said Well what I don't understand is this, If Jesus was god how is it that he also worships god?. Thus this questioning became her light bulb moment and she became the only muslim she knew at that moment. After certain years of being muslim and fully embraced the faith she decides to embark on hajj. Then this documentary goes on to the life of Khalil who might be suffered from racial discrimination because he states that god doesn't look your face, god doesn't look to a body, it is only looking forward your heart. The next character was Ismail who was going to hajj with his wife, this journey was a big challenge for him because he used to satisfy most of his material needs being a businessman but the hajj is more about ascetic life. So all of this background information is to know how different these people are and what does unite them all is only love to God.Further in the spiritual journey of these three pilgrims narrator plays very important role as he talks not only about people's background but he also tells about the historical events associated with Mecca, must-do muslim traditions during hajj and skilfully connects all these with the emotions of main characters. The narrator starts the story of pilgrimage from Abraham describing him as a father of monotheism, father of the jews, christians and muslims. It is also known from the lecture about Judaism that his name itself which is given by God in his 99s means father of many nations which proves that narrative is completely reliable (Lecture Abrahamic Origins). From the lecture we know the story about the God's command to Abraham to sacrifice his son Issac taking him up to the mountain, but he doesn't do it because angel Jibreel stops him (Lecture Abrahamic Origins). This story also finds its place in this documentary and by this narrative it is clear that the religious ritual called the Jamarat is actually in honor of that day when Abraham showed the first example of a true believer. These stories are artfully connected with personal thoughts of one of the actors Fidelma O'Leary, who brings the scientific arguments for the effectiveness of the Jamarat in containing evil and temptation. Therefore this kind of skilful matching of theoretical knowledge and religious traditions with the practical application of them by these three muslims shows the importance of the narrator in this documentary movie.This documentary movie also tacitly raises the problems of racial, sexual and financial discrimination which are not unfamiliar for many pilgrims from all over the world too. For example, the presence of VIP tents for those who can afford more comforts because of their financial status shows the unequal socioeconomic side of pilgrimage. African black radio commentator Khalil who was aching to see brotherhood and sisterhood in this holy place, conversely faced the racial discrimination in his tent where he was not treated as others just because he was not the same color with them. Then Fidelma also says that many people were asking her Is she really a Muslim? forgetting that only Muslims can enter those places and she also told that sometimes this kind of questions can heart people. But both of them tolerated this kind of discrimination because in this spiritual journey they understand that it is needed to be patient and be focused on seeking the God's mercy for their sins. I also think that by choosing one of the main actors from women, this documentary movie made egalitarian viewpoint into the practical part of the pilgrimage.In conclusion, I want to say that I will recommend this movie to watch for Muslims as well as for non-Muslims because it gives very thorough knowledge about one of the pillars of ever-fast growing religion Islam. Three actors chosen for this movie is also from various nations and culture, they are non-Arabs which is very good to show obstacles that face people from different backgrounds. At the end this movie made me to feel what those performers feel, for example when tears are rolling on the face of Ismai while he is praying, when Khalil makes very loud speeches about the fairness of God, all of this touched my heart. I think it effectively transmits their emotions because these people are ordinary people like everyone but their difference is that they just wanted to fulfill their obligation in front of God."}, {"id": 16, "text": "The film describes the main concepts of the Islam religion. The video achieves this goal by showing the Hajj (Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca) from the inside and taking as main characters of the plot three different people from various parts of the world with their own nation, wellbeing, skin color, race. The plot of the film describes the concepts of Islam like monotheism; the importance of taking care of the less fortunate people than you; the existence of evil and good; equality of everyone before Allah. Firstly, the core concept of Islam, monotheism, is explained in the movie. It is explicitly shown that people do not worship Kabba, they worship what it represents - one God. All rituals of Hajj such as Tarwiyah day, the path to Mecca and Mina, Arafat, Feast of Sacrifice, haircutting, and Tawaf are mainly purposed to worship only one creature along the journey. However, according to lecture materials, Five Pillars of Islam states there is no God but Allah. Thus, we can understand the first main concept in Islam, that Muslims have only one Allah and no other divines. Secondly, in Islam, there is not any priority, and all are equal before Allah. In the film, the equality of people was significantly highlighted by showing three different Muslim pilgrims from different countries and who have no similarity except the faith. According to the film, no matter who you are: woman, man or child; what is your nation; what is your skin color, no matter, there are Islamic brotherhood and sisterhood, which brings all Muslims together. Thus, by delving into the daily life of each character, the viewer can see how they are different in terms of well-being, profession, lifestyle and etc., however, when we see them with other millions of people in Mecca, who pray without any distinction (in two pieces of the towel), the viewer can grasp that in Islam all people are equal in front of Allah. On the other hand, there were some critics, which was mentioned in the video, about racism and discrimination. For example, Khalil from South Africa was disappointed when he was not treated well with other South Africans because of his skin color. Also, we can see some class discrimination in Mine's tent city where they rely on the rule that there is not any prohibition on comfort as long as pilgrim may pay for it. These incidents provide information about some de facto exceptions of rules in certain real-life situations and it was clearly shown in the film. Moreover, the movie emphasizes the next concept of Islam implicitly, which is the Sharia, the unique set of rules. According to lectures, the Quran is not taken from third-party narration about prophet Muhammad, instead, the Quran and Sharia are direct instructions of Allah to people. Therefore, in the video, all rituals of Hajj were shown explicitly, sequentially, and in details, because it was said that pilgrims actually have to be within the clearly marked boundaries of Arafat or their Hajj may not be counted. Hence, we can understand that in Islam, rituals must be followed strictly, because there exist Allah's direct will and directions as a set of rules (Sharia). Furthermore, the film highlights the concept of good and evil. It was clearly discussed in the part about jamarat, where believers did stone Satan. It could give a clear understanding that for Muslims there exists the concept of good and evil; justice and injustice; righteousness and sinfulness. By the jamarat ritual pilgrims seek forgiveness and reject evil. The concept of good and evil can be considered as one of the cores in Islam because everyone must distinguish them without any gained knowledge: avoid the action, which brings suffering for others and approach to good. As a next point, the helping of poor and less successful people than you is described in the feast of sacrifice part of the film. The plot of the film revealed that with the largest ritual sacrifice, pilgrims help poor people all over the world by supplying them with food, because each pilgrim must sacrifice one sheep, or seven pilgrims must give one camel at the end of the Hajj. It can be clear that the film plot is bounded with the topic of Hajj and Kaaba, thus the plot does not describe the concept of help fully, for example: by showing the ritual of Sadaqah or by showing the content of Surah, where Allah says about his/her/it love to gentleness and love. To sum up, the film could clearly highlight the main aspects of Islam such as monotheism or worshipping one God, social equality, the concept of good and evil, and supporting vulnerable parts of the society by showing the main rituals of Hajj and experiences of main heroes. Also, the film could convey all core concepts of Islam in giving a framework of Hajj."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Film review The main idea behind the movie Inside the Mecca by National Geographic is to demonstrate the World spread of the Islam religion and to describe the process of annual Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj) in the region of Mecca. The movie attempts to demonstrate the above-mentioned ideas by showing the experiences of three different people before and during the Hajj. Moreover, my assertion is that the movie Inside the Mecca effectively demonstrates the idea that Islam religion is widespread around the World, in addition, I also assert that the movie productively demonstrates diversity of religious believe in Pre-Islamic period in Arabian Peninsula and the theory that the significant part of local people in Mecca are dependent on trade and on organizing the Hajj for Muslims who come to Mecca from different places around the globe. Pre-Islamic diversity of believe in Arabia and Islam is widespread religion: The idea that the communities in Pre-Islamic region of Arabia were diverse in their religious belief we may know from O Abu Talib, your nephew has cursed our gods, insulted our religion mocked our way of life and accused our forefathers of errors (article The Life of Muhammad, p 119) and  Early communities (about early supporters of Muhammad during his life) of people included many different kinds of people perhaps, Quranic believers also Christians and Jews...  (Lecture, How Islam began, Fred Donner, 26:40 min) and also  the city of Mecca played a major role in addition to being trading hub the city of Mecca was also major hub of pilgrimage that contained different Gods and idol. (Lecture on Origins of Islam, 23:45 min). Therefore, we may conclude that the early communities in Arabia were not uniform in their religious beliefs. The movie demonstrates the diversity of believes in pre-Islamic period by saying that Definitely pre-Islamic Arabs practice the pilgrimage to Mecca (Inside the Kaaba, 13:53) and  Different idol worship dominated the Kaaba ( Inside the Mecca, 15:08 min), also  in year 630 Prophet Muhammad cleared the Kaaba of idols returned to worship one God (Inside the Mecca, 15:13). As a result, the movie demonstrates the diversity of believe among early communities in Arabian Peninsula, which is also supported by the lecture material. the new community expands outside Arabia in Egypt, Iraq, Syria and so one (How Islam begun, Fred Donner, 20:50), which indicates the beginning of spread of Islam. Also, the movie demonstrates how widespread the Islamic religion is by selecting the main Muslim character from different parts of the world namely, Africa, United States and Malaysia. The movie also shows the recording of communities of people during Hajj that consists of people with different races, ethnicities, and origination. The depiction again emphasizes how widespread the Islamic religion is. Significant part of local people in Mecca are dependent on trade during Hajj and organization of Hajj: We know that the part of locals in Mecca were Quraysh and that they were looking after the Kaaba from  They (Quraysh) said that we are the sons of Abraham, the people of the holy territory, the guardians of the temple (Kaaba) and the citizens of the Mecca. No other Arabs have the rights like ours or position like ours. (article The Life of Muhammad, p 87). Also, we may understand that the Khadija belonged to Quraysh and that Quraysh were dependent on trade form Khadija was the best born woman in Quraysh and Khadija was a merchant woman of dignity and wealth. She used to hire men to carry merchandise outside of the country on a profit-sharing basis, for Quraysh were a people given to commerce (article The Life of Muhammad, p 119). In the movie we also see the continuation of lifestyle of locals in Mecca that they make their livings from administering the access to Kaaba and organizing the Hajj and from trade during the annual pilgrimage. This can be supported by several quotes from the movie  The lives of Meccan more than one million of residence and the city itself are utterly defined the presence of the Kaaba and the preparation for the Hajj( Inside the Mecca, 3:27 min), We (locals) never stop preparing for Hajj, we prepare for Hajj every single hour during Hajj immediately after Hajj, before Hajj and  the markets of Mecca have long made the journey good for the wallet as well as the soul. As a result, we can conclude that significant part of locals is dependent on administering the Hajj as well as the trade during Hajj. Therefore, considering the mentioned lecture material and the movie Inside the Mecca we can state that the locals in Mecca in the period of Quraysh and in the present time are dependent on administering the Kaaba and pilgrimage and also on the trade. In conclusion, we can say that the movie Inside the Mecca effectively describes the main idea that the Islam is widespread around the globe and about the process of Hajj through stories of main characters of Fidelma O'leary (USA), Khalil Mandlasi (South Africa), Ismail Mahboob (Malaysia), who represent different citizenship, ethnicities and races. On the top of that the movie also describes the diversity of religious beliefs in Arabic Peninsula in pre-Islamic period through reference to the role of Kaaba in the mentioned period, which is also supported by the article The Life of the Muhamad . Further the movie Inside the Mecca illustrates that the local population is heavily dependent on the presence of Mecca and Hajj by interviewing the local people. Also considering the lecture material on Quraysh we can say that during the period of Quraysh and in the present time the local communities make their livings from administrating the Kaaba, organizing the pilgrimage and the trade, all of which is based on large numbers of people coming to the territory of Mecca. In my opinion the movie can be improved by addition of historical references on how Islamic religion was spread. So that the viewer of the movie can understand what the reason for the presence of Islam around the globe was. Overall, I enjoyed watching the movie and I would advise watching this movie to everyone who is interested in discovering what is the city of Mecca during Hajj and what is the role of Hajj in Islam."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Inside Mecca is a delightful representation of the Islamic traditions being kept and performed by an individual and by the society of faithful Muslims. The film focuses on Hajj and three basic characters with totally different backgrounds coming to Mecca to perform Hajj for worshiping the God. Documentary shows the way these characters understand Hajj and what they are going through during it. It also shows how other people act during the Hajj as a community. In this review I will discuss the view of the Hajj, its meaning and importance in the Islamic traditions for and individual and for a society using the film material and other sources. Also, I will focus on the topic of the equality that this film is showing. One important concept that film brings up, which is also a very fundamental in Islam is monotheism. Basically is the idea that there is only one God. Fidelma O'leary is one of the basic characters and one of the pilgrims. She chose Islam in her path of searching God. Quran states the idea of monotheism as follows: In the very nature of the case, there can be only one God, for whenever one tries to conceive of more than one, only one will be found to emerge as the First: And God has said, Do not take two gods (for) He is only One (Major themes of the Quran, page 12.)Being raised Catholic and keep questioning her faith once she hears a person on the radio saying If Jesus was God how could he worship God? (Inside Mecca 7:15). For her it was a moment when all peace finally came together and a moment when she started her way as a Muslim. Since, all Muslims worship only one God and the name for him is Allah. The other fundamental concept of Islam is equality among all living man, what is also arose in the film while pilgrims came to Mecca for Hajj. Dr. Fidelma O'leary is American white woman, Khalil who works as a businessman is a back man, and the married couple Ismail and Asma are Malaisian people. According to Islam no matter of race and wealth people are equal to each other. For that reason Quran assumed, affirmed, and confirmed the idea that the essence of all human rights is the equality of the entire human race. This is the reason behind the special attire called Ihram that people have to wear during Hajj. Ihram is closing that Muslims wear before the pilgrimage. In the film they also state that wearing this outfit rich man and poor, educated an illiterate all look alike. However, both Fidelma and Khalil faced unpleasant questions and mistreat when people questioned their religion. This attitude disappointed them. However, they decided to stay calm during the Hajj not letting bad emotions and feelings to came out as anger or backbite. Khalil says that when we are here, indeed we need to respect all human being (Inside Mecca 34:08). The reason for them being disappointed about this situation, is a little more that the feeling of disrespect. It violates taqwa, which is a fear of God, or being conscious of God in order of performing good attitude and avoid bad. Violating Taqwa happens when they suspect people who look different of not being Muslims, even if it is clear that only Muslims can participate in Hajj. It was noted in Quran. O you who believe! avoid most suspicion, for some suspicion is sinful, and do not pry into others' affairs and do not backbite each other (Major themes of the Quran, page 39)According to this taqwa other Muslims should not have been question the believe of their sisters and brothers, because as was noted they are all equal no matter of the nation. They let themselves questioning and suspecting them, this was more serious than just a simple act of disrespect. Amazing thing that film shows is that it shows the importance of the equality not only within the Muslim community but also within the all people of different believes. Traditions of Muslim people in performing Hujj that film showed was spinning around the Kaaba, performing Jumerat, running in the dessert imitating the desperate mother searching for water for her son. These traditions come from the Judaism. Where Abraham was said to sacrifice his own son, according to the most Muslims it was Ishmail, but according to the Bible it was Isaac. This was done to Abraham so he could prove his devotion to the God. At the same time the devil comes and wants him to disobey the God, making Abraham having doubts about killing his son. We know that early traditions develop every religion, giving context in which the religion will emerge. The one example of transmission of the traditions from on religion to another, is that in Mekka, the holy place people performing Hajj have to take off the shoes. In this case the film unites the three main religions that we are having nowadays Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Showing that they have the same roots and should be treated equally important, and their followers equally respected."}, {"id": 19, "text": "National Geographic documentary Inside Mecca by Anisa Mehdi gives an opportunity to take a look at the Hajj, an annual Islamic pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It displays the religious journey of three pilgrims from Malaysia, South Africa, and the US who have different social background but share the love for one God. The documentary sufficiently explains the process of the pilgrimage, as well as its religious background, showing how the religious duty is carried out in the modern world guided by the ancient rules.The documentary efficiently displays the course of rituals performed during the pilgrimage of Hajj. The journey starts in the heart of the sanctuary in Mecca: the Ka'ba, which was believed to be built by Adam and then rebuilt by Abraham, who paved the path for the monotheism (Lecture on Abrahamic Origins). Umar F. Abd-Allah from the film expressed an opinion that faiths tend to have a center, like Ka'ba in Islam, which forms a crucial part in religious mentality. This echoes an idea of axis mundi by Eliade(Sacred Space and Making the World Sacred, p.22-23), which states that there are places for various beliefs that constitute the saint space closer to God. The Ka'ba is considered as a religious center for the Muslims, since it represents the house of God. Indeed, if it was not the religious importance of the Ka'ba, millions of people would not make an effort to travel to the city of Mecca for the annual pilgrimage. However, people who gather and walk around the Ka'ba seven times do not worship the Ka'ba, but instead worship what it represents: the one God, which highlights the monotheistic nature of Islam. Next, film takes the viewers to the Mount of Arafat, where people spend the day of reckoning, seeking absolution, giving an insight on the Islamic belief of the Day of Judgement. Then we see the scene of casting stones in Mina, symbolizing the battle with Satan, who is believed to seduce man away from the right path (Rahman, Major themes of the Qur'an, p.40). This ritual, as the narrator explains, represents the distinction between good and bad, righteousness and sinfulness in the religion of Islam. Overall, the film explains the general course of the rituals, performed in the annual pilgrimage of Hajj.What is important, during all of those rituals, the pilgrim must take care of its mind and body: pilgrims enter the state of ihram, in which they control their temper, focus on their spiritual purity rather than outer appearance by wearing loose-fitting clothes in neutral colors. Ihram resembles the idea of equality, oneness of all people despite the physical appearance: all people are the same in the face of God and what unites them is the faith. However, the documentary shows that this mental regulation is not always followed. The followed pilgrims face obstacles during their journey caused by their appearance: Fidelma O'Leary is constantly questioned about her faith because of her nationality, while Khalil Mandhlazi is racially discriminated. Also, the film shows that there is a division between the accommodations and comfort zones according to the price.The stories of Abraham are efficiently used in explaining the religious background of the pilgrimage rituals throughout the documentary, since Abraham is the central figure in the formation of Islamic doctrines such as submission to one God and annual pilgrimage. Starting from the story about abandoning Hagar and Ismail in the dessert, which is the origin of the Hajj; the desperate run of Hagar between the two hills while looking for the water, following the sacrifice of Abraham's son, which led to the tradition of stone casting, symbolizing the battle with Satan, and the sheep sacrifice.The film also emphasizes the importance of the figure of the Prophet Mukhammad in the formation of ways the Hajj is performed. The traditions are based on the actions of the Prophet, which, in some sense, can be compared with sunna, the normative behavior of the Prophet (Lecture on Islamic Law and Hadith). Pilgrims perform rituals and behave themselves in a certain way, saying that the Prophet did it this or that way. These traditions include seven circles around the Ka'ba, walking by feet to the valley of Mina, sleeping under the stars, cutting hair, washing, and changing the ihram clothes in the end of the Hajj. This can be explained by the fact that the Prophet was believed to receive the revelations and therefore know the right ways to live a righteous life as demanded by God, which led to people following him.To sum up, Inside Mecca allows the viewer to follow three pilgrims from different countries to take an insightful look on the wonderful journey of Hajj. The documentary provides descriptive and instructive content about the pilgrimage: it overviews the series of rituals and preparatory actions, provides the informative religious background of this tradition and informs about possible obstacles that can come across during Hajj based on the experience of the pilgrims whom we followed throughout the film."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Kaaba is a replica of the celestial house of God that existed before everything was and a symbol of worship of one God, God of Abraham. It is known that every religion has a center and Kaaba is a center for muslims. The faith of muslims requires going to Kaaba and performing Hajj. The film illustrates some of the most important concepts in Islam including following of Muhammad, strong belief in forgiveness of God Almighty, equality of people and so on.Going to Kaaba is very important in Islamic tradition and is done for remembrance of God. This trip is considered a spiritual journey after which a person will not be the same as before. The three pilgrimages forgot their background, what they did and who they were and became the same and near God. They spent a week with a crowd of sweaty people and tried to control their feelings for the love of God that connected them altogether. So, going to Hajj means you forget everything that was before and concentrate only on one God and worship God. People of different ages, nationality, gender, social status are equal in this journey and there is nothing important but remembrance and worship of God. It is perfectly illustrated that when the time for prayer comes everything stops, shops are closed and the whole street becomes the place for prayer. During the week people devote themselves for worship of God and this changes their minds, priorities and lives. After the symbolic exile of satan people cut their hair as a symbol of a new state of being. This process is similar to Brahmans that are called twice-born men due to spiritual growth that is considered as second birth. In the film it is said that people won't be the same after Hajj and they start a new life.The another aspect of muslims is that they try hard to follow and be like prophet Muhammad. As Quran doesn't cover all the aspects it is not enough to get full knowledge from it. So people use also Hadiths that are words and actions of prophet Muhammad. From this it is clear that after God and Quran, Muhammad is the person to be followed. Pilgrims perform tawaf that is the going round the Kaaba counterclockwise 7 times as did prophet. They go to Jaba Rahma where prophet gave final sermon seeking nearness to him. In addition, muslims try to repeat Muhammad's actions as sleeping under the stars or cut hair after satan exile. The South African pilgrim while walking to valley of Mina, says \u00abour prophet was over 60 when he performed Hajj, and I am only 40 and can walk why I should get bus when Muhammad walked\u00bb. This shows how muslims try to follow their prophet and repeat his actions and try to be like him by personality, too. The other thing is that the author says the people are surrounded by millions and are together in space and in faith, but yet alone before God. This illustrates another belief of muslims that no one can defend people, they are alone with their soul and sins before God. Unlike in Christianity that believe Jesus Christ was crucified to atone sins of people in Islam people are only ones who is responsible for their deeds and sins. It is said that no one can speak and ask for forgiveness for people unless God permits, however, the idea is that people are alone before God.Another concept that is seen from the movie is focusing on forgiveness of God. During the five day quest people constantly pray for forgiveness. Muslims believe that God is merciful and forgives all the possible sins if you understand your mistake and ask for forgiveness. However, there is a restriction that if it is too late like before death the sins are not forgiven. During the period of Hajj people perform many rituals that came from Abraham but the very reason of Hajj is asking for utter mercy from God and absolution. The African pilgrim says \u00abGod can forgive everything people have done and give grace\u00bb. From the readings it is seen that God will use any chance to forgive people. For instance, if one person commits sin God will look to the overall performance of that person and if he is good, the sin is forgiven. The pilgrim believes that the thing that is important is how sincere people are when asking for mercy. We are humans and commit a lot of sins but God forgives. So the goal is not to be ideal and without sins but understand them and constantly improve yourself. The American pilgrim says \u00abyou can't just confess and be forgiven but be improved do not repeat the same mistakes\u00bb that is the idea of Islam. After the end of Hajj Malaysian pilgrim says that he is struggling with inner poverty and wants to be a better person, better father, better worker and better subordinate. This shows that the main goal is improvement of people, people are not ideal and allowed to make mistakes, sins but the thing is you understand and do not repeat them again. Constant improving is what Islam teaches people.One of the main ideas of Islam is equality. The pilgrim from Africa says \u00abdon't ask me who am I or where I am from or who's my father, it is Islam that brought me here\u00bb. According to Islamic tradition people believe that God doesn't look at your face, body, who you're, millionaire, or poor God looks at your heart. The striving for equality is illustrated with the special cloth for men and modest clothes for women. The special cloth consists of two pieces for upper and lower bodies. The idea of this is that all people rich, poor, literate and illiterate look the same and the focus is drawn away from cloth and the soul becomes the center. The Hajj is a perfect illustration of equality where people of different race, nationality come together in one place and concentrate worshipping one God. The other thing that is mentioned in the film is that American pilgrim needed to obtain permission from her son to travel. She says that she never read restrictions in the Quran and it seems that Saudi people themselves created this restriction. In Quran it is said If any do deeds of righteousness be they male or female and have faith, they will enter Heaven ''. So there is no inequality between genders and they are spiritually equal. Also, in the readings it is mentioned that the phrase that men are one step above women doesn't mean one is more deserving than the other. This means that men and women are only functionally unequal meaning that men should feed the family. And if for some reason male cannot do it and instead the woman supports the family then he is no longer above the woman.The state of Ihram required while doing Hajj shows what traits of personality are important in Islam. This state is essential to perform Hajj that is the pure frame of mind, patience, courtesy and respect. Muslims are required to have these traits even in ordinary life. During the journey pilgrims faced many challenges that require patience and tolerance and they overcame them due to their faith. As arguing and losing of temper is forbidden during Ihram the African pilgrim changes group after he was discriminated because of his skin color. The comments and words of other women towards American woman made her upset however it is important to keep patience and tolerate. Moreover, the challenges of transport and living places tested their patience. All the pilgrims eventually overcame the challenges due to faith. And it is clear that these personality traits such as tolerance, patience are important in Islamic tradition.In Islam society and brotherhood are important. Allah says \u00ablook after my mankind\u00bb. Also in the reading it is said that the society that doesn't take care of socially vulnerable members as orphans, poor will collapse. So the charity is basic principle of Islam. The African sees another side of the city with poor and hungry children and helps them. The element of charity is similar to christianity where charity is believed to be one of the reasons why christianity spread quickly. The African here also mentions an important point he says \u00abI do it for the service of God\u00bb. This is also an important point as when muslims say \u00abI love you for serve of God or I do it for serve of God\u00bb this is a sign of agreement so in the day of judgement God will reward them for these deeds. And this words are unique for muslims and they have very important meaning. To sum up, the film illustrates the concepts of Islam and shows what things are important for muslims. It is clear that followers of Islam do not adhere to all the requirement of the religion as they sometimes show intolerance, critique and so on. But the important thing is not to be perfect but constantly improve and learn from mistakes that is the teaching of Islam. The film and also readings were useful as they have clarified two things for me. First, the prejudice that in Islam women are lower than men, now it is clear that they are spiritually equal and the difference is in the functions. Another thing is the words ''I do it for the service of God\u00bb. This phrase seemed insincere as how can people do things without their wish and just for the sake of God. Now it is clear that when you do good things you mention God and God will reward you for this."}, {"id": 21, "text": "The movie depicts one of the most important aspects of Islam for Muslims - Hajj. It does so by telling the stories of three pilgrims coming from different social, economic, and racial backgrounds. The main plot line is constructed around the Hajj pilgrimage of those three people: Fidelma O'Leary, Khalil Mandhlazi, and Ismail Mahbob, and supported with the historical and informational description of the narrator. This review will show that this movie describes well the significant aspects of the Hajj and highlights some of the religious notions in Islam, such as equality before God and the meaningful faith in one God. The review will consist of two parts: how the movie explains the Hajj and what other aspects of Islam it highlights and criticizes. First, the movie is made for the broader audience than only Muslims, thus the narrator explains in detail both the historical importance of the Hajj, and the stages of the Hajj pilgrimage. The history of the significance of Mecca starts from the times when the Prophet was born here, in 571 AD. Mecca used to be the chief city, which played important roles for many religions. There were many temples of different Gods, and the city of Mecca was an important spot in the polytheistic religious environment (Lecture on Early Islam). However, later the building of Kaaba turned into the representation of the monotheistic religion. The movie also shows that the pilgrims coming to Mecca do not worship the Kaaba itself, but rather what it symbolizes - the monotheistic faith in God. Apart from this, the historical depiction in the movie continues with the description of the steps of the Hajj - each stage represents the journey of the Prophet and Abraham, and each sacred space is historically important places from this journey. For instance, the movie closely shows the stoning of the Satan, when all pilgrims throw the stones to the stone pillars. It is believed that when God demanded the sacrifice of his son from Abraham, the Satan came to him telling him not to kill his son, and to disobey the God. But every time the Satan came to him, Abraham throwed a stone to him and resisted. By stoning the Satan, every pilgrim resist to his personal evils, says the narrator. There are also explanations and descriptions of other steps of the pilgrimage in the movie, and the detailed narration combined with the stories of three pilgrims effectively shows the meaningfulness of Hajj for the Muslims. Second, the movie indirectly highlights and criticizes other aspects of Islam, such as unity, equality and helping hand to those in need, and others. By choosing people from different backgrounds, the movie shows how their identities and peculiarities sometimes can experience the contradiction to the main values of Islam. For example, it is said in Quran that all Muslims should give a helping hand to those who are in need, and should support them (Rahman, p.46). But the story of Khalil Mandhlazi, who was shocked that he was first to share charity of food to those families who live in poverty there, at Mecca, shows that not every Muslim highly appreciates the highest values of Islam. Many of the pilgrims may be just focusing on the Hajj only, or just may be short in resources, or may have any other reasons of not doing a charity at Mecca. However, millions of Muslims travel from different parts of the world, and this is genuinely shocking that Khalil was the first one to give. Moreover, Fidelma O'Leary, who came from United States, often experiences the discriminatory patterns towards her beliefs in everyday life. In the movie, she narrates that she had to get a confirmation from her mosque that she is a Muslim because her surname causes mistrust in that. Also, she faced this discrimination even at Mecca when some people came to her asking VIP client services that include some better comfort. Even though Islam says all people are equal before God, those who suggest those VIP services justify themselves by saying that comfort can be suggested to those who can afford it, and it does not discriminate anyone since the matter is only in the money resources and wishes one have. Personally, it seems for me that all of these three pilgrimage cases are included in the movie to illustrate some contradictory sides of the faith to the audience. The movie does not directly criticize those, but rather gives a food to think to those who are watching. To conclude, the movie successfully describes the process of the pilgrimage Hajj by showing each of stages with explanations and visual representation. Additionally, by telling different stories of three pilgrims, the movie effectively emphasizes the important aspects of Islam. As it shows the stories from the personal perspectives of the pilgrims, it leads to the deep thinking and analysis of the religion itself."}, {"id": 22, "text": "National Geographic offers people worldwide the opportunity to experience the pilgrimage of the Muslim community to Mecca. The documentary is very insightful as it tells Mecca's historical significance through the stories of real Muslims from different parts of the world. Even though the film is only 55 minutes long, it provides useful insight into the Islamic religion's core concepts. The documentary Inside Mecca effectively explains the importance of charity in Islam, God's love relationship towards Muslims, and key points from the Ka'ba's story. These and many more details from the film give a holistic perspective to the viewers.The documentary film clearly depicts the concept of charity that is a basic principle of Islam. The Qur'an aims to strengthen the weaker sections of society: the poor, the orphans, women, slaves, those chronically in debt. (Rahman, Major Themes of the Qur'an, pp.46-47) It is also important to note that the Prophet Muhammad himself was an orphan. Besides, the first man who accepted Islam after 'Ali was the freedman, Zayd. (Ibn Ishaq, The Life of Muhammad, p.114) With this in mind, the significant element of Islamic social justice is to help those in need. In the documentary, Khalil gathers his fellow pilgrims to help poor and hungry children in Mecca. He provides their families with the basic necessities of life. According to him, It is our duty to look after this. Allah says look after my mankind. My mankind is the people who are like us, human beings who do not have... (25:13-25:20). There is also a moment in the film that represents a man without a leg begging for money; and how people around do not ignore and try to help him. (36:18-36:20) Accordingly, Islam is not simply about prayers, but also about fulfilling other duties of the Qur'an, such as giving money to those who ask for financial help, the poor, orphans, etc. All of these are accurately shown in the Inside Mecca documentary.Secondly, National Geographic does a great job of representing the love of God. Throughout the film, it shows that God is on a person's side. God sees human endeavor even though a person might commit evil deeds. For example, in the Major Themes of the Qur'an (Rahman, p.30), it is written that If you avoid the major evils that have been prohibited to you, We shall obliterate (the effects of) occasional and smaller lapses. (4:31) The documentary depicts a similar idea in the Day of Arafat: The important thing is the utter mercy of God. God loves people. He is able to obliterate everything that they have done that is wrong, and he is able to give them grace. (37:47-38:02) In Islam, the overall accumulated good deeds are rewarded higher than evil deeds. Also, one of the older pilgrims reads aloud a book that states, We are human - we tend to make mistakes. So the chances for you to ask for forgiveness are a lot. (29:07-29:13) That is, Muslims feel that God is merciful and forgiving. Those who journey to Hajj think that God loves them and thus chooses them to come to Mecca. Therefore, respect and conscience of people help them to choose the right path. From the movie, one can see that human beings want to become better people after the pilgrimage, better fathers, leaders, workers, subordinates, etc. (52:43-52:51). All in all, the documentary demonstrates the love relationship of God towards Muslims.Thirdly, the Inside Mecca documentary succinctly tells about the story of Ka'ba. It clearly states that since long before Islam, Ka'ba has been considered a sacred space. According to the documentary, some scholars even believe that Ka'ba was a place of pilgrimage for Jews and Christians. It might be the case because Christianity and Judaism played significant roles as the religious background of Islam. (Islam Lecture 1: The Origins of Islam) Besides, Ibn Ishaq also highlighted Ka'ba's sacredness and the ritual of circumambulating the temple that was before Islam. (The Life of Muhammad, p.84) Therefore, there is evidence that pre-Islamic Arabs practiced the pilgrimage to Mecca.Moreover, the documentary correctly emphasizes idol-worshipping that came to dominate the Ka'ba. Before the emergence of Islam, there were a large number of statues of gods and goddesses there. (Islam Lecture 1: The Origins of Islam) The film describes the prophet Muhammad who cleared the Ka'ba of idols and returned worship to one God. The prophet played an essential role in rebuilding the Ka'ba; however, I believe that it would be better if National Geographic also included the impact of Quraysh regarding that decision. Overall, the critical concepts of Ka'ba are clearly described in the documentary.To conclude, the National Geographic documentary helps people worldwide to acquaint with the Islamic religion, particularly with the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. One can summarize that the concept of charity plays a vital role in every Muslim's life. It is written in Qur'an to help people in need, and that is clearly depicted in the film. Secondly, there is a good representation of the love of God. Not only is written in Qur'an but also Muslims feel and know it. Lastly, Inside the Mecca briefly describes the Ka'ba's story's critical concepts during the documentary; however, it would be better to include Quraysh's role in the rebuilding of Ka'ba. Overall, the film is informative and insightful."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Inside Mecca is fundamentally only about one, albeit complex, ritual in the Muslim tradition, yet it perfectly illustrates several crucial religious concepts in the context of Islam. This essay will analyze the documentary's depiction of Hajj as an example of believers' interaction with a sacred space, the idea of emulation of an important religious figure, before discussing its critical implications with regard to the modern aspects of the pilgrimage.The film demonstrates the degree to which Mecca corresponds to the classic notion of a sacred space, described in The Sacred &amp; The Profane by Mircea Eliade (1957). The creators most likely did not envision the documentary to be viewed from this exact perspective, but they skillfully show this facet of Islam pertaining to space. Sacred space occurs where the divine seeps into the dimension of reality and manifests itself in various ways, and there are features of it that Eliade defines, which are very evident in the city of Mecca. Firstly, it is noteworthy just how clearly demarcated the physical boundaries of Islamic holy places are. Even the world's largest, most popular metropolises mostly are free to enter, yet the access to Mecca is restricted quite heavily. Exclusively Muslims are allowed inside, and sometimes approval requires comprehensive background checks, as in the case of Fidelma O'Leary. Moreover, in the film, there are images of big checkpoints on the roads leading to Mecca, ones that are usually employed at country rather than city borders. Additionally, the second day of pilgrimage happens at Mount Arafat, and in the continuation of the theme, the narrator says, pilgrims actually have to be within the clearly marked boundaries of Arafat, or their Hajj may not count. Thus, Muslims are very explicit in their differentiation of space. Secondly, this differentiation results in a special norm of behavior within the sacred space. As the film suggests, prior to the emergence of Islam, Mecca was already a sanctuary where it was forbidden to hunt, cut trees or fight. Furthermore, during Hajj, the main way of interacting with the holy city of Mecca, one must adopt a state of Ihram, marked by patience, perseverance and commitment to God. In other words, setting foot in this place involves a responsibility to refrain from all that is sacrilegious. Thirdly, it is the believers who impart holiness to this territory. According to Eliade, the formation of the sacred space is a twofold process. First, people must begin to see some space as sacred. Inside Mecca does a great job of explaining the rationale behind the veneration of Islamic holy places, which generally lies in a variety of religious stories. For instance, the Kaaba is thought to have been built by Adam and later rebuilt by Abraham. Second, people must attempt to distinguish it as such, as in the tale of Jacob who set a stone and poured oil on it in order to delimit the newly found House of God (26). Similarly, the Kaaba is the center of orientation for all Muslims, but the narrator underlines the fact that underneath its cover, it is a simple stone building; inside its golden doors is an unadorned room. Therefore, much like the stone and the oil, the Kaaba in and of itself is not anything extraordinary, yet what it represents, the unity of God, is. That is to say, the role that people play in conceptualizing the Islamic sacred space is massive. Finally, Muslims connect with Mecca in a peculiar way. One of the most important attributes of sacred space is how people experience it. Fidelma O'Leary cannot hold back tears at the very sight of the Kaaba, and not because it is a sublime piece of architecture. Instead, to simply set eyes on such a holy monument overwhelms her with emotion. Likewise, Ismael, who presumably prays five times a day back at home, sheds a tear during his prayer near Ararat, saying that he felt like he was communicating one-on-one with God. Clearly, Mecca is a sacred place not just on paper: it feels sacred for every Muslim.In tracing the historical and traditional roots of Hajj, the documentary discovers in the rituals the notion of emulation. The idea that one should strive to live their life in the same manner as someone central to their religion is not exactly new. In Christianity, salvation can only be attained by those who not only believe in its tenets, but also try to follow Christ's way of life. The treatment of Prophet Muhammad in Islam is similar in that he is viewed as the ultimate paragon of behavior. As a result, through the vast collection of hadiths, Muslims attempt to learn as much as possible about a person they would like to follow. In describing the theoretical background of the pilgrimage, Inside Mecca shows that the aforementioned theme translates into the practice of Hajj. Essentially, every pilgrim traces the footsteps of Muhammad when they circle the Kaaba or when they travel to Mina. Yet it is not only about walking. Emulating Abraham's actions dating back thousands of years, Muslims throw stones at the pillars representing Satan. Emulating Hagar's urgency to find water, Muslims run back and forth between two hills. Both the narrator and O'Leary point out that active rites involving physical emulation of these central Islamic figures allow pilgrims to connect with them on a much deeper level. Halil, for instance, is able to find within himself the required strength and grit to reach Mina on foot, knowing that Prophet Muhammad was able to do so as a sixty year old.In conclusion, Inside Mecca is a documentary that is replete with insightful details about Islam. It is difficult to orient oneself in this flood of information, but I have found the two themes above to be of particular interest to anyone who is fascinated about religion. Overall, its setup of following the journey of three completely different Muslims on their Hajj is very engaging. As a consequence, the viewers can understand Islam not as strangers from the outside looking in, but through the lens of followers so devout that they decided to embark upon an adventure as grueling as it is fulfilling - the sacred Hajj."}, {"id": 24, "text": "The central subject of the movie revolves around the Islamic religious tradition themes and origins. Along with depicting Islam, the movie incorporates the story of three pilgrims from three different corners of the world who are heading to commit pilgrimage to Islamic centre - Kaaba in Mecca. This movie review argues that the film managed to narrate the important principles and aspects of Islam in a significantly proper manner. Illustration of Islamic characters such as brotherhood, charity, equality, monotheism and pilgrimage to Kaaba in the movie can be considered accurate and consistent with the Quranic and general Islam knowledge. To start with, The narrator mentions that Islam places primary emphasis on being equal before God and highlights the frustration of Khalil from South Africa when he is treated differently because of his race. Khalil tries to explain that believers are equal before God no matter what colour, race, or social position one has and insists on the essence of brotherhood. Indeed, his statements are in consistency with Qu'ranic verses about the bond of community. Particularly, the Quran numerously stresses and declares all believers as brothers and that those are impregnable as a building reinforced with lead. Rahman also confirms that the equality of all human race before God is the essence of human rights wherein goodness and virtue are the only distinctions that can be present among men ( Fazlur Rahman, Major Themes of the Quran, p. 45). Thus, the appearance of brotherhood and equality principle of Muslims that is depicted in the movie can be seen as an effective attempt advocated by Islam. Secondly, the film reveals the importance of charity and support of the poor in Islamic tradition. One of the pilgrims references command of Allah to look after mankind and Kahlil confirms that he always practises charity for the sake of God and strives to live the Islamic ideal. Indeed, because of their difficulty to remedy, the Quran emphatically criticizes socioeconomic disparities that prevail among Meccan societies. Thus, the Quran actively calls believers to help and feed poorer people as in the absence of concern for the welfare of poor, even prayers became hypocritical. What is more, the basic vulnerable traits of man- pettiness and narrowness- are manifested when they withdraw from helping those who suffer financially. Importantly, pilgrims in the movie repeatedly confirm that they practise charity for the sake of God since Quran exhorted Muslims to spend in the cause of Allah and thus establish credit with God so that God can repay you manifold (Fazlur Rahman, Major Themes of the Quran, p.39). The film and characters reveal the necessity of charity as a duty and a part of the ideal Muslim which is actually accurately supported by many verses of the Quran in Islamic tradition. Thirdly, the narrator highlights the monotheistic feature of Islam and that it is Abraham who established most of the Islamic traditions and submission to one God. Indeed, Abraham is the father of three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, within which submission to one God is central. As noted by Fred Donner, the Quran does not refer to Islamic followers by Muslims but rather believers which further indicates that those are the ones who believe in one God ( Lecture on How Isam Began). Importantly, Quran states that believers should follow the holy books perpetuated by earlier messengers and believe in what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaak and Jacob... who are known as the prophets in Christianity and Judaism ( Lecture on Quran and Tafsir). As Abraham is the father of monotheistic religious traditions he can be considered as a leading influencer of how these religions established themselves. The approach with which movie properly represents Abraham as a major influencer of the monotheistic Islamic religion is another aspect that is maintained by central themes and nature of the Quran. Last but not least, documentary also narrates the origination of Islam in Mecca and the role of Mohammad in it. As mentioned in the documentary, Kabaa is older than Islam and has been a pilgrimage direction since the pre-Islamic period. Later, Mohammad the prophet attempted to clear the Kaaba of idols and to return the Kaaba to the Islamic faith, thus, establishing it as the centre of Islamic pilgrimage. Indeed, those claims are true as in the pre-Islamic period, people of the Arabian Peninsula were very decentralized and trajectory in their religious tradition and exercised various polytheistic religions worshipping different ancestral gods and goddesses. People of Arabia would come to Mecca to trade and perform pilgrimage in temples and religious institutions that incorporated various representers of polytheistic idolatry faiths from across Arabia. Importantly, Kaaba also obtained a large number of idols and statues of different Gods ( Lecture on The Origins of Islam). So, as narrated in the movie, one can see that the claims of the dominance of idolatry and pilgrimage to Kaaba yet in pre-Islamic times are consistent with historical facts and are depicted in a true manner. What is also consistent, Mohammad the prophet's goal was to essentially convert the Kaaba or to return to a monotheistic religious tradition and once again becoming the centre of Islam (Lecture on The Origins of Islam). Consequently, one can see that narrator depicted the Kaaba's history and Mohammad's role in it in an effectively truthful manner. To recapitulate, the paper argued that the movie was able to effectively depict the aspects and beliefs of Islam to a larger extent. The documentary included the depiction of many aspects and themes of Islam. This paper analyzed the consistency of brotherhood, charity, equality principles and origins of Kaaba pilgrimage in accordance with Quran verses and lecture materials."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Inside Mecca gives an intimate portrayal of hajj in modern times, through following steps of three people and thereby giving their point of view to this journey as well as documenting the hardships associated with the event for the citizens and the government of Saudi Arabia. The main audience of the movie is non-muslims, and therefore the movie tries to explain key parts of hajj by explaining the history associated with it. I believe, the movie successfully portrays keys parts of hajj and gives a detailed representation of a modern Islamic community.Firstly, the main purpose of the documentary is to introduce hajj to people who people of different backgrounds and I think it successfully accomplishes that through camera work and historical interpolations. The director is able to use a wide range of camera shots to represent different elements of hajj, but most importantly they are able to convey how strong the devotion of Muslims towards Allah is. The director often uses a high-angle wide shot to fit as many people in the shot as possible. Those shots, for example, when people are circling Kaaba 7 times, represent that truly a massive number of people gather for Hajj every year. Moreover, oftentimes they depict people moving in unison and I think that captures what a powerful force faith is: making millions of people do the same thing at the same time and the same place is unreachable to recreate by any human. The close-up shots are there to show people's emotions. They show how important hajj is to Muslims: for instance, we see a close-up shot if Ismael in the day of judgement crying in emotional distress because he felt that he was lonely: it was only him and God. It goes to show, people, are able to retrieve their utmost worries and share it with God during Hajj. Another cinematography method they use to show the devotion of Muslims is by showing satellite retracing of the steps of Muhammed. The movie shows brief excerpts of people walking from one place to another, for example from Mecca to Mina, but satellite videos truly capture how long these people had to walk in the desert to literally follow steps of Muhammed and how harsh the terrain is, and it shows how much effort people are willing to put in for this experience. From all the shots, viewers are able to understand how important hajj is to Muslims but to have a deeper understanding audience also needs to see why it important and the director accomplishes that with the insertion of historical context. They interview historians and explain an associated event with appropriate artwork. For example, to explain sa'ay - which is walking quickly between the two hills of Safa and Marwah, they bring the story of Hagar looking for water walking in distress between the hills. I think, the historical context allows the audience to have a deeper understanding of motivations of the rituals, and therefore can appreciate them more. All the elements of the movie given above give a well-rounded representation of hajj for an unfamiliar audience. Secondly, the movie also tries to represent key elements of the modern Islamic community and I think the representation is well-balanced as it highlights both problems and accomplishments of the community. The movie tries to show the diversity of Muslims. That is shows by the three characters that the audience gets to follow: A Texan woman of an Irish descent that is a professor of science, a Malaysian wealthy family man and South African radio representative that comes from a lower class. It goes to show how widespread and accepting Islam is, that virtually anyone can become a Muslim. A negative quality that is highlighted is inequality: we see that while it is written in Quran that everyone is equal: The essence of all human rights is the equality of the entire human race, which the Qur'dn assumed, affirmed, and confirmed(Major themes in Quran, page 45), there is also a struggle in achieving that. For instance, when Khalil encounters racism in his tent and leaves the tent. On the other hand, other elements of trying to create an equal society such as redistribution of wealth do seem to exist as well. It shows local shops trying to help people in need and that too is in accordance with Quran:  the Quran laid down the principle that wealth should not circulate only among the rich (Major themes in Quran, page 41). I think the documentary shows both sides of the coin that while there is no perfect equality, it is important to acknowledge when there is no equal treatment of people and thereby spread awareness to try to impact people.In short, the Inside Mecca is able to give an intimate portrayal of hajj to people undergoing it by showing their raw emotions, highlighting the strength of their devotion to God and explaining the reasoning behind it. Moreover, it touches upon some key principles of Islams such as equality and acceptance. All in all, the movie gives a well-rounded representation of one of the most important events in the life of a Muslim."}, {"id": 26, "text": "Inside Mecca is a National Geographic documentary that invites viewers to accompany three pilgrims on their Hajj journey and explore the intricacies of pilgrimage and religion from the inside. During the film, three characters go through seven stages of the Hajj, each of which reflects a historical event and has a symbolic meaning. In this review, I will analyze the key elements of their journey and argue that the movie effectively elucidates the key doctrines of Islam such as equality, unity, piety, purity; and emphasizes the importance of following the right path.The film begins by introducing the main characters - an American woman with a Christian background, a black South African man and a wealthy Malaysian. These people of different socio-economic status are united by a common faith and goal to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, or Hajj. Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, rooted in the pre-Islamic traditions of Arabia. Transformed by the Prophet Muhammad into a monotheistic tradition, Hajj is the duty of any Muslim who can afford it physically and financially. The rites and rituals of the Hajj are centered around the house of Allah - the Kaaba and have a symbolic meaning (lecture Early Islam). It is important to note that although Mecca is a God's holy house and the Kaaba is the most sacred site, Muslims do not worship them (Ishaq, p.86). They worship what they represent - the symbol of the Oneness of God. Thus, every year in the last month of the Islamic calendar, millions of Muslims perform the Hajj as a tribute to God. As it is shown in the movie, the pilgrims are of different ethnicity, age, marital and economic status, but they follow the same spiritual path and believe in One God. They are one and equal before Him and, as it was mentioned by Rahman (1994): The essence of all human rights is the equality of the entire human race, which the Qur'an assumed, affirmed, and confirmed. It obliterated all distinctions among men except goodness and virtue (taqwa) (p. 45). These aspects of Islam - unity and equality - are especially emphasized in the film.The next part of the documentary depicts the stages of the Hajj: circulating the Kaaba seven times, praying on mount Arafat, staying overnight in Muzdalifah, running seven times between al-Safa and al-Marwa, stoning of the devil in Mina and farewell tawaf. All these rites need to be performed in a state of Ihram - spiritual purity that requires patience, curtesy and respect. This is a great challenge for both body and soul that the pilgrim's faith must meet. Moreover, these rituals take place in historical sites and imitate the journey of Abraham and the Prophet Muhammad, thereby strengthening the connection with history and God. The example we see in the film is the ritual of running seven times between the hills of al-Safa and al-Marwa, as a tribute to Hagar's despair. According to the narration, Abraham left Hagar and Ishmael in the desert, and when they ran out of supplies, Hagar began to run desperately between the hills in search of water. In response to her struggle, God sent the Angel Gabriel to help her and a spring of water appeared in that place. Another ritual from the movie associated with Abraham is the stoning of the devil. It is believed that when God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son, the devil tempted him to disobey the will of God, but Abraham resisted and stoned the devil. The ritual performed by the pilgrims symbolizes the importance of following the right path and resisting evil. Similarly, the rest of the rituals and the pilgrimage itself emphasize the necessity of being pious. In its turn, piety is considered the most crucial trait of a religious man. As Rahman (1994) noted, It (piety) denotes the fully integrated and whole personality of man, the kind of stability which is formed after all the positive elements are drawn in (p.28).Throughout the journey depicted in the documentary, the main characters make every effort to follow the right path. For instance, although Khalil Mandhlazi from South Africa, was discriminated and unwelcomed because of his skin color, he managed to let go pain and anger and did not violate the state of Ihram. Also, he donated food to local poor families, which seemed to me an especially beautiful gesture, because the Hajj does not require it - it comes from the heart.It is believed that no pilgrim returns home the same person. The Hajj is intended to deepen the faith of Muslims and strengthen their connection with God. However, the Hajj, like so much else in everyday life, can challenge patience and force people to choose between good and evil. The mission of a religious man is always to choose the good, the right, the just - to choose God."}, {"id": 27, "text": "What aspects of that religious tradition does the film highlight, criticize, or explain? Does it do so effectively? Inside Mecca is a documentary film that tells about a pilgrimage to Mecca by covering the stories of three Muslims from different continents. These people are the main characters of the movie: Fidelma O'Leary from Texas, Khalil Mandlasi from South Africa, and Ismael Mado who comes from Malaysia. The movie clearly shows all the rituals which are performed during the Hajj. Although the heroes of the film have different cultural backgrounds, they have the same religious goal which unites them in the holy place. This review will show that the movie does emphasize the crucial concepts of Islam such as equality, the sacred space and supporting weak by analysing different passages of the documentary and behaviour of main characters. The movie highlights the importance of the equality in Islam. According to Rahman, the goal of the Qur'an, which is the first source of Islamic law is an ethical and egalitarian social order (Rahman, 38). In one of the episodes, there was mentioned the term Ihram which was a special attire for men. Namely, Ihram constitutes for two pieces of cloth which are the same for everyone and men have to wear it during the pilgrimage. In this outfit wealthy and poor, literate and non-literate people do look identical. For example, Ismael holds a high job position and is very successful, but when he comes to Mecca he leaves his comfort life and wears Ihram which makes him similar to other Muslims. In addition, the second main hero of the documentary Khalil Mandlasi emphasizes the aspects of brotherhood and sisterhood in Islam and considers Hajj as a chance to see an ideal world in action. Khalil comes to Mecca from South Africa and strongly believes that despite the fact that people have different races and different economic statuses, they are all equal. It could be clearly seen from the experience of another character called Fidelma. Both of these heroes are the representatives of different nationalities, however, they feel themselves the same as other Muslims. Although, Khalil and Fidelma face some discrimination in Mecca, their ideals of Islam do not change to a great extent. Especially, when Khalil was circling around the Kaaba with other Muslims he gained that brotherhood and felt the equality which was clearly seen from his emotions. Therefore, by showing the significance of Ihram, motivation of Khalil to witness the Islamic brotherhood and depicting the stories of people with different background the movie underlines the concept of equality in Islam. The next aspect of Islam which is emphasized in the movie is the significance of the city Mecca and the most sacred site Kaaba. As it was shown in Eliade every religion had its own holy space which was a point of reference for the followers of the particular religious traditions (Eliade, 24), and Mecca is a sacred place in Islam. At the beginning of the documentary, it is pointed out that Mecca is a year round destination for Muslims and considered to be a sacred territory where hunting and fighting were prohibited. Moreover, Mecca played an important role even in pre-Islamic Arabia when people believed in many Gods and the Kaaba was the centre of various rites and rituals (Lecture The Origins of Islam). However, the Prophet Muhammad cleared Kaaba from idols and people worshipped to one God. The movie does demonstrate that the Kaaba is a symbol of worship to one God and millions of Muslims circle the Kaaba and pray during their Hajj. Furthermore, the main characters of the documentary were highly excited to visit Mecca and the Kaaba and were very happy to feel the atmosphere which was present in that holy place. Thus, the passages which contain interviews with the main heroes and different rituals such as going around the Kaaba clearly depict the significance of these places in Islam. Apart from equality and sacred space, the documentary shows how crucial it is to help poor people in Islam. It is worth mentioning that according to the Qur'an, Muslims should support vulnerable parts of society and take care of them (Rahman, 46). In one of the episodes, Khalil Mandlasi buys products for children of immigrants who live in Mecca in the ramshackle houses and tells that it was not the first time when he was doing that. This example clearly demonstrates that Muslims should provide help to those who need it. In conclusion, Inside Mecca is an exciting documentary that demonstrates all the stages of annual pilgrimage to Mecca and tells the story of three pilgrims. So, by discussing the experiences of these people and different passages of the movie, this review shows that the film highlights the Islamic concepts of equality, importance of Mecca and Kaaba and significance of supporting vulnerable parts of society.Reference list: Daniel Beben, The Origins of Islam (Lecture, Nazarbayev University).

Minneapolis : Bibliotheca Islamica, 1994."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Inside Mecca is a documentary film by National Geographic. The film illustrates a pilgrimage to Mecca, embark on hajj. It explains the religious rules of Islamic Hajj pilgrimage. The main characters of the film are Ismail Mahboob, Khalil Mandhlazi, and Fidelma O'Leary. All of them are different, they came from different countries, have a different ethnicity, speak different languages, have different social status. But there is one thing that unites them. It is their religion Islam. All three of them went to embark on Hajj. The film shows and explains different aspects of religious traditions as the rules of Muslim communities and rules of pilgrimage through different perspectives. This review will discuss how the religious traditions such as the meaning of equality in the Islam community and some arguments about the rules of the religion were highlighted in this documentary movie. There is an emphasis on being equal before God in Islam. This means that God does not separate people by their color, race, or wealth. Thus, being patient, toleranta and supporting each other is essential, especially during the embark on Hajj. This was highlighted in the movie, too. Before Hajj, all pilgrims wear a special cloth called Ihram. They walk 5 miles together, pray together and embark on Hajj together. Despite the fact that Ismail was a wealthy man, he left all his belongings and wear only Ihram as everybody did. He prayed and embark as everybody on the Hajj pilgrimage. Also, the movie showed an assistance during the Hajj. Fidelma says that there was a happy moment for her when the African man helped her to find a space and said: Alhamdulillah and praise be to God. I really was welcomed, she says. This exactly shows support in the Islamic community. Thus, the equality is very important during the Hajj in Muslim community. On the other hand, despite the fact that there is a rule of equality in Islam, the movie shows that it is not always the case. For example, people can get a VIP buffet, upgraded buses, and better tents with fewer people for extra money. It is explained that even if it is important to be equal before God, there is no prohibition on comfort as long as pilgrim can pay for it. Hence, it is unclear what equality mean exactly in Islam. Also, there is still a stereotype concerning Muslims. Fidelma is an American woman with blue eyes and Irish ethnicity. She faced some inequality during the Hajj as people were staring at her. Strangers tried to tell me what is like to be a Muslim and ask me if I am really a Muslim. I think they forgot for a moment that you can only be here if you are Muslim. It can be upsetting, she says. Khalil also felt uncomfortable as he wasn't treated as others due to his skin color. He complains: It is very painful to see this condition during the Hajj since we are here always in one community. Thus, the movie demonstrated that the Islamic religious tradition of equality is not always met as was expected. The movie also shows a pack of rules for doing Hajj, but also it mentions that there are still some misunderstandings regarding the religious rules. For example, in order to get a visa in order to enter holy places of Muslim, a person has to provide a certificate from the Mosque proving that he/she is a Muslim. Likewise, the Saudi Embassy requires male relative permission for a female to travel. As she was divorced, she asked her son to give her an official agreement. I have never read any restriction in the holy Quran. But I don't mind, because in Roman you do what all Romans do says Fidelma. Thus, even if there is nothing written in the Quran about those rules, there are still existing rules of the government regarding religion. Another misunderstanding happened during the ritual called the Jamarat, throwing stones at the walls. It was unclear how many stones should a pilgrim throw to Satan. While Fidelma mentioned that 47 stones are needed to be thrown, while another person said that there should be 49 stones. There is a confusion about how much punishment Satan should get, states the speaker in the movie. Hence, the amount of pebbles is conroversial. Those misunderstandings show the arguments on the rules of Islam still occur nowadays. In conclusion, the documentary movie Inside Mecca effectively showed and explained the Islamic tradition of pilgrimage from different perspectives of three different people. The movie also explained the term equality in Islam and some stereotypical vision concerning other races and ethnicity. Also it demonstrated some disputes in religious traditions as rules to get a visa to embark on Hajj or the amount of stones needed for Jamarat ritual."}, {"id": 29, "text": "I don't know why anyone would wanna go spend a week with three million sweaty people in the heat of the desert unless they really were doing this for the love of God - Fidelma O'Leary, the characters in the documentary, commented on Hajj.Hajj - one of the obligatory pilgrimages of Muslims to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, that is a holy city in Islam. It takes place annually and gathers in one place millions of people with one goal. At least once in a lifetime a Muslim needs to do Hajj, the religious duty that is depicted thoroughly in the documentary 'Inside Mecca' by National Geographic. In this review, the roles of the narrator and the main characters in depicting the Islam religion in the movie 'Inside Mecca' are going to be discussed. While the narrator gives the overview of the pillar Hajj, main characters in the faces of Ismail Mahbob, Khalil Mandhlazi, and Fidelma O'Leary share their experiences in this spiritual journey.Firstly, the role of the narrator in this documentary is crucial, since he gives the detailed information on the pilgrimage, on the processes and artfully connects them with the history. In the movie it is said that there was a holy place, the celestial house of God even before the creation. Its replica is Kaaba which symbolizes worship of one God, and now is located in the center of Mecca. Starting from this historic background, the narrator focuses on the 5 day quest for salvation during Hajj. The way he put the story of Abraham's life in line with all the stages of Hajj pilgrimage helps viewers understand not only the chronological order of the events, but also the meaning of the rituals performed by the Muslims. Together with that, he tells the story of 3 different pilgrims in order to get first-hand experience and feelings during religious rituals. For example, in history, it is written that God tested Abraham by asking to sacrifice his son, however the devil challenged him not to. Therefore, Abraham pelted the devil three times with stones. The spots were marked with stone pillars, and the story gave rise to one the rituals called 'Jumerat' where Muslims throw the stones into the pillars in order to affirm that there is good and evil. The narrator connects this story and consecutive ritual with the personal thoughts of one the main characters, Fidelma O'Leary. When she performs Jumerat, she feels like getting temptations and obsession out of her life. By this, the narrator tries to show not only the theoretical part but also the practical part of the religion through the performer's perception of the general means. Therefore, narrator plays an important role in familiazing viewers with pilgrimages in Islam religion.Secondly, stories from three different pilgrims give insights to the personal perception of the religion and spiritual experience. One of the messages of the main characters is that religion has no borders and is not limited to one culture. Faith in one God unites people from all over the world with different backgrounds and culture. Thus, Khalil from South Africa, Fidelma from the USA, and Ismail from Malaysia had the same goal, that is to undertake the Hajj. These not typical Muslim representative as we used to see, but the directors of the movie excellently showed that people with different paths could eventually fullfil their dream and goal despite obstacles on their way. For example, Fidelma told her story of becoming a Muslim. Raising in Christian family expected her to be also a Christian, thus her parents were shocked and hurt by the news of Fidelma changing her religion. Apart from that, her sibling were against her decision that make her way to Islam harder. However, she could withstand everything, even the fact that she needed permission from a male to go to Hajj. This was totally against her life principles and american morals, where females are free to do anything without an official document from men. The desire to go to Hajj and being a Muslim was more important than the cultural/social constructions.During Hajj, two pilgrims, Fidelms and Khalil, experienced some unexpected attitude from other Muslims towards them. Islam religion is about equality of all and the only destinction can be made between them is the amount of good deeds. However, two main characters faced discrimination from people who forgot this. Khalil was not welcomed by other South African people in the tent because of his skin color and he felt better to move in with Malawi people. It was painful for him to see such conditions in Hajj. Also, Fidelma was regularly asked whether she is a real Muslim, while only Muslims could get there. She was trying so hard to prove her religious beliefs. The movie also showed the violation of equal rights with the fact that in Mina vip tents were provided for the people who could afford them. These kinds of discriminations in terms of skin color, nationality and financial status hurted feelings of main characters, however teached them to be tolerant.Overall, the movie 'Inside Mecca' is worth watching to gain thorough knowledge about Hajj from the narrator and also get familiar with experiences of pilgrims. The stories of three pilgrims are not usual since they are not stereotypical Muslims as Arabic or Central Asian people, thus the movie showed obstacles they faced. However, we need to remember the fact that the documentary film was directed in 2003, many things have changed now. Islam has been spreading so fast around the world, so that there are a lot of Muslim around the world. Therefore the obstacles our three pilgrims faced in this film demonstrate us the beginning of this growth, since there were few 'unusual' Muslims in 2003."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Inside Mecca is the National Geographic documentary directed by Anisa Mehdi in 2003. It depicts the journey of different people around the world to Mecca. It introduces the intimate experience of pilgrimage that thousands of people do every year. The documentary is primarily focused on three people who intended to perform Hajj. This performance of Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam religion and as devoted Muslims, they spent several days imitating the journey of Prophet Muhammed. They follow the frustration, excitement, and struggle of a journalist from South Africa, a professor from the United States, and a businessman from Malaysia. The documentary successfully portrays the main goal of Hajj yet it perhaps intentionally distorts the rituals that Hajj consists of. The documentary effectively depicted the main idea of Hajj - clearing sins and strengthening the faith. In Islam religion, the purpose of the pilgrimage is to connect with God and deepen the faith by tracing the footsteps of Ibrahim and Ismael and Prophet Muhammed. It also involves imitating Hagar's search for water. It requires a state of pureness (ihram) and abstains from bodily pleasures, anger, and arguments. In this way, these practices give Muslim connection to the divine, so that now they entered this state of profane, they cannot sin or get angry. This film depicted these practices very well because they managed to show the intimate experience of each person. They also feel connected to the divine through Kaaba. The film claimed that if you have a glimpse of Kaaba, you are already lucky enough. According to Islam religion, they do not worship Kaaba, they worship what it represents - the house of God. That is why it is quite understandable why those people in the film got overwhelmed. For example, there was a scene when the professor from the USA starts crying and saying that she waited for so long to be there. She was vulnerable because perhaps she felt the most connected to God, which is one of the ultimate goals of Hajj. This connection is very important because it helps to resist human nature who tends to sin and fail the tests of Satan (Rahman, 1994) Moreover, the cloth they have to wear during Hajj is white. As the documentary states, it is done to show equality regardless of your social status, nationality, or ethnicity. This idea of Islam religion is depicted effectively by showing these people from different continents are in the end blended with other thousands of people who are also in white. Perhaps this white color also symbolizes that after Hajj people are reborn, and in Islam people are born pure, without any sins (Lecture materials). Lastly, perhaps one of the most important aims of Hajj is to make people better. Thus, the final day is dedicated to coming from ihram, and distributing livestock to the poor. Even the idea to chase out the evil from their lives is a good representation to sin less and become a better person. For example, the businessman from Malaysia stated that he wants to be a better father, a better worker, better leader, and better subordinate. As a result, these core Islamic ideas that inspire people to be better and strengthen their faith after pilgrimage are captured quite well in this film. This is ultimately what Rahman (1994) states in explanation of the Quran, that a person is the only one responsible for their acts of good and bad. By doing this Hajj, our characters in the film are showing their human agency since it is in human nature to know the difference between good and bad and to choose. However, upon closer examination, I can notice some intentional choices that were made to perhaps hinder the perception of Islam. Even though I appreciate that the film chose three people with a completely different background, it also seems that they wanted to emphasize that conventional Muslims are not welcoming towards outsiders. For example, the professor talked about her experience that sometimes true Muslims questioned the authenticity of her faith. During the Hajj, we can see the way the radio host is discriminated against because of his skin color. This forms the perception that traditional Muslims even in the Hajj have these biases and judgemental prejudice as if these rituals are done superficially instead of fully committing to the experience with the whole heart. Also, the tents that were built by the government completely contradict the idea of equality. People wear ihram to erase any differences among people, but the tents offer VIP surfaces for those who are willing to pay more. This highlights the social inequality by offering the rich more comfortable conditions during Hajj. Lastly, In the documentary, the ritual of casting stones in Mina to throw them at Satan, who comes to seduce people to do bad actions is ridiculized. They depict how some people throw away their belongings as well hinting that perhaps the Muslims take the ritual in a literal meaning. Thus, instead of working on themselves, they are willing to complete these rituals in an extreme way hoping that it might help. Overall, I think the documentary is a good insight into the Islamic world of performing Hajj. It successfully depicts the motivations, expectations of Muslims who decided to go to Mecca. I would recommend this film to those who have prior knowledge about Islam to notice some details that were distorted. It is important to mention that this was filmed in 2003. Maybe the experience of Hajj completely changed in 2020."}, {"id": 31, "text": "Hajj literally can be translated as a pilgrimage, is one of the five obligatory pillars of Islam, alongside with Shahadah, Sawm, Salat, Zakat. The movie Inside Mecca, directed by Anisa Mehdi, describes the rules to complete pilgrimage and the history of rituals, which must be going through by Muslims during the Hajj. The Hajj is shown via the prism of three pilgrimages from the United States, South Africa, and Malaysia. The prism helps to convey not only the descriptive information but also the emotions Muslims experience during the preparation and Hajj itself.In my opinion, this documentary has two main aims. The first goal is to introduce the essence of Islam religion to the National Geographic audience. This can be noticed from interviews with the main heroes of the movie: Fidelma, Khalil, and Ismail. In the beginning, they explain how they came to practice Islam and why they are still practicing it. It is worth mentioning that the director chose the representatives of all three races to influence more people and show that Islam is a universal religion that equalizes all people. In addition, the movie initially starts with basics and explains the core concepts such as 'ihram', 'Kabah', and other laws of Islamic Shari'a. The second objective is to provide a manual for beginner Muslims on how to complete all Hajj practices, alongside describing the history of each ritual. It can be noticed that most of the rituals are just reiteration of the actions completed by prophets Muhammad (s.a.s) and Abraham (a.s.). This reminds the concept of sunnah, in other words, the combination of practices of the Last Prophet that should be followed by Sunni Muslims. The logic behind that is quite simple. According to Islam ideology, to follow the behavioral role model of the Prophet will assure you his protection on the Judgement Day.Moreover, the movie captures the socioeconomic aspects of the trip to Mecca. The trading during the Hajj period is described as an integral part of the spiritual trip. It is the general knowledge that the prophet Muhammad (s.a.s.) was a tradesman and encouraged trading, of course, if all Shari'a laws were upheld. Since Islam promotes the idea of equality behind the Almighty, the situation with VIP tents in the Mina valley can seem controversial for most people. As the host of those tents said, VIP tent is just commonly accepted in society, indeed it is just simple trade of services for extra money. The fact that one individual can afford himself some extra services in contrast to you, does not make him more privileged in front of God. What differentiates one person from another in front of God are deeds and their intentions. Henceforth, providing such services is not prohibited by Islam law and should be interpreted in the right sense. Still, the structure of the plot, where Mecca gathered three pilgrimages of different races and from distinct social classes perfectly defines the idea of the unity of the Muslim community. Each of the three has own problems, worries, and story, but the strong sense of duty and desire to get closer to God unite all them.The racial discrimination of Khalil by the South African Muslim community is the only moment that surprised me. Unfortunately, the documentary does not provide complete details of the quarrel, so that the dispute cannot be properly analyzed. Still, most people can interpret this case as the inconsistency of Islam teachings. Indeed, Islam cannot be assessed by the behavior of its representatives or followers (Muslims). In this case, it is the South African community that discriminates Khalil, but not Islam. So, the mistakes and sins of Muslims should not be considered as misconceptions of Islam.The story of Kabah's construction demonstrates that this holy place is the most significant geographical object for all Abrahamic religions. Muslims consider Kabah as Bayt Allah, which is translated as House of God and pray five times a day in the direction of Kabah (qibla). The building process was initiated by prophet Adam (a.s.), the first person and prophet on the planet, and was continued by Abraham (a.s.) and his son Ismail (a.s.). Even if the Kabah was built by a common prophet of all three religions, Christians and Judaists do not consider or recognize this place as Muslims. However, this is the question for the larger analysis.To conclude, the movie perfectly transmits the emotions and worries of heroes that help to understand the significance of Hajj in the life of Muslims. Furthermore, the description of standard Hajj practices and traditions seem more interesting, when they are shown through the prism of history and using the specific stories of Fidelma, Khalil, and Ismail. The movie also does not ignore the socioeconomic side of the Hajj and demonstrates the influence of the Hajj on the economy of Mecca. Henceforth, I enjoyed watching this movie."}, {"id": 32, "text": "This film shows us why Mecca is main city for Muslims from all over the world. The director of the film depicts us how people do Hajj. Hajj is pilgrimage to holy city Mecca. Every year more than million pilgrims come to the Mecca to see the Holy city, but in Hajj season number of visitors reaches an unprecedent size. More than 2 million people from all over the world come to the Holy city in five days to show their obedience to God. In the same way, three main characters of the film from different parts of the world came here to ask for forgiveness and strengthen their faith. Each of them has different socio - financial status and origin, but each of them has the same goal - to undertake the Hajj. The director of the film decided to talk about Muslims, who are not typical for our society. We are used to remember representatives of Arabian nation while we hear word Muslim. In this case, no one of the main characters of the film is Arabian. As an example, Fidelma, a Muslim neuroscientist girl form the Texas, whose parents are Catholics. While studying at university she decided to convert Islam, which was a disappointment for her parents. The next character Halil, DJ on the radio in South Africa. According to him, he came to Mecca to increase his faith and to see Islamic brotherhood. Third character, Ismail, is wealthy official from Malaysia. He also came to Mecca to get out of his material comfort zone and to be spiritually renewed. Everyone entered the state of Ihram, which means to be one step closer to God, remaining calm and not irritate to Earth problems. Despite of the fact that the Hajj means to show everyone equal, as God servants, there are still some paradoxes and contradictions. For example, the first two characters faced on their trip stereotypical thinking about providing Muslims with Arabian people. Fidelma and her friends even had to pass special test to prove her spiritual readiness to perform the Hajj, because only Muslims can enter the Mecca. It seems paradoxical, knowing that Islam is the religion of the peace and kindness, and knowing that originally here lived the representatives of other religions (Berkey, 64). The film also did not avoid the problems of the government of Saudi Arabia, for which the Hajj is comparable to the Olympic games in terms of the number of foreigners. The documentary carefully tells about religious rites during the Hajj, leading to comments from the main characters and the government of Saudi Arabia. The Hajj itself is not a walk or a form of tourism, it is a test of the soul. For example, the first rite is a trip to the Mina valley, for which officials have prepared a huge camp in the desert. Despite the idea of the equality behind God during the Hajj, not everyone has equal comfort because of material and national differences. As an example, there may be VIP tents with better food, a smaller number of people in one tent and so on. Also, there are divisions for representatives of different nations. In one of these camps, Halil met with racism from people from his own state. Because of Ihram he couldn't be angry on them, but operators of the film accurately showed his disappointment, sadness and frustration. The next test was the journey to the plains of Arafat, what was culmination of the film. The real feelings of the main characters. Despite the differences in status and origin, each of them shown to be weak before Allah. The next and most dangerous task was throwing stones at the Devil. Even considering the measures taken by the state, people are not completely protected from accidental stones in their heads. Here, we saw differences in the beliefs of different people. It was shown in the example of a dispute when picking up stones to cast, when Fidelma was debating with one of the pilgrims on their number. We can see in this example how religion has changed over the years and how everyone interpreted Holy book in their way. Also, there were some argues, fuss even in the state of Ihram. During the return to the Mina valley, there were frequent skirmishes and swearing among the pilgrims. At the finish line, the pilgrims had to circumvent the Kaaba's sacred stone 7 times. According to Ibn Ishaq's The life of Muhammad, the Kaaba's sacred stone was built by the first prophet in Islam, Adam, and reconstructed by Abraham. A lot of attention was paid to the prophet Muhammad and the prophet Abraham in this film. The Director of the film sensitively uses parallel editing, telling about each ritual, using cuttings from various materials and explaining their origin, comparing journey of the prophet Muhammad and main characters journey. In the end, this film shows us how important Kaaba for Muslims from all over the world. As Fidelma said in the film, she saw the place where she wanted to be five times a day during her praying. However, the idea of unity, kindness and peace, there are a lot of contradictions, such as material and national difference."}, {"id": 33, "text": "Before the formation of life on the Earth, there was this celestial home of Allah - Kaaba. In our present day, one can visit it in the important for Muslim city Mecca. It stands for a symbol of the worship of one God only - the main essense of Islam which prohibits polytheism. According to all the sources provided during the course, starting from Berkey, it is said to be the place of pilgrimage for a myriad of generations. This sacred act of pilgrimage is said to change the life of every person as he or she will never return to the life they had before visiting it. The movie for which I'll be writing a review is a documentary released by National Geographic in 2003 which follows the three pilgrims from Malaysia, South Africa and America in their journey to the Holy Place of Kaaba for the Hajj. The movie opens with a scene demonstrating the non-stop preparations in the city of Mecca for Muslims who come there for the sacred act. As everything in this world has its own center whether with a spiritual or secular meaning, the city of Mecca and Islam also have their common heart - Kaaba, a stone building of 50 feet high to which's direction all Muslims face to pray. It is the important part of the pious mentality of humankind's spirituality. There comes up an interesting question of who built the Kaaba? One muslim tradition says that it was constructed based on a cosmic plan given by God to Adam and then restored by the Prophet Abraham. On the Kaaba's southeast corner, there is a black stone framed of silver. According to one type of people, it fell down from the heavens and is seen as a sacred stone which was used by the Prophet Abraham during reconstruction. The first pilgrim introduced in a movie catches an eye of the viewer with her being raised as a Catholic. What is important to note here is that despite having not even a single Muslim around her, the professor of neuroscience - Fidelma's questioning of her own faith led to conversion. In an interview, she sounds sincerely happy that she found a religion that speaks to her and that she loves from the bottom of her heart. I think that the director specifically selected three pilgrims from completely different places in the world with non-similar backgrounds to show that the belief in one God, one Holy Book - Quran is what unites them as Muslims. According to the Cambridge Companion of the Quran, this essentially is one of the goals of Quran - to bring back the harmony and unity of Islam. So, the second pilgrim is the radio commentator shaped by the racial strife of South Africa - Halil for whom Hajj is the opportunity to get a glimpse of the ideal world of Islam in action. His words match with the information given in Rahman's book Major Themes of the Quran that the Quran numerously puts emphasis on the equality of all humankind in front of Allah. So, no wealth, status, body or face places you in a special position in Islam. What is important is the strong belief in one God and the morals of the Quran in your heart. Finally, in the scene where the viewer is introduced with the third pilgrim from Malaysia - Ismail, it highlights the previous idea that one will make a pilgrimage to the desert not covered in wealth clothes but in a towel - Ihram in order to find out what one is made of. The spiritual journey in search of redemption and being closer to God emphasizes the practice of austerity and modesty in Islam. One of the crucial points mentioned in the movie is that one should go for a Hajj prepared with a legitimate knowledge of rituals and recitals of the Quran. Coming back to the Cambridge Companion of the Quran, non-Arabian Muslims like Fidelma must adhere to Quran - God's revelations and study it. Another interesting moment occurs when in the documentary, it says that the male relative of the woman must give permission to the woman going to Hajj. This finds its explanation in Major Themes of the Quran: Men are in charge of women because God has given some humans excellence over others and because men have the liability of expenditure(33). The documentary then says what was mentioned in the lectures of professor Daniel Beben, that the the pre-Islamic pagans, Arabs practiced the pilgrimage to Mecca which stands as a proof that it is far older than Islam. The Prophet Abraham with whom the God has made a convent is known as a father of monotheism - father of Jews, Christians and Muslims. God tells Abraham to send his wife's slave - Hagar and their son Ismail away to start another kingdom. Despite being sad about this Abraham follows whatever God says. Following God's words, he then builds Kaaba and calls people for pilgrimage. Yet, over time, people of Arabian Peninsula started to practice a variety of different polytheistic religious traditions - a series of local cults marking it as a quite decentralized religious tradition. So, within the building of Ka'aba, there were various statues of different Gods and Goddesses, maybe even of Christian iconography. Later, in the 7th century, this place became a major focus of the career of Prophet Mohammad, who wanted to return the Kaaba to monotheistic religious tradition - Islamic tradition. Returning back to the story of three pilgrims, after they come back from spending a week in the Holy city of Medina, old Yathrib, the final step of pilgrimage is the visit of Kaaba. It is a magnificent and emotionally-overwhelming scene to see the tens of thousands Muslims performing Tawaf - a rite of circling around the Kaaba seven times altogether in harmony. This puts a significant emphasis on a point that in spite of nationality, race or color of skin, all Muslims from different places all over the whole come in a unity to worship one God - Allah. That is a power of Islam! However, the documentary also shows the other side, not so pleasurable to experience, of Hajj. That is, Fidelma being an American and having an outer appearance that is different from that of other people in Hajj faces questions from other women: Are you really Muslim? Halil, too, experiences an upsetting treatment for the reason of having a black skin. Yet, these are one of many trials that humans may experience during their lives. Besides, having worn Ihram, being in a sacred place and in a state of ritual sanctity, Muslim should not lose his temper. Moreover, this only proves what has been mentioned in the two sources that Allah is graceful and will always be there for those who show repentance for their bad deeds. To sum up, the documentary gives a rich insight into the act of pilgrimage where the soul and inner search is put into the center of religious tradition. From the start to the end, it does a great job of demonstrating Kaaba as a symbolic center of Islam which allows to perform rituals to show one's commitment to one God only. In doing so, it prominently conveys the emotions of pilgrims for whom seeing this sacred place towards which they have been praying for many years is the most meaningful and emotionally overwhelming moment in their lives. It also illustrates that illiterate and literate, wealthy and poor, disabled and healthy - everyone is put down on the same level emphasizing the equality of the whole humankind during the pilgrimage."}, {"id": 34, "text": "The movie impressed me with the idea of putting the story of Abraham in line with how the pilgrimage to Mecca is happening nowadays. The chronological order of the events and all of the rituals being explained thoroughly with sufficient amount of details are the points I would like to emphasize. It was not hard to understand the historical background of the creation of the religion, following the life path of the holy patriarch and seeing how all of these details and events in the past (i.e. the main story line) apply to the current pilgrimage process. With the proper timing and explanation a lot of things in Islamic concept of pilgrimage became clear. The main structure of the film consists of explanation of the main idea of the rituals, providing the picture of how the ritual is happening in real and interviewing three main pilgrim characters of the movie. I really liked the diversity of the three main characters. This way filmmakers highlighted the idea of Islam being the religion with no restrictions in terms of the background, race or ethnicity of the person. Taking Malaysian, South African and American people with different social and economic status and showing their similar reactions to the fact that they established a connection with God is really impressive. For me, the most affecting story was of Fidelma from Texas who has a difficult life path with her mother being sick, with divorce and father who passed away. I think showing the way she is preparing for the pilgrimage and taking all of the necessary rituals seriously is conveying a deep meaning, revealing that being committed to a religion you choose on your own is not impossible. Of course, we see a lot of judgment in her direction and we see some organizational issues with her son giving her permission to go as he is the only male member of the family. But we also see the way she deals with all of that. She demonstrates full understanding of all of the hardships she is going to experience and shows the total preparedness to that. In terms of the Malaysian character Ismail, the whole movie we saw him being rational and cold-minded but towards the end we see him crying because, presumably, he felt the true connection with God. It again shows us the scope of the pilgrimage and its importance in the Islamic world. Another aspect worth mentioning is the civility of the whole procession and organization of the host country. For example, the organization of people in tents of Mina or providing people with clothes, organizing a Feast and being able to accept more than 2 million people shows the seriousness with which people perceive the whole event. The only worrying aspect was the sort of discrimination during the settling in Mina where there are certain tents for the so-called VIP. The situation with the South African pilgrims was also worrying because the idea of equality was broken. There were, for certain, some sort of downsides of the movie, which included the quality of the video fragments and the majority of time narrator speaking. I think it would be good if there were more interviews with the experts and specialists. Their credibility and experience are richer and their commentaries to the most of events described in the story would make a movie more engaging and interesting. Taking into account, how hard it was to shoot the scenes in the epicenter of the pilgrimage, I would say that film producers and operators did a good job trying to convey the vibe and atmosphere of what was happening at that time in Mecca. The whole narration was presented in a neutral form not showing it in a propagandistic or, otherwise, criticizing way. I think anybody who will watch the movie would find it more informative than influential. From the movie we can clearly see that in Islamic religion the process of approaching the Holy is not only very serious and widespread but also tiresome and difficult. Filmmakers successfully showed how hard it is to go along the way and survive through the hardships of sleeping in tents or under the stars, being under the danger of being hit by the stones, go a long way to the plain or the hills in order to perform a certain ritual and get used to the crowd always being around. I really liked the movie from the perspective of a person who have always been living in the Muslim environment. For me, there were a lot of new information and I saw the ritual, about which I've been told in a vague and unclear way. Now I saw it from the objective and unbiased perspective, also seeing the particular stories taken into account."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Ilyas Emirkhan Demir Dr. Daniel Beben REL 110 April 19, 2020 Film Review on Inside Mecca, 2003 This documentary was created especially for the city called Mecca in Saudi Arabia because of its holiness with strong religious background. Mecca was believed as the city where most of the Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were originated. The history of the Mecca was beginning with the prophet Abraham, he went there and built the Kaaba because God told him to do. It was believed that after the flood the Kaaba was rebuild again. Most of the people know that Kaaba is emerged during the Islam in the 7th century. Although the emergence of Kaaba was way before that. This shows that the city of Mecca was always important because people before Islam were worshipping to the idols, several gods and goddesses. This indicates that before Islam in Mecca people were believing in Polytheism. Although, interestingly, Mecca was always the place where god pointed at, and most of the prophets were following God's orders in Mecca. When Islam has emerged, Prophet Muhammed ordered to abolish the idols in Kaaba, because people were worshipping them instead of God. When each Muslim makes his or her prayers they always should face Kaaba because it is the center of the world or universe. However, Mecca known as the most important place in Islam because of its mandatory religious duty of all Muslim people. At least ones every Muslim should visit Mecca. The haj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. The Mecca is famously known as the hose of Allah (God). Especially during Haj there more than two million visitors. This holy site of Mecca is a direct connection to God. Every person could talk with God and pray directly to him to avoid all the sins which were done before. This is the purification site of all Muslims. God gives a chance to be purified and to reborn to the world again. This documentary explains the journey to Haj by concentrating on three main characters who are traveling to Mecca to perform their mandatory duties in front of God. It is very hard to go there because each person should prepare for the Haj in order to know all the rituals that needed to be followed. It is very fascinating that only Muslim people enter Mecca. But it is important to mention that people go there not to worship Kaaba, they go there to worship God. It is the home of God and you are very close to God when you are there. The Quranic text that is written on the cover of the Kaaba is made out of gold and more than five million dollars is spent to do this wonderful cover. There are golden doors and the black stone which was believed as the stone which fell from the sky. Fidelma is a US citizen who was converted to Islam and she took the journey to Haj in order to perform her religious duty. She explains how the Saudi Government was controlling everything before entering Mecca. The second main Character was the Ismail from Malasia. He was also performing his religious duty by traveling to Haj. It is believed that for almost fourteen hundred years Mecca considered as the house of Muslims. The documentary points out that there three pilgrimages as we call, Arafat, Stoning Satan and Circling the Kaaba. These three pilgrimages are the most important ones. People before going to the Kaaba they have a special cloth called Ihram contained two pieces of cloth. This cloth indicates equality before god during the Haj. The 7 top hills are the story when Hagar and Abraham went to Mecca and her son was so thirsty and she was walking fast up and down of hill to find water for her child. Eventually, she found spiritual Zem-Zem water. On the last day of haj people visit the mountain Arafat to communicate with God and ask forgiveness from him for their sins. Ismail was crying because he was feeling God on Arafat and he was so thankful because he talked with God. The Arafat ends after the sunset. The second pilgrimage is the stoning Satan to break ties with Satan forever. People throw about 47 stones to Satan and some people are throwing slippers because they are angry to Satan. After the stoning the Satan, men at Haj cut their hair. After that, you sacrifice the lamb because God says to Abraham to sacrifice his child Ishmail but after all that God stops him and says to sacrifice the lamb. Satan is stoned in this case because he was whispering to Abrahams's ear not to kill his son. But Abraham throws to Satan three stones. Abraham is about to kill his son and god stopped him. This was the message that Abraham was loyal to God. After the stoning Satan, everyone celebrating this day in Mecca. The last pilgrimage is known as the Circling the Kaaba seven-time like the prophet Muhammed did. Then it ends and most of the sacrificed meat is distributed all around the world to feed poor people. However, according to Fazlur Rahman, Abraham was beliving in Monotheism even before the creation of Islam. The image of Abraham as the arch monotheist is asserted against the Meccan pagans toward the end of the Meccan period where (suras 6.al-Anam and 12.Yusuf) the stories of earlier prophets except Abraham have ceased and where, in 6.al-An am:74 ff., after detailing how Abraham arrived at the idea of monotheism after eliminating astral gods one by one. (Rahman, 99) This is the clear indication that Abraham is a very influential figure in Islam and this quote is justifying that Abraham was believing to one God and he was the true follower which was about to sacrifice his son for the sake of God or even future Islam. He showed the best example of avoiding Satan by throwing stones to him. The Fazlur Rhamans reading is directly connected to this documentary because he explains the Abraham's life and his life is very much connected to the stories which was explained in this documentary."}, {"id": 36, "text": "The authors attempted to show the three distinct perspectives and backgrounds coming together in the name of Allah. The movie provides an inside look at the journey to Mecca taken by the Muslims from Malaysia, South Africa and the United States. Every year before the Ramadan, all Muslims make a pilgrimage to Mecca, which is believed to be a sacred place for the Muslims. Even before the city was declared as such, it was prohibited to hunt, cut trees or even fight in the city. Mecca is deeply associated with the Hajj because of the Great mosque of Mecca, al-Masjid al-Haram, where there is Kaaba, which is claimed to be the focus of the Prophet Mohammed's studies. According to the stories, Kaaba was built by Adam from the stones handed down to him by God. The building was later on rebuilt by Abraham, who tried to save the building after the flood. The first character, Dr. O'Leary, lives in the USA, where she prepares to make her first pilgrimage to Mecca. Even though Dr. O'Leary was born and raised as a Catholic, she has made a decision to become a Muslim claiming that she felt the sense of belonging to Islam. Dr. O'Leary's path to Islam has started after she had begun questioning how the Christians could worship the God, if the God was believed to be the same as Jesus Christ. Apart from the difficulties of discovering the new to her religion, dr. O'Leary has faced a lot of disapproval and rejection not only from the society but even from the members of her own family, who for a long time could not forgive her for converting to Islam. However, according to Dr. O'Leary, she never doubted her belief, as she knew that her intentions were coming from her heart. Despite the fact that Islam did not fit the social norms accepted by her circle, she did not feel like giving up. In the end, she has found the women, who shared her aspirations and her belief in Allah and who she joined in the Hajj. In South Africa, Halil, a radio commentator, spends one day in a week inviting people to Islam by sharing his thought and explaining certain aspects of religion on the radio. As Halil claims, he is attracted to Islam because of the idea that it promotes on the brotherhood and sisterhood of people from all parts of the world who share the love for God. The third character, Ismail, is a Muslim, who lives in Malaysia. The movie shows how he and his wife prepare for Hajj, leaving their four kids at home. The pilgrimage to Mecca plays a special role in his life, since it allows him to forget about everything but his belief and values. Apart from the desert, heat and a big concentration of people the characters are faced with the prejudice coming from their Muslim brothers and sisters, who question their belief in Allah. However, they all soon become reminded that God does not look at the race, ethnicity, age, gender or the level of income, it only looks at the heart. The thoughts, actions and intentions are all that matter in religion. I believe the movie shows how the religion unites people from all over the world. All three characters emphasized the important role Islam played in their lives. Even though the characters came from the different backgrounds, they all shared the same thing in common - Islam. In my opinion, the movie also attempted to demonstrate the importance of Hajj. During the journey, the characters, who traveled through a desert, wearing the long robes, were reminded to be patient with things and other people. Despite all the difficulties, the characters' belief in God has helped them to stay calm and positive."}, {"id": 37, "text": "This documentary by the National Geographic on Islam clearly demonstrates both the beauty of this religion and the challenges some of the followers face. The viewers can get acquainted with Islamic history and traditions while understanding their significance. Moreover, most importantly the documentary shows the significance of the city of Mecca, Ka'aba, and the Hajj which is a pilgrimage performed during the lifetime of the Muslims. In the beginning, we might see the elements of monotheism. As it was said, Ka'aba symbolizes the worship of the one God, the God of Abraham. However, it is also mentioned that for many centuries this was a place that united not only Muslim people but also the believers of other Abrahamic religions. The film not only shows people's experience of getting to Ka'aba but the power behind it. The narrators, as well as the characters themselves, tell us the spirit of unity they feel in the sacred place. As said by Dr. Umar F. Abd-Allah this is the central place for the Muslim religion. Bowing and reading prayers can show how people's spirit is one with their body which are not separated in Qur'an (Rahman 12). As written by Berkey (60), Islam got influenced by several religions that existed before, including Abrahamic ones. For that reason, throughout the film, the viewer can hear the names of Abraham, who rebuilt Ka'aba, and Adam, who put a starting stone on it. These names take their start in Judaism and Christianity. We also notice the importance of the ruler in the religion when King Faisal enters Ka'aba and does the washing. The same also could be seen in Christianity in the Roman Empire as well as in Orthodox Christianity. For example, Ecumenical councils which were organized by Roman emperors. Another important point in the film is economic equality before God. As we could notice people were dressed in white attire, ihram, which lets all the people look the same and be equal, despite different economic and educational backgrounds. As said in Qur'an, a person should not be tied to his/her wealth (Rahman 27). Ismail, the executive from Malaysia, was taking only a few clothes to Mecca as his pilgrimage was not about material goods but spiritual salvation. It is also demonstrated that in Islam giving back to people is important. In the video, Khalil was bringing the food for those in need. According to Rahman (27), there is an existing tax in Islam called Zakat. It stands for sharing the wealth with the others who need it the most. It is important to do this not to please God but rather from sincere intentions. Due to the documentary, we understand the importance of pilgrimage. This is shown as every Muslims' mission that he/she should accomplish during the lifetime. In addition, according to Rahman (23), this can also be considered as one of the steps of practicing knowledge. Rahman says there are 3 types of knowledge in Islam, where the second stands for traveling around the globe, experiencing the world, and gaining the knowledge ourselves. Aside from the pilgrimage, people have exercised many different rituals that were originally performed by the Prophets during their lifetime as their repeated actions or actions they made that had significance in Islam. One of those, as we can see is ram cutting. As demonstrated in the video, the story behind is Abraham's burden to kill his son. He had doubts about whether to do it or not. However, when he finally decided on committing to that Gabriel replaced the son with the ram. This tradition is performed as a sacrifice of the people who come to Mecca. Another one represents circling Ka'aba 7 times which was once done by the Prophet Muhammad. However, on the negative side, the viewers see the challenges that people from non-Muslim countries might face. We saw that Fidelma came through some difficulties being white American. Her family could not accept her decision of convergence, which shows that religion plays an important role in one's life. It not only affects people's beliefs but their day to day life and habits as well. We can also consider a point that there might be a social stigma that does not associate white Americans with Muslim religion. This can be supported by the fact that Fidelma was the only Muslim she had known when she converted. In addition to the challenges confronted by her, it is also noticeable that both Khalil and Fidelma face some discomfort because of their skin color while their visit to Mecca. People would be asking where they are from pointing their non-typical Muslim appearances. As they were in the Holy place they had to handle their difficulties with calm. To sum up, the documentary does a good job of providing the viewers the insides of what happens during Hajj, showing the background history and rituals of Islam, while pointing out the diversity of people that follow it. Having watched it, I realized that Hajj was not only the journey people should go through but also an experience that allows them to obtain a sense of community. Besides educating the viewers, the documentary shows us how some of the Muslims can be treated unequally because of their background. It is also important to mention that the narrators were presenting this experience from the more or less neutral perspective, where they were not judging Islamic traditions through the prisms of other religions. I would definitely recommend watching it to the people interested in this topic.Works Cited: Berkey, Jonathan. The Formation Of Islam. Cambridge University Press, 2012, pp. 57-75. Rahman, Fazlur.

This film is about the Hadj which is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims wish to do that in their life. The film represents what happens during Hajj including its seven stages. Importantly, the film tries to show not only physical actions that people do during Hajj, but it represents the reasons for every stage, the feelings of people, and their motivation to do those actions. The review will be about the importance of Hajj for the characters in the movie. Inside Mecca displays the story of three Muslims making their Hajj by emphasizing their feelings from the time of preparation to Hajj at their home till the end of their pilgrimage. Those three Muslims are Ismail Mahbob, Khalil Mandhlazi, and Fidelma O'Leary who are from Malaysia, South Africa, and America. Even though those people are from different parts of the world, their aim and reasons for performing Hajj were the same. All three of them like all Muslims decided to perform Hajj that tests both the body and soul because of their true belief in Islam. As Fidelma said during the movie: I don't know why anyone would wanna go spend a week with three million sweaty people in the heat of the desert unless they really were doing this for the love of God, Muslims perform Hajj to revive their relationship with God which plays a crucial role in their life. In the beginning, all three people were very happy and motivated during the preparation for Hajj. At that moment, the film shows various backgrounds of those people which clearly emphasizes that the Muslim population is very widespread all over the world. Even though they live in very different places with different cultures, their love and belief to only one God are the same. It shows the powerful side of Islam which is equality. Every person who wants it can become a Muslim, and I think it is a true representation that Islam is a religion for all mankind. The film talks about the background and everyday lifestyle of those three Muslims separately. The story of Fidelma O'Leary is very unique and it is not possible to watch it without feeling her sincerity. Although she was not from a Muslim family and did not have any Muslim friends, she could find spiritual peace in Islam and just embraced it and loved it. One of the reasons for her conversion to Islam was that she does not understand why Jesus worship God if he is God in terms of Christianity. As it is given in the film, Muslims don't worship the Kaaba, but they believe in one powerful God. Additionally, in the book called Cambridge Companion to the Quran, it is written that Jesus is God's servant and His Prophet while for Christians Jesus is God. It seems to me that the abidance of the idea of one God and the actions that confirm Muslims' belief in this idea was the big reasons why she decided to convert to Islam. God is one, but people may recognize Him and come to Him in different ways. The story of this brave woman who did not refuse the religion even though her relationship with her family was almost breaking down shows unbelievable support from God that Muslims are able to feel. In addition, the film tells the story of Khalil Mandhlazi who is from South Africa. He was talking about equality and the primary importance of the pure heart in his religion all over the film. It is very important to mention that the concept of racial equality in Islam is fascinating. However, the film has the fragment where Khalil was upset about the situation in which some people were served differently because they had more money. He said: it is very painful to see this condition happening during the Hajj since we are here always in one community not looking to the color and not looking to the rest or whether you are rich or poor. Importantly, he showed true patience that every Muslim should have in spite of that situation. Another character was Ismail Mahbob. His personal story was about motivation to live better. After finishing his Hajj, he said: I want to be a better father, a better worker, better leader, better subordinate I want to play a better role. This is a clear representation of that the Hajj and the religion itself motivate people to live better, and it is very good. Finally, I believe every person deserves to live an ideal life for him. The film represents the Hajj as an ideal world of Islam in action, and it is amazing to see true happiness in the face of people having their ideal world during performing the Hajj."}, {"id": 39, "text": "The movie Inside Mecca was made in 2003 by the National Geographic and pictures annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Long before the emergence of Islam, territory of Mecca was divine and today, there is a great mosque inside of which Ka'aba is located. It is not the Ka'aba itself what Muslims worship, but what it represents - the one God. Ka'aba is a stone with golden doors and inside, there is a room. It was built by Adam and rebuilt by Abraham. Also, there is a black stone on one of the Ka'aba's corners that all Muslims want to touch or see. The movie tells different people's stories about their pilgrimage to Mecca, particularly Fidelma's, white American women, Halil's, black men from South Africa and Ismail's from Malaysia. This review will consider Hajj's rules and argue that they are oppressive towards some people and result in unwelcoming occasions despite its initial aims. The government of Saudi Arabia, where Mecca is located, controls the whole process of pilgrimage, from visa applications by pilgrims to security on sites. Strict security measures are justified because there are about 2 million of people coming to perform Hajj and all of them mostly are gathered at the same place. It is very hard to provide security for such amount of people who gather at one place. Fidelma was born in a Christian family and converted to Islam later. Her parents were not welcoming such conversion. For her, it was very challenging to get a visa because she had to prove that she is Muslim by getting a document from her imam in Texas. Also, she needed a permission from a relative male to travel to Saudi Arabia. Because she was divorced, she had to ask her son to write such permission. Apart from that, there is a certain dress-code for women who wish to perform a pilgrimage. A group, that Fidelma was travelling to Mecca with, was advising her on that matter by saying what would be appropriate to wear and what will people say about the way she will look. Such measures are restrictive and oppressive towards Muslim women and particularly towards non-Arab Muslim women. According to rules of Hajj, people who perform pilgrimage are restricted from having pleasure and anger during it. However, the movie depicts hostile environment for Muslim minorities, particularly for Fidelma and Halil based on their gender and race identities. When pilgrims were spending a night in tents, people were curious how can white women be a Muslim. They also were doubting her religious affiliation despite the fact that she proved it to the Saudi Arabian government upon arrival to Mecca. Halil who was spreading the information about Islam via radio in South Africa, faced similar problems. People from South Africa also doubted that he is a Muslim because he had a different skin colour - black. He then had to join Malawi Muslims to have a prayer. Such occasion, occurring during the Hajj are not something good because at its very essence, Hajj is not a place for hostile environment. This can be proven by the rule that makes all pilgrims to dress in the same way so that their backgrounds are not visible to others. It makes it impossible to tell how rich or poor, educated or illiterate, etc. the person is. The main aim for doing so is to show people that they are all equal for God. In fact, the movie argues that it unites people, they communicate with each other easily without social borders during the Hajj. However, inequality still has a place there. There are service during the Hajj that allow people to have special treatment like less people in a tent, buffet or transport with air conditioning for an additional price. In conclusion, it can be argued that it is not Islam that does not welcome non-Arab people but the people who are part of it."}, {"id": 40, "text": "Inside Mecca is a documentary film about Muslim pilgrimage, the hajj. It was directed by Anisa Mehdi and describes how three pilgrims from Malaysia, the United States, and South Africa travel to Mecca. The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and every Muslim must perform it at least once in life. The film shows in detail every part of a pilgrimage, its rituals and where did they come from. In addition, it reveals the inner life of Mecca as a city, showing both dark and bright sides. The film succeeded in showing what it is like to make the hajj and how Muslims feel about the holy place of Islam. One of the crucial points of the film is that Islam is available and open for every person and that everyone is indifferent when it comes to religion. It shows the viewer how three people perform hajj, Muslim pilgrimage tradition. It is worth mentioning, how profoundly directors captured the personal aspect of stories of all main characters. Every single of them has something that touches the viewer. Ismail Mahbob's line is about human's demand for spiritual fulfillment. It shows how people realize that materialistic attainments cannot provide complete satisfaction and how they start to care about the spiritual dimension of their lives. Another line is about South African radio commentator, Khalil Mandhalzi, who at some point experiences discrimination due to his race. And the last, Fidelma O'Leary's story tells how even being from a family that practices different religion people still may convert to Islam and be truly devoted despite all the resistance they meet. All of them are of different nationalities, different races, coming from different parts of the world and having drastically different backgrounds. There are millions of other people who have disparate lives. And one thing that unites all of them is their faith and goal to step up on a higher spiritual level. The film messages ironical contrast of equality and inequality, when first we introduced to ihram clothing that makes all people look the same, puts the body to basics and then see different service levels and discrimination towards black people. However, when it comes to the truly holy core of hajj, everyone is indifferent. Another noteworthy point film makes is that pilgrimage to Mecca goes beyond Islam. It starts with lines about the creation of the Kaaba: it was created even before everything else did. Then, according to film, Adam and Eva meet each other at the mountain Arafat, near Mecca, and Adam built the first building of Kaaba. Hundreds of years passed and Abraham rebuilt the Kaaba as we know it nowadays. Abraham presented as founder of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and the one, who with his family established pilgrimage rituals and traditions. Based on this, we can assume Mecca as the center not only of Islam but of all Abrahamic religions in general and even the Universe. Film notes that besides monotheistic traditions, Mecca was the major pilgrimage point of polytheism too. The Kaaba was full of idols and people were coming there long before the prophet Muhammad lived. By all of these, the film points out the historical importance of Mecca. This brings us to the concept of sacred space. For a religious man, it is a space of high significance, as opposed to unfamiliar, inhomogeneous profane space. It establishes orientation and stability to the religious man's world (Eliade n. d.). According to this, Mecca serves as a sacred space and origin for the Muslim world. The film conveys this deep feeling of connection to divine experienced by millions of pilgrims coming year-round. It shows how everyday life, infrastructure and business in Mecca are all based on the pilgrimage. Every part of the city is influenced and formed by this phenomenon. People strive to perform hajj despite all difficulties they experience. We see how the main characters and other people surrounding them struggle financially, physically, but still, do it with a great feeling of redemption and spiritual fulfillment. The film shows genuine emotions of people when they visit places, where centuries ago prophets Muhammad and Abraham stood, when they perform practices that the Quran characters did, and most remarkably when they feel meeting almighty God one-to-one. People all over the world perform this challenging and at some point dangerous journey lasting five days to attain forgiveness and intangible rebirth at the end. The film Inside Mecca satisfactorily shows the process of performing the hajj, Muslim pilgrimage. Its advantage is that it tells this from the point of view of three different pilgrims, thanks to this it felt like I went on a journey with them. The film also provided some historical background of the city and rituals. Most remarkably for my review, it created a space for deeper analysis of the concepts of religious practices and sacred space. In conclusion, the film showed the indifference of people in spiritual aspect and how deep feeling of devotion and seeking for sacred origin brings millions of people the holy city of Mecca."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Inside Mecca is a National Geographic documentary directed by Anisa Mehdi illustrating the first-hand experience of three pilgrims (Ismail Mahbob, Khalil Mandhlazi, and Fidelma O'Leary) participating in one of the most important events in the Muslim society, - the Hajj. Being one of the five foundational pillars of Islam, the pilgrimage takes place in Mecca, - the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad. Therefore, the scale of the event and its importance can hardly be overestimated. The fact that all three people were not actors, and had different backgrounds makes this movie exceptionally fascinating and informative. Not only does the movie show the historical significance of the city of Mecca, and explains the universal principles of Islam, but it also creates the conditions for real immersion in the history of each character by demonstrating every step and its significance on their way to perform Hajj. The very foundational principle of Islam is that everybody is equal before God. However, there are more than one examples of the inclusion issues that took place during their spiritual journey. Despite the fact that such social inequality cases occasionally take place, the Hajj still unites millions of Muslims from every part of the world, in attaining a common goal - showing submission to God and relieving their souls from sins. Thus, you will witness very similar, yet completely different incredible experience. The narration starts with Fidelma, a professor (who was raised as a Catholic) willing to make her journey from the heart of Texas to Mecca. The movie introduces her challenge by a phrase she has a little physiology to take care of, which makes it funny but thought-provoking at the same time. Before the pilgrimage Fidelma needs to prove she is Muslim by gaining a certificate from her mosque, along with asking for a permission to go there from her son. This beautifully illustrates the discrimination towards women, as a permission from a male relative is mandatory for them. Though, this very important detail at least provides information for the audience. It is also worth to mention that the movie is good at illustrating the true emotions of the characters. For example, standing nearby Kaaba makes Fidelma cry, and this once again highlights how majestic this place is for her. But tears of happiness gave way to indignation, as some people asked her if she really was a Muslim. In my humble opinion this was just a curiosity, since later Fidelma and other Muslims were helping each other to climb the Mountain of Jabal Rahmah (the Mountain of Mercy), and later she was praying together with the other women. This way or another, Fidelma performs her pilgrimage successfully in the atmosphere of safety and respect. For the other character, a man named Khalil, - a radio broadcaster from a rural area of South Africa, the most important things are brotherhood and sisterhood, as he struggled with the racial discrimination. From his story we understand that equality before God, and charity are one of the basic principles of Islam. However, both Khalil and me were surprised by two things: a navigation sign saying All South Africans are aside, and the fact that he was almost the only person bringing food for the poor (let's not forget that 2 million people visit this place for the pilgrimage annually). So, there is still a place for discrimination, both racial and economic (or financial). But then again, as he is in the state of ritual sanctity, Khalil manages to keep calm and perform Hajj, and have left the place being very happy. Now we are in Malaysia. Ismail seems to seek for leaving all his material beings (that he used to possess) and truly unite with God. However, certain people still can afford themselves more comfortable conditions, which makes them privileged to some extent. His experience of traveling is contrasted with the Khalil's one, as the latter one has to catch a bus and sometimes walk. But then the movie quickly balances out these discriminatory vibes by showing a room, where all men wear Ihram (special clothes), and emphasizing that people's education, social status are no more important. Or are they? During the whole period we see how the conditions differ from person to person: one sitting on the ground under the heat, the other sitting in an air-conditioned bus, holding a cup of tea. I appreciated that the movie shows the other side of the coin: all the risks during the ritual of throwing stones at Satan, graphical illustration of animal sacrificing, and that Hajj requires both mental and physical perseverance. So, you don't only get the spiritual and beautiful part of the pilgrimage, but also its the uncomfortable and dangerous bits. I also have gained a lot of information while watching the movie about the religion itself. Starting from the walking seven times between the hills, drinking Zamzam water, throwing stones at Satan, and circling the Kaaba, all the rituals were tightly connected with the story of Abraham, and the prophet Muhammad. More to the point, the best feature of this movie is that it shows the experience of real people. People from different national, economic background, two men and a woman, which makes it possible to reveal not the religious aspects of the process, but also the gender and racial discrimination that could be experienced by the pilgrims. Last, but not least reason I totally recommend this movie for everybody is because it is filmed in such a way that you feel like you are there, so that you feel an actual connection with the people, and thus gain a broader view on the whole process. By the end of the video, all three pilgrims became better versions of themselves, while I gained a better version of my brains."}, {"id": 42, "text": "Inside Mecca 2003 is a National Geographic documentary film, which is about a spiritual journey to pilgrimage to Mecca for the Hajj. The film manages to illustrate how Islam brings people from everywhere to this place, and it shows that while people are directed to the heart of Islam, they believe that God is looking through each of their hearts. As it was said in the movie each religious faith has a center, and for Islam, such place is located in Mecca, the large mosque Al-Masjid Al-Haram with the most sacred site for Muslims- the Kaaba. It is not only that faith requires people to go there, but also it is actually a dream for most people to visit this place. However, although the sacred place gathers millions of people, it is only Muslims who are allowed to be there. The film shows not only a positive view of this journey, but it also demonstrates the possible paradoxes that are usually not seen for people, it shows how even Muslim people are struggling to get there and which issues they could face. The film tells story of three different pilgrims from the USA, South Africa and Malaysia. Three of them had embraced Islam, and now they are trying to the ideal world of Islam embrace them, and each of them is willing to discover what are they really made of, to gain brotherhood and sisterhood, and to spiritually heal themselves. The journey starts for them with finding the special clothing that they will be wearing during the travel. It is also important to mention that the learning is required too. So, for example, it can be seen in the movie how the pilgrim from the USA was studying with a big interest in a small group before the journey. However, it is not all, before the travel the female Muslim also had to prove that she is a Muslim. Because she has not a very Muslim name and appearance, and as a female she was also required to provide a legitimate permission from a male close family member to travel to the holy site, which could be problematic for some people, in this case the woman was divorced, but she has a son, so it was not that complicated for her, however such demands could affect woman's and even man's feelings. In the film pilgrims are facing discrimination towards their race, appearance, and even there they could observe the difference of social classes, between rich and poor. That is what paradoxical, because as Muslims all of them are supposed to be equal and still inequality, discrimination exists. So, the pilgrims had to stay strong despite the weather conditions on their long travel, had to not lose their control and temper when they were facing discrimination, they had to show and prove their patience and respect because in the end, the goal of the journey is also to improve one's self. In the film besides the storyline of three pilgrims inside mecca, there are some excerpts from old records, images of Abraham's portrait, and construction of the Kaaba. During the film it is possible to hear some traditional music, and also surah and prayers. There are some scenes that were taken from above in which that 2 million people or more could be seen, the chaos in which a person could die without a notice of others. And even though the people death accidents were not depicted in the film, there is a scene of animal sacrifice. It can be seen in the film that the trading is also taking a place there, however, during prayers the shops stop working and they become places for worship too. Also, in the film it is shown that people who are able to pay money can be treated and welcomed, with food and a comfortable place to stop provided. At the same time, the living condition of poor people is depicted in the film, and the act of charity took place. One of the pilgrims distributed some food, and that just showed the need for simple goods like food, and what the pilgrim was upset about is that not all of the pilgrims do charity. In the film, the preparation for the journey is well depicted. How pilgrims' visions of the journey were changing, vision of brotherhood, justice, rightness, and simpleness. In the film it is demonstrated that pilgrims are possible to face different struggles, doubts, judgments, inequality and discrimination. How it is important no matter what to still stand for forgiveness, as the Hajj is a host of redemption. How emotional it could be to be surrounded by thousands of people, but still find yourself alone with God. In the end for pilgrims it was hard to say goodbye to this sacred place, because they had gained a lot, it was a great opportunity for them to rebirth."}, {"id": 43, "text": "The movie Inside Mecca, directed by Anisa Mehdi, shows the history of Hajj, its importance, traditions, rituals, emotions and problems that people might have during their trip to Mecca. Hajj is an Islamic pilgrimage, where around 2 million people from more than 170 countries come each year to Mecca. The movie shows the story of 3 people from United States, South Africa, and Malaysia, who decided to make pilgrimage. They were from different race, nationalities, and social backgrounds, but they were united by the fact that they were Muslims. The movie did not just provide additional information about the Hajj, but it shows what it really is through the eyes of these 3 people. The movie emphasizes the significance of Hajj for Muslims and points out that each Muslims should visit it once. However, the movie also illustrates that making pilgrimage to Mecca is not an easy process and requires good health and solving many bureaucratic issues to get there. It also shows the personal and general problems that pilgrims face. One of such personal issues was the story of Fidelma from Texas, the USA, because she was raised in Catholic family and her conversion to Islam created some tensions in her family. She also had some problems to prove that she is Muslim and to get her visa. Another pilgrim Khalil from South Africa also faced some problems, because people around him treated him differently because of his color. The third pilgrim Ismail, the entrepreneur from Malaysia, did not face any gender or race problems, but had some personal spirit issues that he needed to solve for himself during his pilgrimage. He also lived during the Hajj like everyone else, slept in the tents and wore Ihram which shows that all of us are equal in front of the God despite our differences in social status, gender, or race. The movie also shows common problems for majority of people. Most of the people, who decide to visit the Hajj, should be ready for transport problems, severe climatic conditions, dust, 2 million of people, and the collapse of crowd in some cases. There was a moment where it was seen that people without good economic conditions slept outside of the tents under the stars. It is possible to understand them, because as it is said in the movie, it costs about 2,500 US dollars to receive the full package for this trip. There are also some additional services for VIP guests, where everyone could make their life more comfortable for additional payment in the tents. Fidelma O'Leary points out I don't know why anyone would wanna go spend a week with three million sweaty people in the heat of the desert unless they really were doing this for the love of God (13:19-13:30 m.). This moment perfectly illustrates that people despite the uncomfortable conditions are ready to overcome them to be closer to the God. The movie shows that the government of Saudi Arabia are doing good job in making pilgrimage more accessible and comfortable for ordinary people. For example, they have constructed more than 100 000 special white tents to accommodate more than 2 million people during the Hajj. The government also designed and built a two-tiered pedestrian walkway (48:01 - 48:05) to facilitate the access to commit Satan stone ritual. The walkway really improved the condition, because fewer people began to die in the crowd collapse during the ritual. The walkway allows them to throw stones to attack the Devil in the first and second floors. The ritual relates to the story of Abraham who throw such stones to the devil to drive him away. I would give the movie high ratings, but some technological problems, associated with filming, changed my mind. The movie had good soundtracks, but their volume was too high during some moments, and it really distracted me from the content. Another problem was related to the interference inside the movie. I do not know why but there were few interferences, like moments between 15:24-15:56 minutes, and these episodes ruined the impression about movie. Moreover, I did not like the part, where it is shown how people killed ships and they skinned them. I understand the importance of the ritual, which is related to the history of Abraham, but I believe this moment of killing could be missed. I know that movie was shot almost 20 years ago, but with modern technologies I hope that it is possible to make some changes with its video and audio problems. To sum up, I really liked the content of the movie, because the movie through the life of 3 pilgrims could show the problems that people might face during the Hajj. It also showed their personal problems and stresses. In addition to that, I get a lot of new information about Islam, Hajj and its rituals. However, I still believe that some technological problems should be improved or made video editing again. In general, my rating is 8/10."}, {"id": 44, "text": "Mecca is one of the most important cities in Islam. It is a pilgrimage center for Muslims. Muslims of the Medina community, led by the prophet Muhammad, entered Mecca. The city surrendered without a fight, the inhabitants accepted Islam. Mecca with the Kaaba was turned into a religious center, and Muslims began to pray face to Mecca, wherever they were. Before Islam, Mecca and Kaaba used to be a holy place of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions. It is believed that Kaaba was built by Adam and then rebuilt by Abraham, the father of monotheistic religions. It is Abraham's story that lies at the core of pilgrimage. In addition, it is worth saying that Muslims do not worship the Kaaba, they worship what it represents\u00bb.This movie shows and gives an idea of what is Mecca and Hajj; how different cultures are united by Islam; and what procedures are necessary to conduct Hajj. In this review, I will give an evaluation of these ideas and will give a general opinion on this movie.Mecca is known as the holiest place in Islam. It was meaningful not only to Muslims but also for Abrahamic religions as well. The documentary film shows and highlights the importance of the city even before Muhammad, and before Adam and Eve. It has been a place of pilgrimage for countless generations drawing people of many faiths. The rules of Hajj were introduced by the prophet Muhammad, and it is considered as the fifth pillar of Islam. Hajj takes place in and around Mecca. It is a series of rituals performed between the 8th and 13th days of the last month of the Islamic calendar. The movie shows how it is important to obey the rules of Hajj, to do what the prophet Muhammad did to pray for God. The fascinating thing is that even centuries have past people are still conducting old traditions, this is where past and present and, probably, the future intersect.The movie shows the story of three pilgrimages from Malaysia, South Africa, and America. People who have different languages, cultures, traditions, occupation and who, probably, will never meet each other are connected by the same religion. Their story represents that Islam has no borders and its laws are not made only for one culture. The film shows not only their respect and faith in Islam but also how their journey challenged their patience. It shows how the pilgrims struggle, and how the journey can be physically exhausting. Nevertheless, it represents discrimination that Fidelma and Khalil experienced in Mecca. Fidelma is American with a non-muslim name, and Khalil was black, they faced racial discrimination in their trip to the closest place to God. It is prohibited to judge people in Islam, however, not everyone is obeying it even at the sacred places like Mecca. The journey to the holy place is properly planned. It has several phases needed to be completed. The first pilgrims travel a few miles from Mecca into the valley of Mina where they find a massive tent city there they rest the next day pilgrims continue to the plain of Arafat this is the most important day of the Hajj a day of reckoning one-on-one with God then they returned to Minna to perform a ritual stoning of satan that continues for two more days in the epilogue to the great journey they returned to Mecca to circle the Kaaba seven times while circling the Kaaba is the final act of the pilgrimage it is also the top priority for pilgrims when they first get to Mecca. The pilgrims have to be cleansed and they have to wear identical two-peaces clothes for men and clothe that covers whole skin and hairs except face to women. All this is done in order to appear equal before God, and even this ritual highlights the theme of equality, that is supposed to be present in Islam.This movie worth watching if you want to obtain a general idea about hajj and Mecca. The documentary by National Geographic, directed by Anisa Mehdi in 2003, presents three Muslims from different parts of the world with different professions who are aimed to perform Hajj. Their ordinary daily life was filmed which gave a better idea that wherever you are and whatever you do does not matter, all of the people are the same in front of God. The Documentary shows their preparation for the journey, the challenges they faced, and the emotional sides of the prayer. The movie portrays the realities of the Hajj, without making it totally perfect. Since the journey to Mecca is not affordable by all Muslims and restricted for participation by non-muslims, the movie has a great value for a wide audience. However, the quality of the movie and the sounds are not good. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the rituals practiced in Islam."}, {"id": 45, "text": "Hajj, one of the Five Pillars in Islam, is a Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca (Saudi Arabia), the most significant city in Islam. Every year, millions of Muslims from each part of the world gather in the city in order to fulfill their duty. In 2003, National Geographic made a documentary, which showed various aspects of this pilgrimage. In order to make it more personal, creators of the film followed three Muslims from very different backgrounds (Dr. Dilma O'leary from the United States, who converted from Catholic; Khalil from South Africa; Ismail from Malaysia) during their trip to Mecca and showed their pre-Hajj stories, their experience during the pilgrimage and how they felt after this trip. By approaching to tell about Hajj in this way, Anisa Mehdi (director of the film) could combine common knowledge about Hajj with some personal stories. Personally, I saw three main points that the authors wanted to emphasize in the film. Firstly, the obvious goal was to describe what Hajj is, how it is implemented and motivations of millions of people around the world to come to Mecca. Secondly, the point was to show how global and massive this phenomenon is. And thirdly, the movie told how modern reality combines with such an old tradition. In this review, I will elaborate on those points in the mentioned order and will conclude with some criticisms of this documentary.Generally, this film is about Hajj and all various aspects of the pilgrimage. By combination of three pilgrims' stories and narration of general information by the speaker, the movie could tell us many things about Islam and Hajj in particular. Firstly, the documentary shows timeline of the trip. Audience gets familiar what pilgrims do before the trip, what they do on their first day in Saudi Arabia, what they do on the other days and on the last day. This is shown by following three individuals during their experiences. For instance, we see home, family, job, friends and life of Dr. O'leary in the United States before she goes to Mecca. Khalil's and Ismail' backgrounds are shown in the same manner. This move of the authors is really significant because it shows destinies and motivations of pilgrims more intimately. Afterwards, we dive in Hajj itself. Audience gets familiar with what people day during each important day of their trip: arrival, circling around Kaaba, trip to Mount Arafat, their last day in Mecca. This timeline is a great instrument for explaining not only each important ritual of Muslims, but also the most significant historical moments in Islam. For instance, some people sleep under stars as the Prophet Muhammad did. Another example is how people go to the mountain, where Abraham was ordered to kill his son. With such narrative, the movie tells about motivations of pilgrims and their personal experiences of doing all the things. So, by showing Hajj from the perspective of three individuals and combination of general knowledge, the authors cover the most important aspects of Islam and Hajj.Moving further, we see how global and massive this pilgrimage is. This is shown in three points. Firstly, in each part of the city, there are enormous crowds of people. Literally hundreds of thousands of people arrive in the city, full buses bring them everywhere, dozens of thousands of Muslims circle around Kaaba, and even bigger amounts go to the mountains. By showing such crowds, it's evident that Hajj is a very massive phenomenon. Secondly, we see how many nations are attracted by Hajj. Personally, I noticed emphasis on this point with the two features: absolutely different backgrounds of the filmed three pilgrims and the large camp of white tents, which was segmented into many areas with subject to nationalities (Singapore, South Africa, Indonesia, Turkey). This shows how absolutely different people from different countries, of different nationalities (80% of Muslims are not Arab), of different income levels, speaking different languages come to Mecca with a common goal.Thirdly, we see a synthesis of traditional centuries-old rituals with the modern context. This is evident, firstly, how Hajj and pilgrims are governed. We see that only Muslim is allowed to get Visa for Hajj. Furthermore, the great control during Hajj is noticed in order to prevent any security threats. Secondly, I was really surprised by the infrastructure which was built specifically for Hajj. There is even the Minister of Hajj in the country. Infrastructure is made in order to accept as many pilgrims as possible in more efficient ways than it was done in earlier centuries. Specifically, this is shown in large areas for walking, sitting and sleeping; in the example of spiritual highway; and in the camp of white tents, which is built to accept hundreds of thousands of people in a convenient way. Thirdly, although people go there not for vacation, there are still comfort facilities during the trip. This is evident from the scene with those luxury foods for VIP pilgrims. Overall, the film is really great in terms of telling about Hajj by combination of personal stories with some general knowledge and cadres. Despite low quality of video and sound, this documentary allows to dive in the great phenomenon."}, {"id": 46, "text": "'Inside Mecca is a documentary film by National Geographic. It shows the process of Hajj, which is an annual Islamic pilgrimage made in Mecca and also a mandatory religious duty for each adult Muslim. Hajj is a complex religious celebration which continues for 5 days. Although Muhammad established the rules of Hajj, the Quran records that God ordered Abraham to leave his wife Hajar and son Ishmael in the dessert of current Mecca. Hajar started to run in a panic to find a water source between the two hills of Safa and Marwah, which through time became one of the rituals of Hajj when Muslims run seven times between two hills. Coming back to Ismael, Hajar noticed that her son scratched the ground and suddenly water flowed. This water source was later known as Zamzam, hence after running between hills seven times Muslim taste a water from Zamzam. Approximately 2 million people visit Mecca for pilgrimage every year, and all of them are representatives of different cultures, nationality, race and language, but Hajj unites them all. This documentary demonstrates preparation and the procedure of religious ritual through three perspectives of Khalil Mandhlazi, Fidelma O'Leary and Ismail Mahboob. All of them had similar preparation by reading the Koran, choosing appropriate clothes and planning the transportation, while Fidelma O'Leary had to ask permission from a male relative and search for a group of women who are advancing to the same journey because women are not allowed to perform Hajj alone. Actually, it was fantastic idea to include a narrative of white woman, who was raised in catholic family and she declared herself as Muslim only in college. Fidelma O'Leary did not know arabic language, it follows that she studied Islam in a group of women by reading tafsir. With regards to Cambridge Companion to the Quran, Muslim is not a religion only for arabs, the message of God that was given to Muhammad was intended the whole of humankind became generally accepted. Over centuries. Many translations of the Quran have been made by Muslims and non-Muslims, which are considered as commentaries to the Quran called tafsir. Tafsir is not written to translate Quran into other languages, albeit it is a kind of help to understand Quranic verses and metaphors included. However, islamic scholars claim that translators might misinterpret certain verses from the sacred book, which evidently affects readers' understanding. Thus, in this case Fidelma O'Leary might have a difference in interpretation of God's commands compared to arabic Muslims. It was mentally and physically complicated journey for her, because numerous Muslims doubt that she is a Muslim at all. Fidelma O'Leary said that they are forgetting that only Muslims may enter here. Nevertheless, there were the majority of people in Mecca, who supported others independently from race, nation or gender since they are all united with one aim to serve God's commands. Another character is Khalil Mandhlazi from South Africa. He converted to Islam because of idea of peace and equality. Unfortunately, Khalil faced with racial discrimination when he lived in South Aftican group and he joined to black African Malawians group. It was really difficult to realize that followers of religion, that promotes tolerance towards racial and national features, break the rule and insult like-minded people. Also, Khalil was upset about the gap between riches and poors in such sacred and holy place. Rich people were allowed to have more comfortable conditions to live by paying for it, which was against the idea of equality between the men. Finally, Khalil passed through all procedures of Hajj with high responsibility, which helped him to pay less attention to external problems. He expressed all his inner emotions in battle with Satan, that is throwing stones to Satan to overcome his temptations. According to Rahman's 'Major themes of the Quran', Satan's role is to misguide people as he wanted to make Abraham refuse from God's order to sacrifice his son, but Abraham could resist Satan. Therefore, throwing stone to Satan symbolizes a battle against your inner rival. The third character is Ismail Mahboob from Malaysia. Despite the fact that he is rich, he wore the same clothes as other men, which illustrates the true meaning of Hajj. However, due to his financial opportunities, Ismail did not face such minor daily issues as living in large communities, walking under the heat and interacting with chaotic crowds as other characters did. To summarize, I would definitely recommend this movie for two reasons. Firstly, this documentary shows the importance of Hajj for Muslims as one of the duties and direction which they face during the prayer. Secondly, this movie reveals racial issues in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the heart of Islam."}, {"id": 47, "text": "Inside Mecca is a breath-taking National Geographic documentary film about the holy pilgrimage to Mecca, known in the Islamic world as the Hajj, which was amazingly directed by Anisa Mehdi. The world premiere had been dated March 1, 2003. The Hajj is the annual holy pilgrimage of Muslims to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. It takes place between the 8th and 13th days of the last month of the Islamic calendar. The Hajj has always been a mystery to most of the non-Muslim audience. Finally, the mystery has been revealed through the intimate stories of three Muslims who were completely different in their looks, culture, and lifestyle but one in their faith - Islam. They were Fidelma O'Reilly from the US, a professor of neuroscience at St. Edwards University in Austin, Khalil Mandhlazi from South Africa, a radio commentator, and Ismail Mahbob from Malaysia, a successful businessman. Each of them had their own story to tell. The journey started in the place of their origin, where they have been practicing Islam and were waiting for the right moment to come to fulfill their duty for God by going onto the Hajj. Before departing, they were preparing for the Hajj. For example, due to measures of Saudi Arabia's government taken to restrict the entry of non-Muslims to the places of pilgrimage, Fidelma had to collect all the necessary documentation for the Hajj visa such as approval from the mosque proving she is a Muslim, letter-permission from her son. Also, Fidelma was studying with the fellow Texan group the rituals of the Hajj, interpretations of the stories and events behind it. What is interesting is that Muslims should go onto the Hajj in groups. Once the preparation was over, our pilgrims with their groups arrived at Mecca, where they had to enter to a pure state of mind known as Ihram and put on a special two-piece attire for men and modest dressing with a head covering for women. Fidelma, Islam, and Khalil first visited the Kaaba (the cube-shaped stone building containing sacred black stone) located in the center of mosque Masjid al-Haram. There they performed two rituals Tawaf (circumambulation of the Kaaba seven times) and Striving/Sa'i (running between two hills Safa and Marwa). On the eight's day of the month, the pilgrims as the other two million people headed to the valley of Mina entering the Ihram state where they rested in the tents until the next day. The next day, the most important day of the Hajj, our pilgrims went on the Arafat plain where they were praying before sunset. After, they continued to the Mudzalifah where they gathered pellets and spent the night under the open sky. The last two or three days were the most dangerous ones. Pilgrims, having returned to the Mina, performed the devil stoning ritual. They threw pellets onto three big pillars representing a devil appearing at different spots. Then they bought a voucher to do ram sacrifice in their name. Next, pilgrims changed their clothes to regular ones, having shaved or cut the hair which meant they have left the ritual sanctity state. As the final step of the Hajj, they performed Tawaf on the return to Mecca. Anisa Mehdi as a director did a great job of creating a very dynamic and large-scale project touching upon the most topical religious and social issues of the time. Since Islam became the fastest-growing religion in the US, probably Anisa Mehdi, being a Muslim American woman, put more emphasis on the story of Fidelma in the plot. She wanted to show to American non-Muslim society what it is like to be a Muslim, to feel and to act like a Muslim. She wanted to show to what kind of challenges Muslims are ready to prove their love for God going onto the Hajj. She wanted to demonstrate how people become Muslim, why they become Muslim, and what kind of troubles they face, and what they gain from the Hajj on the example of three pilgrims. The first pilgrim Fidelma was a blue-eyed blonde American divorced woman. She was born to a Catholic family. Further, she has converted to Islam during her college years because of her inner voice questioning her faith. Her family became against her. She hurt their feelings. In addition, she was the only Muslim in her circle. Even though she struggled, she still loved and embraced Islam. She knew that Islam was the religion for her. In contrast to Fidelma, Khalil's attitudes towards Islam were shaped by the traces of his past. Khalil embraced brotherhood and sisterhood described in Islam. There was no place for racism and discrimination bothering him in the past. Besides, Khalil practiced charitable giving - one of the main moral virtues of Islam. The third pilgrim Ismail being satisfied with his life, family, and material status felt like he lacked spirituality. This brought him to Islam, where he finally found a peace of mind. The other thing about Inside Mecca worth mentioning is the stories behind the rituals of the Hajj like striving/sai, devil stoning, and ram sacrifice. These stories help the non-Muslim audience to understand why Muslims perform these types of rituals. For example, why do Muslims walk around Kaaba, not any other building? Well, because, it is believed that the Kaaba is 'a holy place, the celestial house of God' that existed 'long before the great Prophet Abraham, before Adam and Eve, and even before creation'. That the pilgrimage to Kaaba has been practiced by countless generations of many faiths long before Islam has emerged. Thus, one can understand that striving/sai is carried out to replicate the desperate running of Hagar, wife of the Prophet Abraham, in the desert as she was searching for water for Ismail, their son. The devil stoning helps to clear the mind from temptation and obsession. While ram sacrifice emerged from the story of Abraham's sacrifice when a ram was sacrificed instead of Ismail by God's will in response to Abraham's loyalty to God. In general, Inside Mecca was intended to introduce the Islamic world to the non-Muslim audience. To show that, on one hand, each arrived at Mecca Muslim feels like he is specially invited here, but, on the other hand, one's significance drops to zero among millions of other people. Since 'there is no god, but God', all Muslims are equal regardless of their background. And to warn the Islamic community as they should be prepared to welcome more and more of 'green-eyed Irish and blue-eyed British Muslims'."}, {"id": 48, "text": "This documentary by National Geographic provides a unique insight into the holy pilgrimage for the members of the Muslim Ummah - the Hajj. By showcasing the story of three pilgrims from South Africa, Malaysia, and the U.S., this movie demonstrates how the journey to Mecca unites people from around the globe under the same goal of praising Allah. It is through these stories, accompanied by religious explanatory narratives, that a spectator gets an opportunity to dive Inside Mecca and understand each step that Muslims go through in their pilgrimage.The fundamental notion that the documentary is built on is what in Mircea Eliade's jargon would be called axis mundi - embodied by the Kaaba, or the House of Allah. Kaaba defines the direction, in which Muslims pray, and it is also central to the ritual of Tawaf, whereby pilgrims have to circle around the Kaaba as a part of the Hajj. This axis mundi remains at the center of the holy site of Mecca, which is a house to other sacred spaces, including the Grand Mosque, known as Al-Masjid al-Haram and the hills of Safa and Marwah, between which the pilgrims urgently walk, similarly to Hagar, who was desperate to find water for her son Ishmael. The documentary also sheds light on other holy sites such as the valley of Mina, the plain of Arafat with each of them being crucial to the 5-day journey of Muslim pilgrims. It is not only geographic locations, that the movie shows as being consecrated as sacred for Muslims, but also particular rites and even objects - all of which derive their symbolic significance from the religious sources.While the documentary does a great job in portraying the holy sites in Islam, it also draws attention to important social issues, that underpin the story of each of the three main characters in this movie. In these regards, U.S. Professor Fidelma O'Leary's story was particularly appealing to me. Having converted to Islam from Catholicism, Fidelma underwent a long way to get to Mecca. She had to verify that she is a Muslim and ask permission from a male member of her family - her son to get a visa. She has also been subjected to gazes of multiple wondering eyes, due to her appearance, that differs substantially from most of the Muslims. Despite these challenges that she faced due to her gender and race, she was able to show patience and perseverance, remaining faithful to Ihram - a state of mind essential for Muslim pilgrims. Similar qualities were demonstrated by Khalil - a pilgrim from South Africa, who faced a somewhat different treatment due to the color of his skin. Yet, he was fulfilling his Islamic ideal, doing charity, displaying a high level of consciousness and being careful not to lose his temper because of external circumstances. The third character of the story - Ismail, a wealthy man from Malaysia, received relatively less attention in this documentary. Unfortunately, his personage was not fully uncovered in the movie, although his story is highly enlightening insofar as it illustrates probably one of the most important messages delivered by this documentary. This message pertains to the notion of equality in Islam. One embodiment of that equality is the white clothing that makes every pilgrim, regardless of their race, gender or socioeconomic status, equal before God. It is specifically through the Malaysian pilgrim, that one can understand how unimportant is material wealth compared to the mental and spiritual fulfilment, as the hero says he was undergoing a struggle against the poverty of spirit. An essential part of this struggle is to overcome the temptations, evoked in humans by the devil. The documentary further reveals how Muslims attempt to resist these temptations and become closer to God. As such, through each of the stories, a grander narrative flows - that of the mental transformation which Muslims undergo while fulfilling one of their most important religious duties.The content of the movie is indeed highly important, so is its delivery. Certain technical details, including low quality of the video and inappropriate musical accompaniment slightly diminished the overall impression from the movie. Yet, these should be understandable provided that the movie was made long ago when technological sophistication constrained the ability of filmmakers to improve the quality. Alternatively, one might suggest that it could have been rather difficult to film the pilgrimage given the external and logistical impediments. Either way, the delivery component of this movie could be improved to match the quality of content.In sum, the documentary leaves an overall positive aftertaste. It was highly educative in terms of revealing religious explanations of the stories behind each stage of the Hajj, and it was also thought-provoking when pointing to the social issues that underpin the stories of particular pilgrims. More importantly, however, it attempted to show its spectators how life-changing the experience of the Hajj might be."}, {"id": 49, "text": "National Geographic's documentary, directed by Anisa Mehdi, Inside Mecca, talks about one of the five responsibilities that Muslims must carry out throughout their lives, the hajj. Supporters of Islam believe that if Muslim is in good health and has the financial ability to go on a pilgrimage, then he should do this at least once in his life. The movie presents a more knowledgeable outlook with step-by-step and detailed procedure of Hajj. Starting from physical as well as inner preparation, all the way towards the mosque of Al-Masjid Al-Haram where Islamic center, Mecca, is located. It depicts major rituals: traveling to the valley of Mina, trip to Arafat, throwing a stone into Satan (so called battle with devil when people are fighting against inner urgings that they have towards evil), returning to Mecca in order to circle the Kaaba. The Hajj rituals are explained in a such a way that it is clear not only to Muslims, but also to the non-Muslim community. In subsequent chapters, I would briefly review the movie. First, the film showed how diverse Islam is. Three selected pilgrims from different continents: one from the USA (Fidelma O'Leary), another from South Africa (Khalil Mandhlazi) and the third from Malaysia (Ismail Mahbob) really correspond to their position. Assigning this role to them, I believe that the director intends to demonstrate Islam is not only religion of Arabs. Personally, I myself, surprised when the narrator said only 20% of Muslims are from Arabic countries. Moreover, it should be noted that three people are not actors; these are people who experienced the Hajj. This factor also played a decisive role when they expressed their true feelings in which pure belief manifested. I am sure, deep immersion in such emotion would not be possible if there were an appointed actor. Secondly, I found out that everyone in Islam has a equal level of respect, state and priority in Hajj despite their real life status. Rich men and poor, educated and illiterate, white and black, all look the same. However, from the movie we see the scene where Fidelma shared the story when she surprised many pilgrims who were in Hajj and asked for confirmation whether she is a true Muslim (although they knew that only Muslims could be there). In addition, Khalil was also discriminated because of his skin color. Someone will argue that these factors would arise as a result of a long day walking under the Sun and in an emotional state. Nevertheless, I perceived this behavior as a lack of Muslim qualities in a human being rather than the problem in Islam itself. This documentary film clearly left such kind of impression in me. Under whatever circumstances would person be, he or she never should be rude towards others. This applies not only to Islam. Any self-respecting person would agree with me. Thirdly, as I understood, the main action that pilgrim should do is the immersion to state of Ihram. At this point, I want to mention interesting similarity between Ihram and one lecture from Ethics course. John Rawls in his Theory of Justice had mentioned that in order to come up with the better laws and rules people should put under Veil of Ignorance (the state of blindness where they would be excluded from social status and personal characteristics that is crucial to come up with justified decisions). Veil of Ignorance, in itself, really similar to idea of Ihram (not vice versa, Islam has existed since the 7th century, Rawls was born in 1921), a state of purification, state when you met face to face with God, analyzing all previous deeds and go home with a firm intention to change something in your life. Therefore, implying the fact that morality in philosophy could be found in Islam as well. The other moment when all living creatures stopped their routine for a while, when shops closed, movements throughout the city froze and the streets became a place of worship truly demonstrates how Muslims are in touch with the Creator. Finding other place where people would leave their properties to be in touch with their God would probably be very difficult. Taking into account that it happens five times a day and last for a whole life is signs of divinity in the nature of person. Watching the scene when people from different nationalities in one place, concentrated in one direction, worshipping one God is really touches the inexplicable inner feelings. Looking at how passionately people are doing dua's, sometimes even cry, is astonishing. By doing so, they seemed getting inner peace by addressing all the concern one-on-one to the God. Inside Mecca could able to travel me into Hajj environment and experience it in myself. Passion and attitude of Muslims from all over the world towards Allah is impossible to describe. To conclude, I came to the decision that being a Muslim is not a label, it is the state of inner fulfillment and behave that you have towards others."}, {"id": 50, "text": "Inside Mecca filmed by National Geographic reveals the hajj stories of three Muslims coming from different backgrounds with each experience being very unique, but united under one faith of Islam. The documentary introduces us to the hajj journeys of Muslims coming from South Africa, Asia and America. Hajj is a way for them and for every other Muslim to express their religious solidarity and faith in one God. This pilgrimage is one of the five pillars of Islam and it is an obligation for every Muslim to perform it at least once in their lives. It takes from five to six days to perform the hajj in the city of Mecca and its surroundings. All the Muslims from different backgrounds endeavor to visit the holy city of Mecca and replicate the sacred rituals performed by and associated with the holy prophets Ibrahim, Ismail and Muhammad. Performing hajj needs a vast preparation and dedication from the pilgrims due to the spiritual prominence of the event. For many pilgrims it takes a great effort to prove their commitment to Islam and be able to actually enter the Saudi Arabia. Once in Mecca, the pilgrims enter a state of ihram, which symbolizes the spiritual purity and makes Muslims abstain from materialistic pleasures and focus on their faith and inner selves. In the state of ihram pilgrims ought to dress in white cloth, which would equalize everyone under one faith of Islam, because before God everyone is equal and no one could be either differentiated or discriminated. However, the movie sheds the light on manifestations of discrimination faced by the pilgrims that represent the minorities in Mecca. Racial and gender discrimination are often present even in the holy city and some of the pilgrims face physical hardships due to their appearance. Nevertheless, the challenges are incomparable to the spiritual and emotional changes that occur during the holy journey of hajj. The movie clearly illustrates how religion and faith are meaningful to every pilgrim, but at the same time it reveals unforseen discrimination faced by the minority groups. The pilgrim from South Africa represents the Muslim minority at his homeland, and he is very eager to be united with the vast Muslim community united under one faith and one aim of fulfilling their religious duty. He has been assured that he will finally acquire both inner peace and spiritual unity with the outer world of like-minded people. For him, nothing matters more than his affiliation to Islam when he is in Mecca. However, because dark-skinned Africans represent minority in the Muslim world, the hero happens to face racial discrimination in Mecca, his spiritual capital. The pilgrim from USA had a very similar experience, because she was raised in a Catholic family in a very conservative environment of Texas. Her experience of conversion to Islam was to an extent unprecedented for her community, hence she failed to gain support even from her closest ones. Taking into account all the hardships she faced on her religious path, she always remained very purposeful in visiting Mecca and performing the hajj. She understood that white American, not accompanied by a men, would be a very rare case even among the three millions of pilgrims. However, she is hurt every time someone asks if she is Muslim, even though non-Muslims are not even allowed to visit Mecca. For both of the pilgrims who faced discrimination it was very upsetting not to connect with the outer world during their hajj experience. However, those obstacles were clearly negligible in comparison with the spiritual enrichment they gained. They try to step back from all the challenges and keep their temper, because everyone has to remain in the state of ihram while in holy city of Mecca. As they focus on their inner selves and the prayers, the pilgrims connect to the religious rituals, events and locations on every step of their journey. Ultimately, hajj becomes spiritually enriching for each individual despite all the challenges faced. The movie provides us with a great perspective on the hajj. The event is often seen by non-Muslims as a mere pilgrimage, so it makes a great deal in revealing all the challenges and importance of the event for a Muslim. It gives an insight into the preparation processes, because Mecca welcomes several million people in duration of a week. Henceforth, it takes government to be very inventive in accommodating all the pilgrims and maintaining the order. The perspective on the hajj chosen by the screenwriter and the director, Anisa Mehdi, opened up many important angles of Islam's central event. The movie image illustrated the density of the crowd and the dedication of the people to the rituals very clearly. All the concepts and deeds were well-explained for a broad audience, providing just enough details and insights to get an understanding. However, there is definitely a room to work on the sound and musical accompaniment, as it often distracted rather than complimented the image. Nevertheless, Inside Mecca is a great movie to get acquainted with some of the central concepts of Islam and get historical insights into the holy hajj pilgrimage."}, {"id": 51, "text": "Pilgrimage is one of the common characteristics of the most popular religions worldwide like those of Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and many others out of which Islam is not an exception. This pilgrimage is called Hajj and it belongs to one of the five pillars for Muslims - religious performances they are bound to do. During the Hajj Muslims are obliged to travel to Mecca and complete a set of rituals and that is something that Anisa Mehdi tried to illustrate through directing a documentary movie called Inside Mecca in 2003. The film not only tells about the process of Hajj, but also narrates the stories of three Muslims from different parts of the globe in a very interesting manner. Although the technical part of the movie is of an unsatisfactory quality, the manner in which the narrative flows throughout captures the minds and hearts of the viewers by appealing to emotions.Starting from the script itself it can be noted that Anisa Mehdi took an entertaining approach in supplying the information. Listening to and actually watching the experiences of Fidelma O'Leary, Khalil Mandhlazi and Ismail Mahbob while incorporating some facts from interviewees about the Hajj helps the viewers to retain the necessary information easier. This is because stories are memorized much faster and for longer than any dry statements of religious practices. Moreover, this way of telling about the pilgrimage - by showcasing it through the lenses of three individuals - allows the audience to discover other aspects of the Hajj such as challenges that arise due to cultural and national differences. As Fidelma is from the USA, Khalil - from South Africa and Ismail - from Malaysia, they all have distinct experiences of the pilgrimage. By listening to them we can also see how the background of a person can significantly affect one's perception of the Hajj. For instance, Ismail had to confront the absence of material comforts around like he had had in his ordinary life being the executive. As he himself put it: It's more like forgetting what backgrounds that I have or what I am used to in the office, in the golf course, and at home, and just be near to God. All of this present us the view from another side on the Islamic pilgrimage.As for the weaknesses of the technical side of the documentary, three particular elements should be mentioned which are camera work, composition and editing. First of all, it can be noticed that sometimes the angle and place of shooting is chosen poorly or camera in hands of the operator is shaking and thus impeding the observation like in the case where pilgrims circling the Ka'aba are displayed. However, this can be understood since it must be difficult to do the shooting among millions of people and fix the camera in one place. Secondly, editing seems to be abrupt at times or too diffused which is quite unpleasant for the sight. Yet since the movie is old, for those times it seems to be on a high level. The best part in the whole documentary for me appears to be the emotionality. This is recognized in scenes like Hagar's desperate search of water illustrated in the first person and in sincere emotions of the cast or other people. Their tears of gratefulness for the God, encounter with such as a majesty and prayers for forgiveness are indeed heartwarming and touching. The way they admire the Hajj and express their views on it makes you wish to be there as well, to see the same scenes and experience the same feelings. As an illustration, when Fidelma cannot stop her tears while looking at the Ka'aba for the first time or when Ismail gets very emotional while communicating with God or when Khalil with his group of pilgrims blissfully feeds the poor - you start to feel the atmosphere of the movie that Anisa Mehdi tried to transmit.All in all, Inside Mecca is another great documentary from National Geographic which focuses on the pilgrimage for Muslims - the Hajj - and experiences with it of three people - Fidelma, Ismail and Khalil - all from different parts of the world. Even though the shooting and editing of the film may not be appropriate compared with modern movie industry creations, for the year of 2003 and for the conditions in which the technical crew had to work explain the deficiencies in this area. What is more important seems to be what information and how it is presented in the documentary: it not only unveils the differences in perceptions and experiences of the Hajj by people from different countries and of different races, but also lets the viewers sense the affecting moods of pilgrims and the incredible aura of Mecca, which rightfully, as we saw, got its status of the most sacred place of Islam."}, {"id": 52, "text": "In this documentary we see a depiction of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, with an emphasis on three pilgrims: Ismail from Malaysia, Dr. Dilma O'leary from the United States and Khalil from South Africa, embarking on a journey to hajj. We see main features of Islamic tradition, major stages along their pilgrimage, strenuous mental and physical preparation of pilgrims. Hajj is the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, symbolizing the unity and solidarity of muslim people and their belief in a single God. According to Islamic tradition, it should be undertaken by every muslim at least once in lifetime, from 8th to 13th day of the last month of Islamic calendar. It is translated as heading to a place for the sake of visiting. Pilgrimage and prayers are centered around Kaaba, a black stone symbolizing a house of Allah'', rebuilt by Abraham after the Great flood. During hajj pilgrims commemorate events that happened with Muhammad and Abraham and perform various rituals from walking around the Kaaba seven times, to symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing stones to three pillars at Mina. The goal is to enter the state of holiness - Ihram, during which all pilgrims are equal before God and not differentiated according to their class, colour, gender, education, etc. They do so by wearing identical white garments which denies people's individualism, undertaking certain restrictions like dressing modestly, not being excessive in their needs, taking ablution, refraining from sexual intercourse. On the 8th day - Tarwiyah, pilgrims are reminded of their duties and goals, and implement the ritual of Tawaf - walking seven times around the Kaaba; the 9th day is a day of Arafat, when pilgrims reflect on their part sins and ask mercy from God. From the 3rd day pilgrims perform the stoning of the devil, by throwing stones at three pillars - called Jamrat-al-Aqabah; this symbolizes how people defeat Satan's temptations, and how Abraham defeated devil's words about not killing his son as God commanded him; seeing this, God showed mercy and allowed Abraham to kill a lamb instead of his son. As a result, animal sacrifices are implemented after stoning of the devil in order to commemorate the story of Abraham and Ismael. On the last day of pilgrimage people return to Mecca and walk around the Kaaba seven times; touching or even watching is considered to be sacred. Some pilgrims continue their pilgrimage to Medina to view the tomb of Muhammad. The movie was shot by Anisa Mehdi in 2003; the direction was original due to comparisons by the director between previous Islamic traditions and current state of events - it can be seen that people tend to value their own pursuits higher than actually following the rules of Koran: sharing your income and being equal before God without discriminations against colour, gender, class, race, etc. For example, according to Khalil in the movie, he faced prejudised behaviour during prayers in tents, where others told him to pray with people of his own race; he was discriminated against his colour and viewed it to be very painful to see this condition during the hajj. Khalil also described his experience of donating and sharing food with orphaned children and mentioned there being no other muslims to help, although it is one of the rules written in Koran. According to Zakat rule, every muslim should share part of their income with those in need, and not enough donations and sharing of income with poor people is implemented nowadays. Regarding the situation with Dr.Dilma, she received an unusual attention for her skin colour; she also faced several obstacles, from getting her visa and written permission from her son to travel, to being judged by other people based on her nationality; while Ismail had better living conditions because of his financial position. It is evident that in reality not all people are equal before God, even during the hajj. We can see that it was significantly harder for foreign people to be recognized as muslims due to various prejudices; their mental preparation included learning prayers from Koran, learning the islamic law, proving to be muslim to the Saudi government. As described in the movie, there wasn't much unity and solidarity among the muslims, since it was important for them to know other people's nationality and race. So we can say that the rules and obligations were not as important for muslim people as achieving their own purpose of self-renewal and praying during the pilgrimage. Another obstacle is high prices for the hajj package, which includes visa and flight costs, and expenditures on tents where wealthy people can afford the vip places while others enjoy less privileges. It has become more ubiquitous for Saudi government to commercialize the pilgrimage and instead of a holy and sacred process it becomes more tainted. I believe that these obstacles prevent foreign people, as well as others, from being able to fully immerse into their religion and fulfill their goal of pilgrimage; and since all muslims should be equal before single God, I think that this ideology is not as perfect in real life. This documentary highlights the importance of Mecca and its connection with main Islamic principles and traditions, with cultures all over the world. We can see that hajj was a way of self-renewal for pilgrims, of getting rid of previous sins; that it brought people together from all around the world, being a symbol of equality. I believe that some measures are needed to be made in order to make hajj remain a sacred and pure process of rebirth, self-renewal and reborning of soul."}, {"id": 53, "text": "The documentary Inside Mecca is filmed in a way to show the features of annual Islamic pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, named as Hajj. The documentary is made by National Geographic and reveals the viewers the stories of three people from different parts of the world: United States of America, Malaysia and South Africa. The main characters have very different backgrounds, they are white female university professor, black male journalist and Asian male businessman, however, there is one uniting characteristic - they are Muslims. The film not only shows some features of pilgrimage but also reveals some racial and gender problems that are being faced even in such sacred space like Mecca. Mecca is the city in Saudi Arabia, where Prophet Muhammad was born and received his message from the God. Masjid Al-Haram mosque is located in the center of the city, and it is one of the main destinations for pilgrims. More precisely, the pilgrims make their way to the sacred Kaaba, which is located in the center of the mosque. The Kaaba symbolizes that God is the one and Muslim from all over the world pray five times a day facing the Kaaba, performing one of the Islamic duties. The film shows that seeing with own eyes the place in the direction of which a person is praying many years can be very emotional. Performing the Hajj, Muslims try to somehow copy the way the Prophet Muhammed had performed it. This entails that the Prophet is a model of an ideal Muslim person. The documentary shows that before starting the route, it is required to enter the state of Ihram, which means that a person has to be patient, avoid any negative emotions and thoughts. All pilgrims are required to wear white identical clothing of a white color, which is needed for not allowing the reveal of financial or any other characteristics of a pilgrim, making everyone equal. Although the pilgrims wear the same clothes, they are not restricted in paying for better living conditions during the Hajj. More precisely, the tents could be grouped as VIP, deluxe and premium. This, in fact, makes wearing the identical clothing useless to some extent. Moreover, while watching the documentary, it can be concluded that for some people it can be very challenging to make a way to perform Hajj and see the Kaaba. Apart from evident financial challenge and inequality, there are many more. To perform Hajj, it is necessary to follow a strict route, which requires physical well-being. For example, the route includes praying on Arafat Mountain, which is considered as a place where the Prophet Muhammed delivered the last sermon, thus, the place is considered as sacred. The pilgrims from all over the world try to reach this place, walking under heat and facing other complicating circumstances such as people's crowds which can lead to conflicts. Thus, apart from the difficulty of staying in the state of Ihram, there is a difficulty of climbing the mountain, especially for older people or people in poor physical well-being. Apart from the abovementioned direct challenges, which are usually not dependent upon other people, there are might be some challenges that are caused by other people. Some of the apparent examples are racial and gender discrimination. These problems can be seen through the two main characters: Fidelma, who is an American woman, and Khalil - a black man from South Africa. The documentary reveals that if a woman without male accompaniment wants to visit Saudi Arabia, she has to have a written permission from her husband or male relative. In Fidelma's case it was her son, who gave her the permission. However, following this logic, it might be suggested that there were many cases when women were unable to perform Hajj because of their male relatives' adequate or inadequate unwillingness. Besides of the gender issues, there were racial issues which were faced by both of the characters, Khalil and Fidelma. More precisely, Fidelma was constantly facing unpleasant moments when her religious identity was questioned. She was getting too much unwanted attention when local Muslim women were questioning her if she really was a Muslim, while men were giving her unwanted glance because of her atypical appearance of a Muslim woman. Furthermore, Khalil felt that he was being discriminated due to his skin color. According to him, it was painful to face such circumstances even during Hajj, and he was forced change his tent. To conclude, the background music and scenery of a million people praying as one, all of these factors allowed viewers to feel the atmosphere of the city even through the screens. However, the film misses many important details which could allow viewers to better understand the conditions which are important for performing the Hajj. The example of such could be the fact that Muslims whose physical or emotional state restricts them from performing the pilgrimage may finance the pilgrimage of another Muslim, and this will count as if they performed it too. Nevertheless, the documentary shows that millions of Muslims perform Hajj, which shows the adherence to Islamic laws. Although Hajj is considered as a holy Islamic duty, the current realities restrict the equality among pilgrims and cause difficulties for its performance."}, {"id": 54, "text": "The National Geographic documentary Inside Mecca does a great job of introudcing its viewers to Islam, and to the sacred tradition of the pilgrimage - or the Hajj. The movie is very well structured, as it begins with the very basics - it explains what Hajj is, thus acquainting the viewer with the concept that may have been foreign to them previously. Then, it dives inside Mecca, and follows three different people who are on their pilgrimage, in order to tell their stories, and help the viewer understand what the Hajj means not only on a social, but also on a personal level.The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and it is mandatory for anyone who is in the right health to do it. However, what goes beyond this is often left unknown - and for many people outside of Islam, the Hajj is simply this - a pilgrimage. What often goes unnoticed is all of the work and preparation, all of the individual stories and experiences that go into the Hajj journey; and this movie does a great job at portraying the realities of the Hajj, rather than keeping it an abstract idea. Another important aspect of the movie, is that it shows all of the preparations that happen not only on a personal level for each individual pilgrim, but also on the societal level - it shows how people that live in Mecca work as a community to provide for the Hajj.Furthermore, the movie does a great job of showing the diversity of Muslims, and shows how three completely different people can be connected with one another. How three people from different backgrounds can share something so sacred to them; thus hinting that perhaps, we, as people, are not so different after all.The movie, however, is not limited to just the Hajj - it also shows how and why the three pilgrims came to Islam; and what the religion means for them. In today's world, we often dismiss religion, and ignore its followers. However, this film does a wonderful job of reminding us how sacred faith can be to a person. It introduces the viewer to the concept of equality, and that in Islam - in front of Allah, everyone is equal, not matter their cultural, racial or economical background.However, the movie also shows the other side of the coin. It shows all of the difficulties that go into the Hajj. It shows how the pilgrims struggle, and how the journey can be physically exhausting. Furthermore, it sheds light on all of the discrimination that happens on the Hajj; and this shows that even religious people are still people, and not all follow the right moral principles, even on a sacred journey like such. It was heartbreaking to see how something that is supposed to be so holy and so sacred can be so full with hate and discrimination. Fidelma and Khalil were the pilgrims that had to face racial discirmination, and were mistreated simply for the way that they look; even though in faith, everyone is supposed to be equal. The Hajj is supposed to be the journey that unites muslims, because they all gather there for the same reason, for the same end goal - even if each and every single one of their journeys is personal and, therefore, different. But, just like anything in life, it is not perfect, and does put its pilgrims through many (sometimes unnecessary) challenges. The movie does highlight, however, the importance of the pilgrimage, and the effect that it has on everyone who follows through with it. People on the pilgrimage go there with an open heart; they all are at their most vulnerable, and this emotional state unites them all.Furthermore, the film also introduced us to the practical part of the pilgrimage - the rituals and the procedures that need to be carried out when one enters the holy city. The pilgrims have to be cleansed and have to declare that they are spiritually ready; they have to be dressed modestly and all have similar clothes. All this is done in order to appear equal before God, and even this ritual highlights the theme of equality, that is supposed to be present in Islam.However, despite being very profound contentually, it is not as advanced technologically. One of the things that have stood out to me was the quality of sound. Whenever there was a soundtrack, it was overpowering and it was very hard to focus on the words of the people in the movie. Furthermore, the quality of the movie is very poor - the lighting and the shots not only do not flatter the people and the settings, but they are also very awkward to the eye and not aesthetically pleasing. Many may argue that small details like such do not matter. However, if a person feels negative emotions towards the technical aspects of the film, they may subconsciously translate this dislike and direct it at the content. Therefore, the technical moment is very important, and I think it struggled in this movie."}, {"id": 55, "text": "Inside Mecca is a documentary produced by National Geographic in 2003, directed by Anisa Mehdi. As the title implies, the movie brings the viewers inside the holy city of Muslims. The main point of the documentary is that is doesn't only show us Mecca but takes all the way through the annual pilgrimage, the Hajj. The documentary introduces us the stories of journey of three unrelated Muslims from the USA, South Africa and Malaysia. The only thing that unites them is their faith and their goal of performing the Hajj. By combining the three stories, the movie could have a main aim of showing the Hajj as a symbol of equality of all the Muslims around the world in front of the God. The aims which the Muslims have before the pilgrimage could be very different: some come to pray for their relatives and their happiness and health, some pray for their own success of being a better version of themselves, some pray for the peace. However, all of them come to Mecca with a desire to be closer to God, to see the land of the Prophet Muhammad and to feel the power of Islam and sanctity of Kaaba. Even though, the pilgrimage is one of the highest desires and goals of the Muslims, it is the difficult pathway which can be equalized to the test of one's patience and faith. During the Hajj, all the pilgrims have to be is the state of Ihram, thus being purified: they forget their background and their usual lives as if they are the same as other millions of Muslims. The special clothing, also called Ihram, and almost equal conditions for all the pilgrims erase their identity. The movie successfully shows this by having scenes where the people of numerous nations change their clothes into two pieces of Ihram. Even though it is believed that during the Hajj all Muslims are equal, the documentary brings the issues non-Arab Muslims face during the pilgrimage. Both Muslims from America and South Africa were questioned of their faith due their nation and the skin color; and such attitude is very upsetting especially as the Hajj is not an easy time-spending itself. According to pilgrim from the USA, this was a hard experience due to the weather conditions in the desert, the pressured time and the lack of sleep. Nevertheless, the issues arising during the Hajj are helpful in proving yourself your faith and patience. It is the state of ritual sanctity when one cannot lose the temper and do his best to find his place and make conversation with God. The pilgrimage to Mecca bring Muslims closer to the history of Abrahamic religions and, particularly, Islam. The rites are performed in different places around Mecca, including the mount Arafat, Mina and Muzdalifah - visiting each place has its own meaning and aim. The documentary clearly shows the correlation between history of Abraham and each site of the pilgrimage by inserting the videos and paintings depicting Abraham's story and revelations to Prophet. All this shows that pilgrims are experiencing the events happening to the saints. For example, the documentary emphasizes on the rite of walking between the two hills as Hagar was striving in searching the water for Ishmael. So, movie explains well the whole pathway of the pilgrimage with the exact aim and history behind each saint site and the rites performed there. Moreover, the organization of Hajj is shown also from the another side. The structure of the camping town in Mina which direct the pilgrims according to the country they are coming from, the tent for the usual pilgrims and for those who can pay extra for extra services. The reverse sides of the pilgrimage were also illustrated in terms of the increasing trade in Mecca in the days of pilgrimage. And this shows the economic benefit Saudi Arabia gains from the Hajj. Moreover, one of the benefits from this event is the charity: the pilgrim from South Africa was taking part in distribution the goods and food for the poor citizens of Mecca. But he was surprised that not so many pilgrims were doing the charity and this upset him. Here we see, that the Hajj is not only the religious event. As the movie shows, this is also the international event which has its benefits and drawbacks and requires the impressive organizational work. Overall, the goal of the movie of showing the pilgrimage and the state the Muslims have while doing the Hajj was achieved."}, {"id": 56, "text": "Inside Mecca is a documentary that depicts the journey of 3 pilgrims with completely different backgrounds on their way to perform the Hajj. The Hajj, which completion constitutes one of the five pillars of Islam, holds a very important meaning for Muslims and is one goal that all Muslims thrive to accomplish. Essentially, it is a way to show God your submission to him and to cleanse your soul of previous sins. The documentary demonstrates what it takes to perform the Hajj step-by-step and does so in an informative yet easily understood approach. By telling the pilgrimage story of three totally different Muslims, Inside Mecca offers a unique insight into Islam and the Hajj. Throughout all of the physical steps it takes to complete the Hajj, from circling the Kaaba to making an animal sacrifice, one has to remain in one state - the state of Ihram - in order to have the right spiritual intention. Ihram is symbolized by different actions of pilgrims, such as wearing a particular type of clothing and abstaining from using products like perfume. However, arguably more importantly, for a pilgrim to be in the state of Ihram, they must remain patient, calm, and respectful of others throughout all of the rituals. Indeed, this is similar to the general idea taught in Islam - that before God everybody is equal and that on the Judgement Day each person will be evaluated by God only based on their faith and personal deeds. Thus, all Muslims have equal rights in Islam and should be respectful of each other. Khalil Mandhlazi, one of the three pilgrims mentioned in the documentary, looked forward to the Hajj and meeting his brothers and sisters, or fellow Muslims. Having African background, he loved the idea of racial equality in Islam and hoped he would not have to deal with racial discrimination during the Hajj. However, as it turns out, not everybody necessarily follows the state of Ihram. Khalil decides to remain calm when being subjected to racial abuse, hence illustrating a better example of someone following the state of Ihram. Personally, I particularly liked the inclusion of such a story in the narration of the documentary as it provides a realistic depiction of how the Hajj is performed. As millions of pilgrims perform the Hajj every year, people with different personal characteristics are bound to be there. Next, the pilgrimage story of Fidelma O'Leary, an American convert, also gives rather interesting insights about the Hajj. The director made a laudable choice by including a female convert who was divorced into the documentary. First of all, this choice assists in breaking the common stereotype that a woman cannot perform the Hajj by herself. Surely, she has still to obtain permission to travel to Mecca by a male close relative, but the strong and motivated character of Fidelma succeeds at completing the pilgrimage all by herself. Like that of Khalil's, her story also raises an issue of inclusion. Being a white American woman, Fidelma always has to prove to everyone that she in fact identifies herself as a Muslim. Interestingly, the scenes of the documentary included a number of white (non-Arab) men, which signals that there can be negative gender related stereotypes as well between the pilgrims. However, the majority of the pilgrims do in fact represent the people of Islam as being an equal and considerate society. The director illustrates that by a number of various shots - from Fidelma being offered a hand to help climb the Mountain of Arafat to Khalil and other pilgrims uniting to bring food to the poor. Despite having the background of a rich Malaysian man, the third character, Ismail Mahboob, nevertheless has to cover himself in the same two-piece clothing every other male pilgrim wears. Therefore, whereas the pilgrimage may not be a perfect social experience, the Hajj still brings together and helps to unite millions of Muslims from all over the world. Finally, it is important to note that the Hajj is ultimately a deeply personal experience. It is a goal of every pilgrim that their Hajj is accepted by God and that their sins are removed. Moreover, the Hajj is unique in that it offers Muslims to gain a deeper connection to the sacred places Prophet Muhammad had walked on. The documentary does a fantastic job at portraying this main message of the Hajj by offering an easily understood explanation of the rituals and their history. By having an easily followed narrative and relatable characters, Inside Mecca succeeds at conveying the reasons why millions of people decide to make such a difficult journey like the Hajj."}, {"id": 57, "text": "This documentary sheds some light on the Muslim tradition called Hajj. It is annual pilgrimage to the city of Mecca. As it was told everything has its center, and the center of Islamic world is Kaaba that is house of Allah. Only Muslims are allowed to be a pilgrim and enter the Mecca. As stated in Quran Muslims have 5 pillars to be done. And one of them is going to the Hajj, if you can afford it financially and physically. The modern Hajj was designed by the prophet Mohammed and was performed by him also. Nowadays, the number of people that perform the Hajj can overcome any the most popular event in the world. They have more than 2 million believers that come to the city for it. And, of course, such a big occasion needs serious preparations. The film shows us three characters that are involved to the modern Hajj from the different parts of the globe. And these characters are representatives of different races that tells us how widely Islam is spread. Going through their experience with the religion and the trip itself autohors skillfully give the information about the history. The roots of the Hajj go deep to the times of Adam and Eve that after their expulsion met on the Arafat mountains. We also have Abraham, the father of a lot of religions, and the prophet Muhammed as main actors in the story. We learn about the consequence of the Hajj and how each point is connected to the history. Actually, we have 7 steps of it. Everything starts with intention and reassuring Ihram. It is said that you should be prepared for the trip, get knowledge about the pilgrimage, to truly desire it and perform Umrah. After seeing each step performed, we observe that they are about replicating the actions of main actors. And by doing this people feel closer to God, get the harmony of the spirit. Pilgrims pray for relatives, ask for forgiveness and try to be a better person. In Islam the devil is the one who misguide people and make them do bad things. In the one section of the Hajj people go to the three stone pillar and throw different things at them. It is due to the story, where Abraham was tested by God and he needed to kill his son. The Saitan wanted to stop him telling him that he's gone crazy. However, Abraham realized everything and threw a stone at him three times. Now, people throw stones because they want to get rid of the feeling to do bad things. The idea of going to the pilgrimage is to fulfill the Muslim duty. And this gets even deeper, changing the aspects of people's life. They learn to be more patient, generous and be aware of evil. The Hajj, actually, is like a test of people that makes them feel the same things as main actors. Everyone say that after it you will never be the same. This also affected on our heroes in the film: Fidelma faced a harsh bias towards her belief because of her nationality. Therefore, she did not feel as a part of Muslim community, but she coped with that, what we can see in the end of the movie. Khalil told about racism and that even in such a sacred place people still divide themselves. And he learnt patience and understand that in front of God we are all equal. So, we got a wonderful journey with our characters that are changing as film goes on. From positive sides of the movie: excellent interlocking of the history of the place with the modern times, the right and full information about the Hajj, good soundtrack that involves you in the atmosphere of Mecca's corners, interesting stories of people. On the other hand, there is very low quality of the materials, very strong bias on the positive sides of the Hajj when everything is not so bright, because people die during the pilgrimage, poor sanitary conditions caused from a large amount of people. The overall score: 8/10"}, {"id": 58, "text": "A documentary movie by the National Geographic, Inside Mecca, directed in 2003, illustrate the story of the Hajj, the Holy pilgrimage to Mecca, which is one of the five obligations of every Muslim believer. The film is shown from the side of three different Muslim believers from different parts of the world: from preparation for the Hajj to its completion. To the positive aspect of the film can be included a detailed explanation of all the stages of the Hajj. The film tells you what type of clothes is required to be selected, what routes there are to Mecca, where to live and so on. In addition, it shows the significance of each stage of the Hajj, their historical and religious interpretations, meanings and importance. Consequently, the movie can be considered as the small preparation for the Hajj and see what is worth doing and what is not, what difficulties you will have to face. Personally, I am glad to see that the film showed the Hajj from all sides, illustrating both advantages and disadvantages, not as a religious film showing the greatness of one religion. For myself, I was left with a not very pleasant impression from the movie about the Hajj and seeing some of the disadvantages of the Holy pilgrimage pushed me to study the process even more. It is common knowledge that the Hajj is the commitment of every Muslim believer, traveling to the Holy Mecca and see the Kaaba, the house of God, in what direction Muslims pray 5 times every single day, for these true believers to see this place with their own eyes is magnificent, astonishing and breathtaking. However, despite the sanctity, pilgrimage is also a place of business, a place where money is made through the Muslims believers, a Holy place where people who position themselves as true believers, despite the rules and laws of Islam, can allow discrimination based on race, nation or material condition. Hajj is for the rich. According to Islamic laws, only wealthy Muslims can go to the Hajj, which should not be financially difficult for them, and all other ways such as loans and debts are not considered as an acceptable. In every country where pilgrims go to Mecca, there are travel companies controlled by religious institutions, which is considered as significantly profitable. There is no single common price for all Muslims, because depending on the thickness of the purse, pilgrims can afford not only a pilgrimage, but almost a luxury trip. Upon arrival, in addition to the group depending on the country, the financial component also divides people into different subgroups: it is obvious that the rich will stay in the best luxury hotels, and others in tents. But even there, not everything is so smooth: referring to the film, the guide admits that they have different conditions depending on the payment and even have VIP pilgrims. They have the best conditions, a pleasant, cool and quiet atmosphere, with delicious food and so on. While others are left into overcrowded tents. In addition, near the place of pilgrimage unfold markets where sell all sorts of religious things and not only. This can be carpets for prayer, souvenirs with the symbols of the Kaaba or Mecca, and even parts of the wardrobe that even do not relate to religion: ordinary leather bags and clothes, which indicates an ideal time and place for business. Probably another costly event during the Hajj is the sacrificing. Each pilgrim has to make a sacrifice or join in groups of 7 people to make it cheaper. However, this number of sacrifices for 2-3 million each year certainly brings profits for the livestock business of the country. Being a citizen of a country where there are not many pilgrims is relatively more difficult. Consequently, the heroine of the film from Texas has a harder period, because for the sake of faith in Islam, and later because of the pilgrimage, which led to conflicts in the family. According to Islamic law, only Muslims have the right to go to the Hajj, but the unawareness of some people makes itself felt: after all, the heroine often had to catch glances at herself, as well as stupid questions in the form of whether she is a Muslim or not. Khalil, a South African citizen, impressed me the most, as a positive and strong Muslim who truly believes in Islam, for whom the Hajj is probably the most important event in his entire life. However, even in such a Holy place and in a Holy time, racism was not canceled: Khalil had to leave the South African group because of racial discrimination, and in the future will join the black African group of Malawians. Probably, it is painful for a Muslim to be judged and treated according to the color of his skin, rather than for his faith, actions, and pure heart. In the conclusion, it worth mentioning that the pilgrimage is the most important event for a Muslim, it is required by his religion. Pilgrimage, a kind of imitation of the actions of past Holy people: running of Abraham's wife searching for water between the hills of Safa and Marwa, and eventually drinking the sacred water of Zamzam, stoning the Devil like Abraham itself and walking around the Kaaba 7 times as the prophet Muhammad did it before. Seeing the most sacred places with your own eyes, visiting them, and performing one of the five duties certainly strengthen Muslims' spirit and faith. However, modern Hajj, looking at the film, I see more as a commercial project of Saudi Arabia, which dramatically increase its budget through the Hajj as through tourism each year. With site the two most Holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the house of God Kaaba, this country is able to exert pressure on all Islamic countries if wishes, forbidding the pilgrimage for the conflicting countries. Moreover, there is a universal difference between the poor and the rich: with having money, pilgrims can perform the Hajj without the same difficulties, be in a cool place when it is 50 degrees outside, eat the best food and live in the best room, have workers who will carry all your heavy things, and sometimes even you. After all, the Hajj, in addition to duty, is a test of strength and faith, when a person goes for the sake of faith suffers all difficulties, some travel on foot all the way to Mecca, which is now very rare. I am really sorry that I obtained more negative impressions during the really good documentary film, and that my entire review is focused on the criticism of the current pilgrimage."}, {"id": 59, "text": "Inside Mecca is a documentary produced by National Geographic in 2003 by Anisa Mehdi, which shows us the annual event of pilgrimage to Mecca. As Mecca is a birthplace of prophet Muhammad and a place where the House of Lord Kaaba is located it is considered as the center of Islam religion and sacred place. Every Muslim who truly believe in God want to visit Mecca to make a pilgrimage, which is in Arabic Hajj. This is because Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which is five duties expected from Muslims. If a Muslim has a good health and financial opportunity to make Hajj, then he is obligated to do so at least for one time during his or her life. The prophet Muhammad had done the pilgrimage to Mecca, but it is believed that it was practiced by many people before the origin of Islam. The documentary illustrates step by step procedure of Hajj so that viewers could get an appropriate vision and understanding of the pilgrimage and idea of Islam itself. Although it is believed that during Hajj people should all be treated in the same way and not discriminate against each other, this review will argue that sometimes people can feel uncomfortable during Hajj because their nationalities and ethnicities are rare (unusual) among Muslims. However, despite this people try to be tolerant of each other and help their brothers and sisters. To make viewers feel the whole importance of the Hajj the documentary narrates us the stories of three people with absolutely different backgrounds, nationalities, ethnicities and social status but with a similar vision of life and the same faith. These are Fidelma O'Leary from Texas, Khalil from South Africa and Ishmael from Malaysia. The documentary shows us how Hajj of these people was different from each other and similar at the same time. The DIfference in their journey starts from the moment they left their homes, as a police escort gets Ishmael and his wife straight to the plain, while Khalil does not have such a safe journey and he has to take a public bus. In addition, the vivid difference in acceptance by other Muslims can be noticed before the stoning of the satan ritual when all pilgrims stopped to rest in Minna. Here we see that Khalil was not treated the same as other South African pilgrims for the reason his skin color is black and this was quite painful for him to see this condition happening during the Hajj. He says: We are here always in one community not looking to the color and not looking to the rest or whether you are rich or you're poor. This situation slightly had shaken his vision of brotherhood among Muslims. So, Halil then joined up with another group from Malawi. In the same manner, Fidelma was an object of attention for other pilgrims in Minna,because it was unusual for people to see a woman with a European appearance to be Muslim. We can notice that she catches the eye of many people. Fidelma says that most of the women in her group and even those who were strangers to her were trying to tell her what it is like to be a Muslim and asked her whether she is a Muslim or not. She says: I think they forgot for a moment that you can only be here if you are Mulsim. So this was not pleasant for Fidelma as people had a prejudice regarding just because she had another ethnicity. Also, going back to Ishamel it can be seen that his Hajj was different in a way that he has better services. Even though Hajj emphasizes the importance of being equal before God there is no prohibition on comfort as long as a pilgrim can pay for it. Accommodation varies from tent to tent so that all-inclusive economy packages start from around 2500 dollars. As the movie goes on it can be seen that eventually, Muslim people are tolerant and quite friendly. For example, one North African man found a tent for Fidelma and other men helped her with the collection of stones so that she could collect the right quantity of stones for stoning ritual. Similarly, when Khalil felt uncomfortable in his tent among South Africans, Malawi pilgrims were friendly with him and accepted him. Moving to the quality of the movie, I particularly liked the way different sounds and music were used for each scene. For example, when Muslims were praying, hearing the prayer was bewitching, or when pilgrims were doing shopping, cheerful music in the background made viewers feel that Hajj could also be fascinating. Also, I noticed that particularly the most significant moments of Hajj were filmed. By showing the scene when all the pilgrims were praying on the plane Arafat and asking God to forgive them I even started to cry because I could feel all the pain and other emotions of people. So, I believe the fact that the movie could touch the hearts of viewers means that it succeeded."}, {"id": 60, "text": "Documentary film Inside of Mecca shows three pilgrims' journeys to holy Mecca, from the preparation for the hajj to sad farewell prayer in the holy place. However, the film does not only focus on the intimate experience of these pilgrims, but rather through showing their journey explains the historical and religious background of the Muslim pilgrimage. Moreover, during the film, the viewer is introduced with the most important steps/rites of the hajj: circling the Kaaba, praying till sunset in Arafa, stoning of the Devil, running between hills, farewell prayer, and animal sacrifice. During the film, several important questions were raised. Firstly, Khalil Mandlazi, who is from South Africa was eager to experience the Muslim Brotherhood, which essentially means the unity of the Muslim community. Khalil several times mentioned that Islam means equality, brotherhood, unity. From Khalil's words, during the hajj, everyone should treat each other with respect, courtesy regardless of other person's race, wealth, age and gender. However, he encountered the calamity. Unfortunately, he was treated differently, because of his South African origins, but Khalil had to be patient and calm because he was in the state of Ihram. Throughout the film, the state of Ihram was mentioned many times, when Fidelma and Khalil experienced some distressing situations. Before the Hajj pilgrims enter the state of Ihram, which is a pure frame of mind. For the people in that state, it is crucial to be courteous, patient, respectful despite any calamities during the Hajj. Ihram could be explained in several ways. Firstly, there could be many minor difficult situations during the Hajj, because millions of people occupy the same place at once, praying to God and conforming religious rites. The state of Ihram eases the tension, frictions in those critical moments. However, the state of Ihram also has symbolical meaning. Mecca is a holy city, and a state of Ihram symbolizes the holiness and importance of the city in Islam. According to film, Muslims don't pray to Kaaba, or the city itself, however, those places have an extremely important role in Islam and serves as a holy place to perform hajj. Kaaba (House of God) according to Muslim tradition was built by Adam, then was rebuilt by Abraham, but after a while, Kaaba was surrounded by idols because people started to deviate from monotheism towards idol worshiping. As a result, Mecca became a city, that has an extremely crucial political and religious role for Prophet Muhammad. In 7th century (or 8th year after hijra) returning from Medina, Prophet Muhammed and his followers swiped off all the idols and started to widely spread monotheistic religion (Islam) (Berkey, 61-77). The state of Ihram, therefore, obligates people to respect the history of Kaaba and recognize the cruciality of this holy city, as well as help them to cope with the calamities that they might encounter while performing hajj with millions of people. Throughout the film, the story of Abraham had a a significant role for an explanation of rites and their symbolical representations. For example, hustling between Al-Safa and Al-Marwa serves as replicating the urgency, desperation of Abraham's wife Hadar, when she was left by Abraham in a dessert. While (last step of a hajj) the animal sacrifice is replicating Abraham's sacrifice after God let him sacrifice a sheep, not his son. We see that every ritual, every detail in hajj has a religious symbol, historical background, which makes hajj powerful religious ritual. The film tries to show the viewer that the hajj or Muslim pilgrimage is not only a series of complex religious rituals but rather is a complex event that includes rituals with deep religious meaning, starting from the cloth that everyone wears, that is 2 pieces of white material. That cloth symbolizes the unimportance of wealth, race, social status because everyone is in the same outfit. However, paradoxically, hajj is introduced as a chance to have a direct spiritual connection with God, this could be experienced on a Mountain of Arafat, when people together worship, thanks, repents before God. And the unity on the Arafat can be also felt while circling the Kaaba (holy stone) with more than a million people, therefore people feel the unity of the religious community. Moreover, the stoning of the devil serves as a symbol of repentance, the battle between the person's bad side and good side and embracing Islam as a tool to battle your dark side. During the film, it was mentioned that hajj changes people, their state of mind and upgrade their religious beliefs. However, people have diverse experience and takeouts from the hajj, as it was shown in a film Ismail Mahbob wanted to become good father and believer, Fidelma O'Leary said that this journey helped her to see the place that she faced five times a day, every day. Khalil Mandhlazi had experienced the Muslim brotherhood, that he was striving to feel. Moreover, Fidelma mentioned that people in Mecca should get used to seeing Europeans, American people performing hajj. And indeed, as Khalil mentioned, Islam stands for unity, integrity, and peace. Finally, Muslim pilgrimage doesn't guarantee you direct meeting with God for your money, but rather an experience that makes people embrace, devote to their religions even more, because according to film during the hajj people feel Muslim unity, repent for their sins, have spiritual connection with God.Reference:Berkey, Jonathan P.2002. Formation of Islam. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press."}, {"id": 61, "text": "The director of Inside Mecca, Anisa Mehdi, is of half-Iraqi and half-Canadian descent. It is perhaps not surprising that someone like Mehdi would wish to explore issues of identity, which are at the core of this movie, in more depth in their own professional work. In this review, I will argue that this documentary film's main purpose was to expand the borders of what being a Muslim means in the understanding of people both inside and outside the religion, although perhaps for the latter group to a greater extent. This was done through the choice of main participants and the demonstration of historical facts behind the rituals of the hajj amidst a number of cinematographic techniques to support it. The 2003 National Geographic documentary follows three individuals on their way to the journey that every Muslim dreams upon doing at least once in a lifetime - the hajj to Mecca. It gives us an insight into the participants' different backgrounds, preparations for the road, and eventually the struggles and the bliss that they have to go through to be able to call themselves Hajji or Hajja. Another exploration that this film pursues is the historic significance of Mecca to both Islam and non-Islamic religions. First, the participants of this documentary had been chosen to represent various racial, national, and even religious past and backgrounds. This was to show, for both Muslim and non-Muslim populations, the diversity of those individuals that might be committed to Islam, especially since completing the hajj is considered the most valid proof of one's dedication to this religion. These individuals come from Malaysia, South Africa, and the United States and all of them speak English, bringing them closer to an English-speaking audience watching the documentary. As the documentary rightly pointed out, there are currently more than a billion Muslims (with the majority of non-Arab background) in the world growing their numbers each year around all continents and nations, including the United States and Europe, where Muslims have been for long undoubtedly marginalized and discriminated. The shots from afar of Kaaba and other places around Mecca help people to see the uncountable number of people that practice and dedicate themselves to Islam before we even take into account that people at Mecca replace each other all the time with new people coming and leaving throughout the whole year and also that many Muslims would never be able to accomplish such journey. Even for some members of Islamic faith, as was shown in the documentary, and more definitely so for non-Muslims, it might be strange to stumble upon someone from a different background than what is generally assumed to represent a Muslim person. For example, Khalil Mandhlazi, a black South African male pilgrim to Mecca, was not so much accepted allegedly due to the color of his skin, even in the circles representing his own country. Similarly, Fidelma O'Leary, a white American having a while ago converted from Catholicism, also voiced problems of needing secondary confirmation of her being an actual Muslim from the mosque that she attends in order to be able to obtain a visa, along with the fact that she has surprised many individuals she met in Mecca who inquired where she was from and if she was, indeed, Muslim. However, eventually, Khalil managed to find a group of Malawi pilgrims to pray with, with whom he felt more accepted, and Fidelma felt that she was welcome after a brief encounter with a man who greeted her nicely. This was to show for the non-Muslims (and probably to encourage those within the Muslim faith to do the same) that Muslims can be accepting of each other despite the differences and are not as exclusivist or nationally/ethnically/racially isolated as one might think. Second, the rituals were, in my view, successfully explained to the general non-Muslim audience of other Abrahamic religions, for instance Christians or Jews of the United States, who might be to various degrees struggling to understand what the significance of them was. The specific explanation of the hajj and the rituals accompanying it in the film helped overall to connect Islam with the other Abrahamic religions, the connection that tends to be forgotten in the wake of rivalries between believers of these faiths, again for both Muslims and non-Muslims. Even though Mecca had now become the most sacred of all places for the Muslims most dominantly, according to the historic background presented in the film through a couple of expert opinions, this place had had a profound connection to all Abrahamic religions even before they emerged as world religions. In fact, as a scholar of Islam claims in the documentary, it was Abraham, the father of Jews, Christians, and Muslims, who besides advocating a submission to one deity, created the concept of pilgrimage to Mecca, that is the hajj as we know it today (14 min). The use of European paintings portraying Abraham, Ismail, angel Gabriel and the like, which are closer to the audiences coming from the Western countries, was an effective technique to describe those stories to an otherwise skeptical community that might not identify with Muslim faith. Many things described in this documentary are seen as important to other non-Islamic religions, thus it makes audiences coming from those backgrounds understand the significance behind what most Muslims seek to achieve once in their life - the hajj. Other things were, in my perspective, aimed not only at the non-Muslim religious and non-religious audiences, but also specifically at those within the Islamic community of believers itself. For example, a woman does not need to wear hijab on the daily basis or have a husband, for that matter, to call herself a Muslim and attempt to do the hajj. Fidelma, who is also a professor of neuroscience, does not wear head garments every day and has been divorced. The importance of charity in Islam is shown and more importantly how Muslim members of non-dominant ethnicities within the religious community can give as much or even more attention to upholding some values, such as the significance of giving to those in need, that are integral to Islam and life of a Muslim believer. Upon arriving to Mecca, Khalil is shown as being not at ease with hungry and poor kids and later decides to buy and take a patch of food to those communities in need that tend to live above the city, thus bringing some difficulty to those like Khalil wishing to engage in charitable activities. In conclusion, Inside Mecca showed the extent of what kinds of people can identify with Muslims despite the stereotypes that both people of Muslim and non-Muslim identities might have. One of the film's main arguments is that believers of Islam can be of all ethnic and racial backgrounds coming from a wide range of countries geographically distant from each other, such as Malaysia, South Africa, and the United States, as was shown through the three cases depicted in this documentary. Furthermore, the movie establishes that what Muslim individuals believe in and practice, of which the most vivid example is the hajj, is not completely separated from the origins of other dominant world religions, most importantly Christianity (as per the majority of the assumed Western or American audience of this film). For the audience coming from the Muslim community itself also, Inside Mecca gives some questions and limitations to think about, such as the importance of charity, the presence of female headwear, or the existence of racial prejudices within the community."}, {"id": 62, "text": "Probably many Muslim believers in their life needs to make a pilgrimage to Mecca. It is a symbol of truth and understanding of it differs from people to people. In order to accomplish this, I claim that it is not necessary to be a Muslim and/or cross half of the world to travel to Mecca. I am confident that everyone should found his own Mecca through the way of finding one's faith. To find the faith in universal context, perhaps it could be belief in yourself or someone above this world. Nobody is able to set the criteria and determine the faith in this context. However, one clear thing is that by exposure to the religious knowledge should be a primary source or secondary one, the book or the movie, you may be able to find your own faith. The National Geographic film directed by Anisa Mehdi: Inside Mecca (2003) provides a very intimate shoot of the Muslims pilgrimage to Mecca, as well as approved my initial believes. Moreover, the movie spotlighted the historical importance of holy city Mecca to both the Muslim and non-Muslim people, Arab and non-Arabic population all around the world. Inside Mecca (2003) documented three Muslims from different regions and background path to Hadj as they followed a five-day quest salvation. One of them is Ismail, a rich executive director from Malasiya. The second one is a radio commentator Hail from South Africa. The third is Fidelma O'leary, a female professor of neuroscience originated from USA. Hadj is one of the five pillars of Muslim. As long as there are over 2 million of Muslims all around the world every year intended to pilgrimage, there are a lots of planing required in making the trip happen both for pilgrims and Saudi Arabia officials."}, {"id": 63, "text": "National Geographic documentary directed by Anisa Mehdi in 2003 shows the inside view on the Hajj, an annual Islamic pray ritual. Since the journey to Mecca is not affordable by all Muslims and restricted for participation by non-muslims, the movie has a great value for a wide audience. Over two million people come to see the Kaaba and have a chance to pray in the holy places, reaching the spiritual relief as well as a sense of accomplishment obligated by religion. Noteworthy to mention that a film was shooted from a view of three pilgrims Ismail Mahbob, Khalil Mandhlazi, and Fidelma O'Leary who lives in different parts of the world. This enables us to understand the challenges of the Hajj and eventually the meaning of the ritual better. Taking into consideration that even hurdles of three persons look difficult, the various issues of the two million brings an idea of the scale and importance of the event to the local Muslim society. Nevertheless, all pilgrims regardless of the struggles aim to finish seven circumambulations of the Kaaba for the conscious perception of the true brotherhood, equality of the people, and the reorganization of thoughts about life purpose according to the Islamic teachings. In the following review analysis of Ismail, Khalil, and Fidelma comments are going to be made. In addition, interpretations of some rituals based on the personal understanding of the material will be mentioned.The unique experience of the Hajj is told by Fidelma or Dr. O'Leary, a professor at the university and the US citizen of European ethnic group. Grown by the Catholic family and living in a society with a majority being Christians leads to numerous difficulties for the new Muslim, including psychological pressure from the relatives. Starting from long away preparations of learning the right instructions of the Hajj in regular weekly meetings and ending with buying special clothes to fulfill the pilgrim requirements at the place. Interestingly, being a women traveling alone Fidelma needs a formal agreement from son. After arrival to Mecca, the optimistic mood and passion for spiritual satisfaction motivate her to use the advantages of the pray in a holy place. Eventually, regardless of the alienation feeling, she finds that other Muslims treat her respectfully not less than others and even be glad to know her by giving suggestions to continue the path. This helps Fidelma to finish the Hajj and safely return home.The second story is about Khalil Mandhlazi, a preacher who explains the Islam during weekly radio broadcasts in a rural area of South Africa. Khalil being a religious person aims to visit Kaaba for the first time and this makes him nervous. This gives him an opportunity to attain spiritual needs and complete the fifth Islamic obligation. However, during traveling, he finds out that not all Muslims follow the sense of brotherhood regardless of origin, one of the main teachings of the religion. Moreover, Khalil tries to do more goods at the place by making donations for poor families at the mountains and for his surprise sees that nobody did the same before. Nevertheless, finally, Khalil finishes all rituals, refreshes the understanding of the true meanings of Islam in a sense (the main goal of Hajj), and leaves the Al-Haram mosque.The last pilgrim, Mr. Ismail Mahbob, a Malaysian entrepreneur who travels with his wife. The financial success in the business, broker company environment, social circle, and certain habits makes the Hajj a challenging trip as the conditions of walk in a crowd differs from the ordinary life in Malaysia. However, being a Muslim Ismail with no doubts prepares for a long trip. One of the first requirements that he meets is the wearing simple two cloth to close the body parts. This unifies pilgrims by giving them a feeling of equality in front of Allah. In addition, it challenges the inside ego and the arrogance, the quality of special usefulness to wealthy people as Ismail. At the end of the Hajj, Ismail looks to attain the meaning of Islam as a religion of equality and understand the weakness of human being.To conclude, the followers of the Islam annually performs the Hajj, a direction of daily prays, with common initial reason and leaves the Mecca being a different person after a giving thorough thoughts at the place to the certain personal problems/wishes. Probably the whole atmosphere in the Kaaba, a center of the universe, provides the opportunity for the pilgrims to gather fresh religious spirit according to the Muslims' believes. The movie demonstrated the values interpreted by Islam in terms of individual needs and shows that annual Hajj that is obligated to do once in a life (if affordable) is important and a central point of spiritual power for religious Muslims. We see that finally all characters fulfill the goals and return with a satisfaction regardless of long daily walks in a crowd under hot weather and other numerous physically uncomfortable conditions. The director, Anisa Mehdi, creatively shows the true meaning of individual rituals which I believe is of essential value to understand the Hajj for the common audience."}, {"id": 64, "text": "The movie Inside Mecca produced by National Geographic Television is a documentary film about the Arabian city Mecca which is regarded as a sacred place for Muslim people. Not only for local Muslim people but believers of Islam all around the globe are also coming to this city to make one of the holiest things in their religion to make pilgrimage or in Arabic termed as to make Hajj. The making of pilgrimage is one of the five pillars for Muslim people. In other words if believers of Islam can physically and financially can afford making Hajj they will be obliged to do that at least once in their life. This tradition was done by the Prophet Muhammad and his followers and further continuing until our times. This movie professionally describes and shows the most important doings of Muslim people in the period of Hajj. In other words, by showing each step of making Hajj, we can see the major details which are made by Muslim people to fully and accurately complete their pilgrimage. In addition, the movie seemed to me to be describing not only positive sides of making pilgrimage but focused also on difficulties occurring during Hajj facing each Muslim and showing that it needs big patience for Muslims to complete their Hajj and therefore, this action can be counted as one of the ascetic actions for the sake of the God rather than just traveling to another city. The movie chooses three Muslim people who are interviewed in their preparation to Hajj, their emotions and reactions to different cases were shot during Hajj and after that. These actors are selected from different countries and nationalities. What is interesting and catches my attention is that all of these people before the Hajj were showing their desire to make pilgrimage and they also showed they are not doing it because they are obliged to do but by the movie we can see their true love to their religion and the God. We can also see it firstly from their long preparation to Hajj. Firstly, as we understand by the movie there is required permission to go to Hajj for women from any man within their relatives or husband. And our American actress asks permission from her son which idea she does not like however she accepts it as a part of rule of making Hajj and obeys it. In the movie appeared other problems which were not easy to accept for them but they tried their best to tolerate and solve all faced problems. This movie was produced in 2003 which is 15 years before from now. It is not so early from now and the movie is also very qualitative with good voice and well acted actors. The movie is also bright and instantly catches attention with interesting moments. However, even though the tradition of pilgrimage and its stages are not changing significantly, there could be added some changes of making Hajj due to constantly changing unstable world. For example, the documents required for making pilgrimage could be changed such as the requirement of the permission for woman from husband or any man within relatives which is nowadays sounds weird because if your husband or relatives are unbelievers or they might be unhappy with your pilgrimage. This may be left from ancient tradition and now could be criticized and turned into preferable status however it could also left unchanged which is unknown. Such kind of rules and laws for making Hajj could be changed due to time. In addition, the city of Mecca and other places for making pilgrimage could be changed to comfort the process of making Hajj for Muslim people which was described as difficulties for Muslim people in this movie. Therefore, updated movies should be produced about the Hajj for Muslim people and may be for non Muslims also to be involved in the process of contemporary situation of the Hajj. In conclusion, overall this movie very well describes the details for making Hajj and shows how it is exciting to make pilgrimage and at the same time how it is hard to be patient for difficulties in the way of the making Hajj for Muslims people. However, as it is older movie compared to this time and more changes could be occurred after the movie was produced, it will be more accurate if updated movies about making the Hajj will be produced. Overall, I liked the movie how it is shortly shot and have described the significant facts about the Hajj and Mecca. Interesting moments and qualitative pictures with professional actors were catching the eyes of audience and made more interesting about the history of the Islam. My recommendation for further development of movie if it is thought of gaining more audience might be to document film not only from three people's sides but to include other Muslim people too with different cultural and social backgrounds which might turn movie into level of more entertaining and appealing to audience."}, {"id": 65, "text": "Inside Mecca is a National Geographic documentary movie directed by Anisa Mehdi that describes the set of mandatory for Muslim community rituals that usually done during the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca - Hajj. This movie displays the experience of three pilgrims that have different religious, economic and social backgrounds and that are from three different countries: The United States, South Africa, and Malaysia. This film shows that Hajj is not only the set spiritual ritual but also it is a God's test that is created in order prove Muslims' readiness to give up comfort and pilgrim to the Mecca without any material belongings except their ritual clothes. During the Hajj, all pilgrims are obligated to participate in following rituals. First of all, all pilgrims must attend Al-Haram Mosque where holy Kaaba is located and walk counter-clockwise around Kaaba seven times. Then they must travel to the tunnel between hills Safa and Marwan and move fast back and forth seven times in this tunnel and drink Zamzam water afterward. Lastly, they must go to the Arafat mountain in order to stay there one night and perform the stoning ceremony in order to fight their devil. When the rituals in Hajj ends people shave or cut their head and sacrifice to the God a sheep. Afterward, the official part of Hajj end and three-day celebration of Eid begins. One of the best points of this movie is that it describes the experience of three totally different persons and shows all the difficulties that they faced before and during the Hajj. For example, Christian parents of Fidelma O'Leary were completely against her decision to accept Muslim. Moreover, through the experience of Malaysian Ismail viewer can notice that in order to make a Hajj people should be ready for it not only physically but also mentally. Through this film, we can clearly see that making a Hajj requires serious and thorough preparation for it. So, people cannot just take their baggage and passport and attend the Mecca. It has its own rules and regulations that should be followed in order to enter Mecca. It is good to see that the importance of these regulations is highlighted in this movie. Another interesting and educational point of this movie was that it showed that every ritual that should be done during the Hajj is linked to the important religious and events that led to the emergence of one of the most popular religions - Islam. For example, it visually showed that counter-clockwise walking around the Kaaba seven times is similar as Muhammad did when polytheism fell giving the rise for Islam in Mecca. Also running back and forth in the tunnel is analogous to the actions of Ishmael's mother when she was left between Safa and Marwan hills with his son without any water and food. In order to find some water to feed her son Hagar run with desperation from beginning to the end of the road seven times and Allah decided to reward her with healing Zamzam water. In addition, the stoning ceremony is held in order to fight with devils inside of each pilgrim as Abraham did to fight a real devil. During the Hajj, this ritual is considered as one of the most dangerous ones as people become angry at their devil and throw all of the stones that they collected with blind passion. Moreover, this movie provided with a rational picture of the events that were happening during the Hajj without any idealization. This can be clearly seen in scenes in which people moved from Mecca to Mina in order to perform a stoning ceremony. Even during the Hajj South Arabian and American pilgrims experienced racism and nationalism from other pilgrims that made similar rituals. It is clearly seen that this incident hurt them and that they did not expect such treatment during the Hajj. Unfortunately, even inside of the community that propagates the equal treatment of every people there are individuals that have socio-economic prejudices towards their peers. This was one of the most disappointing events that were happened in this movie. One of the interesting paradoxes that occurred in this movie is the fact that even during the Hajj some of the people are not perfectly equally treated. For example, inside of the tents that were built for pilgrims near the Arafat mountain people can buy the comfort if they have enough money for it. For this money, they can buy better food, drink or accommodation. To my point of view, such kind of treatment contradicts the idea of Islamic society where everyone should be treated equally. For me, it was a really emotional movie as it shows all the emotional problems that three main characters experienced and provides with their own personal stories about their difficulties that they faced in their entire life. Moreover, at the end when they cried viewer can notice that they found some peace and attained internal relief. Overall, I would recommend this movie for my peers that are unaware of the reason why the majority of Islamic people perform Hajj."}, {"id": 66, "text": "Inside Mecca gives a unique opportunity to immerse ourselves in Islamic religion and become a part of an essential Muslim experience, Hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca - the Muslim's holiest city. The film released by National Geographic provides a unique access to the heart of Islamic world, which is impossible for non-Muslim to attain. The Hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam, is an obligatory duty of any Muslim to accomplish for at least once in a life in order to prove their obedience. Therefore, Mecca is a year-round destination, which is particularly popular during the Hajj season, when a flow of Muslims from all over the world increases dramatically just in five days. Annually about two million people come there to ask for forgiveness and confirm their faith. However, the pilgrimage requires not only belief in one God, but also means to achieve him. In other words, the devotion of faith is largely defined by material wealth rather than by one's inner spirituality. Even if Islam promotes equality for all people concerning both earthy and spiritual life, the paradox is that the hajj is not really the same for everyone, as the film shows.Anisa Mehdi, director and producer of the film, uses a stories of three Muslims from a different cultural and social background as a basis of the narration. Their journey, both physical and spiritual, gives a viewer a full impression of what the pilgrims do experience, their emotional challenges and transformation. We want to show viewers around the world the remarkable experience of the hajj: that it is at once deeply personal and widely universal  - is the proper description of the film, explained by the director herself. The first story is about American white-skin woman (which is not a common appearance of a Muslim), who wanted to fully embrace the faith, but apparently not every Muslim was ready to embrace her. The second hero is a South African man, who truly believes in tolerance and brotherhood he was searching in Islam. These two stories share a problem of stereotypical conception of a Muslim in terms of race and nationality as the religion of only Arabic background. The third pilgrim is a Malaysian executive, who is going to challenge the material wealth he is used to. All the three stories are absolutely different, what give us an opportunity to realize all possible difficulties people may face during their pilgrimage. On the example of their way for redemption, the documentary explains every stage and rituals of hajj as well as its religious origins in detail, so that any profane viewer is able to understand its significance. The first phase, for instance, adventure in a valley of Mina, is both mental and physical test, where all people are supposed to be equal before god. In fact, however, the infrastructure of the journey is organized in a modern way and is highly commercialized. People are offered guest rooms of a different classes according to the level of comfort it provides. It paradoxically appears that the emphasis of being equal does not prohibit a comfort, as long as a person can pay for it. Hajj therefore is also a journey for a wallet, as well as for a soul. In addition to that, people here are organized according to their origin countries with a logistic purpose, what however does not eliminate the problem of discrimination, which ideally should not exist among Muslims. The next stage is walking for eight miles to Arafat plain within the specific marked boundaries. Here the documentary explicitly shows that hajj is definitely not a vacation, it is full of stress in a crowd of millions, no schedule and no sleep. At the same time, all pilgrims must keep patience and courtesy. The next stage is the way back to Mina - one of the most dangerous intersections of the Hajj - a stoning of the devil. Even if Saudi authorities build up a special wall and bridge for people's safety there is still a high risk of being trampled, beaten and suffocate. The significance of the ritual is to replicate the Ibrahim's (Abraham's) hajj. According to the religious texts, Ibrahim stoned each of the three pillars, whenever the devil comes. Therefore, this place is also meaningful for all Abrahamic religions, as an Axis Mundi by Eliade. However, Mecca is closed for non-Muslims, even though it was a place of pilgrimage for generations and symbolizes the worship of one God.Finally, successfully went through all the physical and emotional difficulties of the hajj, people feel they achieve their goals and got satisfied. Hajj also give them a sense of belonging and motivation. Apart from the religious side, the movie shows how the process of hajj had been changed over time with an expansion of Islam. The stages of hajj become more organized and upgraded in terms of infrastructure, however continue to be a center of trade of the Arabian peninsula."}, {"id": 67, "text": "Inside Mecca Inside Mecca is a documentary movie produced by the National Geographic Television in 2003. It depicts one of the profound rituals in the Islamic religious traditions - hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca (1). The movie is formatted as an interview of three pilgrims from South Africa, Malaysia and USA supplemented with narrations explaining the events in historical and religious context. The first impression from the movie was that it was very informative. It showed the entire plan of the hajj, including counter-clockwise walking around Kaaba seven time, running back and forth between the hills of Safa and Mrwash, drinking from ZamZam well, going to plains of Mount Arafat, spending night in the plain of Murzalifa, stoning the devil, sacrificing a sheep and visiting a barber. In doing so, there were numerous references to Abrahamic origins and Islamic history that explained where all of those parts of the ritual pilgrimage come from and what they mean. In addition, the format of the film, which included the actual footage of the hajj, gave me a sense of experience, as if I was a part of that journey. Along with that, I felt that the movie excellently portrayed the message of equity in front of God. The three pilgrims, Ismail Mahbob from Malaysia, Khalil Mandhlazi from South Africa, and Fidelma O'Leary, each had distinct lives, occupation and status. Nonetheless, in Mecca, the place where millions of different people gathered due to hajj, they left everything behind. For instance, all male pilgrims wore special clothing, Ihram, and all females wore humble clothing covering their head. They gave up comfort, staying with numerous people in a room. However, this idea of equity was somewhat paradoxal, and the movie showed that as well. For instance, there were several shelters of premium/luxe/VIP class that had less people in them and different food. The staff told that the in front of God there were no VIP, no reach, no poor. Though not really related to the movie itself, doesn't the difference in the conditions bring difference to the overall experience? The fact that the movie included the scenes showing how people entered Mecca, Saudi Arabia, how the city prepared for hajj, the conditions at which the pilgrims were placed provided realistic and convincing insight into the entire period of the hajj. The narrator mentioned risks of being run over by pilgrims, having abnormal sleep or being hit by stones. Such episodes left the impression of being objective and showing the full picture with all of the beauty and risks. Another thing I appreciated in the movie was the cast, or is it better to say its absence? The interviewees were real people with real occupation not related to acting. Therefore, they, I believe, showed their honest attitude, expressed their opinions and feelings. Especially, the moments of them crying when praying or seeing the Mecca, overflowing with genuine emotions left me truly delighted with the strength of their faith and how much the hajj meant to them. In addition, the pilgrims met some racial prejudices, pointing at the human nature of them. For instance, being from the US Fidelma encountered many other people asking is she was truly Muslim. Khalil met some inequity in accommodation and assumed that it happened due to his race. Of course, they were upset and disappointed that such happening took place during the hajj but held their tempers and tried to keep calm for the sake of the sanctity of the ritual pilgrimage they were performing. There is no way that such discipline, devotion, and control could not impress the viewers. Aside the meaning of the hajj to the pilgrims, the movie included episodes of preparation of Kaaba and other facilities to the hajj. It took the great effort for the officials of Saudi Arabia to host the pilgrims and organize their transportation and so on. Such prior organization process cannot be seen but felt during hajj. From the movie it gave and impression of like a behind the scenes to a full immersing to the atmosphere of the hajj. Before watching this movie, I have not known that the sheep sacrifice and shaving or cutting hair was the part of the hajj. Although sacrifices and donations are familiar rituals in Islam, it was cognitive to get to know why exactly the ship was sacrificed and donated on behalf of the pilgrims. The religious meaning behind shaving or cutting hair was nice to know as well. Moving onto the movie editing and production, it worth noticing the included maps that were used during narration to show in which part around the Mecca a particular place was located. Although it was not the most important aspect of the movie, it was interesting to know where the particular stops during the hajj were relative to each other. Accompanied by narrations, they added to general comprehension of the hajj. Another interesting fact about the production, is that this movie is f-rated, representing women on screen and behind the camera (1, 2). Finally, I would definitely recommend the movie to those who wants to get to know the hajj."}, {"id": 68, "text": "An informative video. perfect for newbies who have no idea about mecca and great for those who may have some knowledge. Good perspective for someone who may not be muslim."}, {"id": 69, "text": "Inside Mecca tells the story of 3 Muslims making their pilgrimage to Mecca, called Hajj, and is one of the 5 pillars of Islam. The movie is shot in documentary style and shows how traveling to Mecca is not as easy as you may have expected. The movie follows 3 people on their journey to Mecca, Ismail Mahbob, Khalil Mandhlazi and Fidelma O'Leary. Because there are over 1.7 billion Muslims in the world and all of them have to make this journey to mecca there needs to be a lot of planning involved in making the trip happen. You must book a time to go weeks or even months in advance. Something I found interesting with the film is that the American women, Fidelma O'Leary, was going by herself on the trip she would need permission from her husband. But because she was divorced, she needed permission from her only son to travel to Mecca. I was surprised that they weren't asked to stop recording more because I thought the administrators would not have wanted them to film there. I think this film does an excellent job of showing the difficulties of making the pilgrimage but also how important it is to make it."}, {"id": 70, "text": "What started off as just another class assignment, became a really informative, and fascinating movie, that I would recommend to all. The movie follows three completely different people, who have one thing in common: traveling to Mecca to fulfill hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam. The documentary provided the history of hajj, which was interesting since I didn't known much about it. However the focal point of the movie was not its history, but instead what hajj is like in the modern-day, this was shown when it described the many inconveniences that they endured traveling to Mecca. I particularly sympathized with the Daisy, who was white, and therefore got looks and was often questioned about being a 'real Muslim'.One aspect that I liked about the documentary was that it showed how the Hajj is a physical and spiritual journey. Each traveler, on top of the physical challenges was met with mental struggles. For example, both Fidelma and Khalil faced discrimination because of their ethnicity and gender even though everyone is meant to be equal before God. The document taught me that Mecca is not simply going to visit the Kabba, but instead a much deeper spiritual journey that people join to strengthen and fasten their relationship with Allah. Furthermore, seeing how much emotion people feel when experiencing hajj and simply seeing the masses that travel from thousands of miles away from all of the world to attend was incredible and gives perspective to those like me, who know very little about Islam."}, {"id": 71, "text": "Inside Mecca documents the pilgrimage to Mecca, or hajj, through three very different perspectives. As I was watching this film, I was amazed to see how communal but personally challenging the hajj is. Each person would have a different experience with separate mental, spiritual and physical challenges. I really liked how National Geographic did this. They personally followed an American, South African and Malaysian through their own walk. They were all non-traditional Muslims, so the discrimination the South African felt because he wasn't white, or the looks the American got when she wore her covering was all very real. Also, the film juxtaposed the masses of Mecca against the personal experiences and lessons of each person which was very thoughtful. Another thing I found to be very interesting was how informative the video was. Before watching this film, I never knew how complicated or strenuous the experience of the pilgrimage could be. I thought what Fidelma, the woman NatGeo had followed, said before her journey was quite profound. I don't know why anyone would want to spend a week with three million sweaty people and even eat in the desert unless they were really doing this for the love of god. All of these Muslims chose to be there because they have a longing to do so, not because their religion requires them to do it. This documentary also informed me of what each stage of the pilgrimage was for and what it symbolized. Furthermore, the concept of Ihram was so inspiring to see because once the rich, poor, illiterate, literate put on the same robe, you wouldn't see a difference. This way they were able to focus on the soul and not just outer appearances. Overall, I think this documentary was extremely well done and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested or just wants to learn more about Islam and the pilgrimage to Mecca."}, {"id": 72, "text": "Watching this movie was originally a class assignment, so I hadn't been expecting to be very interested or inspired. However, as the film concluded, I found myself really appreciating what I'd just watched. I think the greatest value of this film was the way in which it was structured. The film is shown through the perspectives of three different people from vastly different backgrounds, and whose only uniting factor was that they were undertaking the Hajj. They each have their own personal reasons for going, but the ultimate goal of the Hajj - the honoring of the covenant with God, and the declaration of God's glory - is shared by all three travellers. There were two things I thought the film did very excellently through these three characters. The first, was that it showed how the Hajj is a physical and spiritual journey. Each traveller, on top of the physical challenges (walking long distances in the desert heat, etc.), was met with mental/spiritual struggles. For example, both Fidelma and Khalil faced discrimination because of their ethnicity and gender even though everyone is meant to be equal before God. It showed the power of faith when both were able to overcome this discrimination to preserve their state of Ihram to complete their Hajj. There were other signs of inequality. One of my favorite quotes was what the manager at Minah said about customers, accommodations. Even though they are called VIPs, they are not necessarily special. It is only to describe the services they require that they are labeled VIP, deluxe, or premium. The second thing I thought was very interesting, was the message the movie leaves you with. The last quote in the movie is from Fidelma and she says that the people of Mecca should expect to see more and more people with different looks making the Hajj, because the faith is spreading in this globalized world. The way I see it, the documentary itself is a testimony to the growing awareness of world religions, of opportunities to learn and understand."}, {"id": 73, "text": "National Graphic's, Inside Mecca makes use of unique access to Islam's holiest city to follow three different Muslims of very different backgrounds as they go though a five-day quest for salvation.

One of the five pillars of Islam, the hajj is required of all who can manage it. Each year, Muslims from all over the world travel to Mecca to praise and give thanks to God, to ask pardon for their sins and to renew their spiritual commitment through rituals.

Inside Mecca takes us on the amazing journey of the Hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca through the views of three different Muslims from very different backgrounds on the largest annual gathering of the Muslims in the world. Because I didn't know much about the religion before watching the movie, it has definitely taught me a lot about Islam and I really liked how we were able to experience the pilgrimage through not just one person's point of view, but three. This showed me how many different people could bond through the gathering, not needing to have much commonality between each other. Even at times it wasn't very interesting, the overall movie was informative and I really enjoyed it."}, {"id": 76, "text": "This film shows what a hajj entails to Mecca and its surroundings.

After having the chance to view the film i was amazed at the way you were immersed into the lives of the Muslims that were being followed. You are given the opportunity to see and travel the road just like you would if you were in fact participating. The film also does a good job at explaining the biblical theories behind the rituals that are being performed as well. Without this I think that many people would have a harder time relating to the experiences. Both people of no or different religious backgrounds can watch this film and just learn. The only thing that I saw wrong with the video was the fact that there was no Arib. I would have found it interesting to have seen the pilgrimage from their point of view as well. They did a good job at showing a woman's point of view as well as two men of different economical stages in their lives. On a side note the makers did not only just focus on the religious aspects of the hajj but also the racial and gender issues that come into play. All in all though I think that this film could be used to broaden the horizons of those with only the stereotypes to base fact on."}, {"id": 78, "text": "When looking for a religious film to watch I knew that I wanted to watch one about Islam because I wanted to be more informed. After watching Inside Mecca I am extremely glad with my choice of film because it provided me with a much brighter and more knowledgeable outlook on Islamic beliefs and rituals. This movie explains and depicts Islam's hajj, which is a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia that is one of the five pillars of Islam. One of my favorite aspects of this movie was that it showed the journey of hajj from the perspectives of three people who broke the mold of Muslim stereotypes. There is a white Texan female, a black South African man and a Malaysian man. Before watching this documentary I ignorantly presumed the majority of Muslims to be Arab this movie taught me that only about 20% of Muslims are Arab. I thought that these three characters all had beautiful stories and reasons for being Muslim, especially the man from South Africa who adores how Islam accepts all genders, races and social statuses because he has seen so much racism throughout his country that he is now looking for peace through hajj. This movie does not only give the audience insight into who actually worships Islam but it also gives history to why they travel on hajj and it gives specific reasons for why Muslims partake in the numerous days of rituals. From this movie I have learned that Mecca is not simply going to visit the Kabba, but instead it is a spiritual journey that people choose to join in order to strengthen their relationship with Allah. This movie did get slightly boring at times but seeing how much emotion people feel when experiencing hajj and simply seeing the masses that attend was certainly incredible and gives perspective to those like myself who know very little about the Muslim faith."}, {"id": 79, "text": "The documentary film called Inside Mecca is a vivid example of the most valuable aspects of Islam such as the hajj. In the film, three main characters play a key role in demonstrating some concepts about Islam and Muslims. Three Muslims are from different places in the world, but all of them have a strong desire to make a pilgrimage to Mecca. The first character is professor of neuroscience, Fidelma O'Leary, the next character is Khalil Mandhlzai from South Africa, and the last character is a businessman Ismail Mahbob from Malaysia. In the film, the main characters help to understand what factors trigger to convert the person into Islam, what kind of today's social problems could be solved by practicing Islam, and to what extent the pilgrimage is important to Muslim society. The uniqueness of this documentary film is the effective combination of stories of characters in their life and the narrator's commentary on each new insight during the film.First, people from different nationalities do not feel any discrimination in Islam. The film shows the point where equality among all Muslims could be reached. The point is reached by keeping equality. For example, all Muslims in the hajj wear almost identical dresses which means that no one can be proud of their own expensive dresses. In the film, the narrator describes those people in the following way: the poor and rich, all wear the same dress. In addition, tents are present for people to take a rest and sleep after making a pilgrimage the whole day. From the film, it seems that all tents are the same which demonstrates the equality of all people in a holy place. However, VIP tents are specially organized for a group of people who want to pay extra money for comfort. This example points out the socioeconomic inequality among people exists anyway. In one of such tents, the character from South Africa, Khalil saw the racial discrimination toward his side because of color difference.Also, Fidelma from America faced a common problem in which the stereotype regarding this problem spread out. The stereotype is based on the place she is from and nationality. For instance, some people asked her Is she a Muslim?. As she was not from the country where the majority of the population is Muslim, people from the crowd interested. As other Muslims forgot that religion, Islam is for everyone. From two examples we see the discrimination in a form of the trial from God, in this case, both showed their patience and tolerance. A massive crowd causes the problem with the movement of people in performing some religious rituals. As I have noted before, three characters are from different nations and cultures. The film demonstrates successfully that what kind of feelings people receive during the hajj. Scenes where Busy markets, crying children, people of different ages, charities, and the great atmosphere within the Muslim community shown influence on the audience emotionally. During the pilgrimage, you can face people who are crying while making dua, reciting Q'uran, or asking for forgiveness for sins. The most important aspect of this documentary film is the explanation of some concepts and places by the narrator's speech. I found out that some materials from the lecture Abrahamic Origins which impressed me. For example, the narrator emphasized the stories of Abraham stating that he was the father of monotheism. According to Lecture Abrahamic Origins, Abraham was the father of monotheistic religions - Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Additionally, the lecturer narrated one story in which Abraham needed to sacrifice his own son by the will of God, however, God commands Jibreel angel did not make permission for this sacrifice. In the film, the story gained new insights such as the origin of the throwing three stones ritual.In conclusion, I strongly recommend watching this film for all Muslims and for people who are interested in Islam. In the film, the annual pilgrimage, hajj demonstrates the importance of this spiritual trip to Mecca in terms of spirituality. A hajj challenges Muslims not only with religious rituals, but a massive crowd, sleep discomfort, and discrimination. The Muslim's duty is more than to perform the pilgrimage, also strengthen his character of Muslims through patience and tolerance. On the other hand, three characters are from different places of the world that do not correlate with Arabs and it means that the film shows the feelings and problems of foreign visitors to Mecca. Even they faced problems, they showed how they will battle with problems by demonstrating the strength of Iman in Muslim people. At the end of the film, Ismail cried when he was making dua which might touch the heart of people watching this film. The film was descriptive and informative, however emotional moments and the narrator's explanations may influence the notions about Islam and pilgrimage."}, {"id": 80, "text": "The movie is plotted around the annual pilgrimage of Muslims to Mecca - the hajj. Millions of people come here to participate in a five-day event for salvation. The whole event is introduced from the perspectives of three people of different national, cultural, and economic backgrounds. The film highlights such aspects as equality, modesty of the hajj effectively thanks to the filming, choice of characters, direct words from the three characters, and the appeal to honesty. There is a strong emphasis on the equality throughout the film. The three main characters from the film were especially chosen from very diverse backgrounds to achieve demonstrate equality as well as possible. They are from different countries, and even continents - Malaysia, South Africa, and the USA; they are of different genders, being two men and one woman; they have different economic backgrounds, because it was mentioned that Malaysian man was comparingly rich. However, the only thing that unites them all was the spiritual background - faith in Islam. Although it was mentioned that there was a sense of inequality, as African and American characters mentioned being asked where they come, and the latter one directly saying that such questions can be upsetting, all three antagonists were happy to feel equal towards the end of the film and felt no discrimination. Also, there were the VIP buffets for the ones who can pay for it and the ones that can discriminate poorer people, this problem was immediately resolved by mentioning that all people have access to tents, but these extra services are for the ones who may wish to pay for it. Another aspect of the tradition that was strongly emphasized is modesty. The idea is that every pilgrim is the servant of God, and all of them should practice patience during the chaotic movement of a massive crowd. Also, it should be noticed that all the pilgrims have dressed almost identically. This is done so that people cannot dress differently, and hence, cannot be discriminated based on their physical appearances. When the movie shows men dressing white towels, the narrator directly mentioned that the rich and poor, the literate and illiterate, all wear the same. Although this part can be closely related to equality, it also shows modesty of people, since they can feel down to the Earth. Symbolically, dressing equally also gives opportunities to focus on faith, that it is the most important; or speaking by the words of the South African character, what matters is the heart. Effectiveness of emphasis on equality and modesty is achieved well thanks to the direct words from the characters, the choice of characters, demonstration of the culture, and appeal to honesty. First of all, the quotes of the three main characters speak for themselves - they explicitly show the feelings during the event. South African man said ...God gathered all the nations together. No discrimination. If you look left and right, you find women and men are standing up crying to God to show that all of us are one in front of God. Only one line of such words shows that the hajj promotes equality and modesty for all. Secondly, the three main characters were especially chosen from different social backgrounds. It is done to demonstrate the positive attitudes towards hajj and Islam in general, to the audience of the film by giving different cultural perspectives on the event. Thirdly, demonstration of the culture was achieved well due to the visual representations. The movie was filmed in such a way that the audience can feel as emphatic as possible. Crying men and women, older people and children, and hustling crowds convey the friendly, spiritual, yet busy atmosphere of the event. In addition, the transition from calmness of the places where the three main characters were in the beginning, to the business of the people at Mecca that was shown throughout the film highlights the idea that the journey is challenging, but all the pilgrims stay calm; in such a demonstrative way, the film was able to demonstrate the modesty of pilgrims at the hajj. Having such successful scenes, the movie is able to effectively emphasize the positive moral sides of hajj. Finally, the appeal to honesty is one of the reasons that helped to reach effectiveness of the movie in showing the positive sides of hajj. It can be seen that the creators of the movie tried to avoid bias and showed some aspects of discrimination such as the VIP rooms, offensive questions that South African and the US characters were asked etc. However, towards the end of the film, all characters were happy, full of love, and felt no discrimination; the question of VIP buffet was solved immediately by the interview of its manager when he replied that the extra services should be provided if the pilgrims can pay for it. Although the creators of the movie could avoid including the indicators of honesty, the fact that it was done so, and that the three main characters were happy in the end is one of the main factors that makes this movie effective in describing hajj with a positive attitude. Concluding these four reasons, it can be said that the movie by itself was strongly effective in showing the annual event as promoting equality and modesty. Although the movie was not persuasive, but more descriptive, it showed the annual event of hajj from the positive attitude avoiding bias, and included many details of the event. It effectively used the four abovementioned techniques to describe the event as well as possible. Such a description of the event may draw much more positive and emphatic attitude not only towards the event, but also towards Islam in general."}, {"id": 81, "text": "The film describes the main concepts of the Islam religion. The video achieves this goal by showing the Hajj (Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca) from the inside and taking as main characters of the plot three different people from various parts of the world with their own nation, wellbeing, skin color, race. The plot of the film describes the concepts of Islam like monotheism; the importance of taking care of the less fortunate people than you; the existence of evil and good; equality of everyone before Allah. Firstly, the core concept of Islam, monotheism, is explained in the movie. It is explicitly shown that people do not worship Kabba, they worship what it represents - one God. All rituals of Hajj such as Tarwiyah day, the path to Mecca and Mina, Arafat, Feast of Sacrifice, haircutting, and Tawaf are mainly purposed to worship only one creature along the journey. However, according to lecture materials, Five Pillars of Islam states there is no God but Allah. Thus, we can understand the first main concept in Islam, that Muslims have only one Allah and no other divines. Secondly, in Islam, there is not any priority, and all are equal before Allah. In the film, the equality of people was significantly highlighted by showing three different Muslim pilgrims from different countries and who have no similarity except the faith. According to the film, no matter who you are: woman, man or child; what is your nation; what is your skin color, no matter, there are Islamic brotherhood and sisterhood, which brings all Muslims together. Thus, by delving into the daily life of each character, the viewer can see how they are different in terms of well-being, profession, lifestyle and etc., however, when we see them with other millions of people in Mecca, who pray without any distinction (in two pieces of the towel), the viewer can grasp that in Islam all people are equal in front of Allah. On the other hand, there were some critics, which was mentioned in the video, about racism and discrimination. For example, Khalil from South Africa was disappointed when he was not treated well with other South Africans because of his skin color. Also, we can see some class discrimination in Mine's tent city where they rely on the rule that there is not any prohibition on comfort as long as pilgrim may pay for it. These incidents provide information about some de facto exceptions of rules in certain real-life situations and it was clearly shown in the film. Moreover, the movie emphasizes the next concept of Islam implicitly, which is the Sharia, the unique set of rules. According to lectures, the Quran is not taken from third-party narration about prophet Muhammad, instead, the Quran and Sharia are direct instructions of Allah to people. Therefore, in the video, all rituals of Hajj were shown explicitly, sequentially, and in details, because it was said that pilgrims actually have to be within the clearly marked boundaries of Arafat or their Hajj may not be counted. Hence, we can understand that in Islam, rituals must be followed strictly, because there exist Allah's direct will and directions as a set of rules (Sharia). Furthermore, the film highlights the concept of good and evil. It was clearly discussed in the part about jamarat, where believers did stone Satan. It could give a clear understanding that for Muslims there exists the concept of good and evil; justice and injustice; righteousness and sinfulness. By the jamarat ritual pilgrims seek forgiveness and reject evil. The concept of good and evil can be considered as one of the cores in Islam because everyone must distinguish them without any gained knowledge: avoid the action, which brings suffering for others and approach to good. As a next point, the helping of poor and less successful people than you is described in the feast of sacrifice part of the film. The plot of the film revealed that with the largest ritual sacrifice, pilgrims help poor people all over the world by supplying them with food, because each pilgrim must sacrifice one sheep, or seven pilgrims must give one camel at the end of the Hajj. It can be clear that the film plot is bounded with the topic of Hajj and Kaaba, thus the plot does not describe the concept of help fully, for example: by showing the ritual of Sadaqah or by showing the content of Surah, where Allah says about his/her/it love to gentleness and love. To sum up, the film could clearly highlight the main aspects of Islam such as monotheism or worshipping one God, social equality, the concept of good and evil, and supporting vulnerable parts of the society by showing the main rituals of Hajj and experiences of main heroes. Also, the film could convey all core concepts of Islam in giving a framework of Hajj."}, {"id": 82, "text": "Islam is one of the most rapidly growing religions in the modern world. Of course, there is Christianity, which has the largest number of followers; there is Confucianism, where the religion successfully transformed into the lifestyle. However, Islam, undoubtedly, deserves the right to be taught and demonstrated since so many people turn to Islam every single day. Today, in the era of digital technology, people can not only follow the religion but, also, with the help of media, play an important role in the expansion of religions. One of the examples of media informing people about Islam, more specifically, about the pilgrimage to Mecca, is a documentary Inside Mecca, directed by Anisa Mehdi. By the time, a person finishes watching Inside Mecca, he or she learns the experience from the trip to Capital in Islamic traditions. Throughout the movie, we see how pilgrimage to Mecca becomes an important, life-changing lesson in Muslim's life on the example of three different people. It demonstrates that worshippers of Islam are submitted to one God, value equality with tolerance, and strive for patience. This essay would expand on these three aspects, but it is worth to mention that there are other observations a spectator of Inside Mecca could have highlighted. One of the obvious characteristics of Islam we may learn from the movie: God in Islam is the absolute one, strictly singular. In fact, it is like Christianity and Judaism, where people believe in one God, as well, God of Abraham. Historically, some Christians and Jews converted to Islam, when the prophet Muhammad established the new religion (How Islam Began, Fred Donner). Anyway, the movie clearly highlights the fact that Muslims are submitted to one God, but it does not explain the roots of such a belief. Thus, to explain, Adam was created by God to establish 'a vicegerent on earth', which means creating the social moral order (Rahman, p.17-18). Muslim believe in the story of Adam and Eve, which is well known among Christians and Jews, yet the main contribution of Islam regarding that story is that Adam's religion was monotheistic: there is only one God. In the movie, we see that pilgrimage to Mecca includes a ritual when Muslims circle the Kaaba 7 times. Here, Kaaba is a representation of one God, since it is 'House of God' and Muslims worship not the Kaaba, but the idea behind it. Another ritual from the movie that highlights the all-powerful ruler and creator of the universe is The standing at Arafat. Pilgrims pray and ask for forgiveness at the place, where Prophet Mohammed delivered his last sermon. This realm of forgiveness is shown as an extremely emotional experience, where people connect with God. I believe that the physical meaning of the place plays an important psychological role. Since the God does not have human-like nature or representation, it is impossible to convey the connection with God to a specific place, except Kaaba. However, Muslims worship Prophet Mohammad because he attracted people's trust (Authority in Islam), thus stepping on the ground where Prophet once walked is a solid experience, which allows Muslims to physically connect with the God, thus boosting the mind connection. Apart from the demonstrating total submission to one God, Muslims, who come to Mecca in the Hajj period, challenge their tolerance. In Islam, God's mercy comprehends everything, one implication of which is tolerance towards every other religion. When Leo Byzantine Emperor, for instance, commanded to destroy all icons repeating after Islamic traditions, ironically, Muslims protected defender of iconography, demonstrating the teachings of tolerance of other faith (Eastern Orthodoxy). Apart from tolerance between religions, Muslims should be tolerant within themselves. One of the main characters in Inside Mecca is a female neurosurgeon from US, another one is an African-American man from South Africa named Khalil. While watching the documentary, the idea of diversity among Islam worshippers is shown. There are women and men, elderlies and children; as in The Life of Muhammad': a man ... stood up and prayed. Then a woman ... stood up and prayed. Then out came a youth ... stood up and prayed (p. 113). It is important to mention that women can enter Mecca only if provide the legal permission from male member of the family. Despite that, women are equal during the Hajj; in fact, women played an important role in collecting Hadith, which is the source of law in Islam (Formation of Islamic Law and Hadith). There are, also, rich, and poor, yellow, black, and white skinned people but everyone is equal in the face of God because He looks at the heart only. God can ensure the essential unity of the human race as His creation, meaning that everyone is equal (Rahman, p. 38). During Hajj, 2 million different people from different countries gather to share the experience, which requires philosophic tolerance. However, fair attitude towards everyone is not as difficult as inside struggles of pilgrims during the Hajj. The journey, shown in the documentary, tests both body and soul of pilgrims. The ritual that physically represents the mind struggle Muslims experience is 'The Stoning of the Devil'. In The Formation of Islam, Berkey defined jihad as the 'holy war', which means struggle against evil. In Islam, jihad refers to any striving in the path of God and stoning the devil represent how people fight temptations and expel Satan from their lives. While the ritual is great in helping pilgrims to physically fight the evil, the whole journey tests their patience. In Q 48 'Victory' of Qur'an, a win of good over evil is said to be attained through courage, devotion, faith, and patience (McAuliffe, p. 168). Muslims struggle between wrong and right but with the help of God they stay on the 'middle way', the right path. Thus, failing to demonstrate respect, patience, and courtesy, will make the Hajj not count for a pilgrim, since they are highly valued abilities in Islam. All in all, the documentary 'Inside Mecca excellently showed the process of pilgrimage to Mecca by highlighting the important aspects of Islam. It should be suggested to both believers of other religions, atheists, and Muslims. Apart from worshipping one God, tolerance, and patience, we learn that Islam do not value material wealth, instead values necessities, such as water. Of course, spectators of the movie make their own conclusions and focus on different things but, overall, the documentary transfers the basic spirit of Islam."}, {"id": 83, "text": "Inside Mecca is a National Geographic documentary film directed by Anisa Mehdi in 2003, which is about three pilgrims travelled to Mecca for the Hajj. Mecca is a legendary city, it is located in the western mountains of Saudi Arabia. Only Muslims are allowed to come here to the city and pray in the large mosque called Al-Masjid Al-Haram in center of which the famous Kaaba is located. The sacred pilgrimage known as the Hajj in Mecca unites millions of people all around the world because it is a mandatory duty for Muslims. The documentary provides detailed vision about the pilgrimage today. The feelings and thoughts of participants are supported by a narrator who comments them and gives historical information about the importance of the Hajj in Islam. The film does not have any special effects but it has a background music and the busy atmosphere of the actions and the sounds of loud prayer make the viewer to be more and more emotional. The pilgrimage is a chance for people to pray for Allah to be forgiven and they thrive to do their best during the Hajj by behaving properly as well as by having only rightful thoughts. Even though the pilgrimage can be perceived as an ideal world in action, pilgrims experience challenges during the Hajj. The film shows the storyline of three pilgrims: Dr. Dilma O'Leary from the United States, Khalil from the South Africa and Ismail with his wife Asma from Malaysia. Each of them have different backgrounds but religious duty to perform the Hajj and the motivation to be closer to the God unite them. It is interesting to note that they do not play roles but share with their true experience. This is what makes the viewers to be excited and to feel themselves as a part of the action. They prepare for the Hajj by expanding the Koranic knowledge, reading and understanding prayers as well as praying as it is required in the Islamic law. Before they start pilgrimage, individuals have to enter in the state of Ihram. Ihram is the important inner sacred state of person when people perform pilgrimage. During Ihram, they have to be very patient, prevent any negative emotions as anger as well as any physical intercourse. The philosophy of Ihram is that the identical white clothes represent sameness in performing the Hajj despite a person being wealthy or poor, educated or not, or any other factors. After the attainment of the state of Ihram, people move to the symbolic center of their faith-the Kaaba and walk seven times around it as the Prophet Muhammad did. The Kaaba is a stone building with golden doors that was traditionally built by Adam and rebuilt by Abraham after the Great flood. It is interesting how the director always makes links between the historical background of Islam and current actions during the pilgrimage. This shows that people try to perform in the same way as the prophets which were the guides of ideal human behavior in order to enjoy the bliss of heaven. In addition to the pilgrimage, some pilgrims thrive to live the Islamic ideal as Khalil by doing donations for people in need. People do it because it is said in the Quran that whatever wealth you spend on welfare-supporting sincerely the cause of God-it is multiplied several-fold (Rahman 2009, p.27). The donations as zakat and sadakha expected to strengthen a muslim's religious faith, especially during the Hajj where a person can gain greater amount of barakat. However, the Hajj is not an ideal place as it can be expected because there are cases when pilgrims face challenges which make it difficult to stay in the state of Ihram. For example, during the first day of the Hajj in the valley Mina, Khalil was not able to stay with South African pilgrims because he was discriminated due to his skin color. He said that it was very painful to see this condition during the Hajj (34min06sec). As Khalil, Dr. Dilma also had awkward experience when local women questioned her religious belief because some male pilgrims were paying attention to her, probably because of her light skin color and unusual beauty. On the other hand, Ismail had quite a different story that he was living in better conditions with additional services because he was able to financially afford it. Despite the idea that during the pilgrimage people are treated equally before the God, these situations show that it is not the case in the real world. The minor challenges are that some pilgrims had to walk under the heat of the Sun and the crowd of people led to wildness, chaos and emotional state of mind. It can be seen from the scene in the Mount of Arafat which is a place of mercy where Adam and Hawa reunited and the Prophet Muhammad delivered the last sermon. This is the place where millions of people do the standing at Arafat to pray and cry pleading for relief from inner burdens. It is a very emotional scene, they do pray with hope to be forgiven because it is said in several verses of the Quran that God will pardon or overlook men's lapses, provided the overall performance is good and beneficial (Rahman 2009, p 19). It reveals that pilgrims face both mental and physical difficulties during the Hajj. The given analysis of the film shows how difficult it to perform pilgrimage but pilgrims do it for Allah, because it is said in the Islamic law as a duty of each Muslim. The faces of pilgrims after the completion of Hajj show happiness, desire to begin a new life and become a better version of themselves which means that the director shows both the negative and positive emotions of pilgrims that makes him unbiased. The film reveals the power of Islamic law and how Muslims adhere to it, and hope to attain redemption from God as it is promised in Quran by doing good deeds.References:Rahman, F. (2009). Major Themes in Quran. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.p.12-44."}, {"id": 84, "text": "Inside Mecca is a documentary film by National Georaphic. The creators of the movie showed the rules of the Hajj, traditions, emotions of pilgrims and difficulties that they might have. All of this were shown by the help of following three Muslims from different parts of the world, who wanted to visit Mecca and perform Hajj. Mecca is the holy city in Saudi Arabia, where the Prophet Muhammad was born and the Islam religion arose. At the heart of the city, there is the Al-Haram mosque and at its center the Kaaba is located. It is the cube-shaped building, also called House of God. According to one Muslim tradition, The Kaaba was built by Adam based on a plan handed from God and rebuilt by Abraham after the great flood. The Kaaba represents that the God is one and this what Muslims worship. Every year more than 2 million Muslims visit Mecca in order to perform Hajj. Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which should be done by every adult Muslim, who is physically and financially capable for the journey at least once in their lifetime. It is performed during a week from 8th to 13th days of last month in Islamic calendar. The first step of the Hajj is visiting the valley of Mina, which has a tents for pilgrims. Next one is walking for eight miles to the plain of Arafat, where Muslims should stay until sunset. Pilgrims should pray and ask Allah to forgive their sins. In Muslim history, Arafat mount is the place where Adam and Eve found each other after falling from the Heaven. Then, people should arrive to the Mina for stoning of Satan ritual. Each of them in total should throw at least 49 stones to special walls. Another important rite of the Hajj is to sacrifice sheep in the name of God and then meat is sent as charity for poor people. After that Muslims need to shave head or trim hair. At the end of the Hajj, people round the Kaaba seven times. Also, Muslims can kiss and touch it. The movie did a great job with explaining all traditions and religious rituals by history and theory. Furthermore, it was a good idea to show various perspectives and views on pilgrimage of different people. Producers accomplish this problem with following woman and two men with different wealth. The God said that all humans are equal (49:13). However, even in Mecca during Hajj, pilgrims might feel discrimination as our movie characters had. Fidelma is an American Muslim, which had an a lot of eyes on her and gawking. Some people asked her if she is really a Muslim. Furthermore, South African pilgrim Khalil thought that he was discriminated because he is black. Workers and staff that work during Hajj in Mecca said that all people are equal, however there is no prohibition on comfort if they can pay for it. That is why, pilgrim can be divided into VIP, deluxe and premium. Thus, on the long way to Arafat, Khalil rests on the ground, while more affluent Ismail from Malaysia is in the tent with mattresses and tea. Nevertheless, it also works as mental challenge for them and they must keep calm and be patient. Because they might be eliminated from pilgrimage. It should be mentioned that non-Muslims cannot visit Mecca and even for Muslims there are a lot of rules and prohibitions. Thus, it is not easy to go to Mecca. Therefore, I believe it was very difficult to create this film. Moreover, I think that producers had some difficulties with logistics. Inasmuch as there were three main characters from USA, Malaysia and South Africa, and the film crew followed them from motherlands to Mecca. Therefore, it shows that producers solved all problems and did the movie well. By the film, we can see that the infrastructure of the Mecca is developing. Now people have better conditions for pilgrimage. For example, administration of the city tries to solve problems with logistic and every time make it more easier to transport. To sum up, Inside Mecca movie was very informative for me as non-Muslim and for other people, who cannot visit Mecca but interested about it. Actually, it is sad to know that you cannot visit some place in the world, which has very long, rich and vivid history. However, such documentary films really helps to learn and see the holy buildings and rituals. It can be seen, how the Hajj is important for Muslims. It makes them more motivated and satisfied. They feel themselves lighter and happier, inasmuch as people believe that Allah will forgive them their sins after the pilgrimage."}, {"id": 85, "text": "The movie narrates why Mecca is the holiest city for more than one billion people all around the world who consider themselves as Muslims. Every year around two million people take a visit to Mecca in order to accomplish their spiritual duty before Allah, who indicated this trip to the Mecca as one of the five pillars of Islam. Generally, in Mecca people asks remission for their sins and try to renovate their moral principles according to religion. Interestingly, this journey once a life considers as compulsory for every Muslim who financially and physically afford it. Indeed, the massiveness of believers in annual pilgrimage astonishes world community, yet, for followers of other religions the doors of the Mecca is closed, despite the fact that historically it inhabited by different followers of pagans, Judaism and Christianity. Therefore, the movie by National Geographic, shows to us what in common have three different people who substantially differs from one another by their socio-economic status and background. All of them are about to fulfill a responsible moment of their life, it's a pilgrimage to sacred place in Islamic world known as the hajj. National Geographic team follows after the three Muslims on their way to and in pilgrimage to Mecca. Most interestingly, the film producers are not just following the three Muslims in their trip rather they try to show us the spiritual and deep moral stages of experiencing mixed feelings and internal excitements during the trip to sacred place. For each person presented in documentary making hajj is began from fastidious preparations at home and continued with some challenges on their way to pilgrimage. For Fidelma O'Leary, professor assistant at neuropsychology faculty at University of Austin, Texas, making hajj is considered as life changing experience since she is innate born Irish with Catholic backgrounds. She converted to Islam during when she was student, as states it was her rational choice. One of the obstacles during the trip was that many fellow pilgrims expressed some hesitation to accept her as their sister friend. From my perspective, this fact is closely linked with the fact of stereotypic viewpoint of people that for western people converting to Islam is to some extent nonsense for them. The case of Ismail Mahbub, Malaysian businessman, narrates to us how it's difficult to leave your family and your comfort zone which you are accustomed in return for spiritual renewal. While, the case Khalil Mandhlazi, South African radio representative, narrates to us how it's difficult to face with same problem which you face at your home country. In the Khalil's case, it was racism which shown by his fellow pilgrims during his hajj. Despite this racial discrimination Khalil represented the case where he showed that goal of making hajj is to be one step closer with Allah, not letting themselves to be angry and irritant for certain problem. In parallel the current documentary movie introduces us with story of formation of Mecca as holy city for Muslims. As it had been shown in the movie, behind the scenes there are enormous effort that need to be accomplished by both pilgrims and hosting authorities. For examples, Saudi Arabian government are responsible for all administrative work, and responsible for peace and safe location of pilgrims by managing their accommodation, nutrition, etc. While, pilgrims initially need to overcome administrative barriers and then during hajj they need overcome exhausting conditions like crowding, hot temperature, etc. Truly, the culmination of every hajj is visit by pilgrim the mosque called the al-Masjid al-Haram in which at the centre locates Kaaba, where black stone tethered. According to Islamic tradition this back stone was delivered from heaven, but, as the consequence of touching the stone by millions of people stone turned black due to the people's sins. Another, Muslim tradition states that Allah commanded Prophet Abraham to build a special construction which will be place of worship, which as we call it today Kaaba. Many centuries ago, Kaaba was center of pagan worship, but Prophet Muhamad, founder of Islam, eradicated the activities of polytheists in Mecca and enlightened people to worship only to single God, which form Arabic means Allah. Today as we witness these rituals and rites of pilgrimages were evolved from Abraham to Muhammad, and today, all Muslims are following after their rites which they established the principles of pilgrimage thousands year ago. Basically, hajj consists from travel to valley of Mina, going to plain of Arafat, returning to Jumrah where pilgrims perform stoning of the devil and finally circling the Kaaba by walk for seven times. Another interesting characteristic of Mecca is that non-Muslims are not allowed to make pilgrimage. One conflicting moment in the movie is that filmmakers delivered to us little bit wrong information by claiming that non-Muslims are prohibited to enter the city, in real sense they are just restricted to make hajj. To conclude, Mecca is the holy city for all Muslims, obliged to be accomplished once in a lifetime, since it decreed by Allah. Three characters on the image showed us stages of hajj, and their motive in embarking to hajj."}, {"id": 86, "text": "Inside Mecca, directed by Anisa Mehdi, is a very interesting documentary about 3 people taking a pilgrimage to Mecca, one of the 5 pillars of Islam called the Hajj. The documentary is well presented and easy to follow. It clearly explains all the aspects of the Hajj. The movie depicts how difficult it is to set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca as there is a lot of planning for the people going on the pilgrimage . The Hajj is something that Muslim people prepare for all year. The documentary covered three people's journeys, Ismail Mahbob: a Malaysian Muslim, Khalil Mandhlazi: an African Muslim and Fidelma O'Leary: an American convert to Islam. O'Leary was originally Catholic but she believed that Catholicism did not reflect all her beliefs so she converted and is now a practicing Muslim. The documentary shows both the positive and negative sides of the Hajj which makes it more interesting because it is not biased. The movie also shows the different views of the three people during the Hajj and the experiences they each go through. Anisa Mehdi did well to include three very different types of people in the documentary as it shows the different views of each person, from different backgrounds and originating from different places in the world and how each one of them is affected from their experience differently. I would highly recommend this documentary to anyone who likes to learn about culture and is open to new ideas. The documentary will make a whole new view on Muslim culture."}, {"id": 87, "text": "Inside Mecca directed by Anisa Mehdi follows three Muslims on their Hajj. The Hajj is a annual pilgrimage to Mecca and is one of the duties that a Muslim must carry out at least once in their lifetime. But what separates this movie from others on the religion of Islam is that the three Muslims comes from different countries and cultural backgrounds. The three Muslims that will be documented throughout the movie are Fidelma O'Leary (as herself) a American convert from Catholicism to Islam, Khalil Mandhlazi (as himself) a South African Muslim, and Ismail Mahbob (as himself) a Malaysian Muslim. When the three set off on their Hajj, each person has their own image and opinions of what will happen even though they are all reaching towards the same goal. However, not everything occurs without problem. All three pilgrims face different types of discrimination and internal suffering at different events throughout their pilgrimage. The movie perfectly shows each pilgrim's emotions and feelings without having any biased ideas or intentions. It shows the positive and negative sides of the Hajj. Thus, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a better insight on the religion of Islam, specifically about the Hajj. Personally, this movie was a big eye opener which cleared lots of my misconceptions and questions on Hajj."}, {"id": 88, "text": "It's one thing to promise, at some distant point in one's life, to make a long and arduous journey through the desert to a holy city. It's quite another thing to actually do it. In the National Geographic documentary Inside Mecca, the camera follows three Muslims from three very different countries: a professor of neuroscience from Texas, a radio host from South Africa, and a corporate executive from Malaysia, on their pilgrimage to the most sacred site in Islam. Throughout their journey, they experienced numerous tests to their faith, as well as saw the true scale of Islam as a religion. The documentary also provides the viewer with the details of the Hajj, and tells the story of how it came to be and the difficulty in organizing it today. For me, this documentary was a whole new look at a religious tradition I was only vaguely aware of. I knew that Muslims had to visit Mecca at least once in their lives, and I knew that had something to do with standing around this big black box, but I never knew what any of it meant or what else was required. The documentary provided lots of helpful back-story, so I learned all about the Hajj and the religious history behind it. Normally in these types of documentaries, the religious story is told through reenactments - some aspiring B-list actor in nativity clothes tries to act like Abraham while the narrator talks. But I liked that in Inside Mecca, they told the stories through just voice and landscape shots. It kept the documentary from feeling forced or artificial. Really, its primary focus wasn't the history of the Hajj. The documentary was about the Hajj today, and how an ancient pilgrimage exists in a 21st century world. In this the documentary excelled, as following three specific characters helped give me a sense of what it would be like to actually journey to Mecca. They describe a lot of the modern inconveniences of travel - the bureaucracy of getting a visa, long bus rides, crowds, and getting strange looks in a foreign country. I particularly empathized with the woman from Texas, who was white and so got a lot of flak about being a real Muslim. I could understand her frustration, as I feel the same every time I go to Korea and get treated like a tourist. I also enjoyed learning about the organizational leviathan that is running the city of Mecca. Iyad Masani, the Minister of Hajj, said If you can imagine having 20 Super Bowls, in one stadium, where two million people will come\u0085 and if you add to that that these two million people will actually be taking part in playing the game, it may give you a glimpse of the preparations needed for Hajj. Especially when they showed the tent city at Mina, or the hordes of people walking towards Arafat, I really got a sense of how big an event this was. If there's one thing this documentary accomplished, it was showing me what going to Mecca would actually be like. Mundane scenes, like one of the people packing their luggage or trying to put on their ihram taught me more about the Hajj than many of the facts. I didn't just learn about the traditions behind the Hajj, I learned about what it meant for Muslims today. Even as an atheist, I quite enjoyed Inside Mecca, as they were impressively non-biased throughout the documentary. I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about the Hajj, or anyone who just wants an interesting look into Islam today."}, {"id": 89, "text": "Hajj, the ideal journey that every Muslim hopes to make to Mecca. The pilgrimage occurs from the 8th to 12th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th and last month of the Islamic Calendar. This journey is not only physically, but also mentally demanding. Each action reflecting something symbolic to the Muslim faith. Such as: circling the KA'ABA seven times, attending the Plain of Arafat, or throwing stones at the three pillars, etc... All of them have significant meaning to them. It is a life changing experience, it is said that you are a different person after Hajj. It gives you the experience of Ihram, a patient state of mind. It allows you to feel in the presence of God and Muhammad. But in order for the Saudi government to pull this off they must be the model of efficiency, the King of Saudi even said that it is like having five supper bowls simultaneously. It is estimated that 2 million people attend each year during Dhu al-Hijjah. But in the year of the movie filmed it was estimated to be at 3.5 million people embarking on Hajj. The overall concept and in depth personal experiences of non-traditional Muslims was quite entertaining. None of them being your stereotypical Muslim, yet you could feel a sense of pride in their religion. Each of the story lines providing different situations of Hajj. It was definitely a detailed incite of the Journey of Hajj in Mecca and worth watching."}], "reviews_amount": 90}
