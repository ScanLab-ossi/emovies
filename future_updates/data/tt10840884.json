Action part is okay I would say. One time watchable film."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Watched Taish today and it was a good thriller. Bejoy nambiar as always bought something fresh and it's an entertaining flick for this weekend. The backbone of this movie is the performances given by each and every actor, specially Harshvardhan Rane, the soul of the movie. He gave a brilliant performance as a Punjabi guy and his accent was truly superb. The music of the movie is another plus point coz it's not your daily remakes type of songs, the lyrics and music are wonderful. The movie is some places falls down but it takes paces later. The only minus point of this movie I didn't liked is the final battle between two friends and Pali. Bejoy could have choreographed a good action sequence coz both Pali and Sunny deserved a brutal hand to hand combat. 7.1/10 from my side."}, {"id": 11, "text": "A typical Bejoy Nambiar film it is.

Loved it"}, {"id": 19, "text": "The direction by Bejoy Nambiar is absolutely Brilliant &amp; beyond Fantastic. There is a reason why he'll always remain amongst my favorite. Bollywood directors of all time."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I watched 'Taish' in the movie format. It starts off with two parallel stories - one about a family of gangsters, difference between two brothers (Harshavardhan and Abhimanyu Singh) and a girl (Sanjida Shaikh) who is the bone of contention. Second story is about a sweet couple (Jim Sarbh and Kriti Kharbanda). And what happens when they go for Jim's brother's wedding. Eventually, how these two stories cross paths.What starts off as a slow drama, gradually turns into a revenge thriller. And culminates into a dramatic climax. It's almost 3 hrs in runtime. And feels lethargic in parts. Probably you may find it more bearable if watched in episodic format.What works - The story is good. Performances, especially, by Jim Sarbh, Pulkit Samrat, Harshavardhan, Sanjida and Kriti are great. To me, Jim's performance really stood out. His character goes through various emotions over the course of the story and he effectively conveys them. The action/thrilling sequences are very well shot and will leave you glued to the screen. Watch out for Pulkit's confrontation with Abhimanyu Singh. Or the climax chase/action sequence. The story does surprise you at different junctures and the twists/turns don't seem forced at all.Negatives - The pace is really uneven. It picks up slow. Is interesting in the middle. Again pace drops until pre-climax/climax. At places, story doesn't move at all. Jim's dad's character and his attitude towards Kriti(her being a Pakistani Muslim) feels forced into the story and sticks out like a sore thumb. It was totally unnecessary and story could have done without it. It just makes me wonder, can't they make one movie/series without political references. Abhimanyu Singh is wasted. He shines in scenes he's in but overall wasted. The dialogues are mostly heavy on Punjabi. Making majority audience try to go back and forth to understand dialogs.Overall watchable. But you won't miss anything if you don't see it"}, {"id": 21, "text": "Nice acting from all the artists but you have to believe harswardhan rane is upcoming big star of the industry...what a film loved it\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18"}, {"id": 22, "text": "Pulkit was so good in the film Taish but Jim Sarbh has his own capabilities.

The story is new and perfect for Taish."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Punjabi movie with Hindi as a secondary language. It's not a typical movie where there are twists and thrills and then there's a grand climax, this is a jumbled up messy disaster with bits and pieces of good moments. There are sparks of good acting by Jim Sarbh, Harsh and other cast but not one is worth to remember for a long time, the script itself is SO lose that every single scene and actors performance fizzles off just before it takes off. Sets and actors clothing were great! Average cinematography. Poor editing. Weak, loosely written script. Lazy dialogues. There's NO thriller, NO mystery, and definitely NO climax. It's more of a family drama around few deaths more than anything else. Overall, average. You may skip this one."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Actually the series is in Punjabi language not in Hindi. If you are not good in punjabi then you must have to watch it with english subtitles. Story is same, nothing new, rivalry of two families, one is gangster.Starcast is good, except Jim Sarbh.

He can't act I don't why he is so highly rated. The surprise package were Harshvardhan Rane, Pulkit Samrat and Saloni Batra. They should get more chances in Bollywood. Negatives: The story isn't something which is unique, it is something that you have watched hundreds of times in Bollywood and Hollywood. No huge twists and turns to make the events more interesting. Very very predictable. Good for a one time watch. Don't expect anything extraordinary from it."}, {"id": 56, "text": "This is the first time that I am writing a review of a movie here but I think it was worth it. Taish is fiery and well-brewed.

Based on some high praise across newspapers and media for this web series I tried to watch it. Its such a dull drama that when we slept while watching it we did not know! I don't recommend this useless boring drama. It will waste your time. The director must learn the art of web series making from some of the shows I listed above. Mirzapur, FamilyMan, PaatalLok, Panchayat and Asur have already set the standard too high which even film industry is finding difficult to match. In that high quality scenario, you can't fool public here with nonesense. This show clearly exhibited its naivety towards public mood and interest. Add to that dull acting and screenplay, and punjabi dialogues.

The story is good with outstanding direction by Bejoy Nambiar after Wazir. The screenplay is slow which makes some parts boring. Good performances though especially Harshvardhan Rane. Some songs didn't belong and the film could have been good without them. Action scenes were very good and well executed. The voice modulation was bad though and since a lot of the scenes were in Punjabi some people might not understand it.Lastly, a good choice to release it as both a film and a web series. Definitely a must watch."}, {"id": 515, "text": "Seemed good from trailer. But is total trash and waste of time. Boring Story, Cold Action, Lazy Romance, Bad Direction.

Kudos to the actors, director and producer."}, {"id": 555, "text": "With unique editing And insanely creative cinematography, every single frame looks perfect and glues your eyes to the screen. All the actors have given their career best performance, yes I'm not exaggerating, all of them have given their best acting performance yet. It's very violent At times and doesn't shy away from showing the graphic scenes which is very welcoming. The story maybe a familiar one but the script is the winner here. The narration is very engaging and the dialogues and scenes Are written so so well. Despite being a revenge thriller, this Movie/series feels Very fresh and unique in its style and content.I highly recommend this, please watch this, you will finish all the episodes at once And I guarantee that. It will keep you engaged And thrilled every single second of it and you will be invested in the characters."}, {"id": 556, "text": "The plot of Taish had great potential and looked promising. Even the cast is terrific at least for the main characters.However, it's the uncooked screenplay, poor writing and immature character development which ruined the entire experience.Most of the supporting characters are not properly introduced. In fact, I could not even figure out how some of the to characters were even related to the main characters. They'd just appear and disappear out of the blue with the expectation that the viewer would just accept them.Characters were poorly built. I could not reconcile or justify the actions behind some of the characters. Also everything would be so convenient for them. Half of the situations make no sense at a.A criminal was being transported in an Ambulance without any police car following it? Really? How dumb is the London police?The writing was an even bigger loser here. This movie could have been so much more, but poor writing just decimated everything this movie had to offer. One particular subplot was entirely unnecessary for the movie. I'm still struggling to understand how could the movie have been different if this subplot never existed. I'm talking about Pali-Kulli-Jahaan. I thought it would lead to something, but unfortunately not.Also the climax made no sense at all. Everyone at the end was all over the place. Almost looked like some kind of trial and error. Every subsequent scene was in contradiction to what the characters would do in the prior scene. Like I said, maybe things would've made sense if writing and character development had been better. But without such elements, I really couldn't understand what was happening and why was it happening.Undercooked, Underdeveloped and Uninspiring. This could have been soooo much more."}, {"id": 557, "text": "Taish is a slick intense drama thriller which has revenge written all over it. The title suggests a fit of rage and atleast two of the principal characters here are driven by it. This is the first time a feature film has also been introduced as a mini series consisting of six episodes. I watched the mini series as it seemed like a more detailed version.The series revolves around two families in London. While one is engaged in a grand wedding ceremony the other is grappling with an ongoing feud between two sulking brothers. A shocking disclosure about a haunting past leads to an uncontrollable situation involving both the families. What follows is a series of chaotic events. The story keeps moving back and forth in time rapidly only to slow down during the middle portions but gathers steam again towards the later part.The three main characters of Harshvardhan Rane, Jim Sarbh &amp; Pulkit Samrat get equal opportunity to shine and they all deliver excellent performances. Rane particularly steals the show with an intense brooding performance. Sarbh is not far behind and it was good to see Samrat in an intense action avatar. Amongst the female characters Kriti Kharbanda &amp; Sanjeeda Sheikh stand out. Kriti looks beautiful and does well in a meaty part. Sheikh lets her eyes do all the talking. Rest of the supporting actors are good. The whole cast looks great on screen.The series has been stylishly shot with a terrific background score. The soundtrack is lovely with songs intelligently placed along with the story. Bejoy Nambiar doesnt disappoint both as a writer and director. He shows his class as a story teller with a technical finesse. This fast paced revenge saga has a lot of factors going for it and should be on your watch list this weekend. Streaming now on Zee5."}, {"id": 558, "text": "Taish is primarily a story of two very angry characters, played by Pulkit Samrat and Harshvardhan Rane. The story of this series is scattered in six episodes of about half-an-hour, due to the fact that both these characters are in the air and the result of their collision.It is being called 'film and series' on the film's promotional material. Some things remain unclear in Taish's story. Many reasons have also not been revealed.Some such points do not digest and weaken the swim. Anjali Nair, Karthik R Iyer, and Nicola Luis Taylor have done extensive experiments with screenplays with Bejoy Nambiar.He repeatedly took scenes in the past to explain the reason for what is happening in the present. Such experiments are often seen in web series to create suspense and thrills, but in the case of Taish, the use of the series is slightly affected.The viewer will have to sit with little attention to connect the strings of the story. Harshvir Oberoi's cinematography also gives the film a height.The outdoor locations are filmed extremely beautifully. At the same time, Priyank brings tension in Prem Kumar's editing series.The 6 episode 'ZEE5 Taish Movie' tells a story of about 3 hours, which does not give viewers a chance to get bored.The strong side of the series is its casting. Jim Sarbh, Pulkit Samrat, Harshvardhan Rane, and Sanjida Sheikh have been effective in their roles.However, female characters could be improved a bit more. Kriti Kharbanda has not been given much opportunity by the director on screen.The three main male actors of Taish, Jim Sarbh, Pulkit Samrat, and Harshvardhan Rane have played their roles effectively.Their scenes show an emotional depth. Be it scenes of Harshvardhan and Sanjida or scenes between Pulkit and Jim Sarbh.Bejoy, who has made 'Wazir' with Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar, also made 'Karvaan' with Irrfan Khan and Dulquer Salmaan in between. Apart from this, Bejoy has also made acclaimed thrillers like 'Shaitan'.Bejoy's direction has an emotional depth and style, but sometimes the lack of dispatch makes even the best scenes seem ineffective. It feels like this somewhere in Taish.The story of this series or film is scattered over six episodes of about half an hour. In Hindi Cinema, there are many stories of dying for family and relationships but Taish Movie's treatment sets apart from other films."}, {"id": 559, "text": "Taish is an intriguing new experiment in town. ZEE5 is launching writer-director Bejoy Nambiar's Taish in two versions: a six-part mini-series with episodes of around 30 minutes each and a two-and-a-half-hour feature film. The total duration of the series is 34 minutes more than the film. This could have translated either into greater substance or more fluff in the series, or simply, interesting but differing takes on the same storyline, depending on the choices made in the writing and editing process. The story has two intertwined sects and cross eachother to avenge the revenge. Underwhelming at times, seems dark but is lucid and the cast does brilliant performance from Pulkit Samrat to HarshVardhan Rane, Sanjeeda Sheikh, Jim Sarbh, Kirti Kharbanda.The music and songs are jewels. Each song is unique and has a rustic feel. Sona Mohapatra has also done a good job.Nambiar does what he does best. Watch for a intesly beautiful film."}, {"id": 560, "text": "It's a wedding celebration in the Kalra family, young Krish is uniting with his girlfriend Mahi and it's fun galore. Brother Rohan (Jim Sarbh) and his girlfriend Arfa (Kriti Kharbanda) and Rohan's best friend Sunny (Pulkit Samrat) light up the celebration like a house on fire. Suddenly Rohan spots Kuljinder (Abhimanyu Singh) among the guests, and old wounds are flipped open. Hot headed Sunny notices Rohan's reaction and probes for the reason, following which he accosts Kuljinder and in a drunken brawl, almost fatally injures the latter. Kuljinder's is a family of criminals and his brothers, Pali (Harshvardhan Rane), Sukhi (Saurabh Sachdeva) and Jassi (Armaan Khera) seek bloody revenge. Sunny manages to survive by chance, but tragedy strikes the Kalras, leading to Rohan breaking his ties with Sunny and turning reclusive.This is just the beginning. Taish is the story of the chain reaction that follows this incident and how an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth turns the lives of the two families and people associated with them into a blood soaked mayhem.Taish is explosive as the title suggests. An action more than two decades ago spirals into an uncontrollable series of violent events that touches everyone, ending in disastrous consequences especially for the innocent lives who wake up to the unknown reality about the people they love. It's a violent saga of vengeance amid brotherhood and friendship, love and loss. Harshvardhan Rane stands out in his complex role, subdued on the surface but determined and passionate underneath. Pulkit Samrat impresses in his hot headed role, although his role is poorly sketched for being the pivotal character that sets off the fire and being the carrier of the vendetta flag on behalf of his friend who breaks his ties with him. Jim Sarbh gives a stunning performance in the central role, mixing several emotions deftly. The women don't have much to do, yet Saloni Batra and Sanjeeda Sheikh stand tall in their respective roles of Sanober and Jahaan, the two ill fated women of the gangster household. Kriti Kharbanda is appropriate, offering support. Do watch Taish, its 6 episodes keep matters focused, slick, dramatic and boast of some superlative action, breezy pace, beautiful UK countryside locales and some haunting music that stays with you for long. Baawree by Sona Mohapatra is an apt, melancholy shroud over the violent saga in the end that underlines the tragedy of lost love."}], "reviews_amount": 561}
