As if reading an early science fiction short, you are provided just enough information to move the story along, and are left to your imagination to characterize the individuals and draw your own moral implications from their actions. In this age of high budget, force fed conclusions and extravagant special effects....some trust has been placed in the audience. I like that."}, {"id": 1, "text": "A really good film, if you are expecting Star Wars, move on Much more story driven sci FI that doesn't rely on special effects to tell a story Well worth a watch"}, {"id": 2, "text": "This isn't space battles, explosions, and flashy visual effects. Instead, it's a well-acted story about people, that happens to be set in an interplanetary context. Great aesthetic and prop design, an interesting mix of futuristic and retro."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Prospect was the feature debut for writer-director team Christopher Caldwell and Zeek Earl and proved to be an ambitious masterclass in simplistic worldbuilding. It began as a humble Kickstarter funded short film which debuted at SXSW in 2014 and grew into a 4 million dollar feature film starring Pedro Pascal. The film proves that the sci-fi genre doesn't have to consist of large budget, CGI-heavy stories with overwrought plots.Jay Duplass plays Damon, an interplanetary prospector, who travels from world-to-world with his teenage daughter Cee (played by Sophie Thatcher) trying to make a profit off the rare materials they harvest. While venturing onto an alien moon in search for their next harvest, disaster strikes the farther-daughter duo when they encounter Pedro Pascal's charismatic Ezra and Damon is killed. The film doesn't get distracted with unnecessary expose, while Ezra and Cee go their separate ways on several occasions, they are drawn back together in their pursuit to get off the toxic planet. Cee and Ezra make for an infinitely more interesting father-daughter style duo than Damon did, though that may be due in part to the charm of Ezra's character.As I watched I couldn't help but wonder if the creatives behind The Mandalorian had used this film as their deciding factor in casting Pedro Pascal. He is effortless in his portrayal of Ezra, making the best of his dialogue and love-to-hate persona. Cee and Ezra have to rely upon and trust one another in order to get off the moon and the undercurrent of 'found family' is interesting to watch.The film doesn't concern itself with explaining when it is set, though given the spaceship that Damon and Cee live on and the somewhat dire post-apocalyptic feeling society, one could believe that it's set sometime in the not-so-distant future. The writers utilized clever subliminal dialogue about the film's universe, which managed to invite the audience in without bogging them down with inane details. It provided just enough details to make the world believable and unique. What resonates is that the filmmakers are grounded in the reality of the world they've created and they are able to share that security with the audience. It was a small window into a larger world that felt real and strangely familiar.Caldwell and Earl's straightforward approach to sci-fi storytelling has the potential to spark a new generation of storytellers, borrowing from the classic 1970s-vibe of films like Star Wars. If the story is good and the world is believable you don't need massive budgets to create an engaging movie. Prospect isn't a thought-provoking movie, but it is 100 minutes of interesting storytelling, simplistic sets and costumes, and a masterclass on how good science fiction can be when its at its best."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Stunning costume and set design and a wonderfully real feeling science fiction world. Pedro pascal was excellent and so was Sophie Turner."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Prospect is a slow burn of a film. It's the kind of film that asks for a viewer who is willing to appreciate the subtle but deft world-building and peculiarly literate dialog. This is not cheap-thrills scifi, but neither is it navel gazing pedantry. It's a clear story of an often tense struggle in a treacherous and foreign setting.It is slow, but it is not a slog; on the contrary I found it to be very well-paced. We're never in one place very long, either literally or narratively.All the acting is good to very good. The photography is excellent. The budget (~3mil) was used well and I found all the props, costumes and effects to be really quite convincing. I'm glad I took a chance with this one. It paid off."}, {"id": 6, "text": "If you want lasers, explosions, and a fast pace - skip it.I didn't consider the budget, which means that they did well with what they had. The props are on point and it's quite believable.The actors are excellent; the female lead is played very well as a young girl who's had to grow up quickly. The male lead immediately reminded me of a toned-down Malcolm Reynolds.Definitely one to watch."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Despite an excellent atmospheric start, the story could have been told in any number of settings and at in any point in time. It hardly calls for a sci-fi setting.The actors were good, the effects were good but the overall story is pedestrian. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did. I would have skipped watching this movie if it were under any other genre."}, {"id": 8, "text": "The story follows the usual conventions about prospectors in the Gold Rush. Nothing truly groundbreaking here.Where this movie shines, is that it how it remixes the Gold Rush with gritty, grounded sci-fi world building. There are so many rich details in every scene. The implied story universe is so big that you the audience can let your imagination run wild."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I keep reading about a father, daughter story. That part was over in about fifteen minutes. What it is to me is a glimpse into the future of movies. Simple, believable, beutifully crafted and scored, of a common story that could have been just as easily set in the old west during the Gold Rush. I am so tired of the onslaught of CG that the big budget studios release. This is not one of them. If anything, the CG enhances the beauty of some of the scenes. I won't gve any of it away. But it's been a long while that I have enjoyed every second. of a movie, or would want to see it again. That is how impressed I am."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Low budget movie but very nicley done. Kept me engaged throughout. These kinds of films actually feel more 'sci fi' to me than many high budget sci fi movies."}, {"id": 11, "text": "First of all, sorry if my wording is not so precise, english is not my native language.This is my first review here. I almost wrote one for different movies a couple of times, but never felt the urge to do so in the end. This movie on the other hand is so fantastic, that i just have to write my point of view on this gem. It's rare to see good sci-fi movies these days, that are not full of over the top technology, space battles, cheap drama, hollywood tropes and cliches etc.First of all, the cast is superb. Pedro Pascal and Sophie Thatcher play their roles perfect in my opinion. There is not too much dialogue, but the facial expressions and the overall conduct, especially of the girl, is just on point. The rest of the cast is great as well, Bubbles from The Wire has a weird and small role in it too.But what i loved the most is the overall atmosphere, the movie is beautiful shot and the world building is just impeccable. There is so much going on in the background, that it just makes me want to know more about this whole universe. For example the weird pop music that sounds like an asian language, the little stickers in the pod, the mentioning of different planets and cities, the kit and tools to dig up the aurelacs and so on. Just fascinating. The whole technolgy looks worn and sometimes odd, but has a realistic feel/look to it. It reminds me in a lot of ways of 70s and 80s sci-fi and their world building, especially Alien. All of this is never really explained, the movie just hints at a large and fascinating universe. But thats what i love, it leaves room for your imagination.A must watch for every hard sci-fi fan, who is interested in something different from the usual."}, {"id": 12, "text": "This is a wonderful hard sci-fi film about a father-daughter team that lands on a forest moon in search of gems, but there is a clock ticking. They need to get back into orbit before the big ship that carried them out into this system leaves. Great acting by teenager Sophie Thatcher and Pedro Pascal as the rogue the father/daughter team encounter. The beautifully shot sequences in a forest with lots of particulate dust in the air at all times was a great counterpoint to the gritty reality of day-to-day survival without too much advanced pseudo-science gear. It was refreshing to see a film where people are on an alien world (in this case a forest moon) that does NOT have a breathable atmosphere and thus have to wear spacesuits and worry about the attendant issues of being on an alien world and being able to make it home, things most sci-fi just seems to make into a non-issue... where every planet has a breathable atmosphere, or at worst requires a tiny filter actors wear over their mouth/nose."}, {"id": 13, "text": "This is a gem, great screenplay, great cinematography, great acting, great directing. And the score is perfect."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Prospect never tries to deny its roots. A space Western crossed with a Scifi movie which seems to have somehow escaped from the height of the 70's. Giving a gripping tale of a prospectors daughter and the slowly developing relationship that grows between her and her father's killer. The first order of business, to survive!Things aren't quite that simple though, as directors/writers Christopher Caldwell and Zeke Earl choose to throw the watcher straight into the midst of this working world, with little exposition to explain what is going on. Prospector Damon already takes drugs to sleep and enough to avoid the desperation of his life, as his daughter, Cee, simply seems to be stuck. With no friends and her memories, she desperately tries to write in quieter times.Prospectors go to 'The Green' to find gems, like pearls from oysters, hidden within buried creatures and these gems are their way out of poverty. Prospecting seeming to be an expertise and one her father is good at, bringing you to imagine that the poverty they are in is imposed; like Joseph Hellers Catch 22. However, a poor encounter with Ezra and his Number Two leads to her father trying to become the thief and being shot in the process. Cee escaping to the safety of their pod to find it has failed and she is trapped. The time ticking to return to orbit in time to depart with their haul.The Green seems to swallow up many, as Ezra is also trapped by his own volition, and is seeking escape before he too gets swallowed by the landscape. The directors making this lush world as menacing as any post-apocalyptic world, despite the trees and life. Other arrivals seem to have chosen to remain, in a semi-religious fervour and yet more mercenaries seek out the right people to extract the gems they also seem desperate to retrieve. The whole both reminiscent of the classic Boy and his Dog and also Cormack McCarthy's The Road, as we see Cee grow from girl to woman through the movie.Given that the film manages to keep many elements obtuse, with dialogue sometimes lost due to the poor comms systems and the ticking time Cee keeps glancing at, but which is unreadable to the viewer, as prime examples: As well as questions about the reason richer companies aren't mining these resources. What Prospect cleverly does is never to reveal how much time has passed. As Cee and Ezra's relationship grows organically, but Cee herself seems older and wiser from event to event, to even her smile as they leave. Is it really just the fact they've escaped?Sophie Hatcher and Pedro Pascal are simply immense in the lead roles, with the amputation section being both wincingly uncomfortable and gloriously black humoured at the same time. But the support cast are also well crafted and engaging, yet never revealing about their own situation and why they are stuck in this horrific place. The music and SFX evoking the feel of the film perfectly.Prospect is never going to be everyone's type of film. Slow moving, character driven and often intentionally avoiding giving you the facts. For those who like the genres mentioned, this is a true find and worthy of your time."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Refreshing original sci-fi you don't see a lot of anymore. Surprisingly good and entertaining. Kept us for literally hours later searching for all the songs in the quirky soundtrack. Loved it!!"}, {"id": 16, "text": "Feel free to watch the original Prospect short film. This feature length version could be taken as a remake or a sequel. Characters in this fictional space western are prospectors to a treasure that looks something like an insect trapped in amber, heading back and forth between the alien planets worth mining and rental docking bays on an orbital space station. Prospect, in both versions, builds tension fantastically, uses props and science wisely, and lets our heroin shine."}, {"id": 17, "text": "This movie goes to show what is possible on a shoe string budget when you have a good story and great directing/editing etc. Very well put together."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Back in the nineties I loved to read sci-fi novels and stories. This movie took me back into those times, I felt like I was reading a good old-fashioned sci-fi book, one of those that capture you so much that you can't go to sleep until 3AM. I don't dare to say that this movie is a masterpiece. But it does not pretend to be one. It is one of those somewhat not too complicated movies that you just enjoy watching. Awesome visuals, story is moving but not cheesy, interesting but not overdone. Just the right amount of good stuff. So much better than all the modern big screen sci-fi with so much action going on that it only gives me headachy confusion.Highly recommended."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This movie is basically steampunk, or rather what I'd call scrappie, sci-fi. Flight software in a casete, buttons, switches, bulbs and cathode-ray screens, a spacecraft cobbled up on the cheap, an emphasis on second-hand equipment for the cash-strapped heroes. That's all fine (even atmospheric), and the absence of CGI or other special effects is not missed, if you got a solid script to back a good story. Alas, this is not the case with this movie. It makes the most of our planet's natural environment, making it look outlandish. Acting isn't bad either. But all of this rests on thin air, when it comes to a story that goes somewhere. Things happen and in the end our heroes stage a narrow escape, but none of the other folk appearing have any proper reason for doing so or offer much by way of exciting twists and turns, the end scenes are rather puzzling (how did the condemned redskin guy break free?) and all you are left with is a basic tried to make some buck by mining a planet but failed scenario. None of that can lift the film from a very average attempt to something really worth watching."}, {"id": 20, "text": "This was quite a pleasant surprise. A well written story enhanced by good acting from the principles. This movie proves that good Sci-Fi doesn't need to be big budget. Pedro Pascal may be recognisable to many as the star of the first three seasons of Narcos and he plays an interesting character. Sophie Thatcher was a surprise, she definitely has a presence on screen and was perfect for the main character in this story."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Another reviewer called this a Space Western and I agree completely. At heart it is a story about the frontier of space! It's a small story, focused on one girl, on one world in a larger universe we get small details about. The universe built around these small details left me wanting a trilogy. Seriously, it's epic.But this story is awesome too. It's a test of a young person left to make their way in a cruel, unforgiving world. I just wish we got to see more of this journey."}, {"id": 22, "text": "I like that there are still low-budget sci-fi theatrical releases. Sometimes creativity is nurtured by limitations.One highlight of this movie is the back-and-forth between Sophie Thatcher and Pedro Pascal. They make an intriguing pair, especially within the framework of an alien planet, dealing with various severe conflicts. This movie feels both 1950s sci-fi and 2010s sci-fi. I was lucky enough to see it in the theater, but I think it would be enjoyable in a home setting with a few imbibables in you. \ud83d\ude0cAnd sometimes it's just fun taking in the scenery."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Personally I was amazed to watch how well thought out all the hardware props worked in that movie! I mean all of those '70ties little tiny CRT screens and toggle switches give a very authentic feeling to it. Subtle and smart production for sure!"}, {"id": 24, "text": "I'm taken aback. Such a thoroughly impressive film. I came into this knowing absolutely nothing about it. Its futuristic, yet primitive style deviates from typical, mainstream sci-fi, which adds to its appeal. The primitive nature of their technology is somewhat dystopian, which makes the story that much more real. The score and soundtrack contribute so much more to the atmosphere of this movie than scores and soundtracks usually do. Only the one actor was vaguely recognizable, so I don't imagine their budget was huge, but what an accomplishment. This is definitely up there with the best of sci-fi and the best of films in general. A simple, captivating story. Great performances by the actors and actresses. You can really empathize with the trials and triumphs of the characters. The score and soundtrack is certainly noteworthy, incredibly suitable, and ties everything together perfectly. Overall, amazing execution. This is one of those rare occasions whereby everybody who was involved in the project did a stellar job. I want more!"}, {"id": 25, "text": "This is a fantastic science fiction film that makes good use of practical effects and builds a whole universe that you are left wanting to know more about. After watching the film, I searched the internet for a novel or comic book that this story may have been based on or in. I wanted to know more about Cee's life and Ezra's past. I was hooked! The story paints an accurate picture of history repeating itself well into the future, this time with the gold-rush occurring on a planetary scale, with all the same ruthlessness and violence shown in the All Gold Canyon segment of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, where Tom Waits plays a prospector. Not since the first Alien have I felt like I was watching an original science fiction film where the actors clearly were not just staring a green screens, but actually living and acting in the settings of the film. I highly recommend watching The Making Of specials associated with this movie. I eagerly await the next film by Christopher Caldwell and Zeek Earl."}, {"id": 26, "text": "Every now and then one comes across a movie that sufficiently impresses, that you tell yourself you'll pay attention to anything else the writers or the Director does in the future. Prospect is one such movie. The story is a clever idea, not totally original, but with an almost a Western feel which certainly works, much like Young Ones (2014). Once dressed up with great planetary graphics, great spaceship sets, cool, if hardy, gadgets, a believable planet (though some more cgi would have helped), great camera work, good editing, good lighting, wonderfully chosen soundscape, and well chosen and highly committed actors......well, it's a cool winner. Great mid-budget sci-fi movie."}, {"id": 27, "text": "No, it's Prospect, an indie sci-fi film that had its wide release in 2019. Well, it looks like a sci-fi, it has spacesuits and spaceships and an alien planet with a ton of sci-fi nonsense in the dialogue, but don't be fooled. This movie is a western, another Mandalorian similarity. It has prospectors, settlers, outlaws, rivals and untamed wilderness! Using a 50s and 60s retro sci-fi aesthetic to tell a western story was really interesting and fun to watch. This movie is on the slower side, it has a lot of long shots of just pretty scenery, but the action is definitely worth sitting through the movie for. It's bloody and brutal! The effects are really damn good for having such a low budget. It uses a lot of practical effects with minimal CGI. You get the sense that they really are on an alien world when it's really just a forest. The performances were great and the character dynamics were interesting. The story is simple, but it works. Overall, this is a good movie. Check it out if you like westerns or retro sci-fi!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "I had seen the trailer for this months ago, and I got the opportunity to see it last night. I had read the good reviews and was optimistic, but still expecting a letdown.I was sucked in pretty much from the start however, and the movie just worked for me.

Loved it!"}, {"id": 30, "text": "Lo-Fi Sci-Fi indie flick orbiting the uneasy alliance between a young orphaned girl, Cee, and cut-throat gold digger, Ezra, as they seek good fortune on a perilous alien moon. The sci-fi trappings - rusty space-suits, cranky spaceships etc - are authentically rendered, and the unchartered terrain, a sort of Ewok-free Moon of Endor, breathes with atmosphere thicker than a Frank Herbert Dune doorstop. But they're merely cosmetic ticks papering over a slight tale that would play out exactly the same with buckskins and horses in the wild west. The story's repetitive narrative and episodic structure quickly reveal the script's shortcomings leaving one with the aftertaste of an all-dressed-up-with-no-place-to-go non-starter. So PROPSECT could almost be written off as another style-over-content space adventure then? Not quite. Thanks to the performances and to-die-for chemistry of the two lead leads - Sophie Thatcher and the super charismatic Pedro Pascal - writer/directors Christopher Caldwell &amp; Zeek Earl's debut feature star-surfs to safety via muscular character engagement.

Was painful. I really like silent and slow movies, but this retro-sci-fi fanfiction is no silent, only dull, and all I saw were three or four random scenes without apparent relation; no surprise, no verisimilitude, no plot, no real drama, no evolution. In the vein of the new movies of this era of mechanized standards, and overabundance, the technical aspects were well constructed, the work of the actors good, but the plot and the drama no sense and no existent.

It's not that the pace goes frantic after that encounter, but the stakes get raised.Which is a really nice twist and a really good way to move the story and the movie forward. The affection or lack thereof between characters is something to behold. It is also something that if you get behind, will really keep you on the edge of your seat.

I love scifi, but I find modern day scifi increasingly shallow and cheap. Too bad that counts for this movie also. What is wrong with Prospect and many other today's scifi is the premise and the plot, that usually is a simple story about greed, power and war. These themes dont need a scifi context, because they are omnipresent in our lives already.Actually I pity todays youth, for in my younger days we had terrific and mindblowing scifi like Logan's Run, Soylent Green, The Andromeda Strain or Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

Take away the space suits and this would be a great film about gold prospectors in the wild west at the end of the 19th century. But personally I must say I love the fact that it's set on another planet, and unlike most space movies this planet has beautiful forests but not a breathable atmosphere. Combining these different elements is what makes this movie so fresh, although taken apart neither the wild west feel nor the space thingy are original in and unto them selves. I must also add that the acting is great, especially from Tatcher and Pascal, and it is beautifully shot and the soundtrack ties it all together in a epic but gritty feast for eyes and ears. My only complaint was sometimes I had a hard time figuring out who some of the characters were, or more precisely how they got there, what they were doing and how it all relates.

It was very obvious early on that Ezra (Pedro Pascal) and Cee (Sophie Thatcher) were going to have to team up and I was looking forward to seeing a relationship develop between them (a la True Grit or L\u00e9on: The Professional), or an exploration of Pedro Pascal's fatherly character (a la The Road or Kozure \u00d4kami) but that never really happened.Nothing ever came of Cee's vague origins or her father's admission that there was something he should have told her. The amputation scene was potentially the biggest character-building scene for Cee, but the scalpel on an electric toothbrush really killed the vibe and her skill with a knife doesn't pay off later.If we had seen the relationship between Cee and Ezra really develop and there was some internal conflict between one or both of them about the arrangement, then it could have been a good movie, but that never happens and we are left with a disappointing and mostly unfulfilling shootout ending to a mediocre loss-of-innocence story."}, {"id": 164, "text": "I actually enjoyed this movie.

The dialogue is very hard to understand at times especially through radios and helmets. My other criticism would be plot holes, for some reason the red dude left to die in the cage escapes but doesn't kill the two of them and the guy who came up to the father and Cee suddenly turns into a nice guy.

It tells a fairly simple but very engaging proper sci-fi story in a way that makes it refreshingly easy to suspend disbelief: no really stupid bad science or cheesy overblown SFX, and very little clunky exposition (apart perhaps from a little by the dad early on).Others have alluded to a space western vibe, and perhaps this is somewhat valid in a good way- it would arguably fit quite comfortably in the Firefly/Serenity universe. It's not full of highly conceptual artifice but the attention to detail is very impressive, bringing to life a believably gritty reality that reminded me of Ridley Scott's thinking about the future not being shiny-new, but old and worn.The main characters are nicely understated but relatable, the pace is great, and unlike a lot of sci-fi movies that treat the viewer as an utter moron, this one doesn't over-explain or create spurious tensions and conflict for cheap 'drama'.As a kid I hoovered up EE Doc Smith and old mags like Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, Analog, Amazing SF et al, still love the stories and novels of Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Simak, Poul Anderson, LeGuinn, Ellison etc and would still rather watch Bladerunner again than yet another trashy superhero 'blockbuster'.

It tells about a young teenage girl, played by Sophie Thatcher, who lands on a distant planet with her dad (Jay Duplass), to hunt and harvest precious gemstones that might be their ticket to better life and prosperity. But, on the outer planets, you run into all sorts of danger.Prospect is not a large story. Its about a single life, single girl, trying to survive a horrible situation. This story could be told in many ways. It could be a three page short story in a pulp magazine focusing on westerns. It could be a side plot on a TV series. It could be a whole novel, if you padded it and fleshed it out, but even then there's not that much to bite on.And that's exactly why the film is so refreshing. Because it is such a rare piece, because it chooses to focus on a smaller story. And because it such a well-told narrative, it manages to make such a story feel grander than it is.It helps that the film is brilliantly made. You can very easily see the limitations of the budget, but fortunately modern effects are so good that you can tell a science fiction story, set on a distant planet, and make it seem real even if you don't have the budget for huge sets and elaborate props.The acting is also surprisingly good. Thatcher plays her character very mellow, very low-key, but it works. Pedro Pascal as Ezra, a mercenary harvester, is also brilliant. Just the right amount of quirk mixed with world-weariness.Prospect is an easy recommendation if you're a fan of the science fiction genre. Beautiful visuals, interesting scenarios, great world-building and off-beat story moments. What's not to like?"}, {"id": 190, "text": "What floored me the most about this film was the attention to detail. This is how you make small budget scifi. Its a shame that so many indie scifi films are brought low by a focus on story and forgetting immersion. This movie is downright filthy. Every piece of technology looks used and beat up, lived in and thats so important. Whomever was in charge of set design, bravo. Its original star wars, blade runner, MOON, MONSTERS quality set design and costumes. These are poor miners and mercenaries. Every piece of gear should look rusty, hand cobbled and it does. This movie looks soooooo good. Even the main planet scenery, which could easily be a familiar tropic bog has this beautiful filter and light effect over it that makes it stand out as other worldly. They took the time to create familiar yet other worldy music like something out of cowboy bebop. Jazzy, hispanic, asian sounds whether real or not feel foreign. They created a separate written language just for consoles and sketchpads, never even calling it out(they did that in Star Wars, look it up.) The dedication to worldbuilding in this movie is just jaw dropping. I love the cobbled together rifle that uses hand charging batteries. The aesthetic reminds me a bit of these old scifi shows/films from the 80-90 cyber revolution Desert Punk and Zeiram.and I guess, the movie is also pretty great. The characters are all very believable though Pedro Pascal really carries this movie with his dialog being a unique combination of Mark Twain purpose and Shakespearean adjective style. What I really liked is that for all that work mentioned above its never dwelled upon. Some low budget scifi films, when they know they did something neat, will sit there and make you stare at it while nothing happens for 5 minutes. I promise you this movie has none of that. It moves at a really nice clip to a beautiful bittersweet ending.I honestly kinda want to give this movie a 10, but I think that would just be too personal. Some people don't take set design and cinematography as serious as I do. I would recommend this mainly to the MOON, Blade Runner(original) audience. If you enjoy small scope noir scifi this is for you. If you need backflips and explosions big pass. Dangit, nvm Im giving it a 10."}, {"id": 191, "text": "Nice little gem of a sci-fi movie. I'd never hear of it before and initially started watching because I saw it was made by Dust - a company of which I'm a fan of on YouTube, they make a lot of little sci-fi shorts posted there. This is not really space-based, so space shots are minimal, the majority of the film is spent on a forest planet (or is it a moon?) full of toxic spores, and there aren't any space battles or a huge good vs evil arc.It's a simply told story of a girl and her father who are poor miners/prospectors that have contracted to set down on this planet to mine for gems for a group of mercenaries, but their plans are foiled when there is a malfunction with their drop ship and it lands off target.As they make their way toward the target on foot, they come across an abandoned prospecting site where they find a valuable gem - the kind they've been contracted here to mine. Because it's so valuable, the father, over his daughter's objections, decide they're going to mine for some more for themselves, rather than going on to do the job they were contracted for. Unfortunately, before they can do so, they are accosted by two strangers intent on robbing them and things go downhill for them from there.It may move a bit slow for some people, but I was fine with the pacing. The acting was on-point, esp. the girl. There weren't much in the way of sfx, but the setting was completely believable and what props there were, were well done and believable, everything looked very well used and out of date - as it would when someone is poor and unable to obtain newer or better, really grounds the viewer to the character's lot in life, unobtrusively, without words.There are no space battles or a big finale flourish - though there's several fight/shoot-out scenes, and the ending is satisfying.

I'd take true science fiction over an epic space battle or alien invasion any day. I absolutely LOVE the look and feel of this film...obviously futuristic but in a dirty, mechanical way- no polish to be found here. The sound/music is fantastic, and shots from outer space are surprisingly impressive. If you're a big fan of CGI or mind-blowing cinematography then you may feel underwhelmed by this, and that's OK. It's something different though, and it's one of the more intense and gripping stories I've seen in some time. Love the realistic action of the gunplay; these weapons are certainly from tomorrow but there's no pew pew here. They seem unreliable, and difficult to fire, though extremely deadly if your aim is true. Sophie Thatcher provides a breakout turn as an unlikely heroine among a crew of male characters who are all less than noble in their own ways, mostly being driven by greed and desperation.

Most of it is really space-fantasy, with laser cannons, explosions, space craft zipping around, fantastic monsters/aliens, etc. None of that is found in Prospect. This film is grounded in a gritty reality that is extremely believable, more so than in any science fiction film I can remember seeing. In the novel world, stories that stick to some semblance of known scientific fact are known as hard sci-fi. Now, to be fair, there isn't a lot of science on display in Prospect - it's mostly action, but I will take what I can get! In case you can't tell, I've very much in favour of there being more films like this out there.I very grudgingly rate this a 7 instead of an 8 or higher mostly for technical / production reasons, that are perhaps in turn due to budget compromises. Special effects, music, and perhaps a bit of the acting was a little b-movie at times. But I quickly got over it and was sucked into the story.Also Star Wars writers take note: the main female character Cee is someone that the audience really roots for by the end of the film. Why? Because instead of being all knowing and all powerful right from the start, her character develops. Some of the characterization was a little lean, and I felt another 10 minutes of screen time devoted to fleshing out the father would have really helped the film, but these are minor nitpicks.

But the film deserves some rambling first impressions.Many major science fiction releases from big studios in the past few years have been horribly cast mistreatments of lovely source material ( Valerian), angsty YA dystopians or wastes of opportunity (jupiter ascending).Prospect is not a big waste of money, nor is it a waste of the audiences time. It's a beautifuly we'll crafted glimpse into an unknown future where humanity is still just as human as ever. It doesn't utilise the power of its genre to force upon the audience the possible developments of current or imagined social or technological trends. It does however place it there somewhere subtly in the background and gives you the time to pick up the details and read between the lines.The world building of the expanded universe is beautifully crafted by the props department, and even if costumes do sometimes leave something to be desired, a lot has clearly been achieved with limited means. Along with some cleverly written dialogue with unique speech patterns for each character lets you know of a larger world and richer characters outside of the little scenario we're witnessing The story of a few cast-away individuals scurrying amongst the dregs of a formerly booming prospecting industry on a soon to be abandoned moon is held together by a simple selection of location scenery. Whenever the relatively slow pacing of the film could let you get bored with the repetitive landscape, a powerful vista of the gas giant the green moon is orbiting reminds you how alien everything really is.Sophie Tacher delivers a very convincing performance as the young girl afraid to be stranded in a corner of the galaxy soon to be forgotten while Pedro Pascal does a calm delivery of his charmingly unsympathetic rouge. The score is well crafted, but at times I miss a more aggressive sound.The high score I've given it isn't because this is the best out there, but because it is pretty much as good as a space-western low budget indie can hope to be while preserving the mold.Short version is: 'true grit' on an alien moon, with some early George rr Martin melancholic sci fi spice to make everything more interesting."}, {"id": 195, "text": "What a true little gem of a sci-fi movie this is.

The people who made this film have bright things ahead of them, that much is certain.Both main actors deliver inspired, subdued performances with Pedro Pascal exuding some of his signature charming, yet threatening, charisma that is sharply contrasted by Sophie Tatcher's vulnerability.

Yet it all makes sense in this world, where ressources are sparse, competition is fierce, and tech needs to be as simple and reliable as possible.Oh the soundtrack and photography are gorgeous, too. Both often recall spaghetti western movies, an influence that Prospect seems to proudly wear on it's sleeves with all the stand-offs, uneasy alliances and unavoidable bloodshed. This is, after all, very much about the hardships of frontier life and a very unsubtle nod to the tragedies of blood-soaked gold rushes that occurs right under our noses. And that speaks volumes about the strength of Prospect - the scope of the story is small and intimate, yet you're constantly aware that this takes place in a much bigger universe. A universe that appears ripe for many more stories and perspectives.Highly recommended!"}, {"id": 196, "text": "Thoroughly enjoyable: a lean, tense, slow burn sci-fi film that builds to an exciting crescendo.It's a story about a father and daughter who go to an alien planet to do some prospecting. That's all you need to know, and should know, as there are some plot twists that should be left unspoiled. Trust me.The movie's well directed and written, besides some clunky dialogue in spots, and the world is artfully rendered. It's made on a budget, so there aren't any extravagant sets or creatures, but it does feature lived in, authentic looking technology and an atmospheric alien environment (reminiscent of Annihilation, but a tad more Alien).The performances were all very good, Sophie Thatcher and Pedro Pascal, being the standouts.If I had to describe it, I'd say Prospect is an old-fashioned western set in space, with a touch of 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' (another movie about prospectors). And though it's no Star-Wars, or Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Prospect IS a very good movie. Well worth a watch."}, {"id": 197, "text": "I am a science fiction fan whole heartedly, and saying that feels like a understatement.But unfortunately the genre gets very few additions these days - that are truly science fiction. And not more fantasy being labeled as science fiction, or using 'syfy' as a sub-genre.This is a purely science fiction story, set in its own unique world. Perhaps some plot aspects are a tad lacking, but that leaves you to fill the blanks with your own imagination, which you're provided enough information to do so. It's not totally void of plot. It just suggests a much bigger interesting world that the writers envision this story being apart of.The acting is really brilliant by all involved. It fits the tone of the film very well. -- The cinematography is wondrous and beautiful, helping create the foreign but familiar world the story is set. Using full advantage of the very small amount of CGI on display, but making it all fluid and natural to look at. -- The themes on display grab your attention, A strained father/daughter relationship steeped in surreal science fiction, of a man dragging his kid with him across the stars, but still relatable to any deadbeat father trope. The compromise and trustless alliance that grows with the two leads. An Uneasy journey from beginning to the end. Both actors along with good writing, creating the reliance on each other in a way that didn't feel forced.It's a film that these days is seen as risky, and won't get much funding. But it's these types of films that should show large studios, that creative - original ideas can be executed with very good quality. And that risks are worth taking still, so that the medium of film doesn't completely degenerate into by the numbers dramas, unfunny comedies and no substance action/superhero films.I truly hope in my life time, I see the direction of film studios regress back to taking risks. They already lose so much money on these high budget dung heaps that fail at the box office with increasing frequency. Sticking 20 mil a piece into riskier projects, perhaps someday, will seem like a viable option again... One can only hope."}, {"id": 198, "text": "The best science fiction helps us to imagine how different versions of a real future world might possibly play out. I am absolutely thrilled that Netflix is currently featuring a truly excellent, modestly-budgeted hard scifi film with virtually no digital special effects (just old-fashioned acting and character development) that permits the suspension of disbelief and gives us a feeling for a gritty future in which getting by might still be as hard as it is now....Sophie Thatcher kills it as a typical but bright teenage kid marooned on an alien moon that looks a lot like earth (due to the low budget), but with some minor though important differences. Pedro Pascal (otherwise recognizable as Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones) backs her up as an atypically articulate bad guy and no-account grifter. The story is about how neither one has a chance without the other.White this is not a great film, it is certainly much closer to the spirit of what science fiction ought to be than the big-budget overkill out there that has basically destroyed the magic of science fiction (Star Wars: This means you!). Most all of my preferred science fiction films these days are on the low budget side.Prospect is also available on disc.More like this, please!"}, {"id": 199, "text": "To me, Prospect felt like a Western movie more than a Sci-fi. Twists, turns, shifting alliances, fortune and glory. I never really knew how the story would end. (Actually, I still wasn't 100% sure what had happened when the credits rolled, but I really enjoyed the ride.)Instead of hitting us over the head with heavy amounts of visual effects, Prospect leaves a lot of the action out-of-frame and lets the viewer's imagination fill in the blanks. Normally I hate this, but it works in this case thanks to a beautifully-executed layer of sound effects. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack, and I thought all the alien languages were a nice touch.Prospect reminds me of 2 movies:1) District 9, another gritty, dirty, relatively low-budget movie that began life as a short story, later getting a feature film, and 2) Pitch Black, a fun little story we're thrown into without a lot of explanation while featuring some cool mysterious characters.Both of these had tremendous sequel potential and I feel the same is true for Prospect.

Special effects are meager but convincing. Sets are few but realistic. Small physical details such as medical equipment, weapons, food packs, and written language are remarkably complete. Photography and color are times lovely, at other times gloomy and foreboding. Costumes, especially the ever present pressure suits mandated by the planet's toxic atmosphere, are amazingly varied and realistically worn-looking.Most impressive, however, is the acting. The main characters, especially the young girl, are convincing and very well portrayed, despite the chracters spending the bulk of the movie in the aforementioned pressure suits.PROSPECT is proof positive that a convincing and engaging sci-fi film need not be produced with a bloated budget or the overwhelming effects of a superhero or end-of-the-world cataclysm. The characters here may be accustomed to space travel between worlds but their personalities and back stories are remarkably down to earth."}, {"id": 201, "text": "TORONTO AFTER DARK 2018Grim and grimy, Prospect is one of those films that really wants to be a sci-fi western and for the most part, it succeeds, thanks to some great direction by Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell, solid performances and wonderfully bleak atmosphere that surrounds this entire film.We meet teenager Cee (Sophie Thatcher) and her dad Damon (Jay Duplass), piloting their space freighter on a mission to find some very valuable alien gems that will, in turn, make them very wealthy. Of course, they're best-laid plans go out the window and soon they find themselves in the company of a rival named Ezra (Pedro Pascal) and all bets are off. A complicated relationship begins between Cee and Ezra, he becoming a weird anti-father figure to her, and this is where the movie begins to really get interesting.Earl and Caldwell, co-directors and co-writers of the film, do a great job setting the stage with some wonderful tension, haunting landscape, and great visuals. Earl, who is also the cinematographer, paints a great picture using a great combination of CGI and practical effects. The planet that Cee, Damon, Ezra, and scattered others are on looks great and deadly at the same time. Death is always hanging there, whether in the form of humans or things all around them native to the planet itself.Sophie Thatcher as Cee is a joy, slowly ramping up her performance as the movie moves along and has a very weird, complicated and necessary relationship with Pascal's Ezra. For the most part this collaboration works, driving the movie forward although at times there are moments where their scenes are too telegraphed, the characters and their 'relationship' too familiar. However, that doesn't take away from the performances, especially Thatcher who is very strong in her role as Cee.While it is this relationship that drives the film, Earl and Caldwell are smart enough to know they will need more than just this, and interweave dark and beautiful landscapes during this western sci-fi trek. The interiors at the beginning, those inside the spacecraft, also come across as very real and somewhat claustrophobic. It is a nice contrast to the vastness and open country of the planet the bulk of the film is on, although being in those suits still gives the audience that claustrophobic feeling, which is a very nice touch.Although there are moments in the film where some of the dialogue suffers and the scenes or scenery scream 'been there, done that', the movie reaches for the stars, no pun intended, and is successful in creating a great story and atmosphere for the audience to enjoy. Science fiction comes in many shapes and sizes but when it is dirty, haunting and human-like Prospect, it is a much more interesting story to watch unfold."}, {"id": 202, "text": "The good:The main actress is actually quite refreshing and new.

Think 2001 Odyssey, Blade Runner, Alien, Arrival, Children of Man and such. It is amongst the absolute best.What makes this movie stick its head above most of the other is that is filthy and greedy depiction of humans on SF - stuff are not shiny and high tech and beautiful Stuff break down, and everything in it seems normal.

At least they tried something different ."}, {"id": 206, "text": "The Queen's Lair. That's a theory.What a fantastic SF! Not because there are breathtaking space landscapes. Or because impressive, galactic battles are being fought. And you won't see a collection of exotic-looking aliens. To be honest, everything looks pretty cheap. As if someone has searched through the props room of large film companies just to collect remnants of old fiction films. The spacecraft, a drop-pod, with which Cee (Sophie Thatcher) and her father Damon (Jay Duplass) land on an unknown, green, swampy planet, looks like an old decrepit, plastic garbage bin full of mechanical push buttons and levers with instructions under it in a foreign language. I immediately thought of the old Moulinex kitchen appliances that my mother used to use. And I briefly compared it with the first Star-Wars film from the 70s. And also those old SF books from the library that I devoured as a young boy. Even the film poster resembled the cover of such a book.Perhaps it's also because I was so fascinated by this imaginative universe the makers created. The limited budget meant that they had to be inventive and develop a sci-fi world with limited resources. An environment that doesn't look earthly and where unknown techniques are used. To be honest, I didn't really understand what it was about. What did Cee and her father have to harvest on this planet? Were the marble balls, called Aurelac, a source of energy? Or were they precious gemstones? No idea. But it was obvious that they are worth a lot of money. And that's also the cause that wandering figures (apparently there are a lot of failing landing pods) try to steal each other's crops. Cee and Damon experience this at some point when they encounter Ezra (Pedro Pascal) and his companion. And from then on it's a struggle for survival.I understand some people will say this is a slow film and that they'll complain about the lack of action. No, this isn't a film with heroic laser fights (even though there is an occasional firefight) and intergalactic chases. But if you succeed in empathizing with this strange world, as I did, then everything suddenly becomes more fascinating. At certain moments I found the dialogues between Cee and Ezra touching. And even though they are diametrically opposed to each other, there's that sudden understanding and acceptance that makes them work together purposefully to flee this planet.The setting where it takes place isn't really unearthly. A swampy jungle, full of strange trees covered with mosses and giant ferns. Interspersed with reed-like landscapes where you expect a wild duck to fly by any moment. But these two characters, walking around in an old-fashioned looking space suit with a giant space helmet and a flexible hose connecting them, make it feel like science fiction. And there are also other minuscule details that ensure this. Such as the steampunk headphones Cee owns or the strange language she scribbles in her notebook. And when they come across a religious group that resides in an ordinary camping tent on this planet, you surely get the feeling that you are in a different solar system.All due respect to Sophie Thatcher, who makes her debut on the big screen with this film. She played so naturally and relaxed that it didn't look like acting. A mysterious teenager with a mysterious past. A girl who doesn't know much about her past and apparently never had a real home in her life. The most surprising thing was how you see her grow up as the film progresses. A fantastic acting performance. The most colorful figure is that of Pedro Pascal. A kind of criminal type who sounds rude but he always uses such lyrical, verbally exaggerated language (sometimes difficult to understand). That way everything he asks or tells seems to be incredibly important. The chemistry between the two characters is what drives this film to the final.Prospect is an intriguing film in which the use of interesting and inventive ingredients creates an exciting cocktail that leads to a strange, retro SF. The only thing the two connected (literally and figuratively) main characters want to achieve, is a safe return to the mother ship. And time is important, as they have to make that launch at a specific moment during the cycle. Perhaps the storyline is fairly simplistic. But in my opinion, this storyline fits perfectly with the minimalist view of this extremely successful SF film. This is definitely recommended for SF enthusiasts!"}, {"id": 207, "text": "For sure there are many weak points in this film.

They mention filming in a rainforest, and it looks like the rainforests of the Olympic Peninsula, west of Seattle.I wish I could say this is a very good movie, but I can't. First off in a fictional story like this you have to care about the characters, but I didn't. Partly because we don't really get to know much about them other than they are stranded on some sort of moon far away, one where adventurers go to mine a valuable gem inside living creatures in the ground. It is a close parallel to the old west when men went to mine silver and gold and got into various conflicts.A teenage girl and her dad have a disabled space shuttle and need to find a way home. So much of the movie is slow, having them explore, and encounter a couple of bands of strange people. At the end we have the mandatory gunfight.There are a few really positive reviews of this movie, I can only think they are put here by people with a personal connection to the movie because compared to most good movies this one would come it at about 3, 4 or 5.I could NOT recommend it to anyone.

In fact, I would include this movie among other films like Arrival, Ex Machina, Blade Runner 2049, Edge of Tomorrow, Lucy, and Predestination, all of which are a part of the thought provoking story /theme /character-driven science fiction film renaissance we've been enjoying over the last several years.

I was constantly playing catchup as to who these people were, why they were there and what they were after. This left it hard for me to relate to the characters. What they were after (some sort of gem/plant extract) just did not make any sense and was a little hard to swallow. The script overall was rather poorly done but may have been butchered by budget.Despite its flaws the acting was often brilliant, I was especially impressed by seventeen year old Sophie Thatcher. This stunning young actress gave a very believable performance as cool headed sidekick to her father who had lived a rather tough life.What makes this film exceptional is how small a story this is. This is not Luke Skywalker trying to save the galaxy. This is very much an End-of-The-Road' kind of story. A father and daughter who are broke, indebt, one step away from being dead or worse.

WellsThe title of this unusually smart and humane Sci-Fi called Prospect echoes the wild West of American lore. It is about mining for valuable gems in the forest of a distant moon at the edge of the galaxy. A young woman, Cee (Sophie Thatcher) is sidekick for her dad, Damon (Jay Duplass) as they land to do some contract mining. Not all goes as planned because, like the old West, bad critters abound.While she ends up in a survival adventure with a rogue mercenary, Ezra (Pedro Pascal), debut writer/directors Christopher Caldwell and Zeek Earl hammer out a thriller Butch and Sundance would have approved but without humor. There are other mercenaries looking to mine for the gem, and the struggle gets tough without the gore, say, of Alien. This is lo-fi with little dazzling hardware and much human weakness.Because Prospect is more fiction than science, the growing trust between Cee and her new dad is the magnetizing foundation of the drama, a deftly drawn relationship that sees for Cee survival as a mature reliance on sympathy and trust rather than cynicism and conflict. The arc is slow for her after she bridles her survival instincts-just the right tempo to learn about her and Ezra's characters.Besides being a fascinating amalgam of roughness and insight, Ezra speaks in a smoothly stilted style evocative of an Eton don or an Elizabethan business man. The film is worth seeing just to listen to his high-toned sentences that are yet basic common sense. He would have been a perfect companion to the prospectors of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.What makes science fiction such a valuable part of our culture is that it can traffic in all kinds of imaginative tricks and dreams and still give valuable insight into the human psyche. In Prospect, the real prospect or future wealth, if you will, is in cooperation devoid of greed, or rather just the smallest amount of avarice to give energy to the proceedings.Prospect can stand alongside my favorite Sci-Fi's like 2001 and Forbidden Planet, maybe not as majestic but just as insightful into human ambition and humanity.

A lot of work was done in creating a realistic environment, and that helped the film become believable in the mind of the viewers. The pacing was also well done, very balanced. The characters had quirks and language gaps that added to the believibility of the environment and made the world feel new and fresh in my mind.I was concerned that story might devolve into a dark outcome for the main character, but I was pleasantly surprised where the writers went with it, which was hopeful. I would go so far as to say I was tricked into a line of dark thinking based on the subject matter and the ambiance of the story in the beginning of the film.I also wanted to say that I was compelled to write a review of this film and I rarely write reviews. I really care about films that take this much care and time for developing their craft from all aspects of film making.You will want to see this film if you are a serious science fiction film goer. It's on the level of the Riddick films."}, {"id": 220, "text": "Had moderate expectations and they delivered a moderate movie. Good effort for a first feature. Script had problems from the get go though and the film becomes unfocused and hard to follow in the second and third act, again because of script problems. Performances other than Pascal are pretty middle of the road. Never really cared for any of the characters enough to have a stake, except briefly in the second act. Ambiguity can be powerful, but here it's just unsatisfying. Not sure where the 4 million budget went on this one. The credits are long for something so incredibly simple and what was achieved on screen and in post has a nice sense of atmosphere, but still feels like a half hatched student film. The sound design never really achieves suspension of disbelief and it kind of fails the film, as well as the mix is a bit muddy. The main problem for me was the nonsense sci-fi business the actors do. It mostly makes the film feel dated. That stuff was fine for audiences 20-50 years ago, and can still work in the right context, here it calls attention to itself and pops holes in the world of the film. This nonsense and jargon doesn't have any base or ground in science fact and in a film that takes itself so seriously just comes off as silly. The confluence of this all becomes disjunct right off the bat in the first minutes of the film; the writer director team should have done more science homework to at least cushion viewers with basic science knowledge. A few sequences in this film really work before the line goes slack again, so Hope they keep at it and try again."}, {"id": 221, "text": "So I decided to watch this movie based on the most helpful reviews on this site. The top 10 most helpful reviews rated this 6 and up. All I can say is what the heck were these people thinking? I read a lot of the good reviews and I will say I understand why people said they liked it. Apparently a lot of these people liked the slowness of the film, but I honestly felt like this movie was just too slow. I don't like much action myself, but this was extremely slow and it almost felt forced to be that slow. A lot of people said they liked the focus on the different planet, but it really wasn't that different than earth. I mean I saw a bunch of trees and ferns, earth has trees and ferns too. My biggest complaint (besides the slowness) was all the new gadgets and technology that was thrown in and not explained. It all looked cheap and we had no idea what most of it was or what it's purpose was. Ok I knew the gun was a gun, but it looked like they just took a bunch of garden tools and threw them together. If your going to introduce us to new technology (even if it looks cheap) at least explain to us what the things do! It didn't feel like any of it connected well. At one point I honestly thought the movie was just for people on drugs. I understand what people liked about it, but I didn't like any of those things. It sounds to me like there's no sure way to predict if you will like this movie or not, but if you can't stand a slow movie, you should definitely avoid this one!"}, {"id": 222, "text": "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.While the movie doesn't have top tier actors, you'll recognize some faces / voices if you pay attention.This movie does a lot with a low budget, and, most of all, it properly builds an atmosphere that makes you feel what the characters are going through on an inhospitable planet. The story exemplifies how dangerous it is to be in space, putting the weight of survival heavy on the story.The story itself is wonderfully complex: a contentious alliance between enemies with the goal of survival / escape.I really enjoyed this, even if the planet itself is a little weird."}, {"id": 223, "text": "The beginning is very promising. you're let to believe you're going to watch a good movie. the setting is well crafted, the photography is ok, you feel like you're going to get the answers that start popping up in your mind watching these 2 people doing apparently random things on a space ship. it's incredible how quickly it all collapse into nothing. all the genuine sci-fi curiosity that's grown into you about this weird planet and the business humans have do do on it, evaporate when carachters shoot one another like it's a western movie from the 30s. and you immediately find out the screenplay doesn't have any story to tell, at all. the girl ends up wandering in the woods without knowing where she's going just like you don't know where the movie is going. what appears to be them main plot line takes abrupt bumps that detour it into random scenes where new characters you don't know anything about talk about random deals that should bail out some meaning for the plot. with no result. Just like when you think something that was thrown to your attention before is going to get an explanation or develop into something meaningful, the plot detours again into new characters and new deals that end up in another ridiculously poorly shot shooting scene (pardon me). the characters, instead of being the pillars above whom a screenplay builds a story by developing their relationships (like in any good movie), here are dull, flat, empty, interchangeable puppets that stumble one over the other all the time with the aim of hiding the complete lack of inventive for a story line. dialogues are made irritatingly uncromphensible by the insertion of some random vocabulary that like anything else in this movie never get any explanation. the other faults of the movie are also very apparent, but have to do mostly with the fact that this is a low budget movie - so they're excusable (for example the ridiculous weapons that look taken from Willi Wonka). If you want to save something from this movie, you might probably pick the acting which is above par compared to the rest, and a couple of scenes where something in the popular tradition of sci fi is 'quoted' and used effectively (like the mercs using bad music as a torture tool - which recalls back to the future). but that's really it. bad sci-fi, but bad filmaking first. Don't know how this movie managed to get so many good reviews. it has all the faults a low budget movie has to avoid."}, {"id": 224, "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.Prospect (2018) is a very strange movie. Strange in a sense that it was not badly made at all and i liked acting by both leads (Pedro P. was the reason i picked up this movie in a first place), set design was also pretty descent, but on the other hand - what was going on in the first place? Were was the place were we action took place? What is the time? What happened? Why did this all was going on? I like sci-fi movies which raises questions, but Prospect did not raised them - while the main story line is very easy to follow, the movie needed to explain a bit to its viewers place and time of it all. Without it, movie lost me to be involved, and only solid acting by two leads saved it from beeing boring as hell.Overall, i'm a fan of sci-fi movies, and Prospect isn't a bad one, but its biggest flaw is that it does not explain or at least hint on the world it takes place. I had no clue what was going on, and its not a good thing for a movie in general."}, {"id": 225, "text": "Interesting...

Paint it however you like men are always the same.Weird punishment.Creative low budget idea."}, {"id": 226, "text": "In this film, there are three plans which can be assessed separately that in many ways work against each other. First, the acting and the actors. Although Sophie Thatcher wears a space-suit most of the time, she's quite easy on the eyes. Honesty this forces me to note that, as a middle-aged man, I would have probably stopped watching this movie if Sophie Thatchers character Cee wasn't there. In all actuality I'm being a bit dishonest - the acting in the film is generally great; I don't mean only miss Thatcher, the other characters are also very believable and amazingly well played. Yes, at times the dialogue sucks, especially for people outside the Anglo-American cultural space. Some moments of alienation emerged as a result - even in a vastly distant future the characters are still able to emit some third-rate US commercial TV debris out of their mouths... But these are little things. Anyway a great job! Content - Western. Although most people grow out of stories about how different companies of people climb around lawless outskirts and embezzle loot from each other, there is nothing wrong with such stories in itself. Certainly, I do not want to undermine the genre. But if I do want to watch a western I choose the most atypical one I can find, much like this movie. Third plan - Sci-Fi. It sucks royally. Or lets say otherwise - it's always possible to make a comedy or a parody. But let's decide! Yes, there are some pretty fun movies-series where a stupid story is put in the middle of the 60's sci-fi mumbo-jumbo; where characters in colorful jumpsuits jump on cliffs made of cardboard in a studio, and everything from the huge moons to purple flowers are so genuinely fake that it can't be taken in any other way than a joke. Rocket-powered Caterpillar might have been a tough word in the 70s, but nowadays, there are more electronics and better controls on an excavator than the world's first joystick stolen from a museum or a Pre-World War II microscope. It's just unbearably silly. The planet itself... well, you're still in Kansas. The yellow-orange filter and the giant planets projected into the sky get the job done briefly, but in a matter of minutes the same thing will become disturbing - how cheap and lacking in fantasy! Yes, if the story is good you can forgive the makers - you can't demand that the filmmakers have any clue about science, technology, and even science-fiction, and maybe there was no money for CGI or for hiring someone who knows at least something... In conclusion - a relatively good story and performance with a likeable protagonist in the strikingly stupid background."}], "reviews_amount": 227}
