The journey our characters took to create the film was lots fun, i sympathized with the struggle they went through and loved how the coincidence with Mr. Orabi was a factor for their film to be created, not everything in life is planned. The comedy was good, i laughed a lot and enjoyed the comedy that came from the characters themselves specially Mr. Orabi and Maan were really funny characters and actors . There were couple of sequences beautifully shot and edited and it gave me a thrill, the camera work in general was fantastic. The throw back to the original Saudi YouTube programs like EyshElly and 15 to 9 who made an actual cameo was hilarious, I couldn't believe they brought back Mohammed Bazaid! the guy made a company like 6 years ago and disappeared. i liked how they used the bad language as people are actually using and they did not try to make the dialog looks clean as we usually do in movies/TV series yet the language wasn't that bad. Also the animation scenes were really nice addition to represent what's going on in Hussam's mind, loved it. From the story point of view i wished I'd spent more time with the characters before Mr. Orabi's accident happens specially with Orabi himself, i wanted to hate him and laugh at him more before he joins the team lol . I loved the ending, their film was crap and they knew it but their passion was true and they kept developing, until one day they reach to the level they will accept as a critics, to themselves. I should give Baraa Alem a credit for his performance as he showed a good acting and emotional range for his first role that made him the true star of the movie, i hope we see more of him and wish him best luck in his new career.The down sides for me that sometimes the events were a little bet messy specially during the shooting of the film scenes. The voices were not clear in some shots.In general it was a funny enjoyable movie, i had a blast watching &amp; experiencing it and time flew by, worth the time and the money and what a come back to cinemas after these dreadful months. I'll definitely watch it again."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Loved the movie, the whole movie was so reflective of our society and of the things that touched and affected us in our most sensitive youth.

I already had faith in the team behind this movie but to not be disappointed I lowered my expectations and as you can see from the title of this review they definitely delivered.The movie was balanced in all its aspects in my opinion. Most of the jokes landed well, the shots were highly Stylized but not too flashy, the conflict between the characters was acted and delivered without exaggeration. The whole concept of the movie any saudi can relate to it especially the school and everything happened in it and I liked that.I'm so happy to see this kind of production coming out from where I live. We have been waiting for a long time to see movies made here in Saudi Arabia.

I must confess that each scene is reasonably realistic simulating how high school student's lives as we as the pressure they face due to deciding what to do next after finishing school. it indicates of of the critical part in someone's life whether to advancing higher education that secures your futuristic life and be with the flow as other people normally do or simply do what you like and accept the reality when consequences pouring to your face. the shooting was really up to standards and the ost was coming between 2009 to 2011 which was innovative.

Indeed, they have a brilliant future in film production and the field of cinema, especially with the development of the Kingdom and its interest in the cinematic field. Acting is okay with time. Development comes as the character of the Arab teacher, the actor Suhaib Qudas is the best character in the film. In some situations, the comic side was familiar with the sense of humor about myself. I enjoyed it and it attracted me and drew my attention to the emergence of well-known programs such as What I, Luqaimat, and Muhammed Bazid's Return I did not like the large number of profanity words.

I wasn't very excited to see the movie fearing that it would be similar to other national projects that are cliched or cinge-worthy. But after actually seeing the movie I realized that it's nothing like any other Saudi project I'm very proud and delighted by this experience.The movie follows the path of a high school kid (Hossam) who is passionate about movies, a passion he shares with his physics teacher (Orabi) and his peers. The group decides to kick off their career and make use of Hossam editing and directing skills by filming a horror movie Shams al-maarf. Throughout their journey they encounter the difficulties of having dreams and working to achieve them in an environment that is not supportive to say the least.What I mostly loved about the movie is how relevant it is, everyone can relate to it in one way or another, but its relevance doesn't affect how well thought the story is. The performance of the actors was great, this is the first time that I see Bara'a acting and he didn't disappoint, I was a bit concerned that Sohayb performance might be over the top sometimes like in six windows in the desert but it wasn't, he did a great job portraying the middle aged teacher who still feels like a kid once reminded of his dreams. The soundtracks used in the movie were beautiful, I enjoyed that almost all of them were original and in the Saudi dialect. Finally I really appreciated that the movie is not trying to be something it's not, not imitating other projects and trying to find its own style and uniqueness.Shams Al-maarf is definitely a turning point for me to believe again in Saudi filmmakers, it's a movie that I would enjoy watching again and again."}, {"id": 109, "text": "The Book of Sun is both a high school coming-of-age comedy and a film about guerrilla filmmaking, and it nails it in both areas. The story is very entertaining from start to finish and invokes an atmosphere I have enjoyed in films like Bowfinger and The Disaster Artist without actually being anything like either films. Here is a film that was truly made for the local sensibility and very true to that, yet I believe would be a smashing success has it been given the chance to play internationally. The filmmaking is very well done, and the camera shots are smart and dynamic without being flashy. The filmmakers smartly imploys music, animations, outdoors shoots, and camera flourishes in service of telling a really good story. Set in 2010, it would have been a tall order recreating that time and place in a country with little infrastructure and expertise to pull that off, but the filmmakers managed to do that on a budget that must have been modest, and used the limitations to double down on the DIY atmosphere of a high school kids with talent and passion trying to make a movie in an atmosphere that was anything but supportive. There is a high level of situational comedy, and the cast who consists of mainly unprofessional and unseasoned young actors really delovered on the jokes. Baraa Alem, playing Hosam the aspiring filmmaker, is very good in delivering a wide range of emotions between the drama and the comdey. He is the straight man in this mayhem. The stakes are high for him, because his future is on the line, and the pressure is high on him to succeed in school to become what his family and society deem a successful man, even if it means abandoning his passion for filmmaking which he is clearly good at. The supporting team lead by Sohayb Godus, Ahmad Sadam, and especially Ismail Alhassan truly deliver on the comedy in a big. If Baraa Alem's Hosam is the brain here, Ismail Alhassan's Ma'an his best friend is the beating heart of the gang. There are many funny gags that I believe should not be spoiled, and I feel they are ripe for repeat viewing. Not only the film is great, even the film within a film is the kind of shlock horror films I would totally watch and enjoy. This is in no way a perfect movie. If I have to say where it could have been improved, I would say the plot is predictable and the film would have been better off cut to 100 to 105 min instead of 2 hours. That said, it still is a very impressive effort considering it's the debut feature film of Godus Brothers. It is one of the rare times that I don't have to qualify my enjoyment by saying it's a good enough for a Saudi film, and instead I think it's a film that could stand on its own merits and represent us everywhere and not be graded on a curve, which might be the highest praise I can grant the film."}, {"id": 110, "text": "6 stars is really what I think about this movie, actually If I compare it with the rest of SAUDI movies and TV shows it would be the best, 10 stars without thinking, but comparing to worldwide cinema, 6 stars is fair enough. First I'd start with what I didn't like about the movie cons:1- Really much use of bad language! I know they try to make the movie look much of Saudi real society life but this bad language is too much! Even with my closest friends I wouldn't say that, I don't know about Jeddah society since I'm from Al-Qassim but I don't think any SAUDI society would approve and accept that much use of bad language, and even 13+ movie wouldn't handle that much bad language2- Too much outside references, people who don't know anything about directing/producing/designing would not understand/enjoy the movie, especially with lack of local movies we have, you would expect a lot of tastes and genres to see this movie so most of the audience wouldn't get the whole movie story3- (not major thing) The movie supposed to be in 2010 but I notice a fair enough 2010+ stuff like Windows 10 in some computers4- Since cinema is new thing to us I'd prefer if they respect some of Saudi values so they can have much audience to support them, despite the bad language, smoking and drugs references is too much for 13+ movie and for a society like Saudi, there's a lot of mocking of some saudi values I didn't appreciate it honestly, for a beginning of Saudi filmmaking, they have to have some respect of our values to have more support.5- Classical representation of a dominating/commanding mother, weak/insecure father and perfect/beloved-by parents-sibling, all teen local and worldwide shows used that representation of a family.6- The script is too replicated and predictable sometimes you get bored with it. Now for the pros:1- Directing is so good, the image is always moving and not still you hardly can get bored2- Some actors are really good they surprised me with their acting, especially Sohaib with Orabi character, I knew him for a YouTube Top 5 show but I didn't know he could act like that good, you have also Hussam I knew him from a channel in YouTube and I noticed there that he has a career in acting and it was a good thing to see his first role in a Saudi movie, other main characters were meh, you really feel they acting the acting, but they have a good chance in acting career3- Storyline was pretty predictable but in same time was a little bit good.4- The movie took us to more than one place in Jeddah which made me feel that it's really vivid and make me take a different look to what the other sides of Jeddah is.5- using animation to represent Hussam ideas was a really good move, I really liked it!Finally, for a beginning, it was really good movie! And I can't wait to see how local filmmaking would be in future"}, {"id": 111, "text": "First, I must admit that I had long gave up on Arab movies, but this movie was like a new blood flow in the cinematic Arabic content. I LOVED LOVED every scene of it, the comedic timing, the efforts behind every scene, and how relatable the characters are. I feel like les effets comiques are gonna be a thing that gonna stay in the Arab youths' mind for years to come, at least in our house. I'm gonna scream tortai3a every time I feel endangered or my siblings crack a silly joke. Ismail Hassan was very fine and could get me to lol in every scene he is in especially the tortai3a ones. Baraa is my crush from his youtube videos and loved him even more here. Arabi or Sohaib had a great arc from his silliness and belief of the greatness of his acting to his emotional scenes. I'm pretty sure I'm emotional in this review but what's more wholesome than a very entertaining, joyful, yet relatable, and a movie minak fik. Loved it, more power to the creators. Keep entertaining us with such out of the box realistic, and funny projects. P.S: Baraa keep ur beard for the next projects, it's more of an eye candy. I can hear u screaming tortai3a, but don't worry I'm a girl :)"}], "reviews_amount": 112}
