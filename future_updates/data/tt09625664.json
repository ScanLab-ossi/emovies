{"name": "Trauma Center", "titleId": "tt09625664", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "Okay movie. The female lead Madison was great. Her acting was great, the things she did in the movie were smart and believable so her character was written well. The actor who played pierce however was weak. Tulls portrayed a believable dirty cop. Bruce Willis man this is hard to write bc I am a true fan, but he slurred his words and appeared drunk in most of his scenes. Unfortunately this movie is only 5/10 bc it has a weak storyline (dirty cops shoot good cops with their police gun) so the bad guys were a bit too dumb. They should have added 10 more mins to the film to give it more background/depth and it could have been a great movie. It's still worth watching. I was entertained throughout and actually watched the whole thing without getting distracted. Better than most Netflix films."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Slick shots and the slow build up of atmosphere turn a mundane hospital into something threatening and scary for the heroine. Bruce's character wasn't needed but I get why he's in it. Otherwise, the story kept my attention and was done well as a single location thriller. 5/10 for me."}, {"id": 2, "text": "If you overlook Bruce Willis talking very strangely this Puerto Rico based thriller is an okay TV movie. After witnessing a cop getting killed a pretty waitress played by Niki Whelan gets shot in the leg and is sent to the hospital. The bad cops who shot her go after her and it's a watchable game of cat and mouse in the hospital. Things get a bit too much for one woman."}, {"id": 3, "text": "This movie is OK but Bruce Willis' acting is very ham. I have no idea why all of a sudden he seems to have lost the ability to portray a believable character.Apart from that, Nicky Whelan carries this movie from start to finish with superb acting. Unfortunately, the story is a bit sparse in depth.OK to watch if it comes on telly, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see this again."}, {"id": 4, "text": "The story has been told many times and the script is simplistic, bordering on clich\u00e9s - but with some deft direction, camerawork and a great lead actress to anchor it all, it gels nicely into a tight 80 min thriller. Don't expect a Bruce Willis star vehicle, he's not in much and probably would have done without but that's not how these movies get made. The Puerto Rico vibe added some fresh environments to it as well. Overall, I'd say this was a decent thriller that hits all the right notes for a bread and butter genre fare."}, {"id": 5, "text": "After the film kicks off in the hospital, there is really no stopping. It became almost unbearable at the end, nearly reaching the point of overkill. When you have a thriller filled with so much tension throughout its running time, there's only so much you can do before you start yelling you gotta be kidding me at the screen.The cinematography was beautiful and moody and the performances were fine, except maybe Bruce, who I felt was too wooden, making his character a little bit unlikable.Trauma Center was a solid effort and a great addition to the chase/thriller genre with a little twist."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Matt Eskandari's Trauma Center is another example of those quickie Bruce Willis' VOD releases that clocks in at 87 minutes. This somewhat entertaining suspense thriller, however, features a splendid performance by Australian actress Nicky Whelan as a woman in jeopardy. She is the heart and soul of Trauma Center. Madison Taylor (Nicky Whelan of Inconceivable) witnessed a crime, and two corrupt Vice cops, Pierce (Tito Ortiz of Cradle 2 the Grave) and Tull (Texas Battle of Hard Kill), wind up stalking her at the local hospital. Madison is awaiting surgery to have a bullet removed from her thigh. Pierce wounded her in the thigh during a shooting incident behind the restaurant where she works as a server. Pierce and Tull are desperately struggling to clean up their mess once they have murdered Bruce Willis' partner.Neither Pierce nor Tull cannot put Madison out of their misery because Lieutenant Steve Wakes (Bruce Willis of Die Hard) arrives like the heroic cavalry. He sends these two thugs packing with several pistol shots, but he cannot identify them because the shooting occurs at night. Now, the screws come loose in Trauma Center, because the only doctor on duty (a bespectacled Steve Guttenberg of Police Academy) at the Puerto Rico Hospital where Madison winds up says they have no surgeons on call to remove the slug. Pierce and Tull slip into the hospital and spend about 45 minutes tracking down our beleaguered heroine. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Wakes is off elsewhere trying to solve the crime and about to discover something more surprising that he thought. Little does Wakes know Pierce and Tull were involved in the murder of his partner. Indeed, as a measure of safety, Wakes has confined Madison to a floor on the hospital designated for infectious diseases, and he has stationed a uniformed officer, Jacobs (newcomer Jonathan Galanis) to watch over Madison. This character might as well have bullseye painted on his forehead. You know he won't be around long. Indeed, Pierce and Tull have no problem disposing of Jacobs, but Madison proves to be a major headache for these two trigger happy killers. Their chief problem with Madison isn't that she has seen their faces. Instead, when Pierce wounded her, he put a bullet in her that can be ballistically traced back to his pistol on file at the police department!Eskandari and sophomore writer Paul Da Silva milk the suspense factor for everything it's worth as Madison tries to fend off these fiends. Naturally, Wakes is away from the hospital trying to take care of business, while Tull and Pierce tangle with Madison. Considering her dire circumstances, Madison is pretty damned heroic herself and relies on her ingenuity to save herself. Predictably, she is trapped on a hospital floor where nobody other than the defunct Jacobs has been murdered while our villainous scour every nook and cranny for her. Preposterously enough, Madison resorts to climbing up into and crawling through the air conditioner vent to elude them. This amounts to nothing more than a delaying tactic. Earlier, Eskandari and Da Silva set up a situation that they pay off after Madison finds herself stuck in the hospital. It seems her impressionable teenage sister, Emily (Catherine Davis of The Truth About Lies), suffers from asthma, and she visits her big sister at the restaurant where she has an asthma attack, but she forgot to bring her inhaler! Emily winds up in the hospital, and Madison refuses to spend the night with her scared sister. Naturally, when Tull-the thinking one of the pair-learns about Emily, he decides to use the teen as a bargaining chip. The action gets rather lively during the third quarter. Once the crooked cops catch Madison, they zip tie her to a friction board and use a defibrillator on her to loosen her tongue. Eventually, she returns the favor. The cat and mouse game of survival that Madison plays with Pierce and Tull qualifies as the high point of this boilerplate thriller.Trauma Center has enough moments to make the grade. Although Bruce Willis appears in it, Nicky Whelan has the choice role and her example of empowered womanhood stands out. Let's not overlook the villainous duo played by Texas Battle and Tito Ortiz. You will hate them by the time Trauma Center runs out of trauma."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Shot in just a short time frame, the filming was actually good. The story was predictable but entertaining. I simply could not get past the poor acting of Bruce Willis! I love him as an actor, ever since Moonlighting on TV. He was just emotionally absent, his voice stilted and monotone. In no way, shape or form believable. Steve Guttenberg as the Dr. was also a disappointment. These are veteran actors that we expect to sell the character they portray and neither of these actors delivered. Even in a lower budget movie, you expect these actors to deliver a great performance of their character. Nicky Whelan actually carried the movie and kept you determined to try and finish it. I've watched many movies repeatedly, this will not be one of them. Don't pay to watch it, wait for it to be free somewhere on TV and only if there is nothing else to watch."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Its highly enjoyable with a few fun chase sequences and some decent action but it takes two steps backwards in its simple script. Still worth watching but lacks the charm it could have needed to go over the top."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Decent acting, great camerawork and at 85 minutes the pacing is brisk. For what it is, it's actually one of Bruce's better recent action/thriller programmers. Granted the lead actress carries the show. It's mostly about her suspenseful and tense chase from the bad guys who are after her inside the hospital."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Very catchy story, several nail biting moments waiting for the shock that nearly knocked me off the couch, but this is by far THE most awkward acting from Bruce's side, felt the character were misplaced compared to many of the past great movies he attended / roles he played. Where'd the spark go?. However it won't change the way I see Bruce as a God talented actor."}, {"id": 11, "text": "(Trauma center) Positives - * Good Low budget Thriller * Decent cast * Good enough Acting * You get what the movie title says, nothing more nothing lessNegatives - * Could have done a better job with Bruce Willises characterOverall worth watching \ud83d\udc4d"}, {"id": 12, "text": "I like it, there is tension in the movie. Bros vilis is not in it best, but still the movie not so bad."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Don't waste any of life's precious minutes on this loser show."}, {"id": 14, "text": "This would have to be the worst Bruce Willis film I've ever seen in my entire life half the time while he's trying to act he sounds like he's on drugs and spaced out or acting like he's slow or something. He seems to be on something during the filming of this movie because it is completely different to a lot of his other acting and its absolutely bloody terrible. The amount Of plot holes are unbelievable And some of The situations this film portrays are so far-fetched and downright ridiculous. If I can stop one person from watching this film that would be a Small success! You can watch anything else that's out at the moment and I can guarantee you it would be 100 times better than this garbage movie . It's such a shame because this could've been a Great film And done so much better but clearly they're trying to Cruise through dropping certain names on this film when clearly it's a money grab and hopefully they won't get rewarded for such a bad script"}, {"id": 15, "text": "WHAT happened to Bruce Willis and his acting?! This was a disaster from start to finish."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Comes across mostly as a clever low-budget thriller with a brilliant set-up which almost works but is ultimately let down by a flawed execution. The drama of this main event starts off well and the lead actress Nicky really delivers a stellar performance, but the terrific scenes of suspense are undone by inexplicable plot contrivances or wooden acting. Flaws aside this is a good, solid movie, it has just the right running time and plenty of suspense. Worth a watch if you can overlook the inconsistencies."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Took down a glass of ice cold bourbon and sat down to watch this with no expectations. A simple but compelling premise which obviously harkons to die hard in a type scenarios. From a technical standpoint the movie is very competently designed. Stylish camera moves, NO annoying shaky cam or constant fast editing that destroys so many of these low budget action thrillers. The single location was well utilized to maximized effect.The director elevated the look/tone and style in a great way. The acting was decent as well, Nicky as the heroine being the standout. Bruce is playing Bruce(John McClaine) as usual but nothing of standout from him here. The major weakness was from the script, it works as a boilerplate chase thriller but needed a couple more surprising twists or turns. I almost expected Bruce might even turn out to be a villain but that never happens. A missed opportunity imo. Otherwise, this is worth a watch if you want something tense, suspenseful and unexpectedly well crafted. 6.5/10"}, {"id": 18, "text": "The film starts of bad and only gets worse. Terrible story, shoddy directing and a actor who has forgotten how to act.The final straw for me is at the point when one of the police officers just realises he's lost a micro SD card. It is the biggest load of drivel I have ever seen."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Not a bad movie overall, well worth the watch.Dropped a few stars because of some of the bad acting. Not sure what is going on with Bruce Willis, but it's like he's forgotten how to act. I hope that he wasn't paid a lot for this movie, his performance almost wrecked it. Shame on you Bruce. He wasn't the only actor having issues."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I think some of the reviewers are being a bit harsh. I was surprised by this movie. Yes, it is still a lower budget movie, but what they did with it, elevated it. The acting wasn't that bad, especially from the main lead actress she really showed a ton of range. The production and cinematography were very good, providing for a very suspenseful settings, and at times creepy surroundings in the hospital. It had a GREAT soundtrack that help elevate the suspense. My only complaint throughout this movie was the Bruce character. Was he needed? No... but I doubt this movie gets made without him. He's only in 15 minutes so not a big deal.If you are a big fan and follower of Bruce skip this, but if you like tense suspenseful thrillers this is a movie you want to see."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Trauma Center is definitely a B budget film. Truly the only redeeming part of the movie is the acting of Nicky Whalen. The rest of the cast were painful to watch and Bruce Willis was at the level of Steve Guttenberg, which is just sad to even type. I'm not sure if it was the writing, the directing, or just his I don't give a dang approach to movies anymore...but it was painful to watch. He used to be a favorite of mine but lately...no.The overall premise of the movie is good, but lots of ridiculous portions of the film that caused it to be unbelievable. The main character spends the movie trying to avoid the bad guys but the entire time she is about the loudest person trying to escape...and also goes between doing the dumbest stuff to being really smart at the flip of a switch.Big plot gaps include things like she's bleeding profusely but no blood trail is ever on the floor for the bad guys to follow; The good cop knows she has a sister in the hospital but never puts her under protection or checks in with her; bullet isn't removed from her leg in the ER but is planned to be done the next day; SD card drops from a pocket and is noticed missing (you aren't going to feel that drop out of your pocket).If you can ignore the major issues, and the bad acting, it's not a complete waste of time on a rainy day. But it better be a last option in my opinion."}, {"id": 22, "text": "How dumb are the vice cops / bad guys. At every turn they miss this woman, make the wrong decision.Movie would have been better and more believable if they aren't such idiots.The main actress is quite good. Lala from Vanderpump is in it, so that's funny. And Bruce Willis gives like a C+ effort performance.All in all, it being short, consumable, I'll give it a 5. Could have been higher with better bad guys."}, {"id": 23, "text": "It is truly unbelievable how this movie managed to get released. It is with all honesty really really bad. The acting was probably the biggest disappointment. While turning on this movie I didn't have many expectations. It was supposed to be the movie you play in the background while doing something else. But this movie could not even fulfill this role. It was cringe worthy and honestly just sad to look at."}, {"id": 24, "text": "The story is chase into the maze of the abandoned levels of a trauma center hospital. There isn't a lull in the action although, to be honest, the premise is fairly straight forward. That doesn't take away from going along for the ride. Madison Taylor (Nicky Whelan) is a struggling waitress trying to take care of her younger sister Emily (Catherine Davis) after their mother has passed. Taking a bullet to the leg she is rescued by Det. Steve Wakes (Bruce Willis).Willis pops up periodically as a policeman trying - and mostly failing - to keep Madison safe. But he ultimately proves to be a distraction from the scenes in the film that work best, in which the heroine tries to make use of the scant resources of an under-stocked medical facility to beat the bad guys and survive.Nothing crazy or surprising but it works as a well executed and tense action thriller."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Isn't not hard to jump into this one from the premise if a brisk/tense thriller is what you're after. It's got a well acted ensemble and of course Mr. Willis has small cameo as a grizzled Detective. Best parts are watching Nicky as the heroine doing her best to survive and fight back against the corrupt cops. Tito surprised me with how menacing he was. Impressive action and well shot cinematography for whats a smaller budget."}, {"id": 26, "text": "Trauma Center is hardly a perfect film as others have mentioned, there are plenty of things here that feel tacked on, implausible, or even ridiculous. But surprisingly, we find ourselves left with an impression of overall integrity and artistry which is quite the feat, considering the obvious low budget (12 day shoot schedule) and a number of otherwise un-subtle elements in the mix.Above-average cast, great character arc for the lead heroine and outstanding cinematography make this one stand out from the usual B movie action progammer fair. Making a single location thriller work take skills and that's on display here. Worth a stream."}, {"id": 27, "text": "This movie is badly made, all actors and actresses are not performing, they are just reading their lines. The movie is full of errors, flaws, contradictions and exaggerations. It seems like it was directed by 10 years old kid."}, {"id": 28, "text": "I'm a sucker for tense single location thrillers and this delivered everything in the genre. The acting from the cast all around was superb Bruce while not his top shelf self was better then expected for the few scenes he's in, the action is very well done and the pacing and atmosphere was top notch. Awesome seeing Nicky own every scene she's in and build up to end where she kicks the guys asses!"}, {"id": 29, "text": "But after making this film, just retire...It looks like you've forgotten how to act Bruce (not that you were a good actor anyway), and those idiot cops who can't even talk properly are just as bad.How can you pat your jacket and realise an SD card is lost? Ha! This film is a joke from start to finish. In fact, just as bad as those balloon lips on Madison's sister.OMG - dreadful, simply dreadful!"}, {"id": 30, "text": "Never gonna be an Oscar winner but an easy watch to stick on with the parents.Bruce Willis has a bit of a strange accent at times and acts a bit wooden but you let him off because it's him!Nicky whelan is very easy on the eye but at times her actions are not believable.Some of the writing is poor and at times it's very cliche. Got a home alone vibe to it!"}, {"id": 31, "text": "This is another recent Bruce Willis makes a cameo action/thriller flick, but a definite notch above many of his other films, at least in production values. The photography and acting from the main actress is above par and shows some range from scared to emotional breaking down. The direction is tight and I lked the score also. Anyway, it's fairly low-brow entertainment, but at least it is entertaining and fun to watch."}, {"id": 32, "text": "No shaky cam, no fast cuts, just a great build of tension and suspense and solid pacing. Nicky as the main lead really owns this and kept me engaged as she slowly comes through it as weak/scared and then into a badass. One of those thrillers you can watch and just enjoy. Well done all around."}, {"id": 33, "text": "Bruce willis was definitely not into this part and was merely reading the script, one of his worst acting jobs to date. Why signup if your not willing to get into the part!"}, {"id": 34, "text": "In terms of action, and hence entertaining, it delivers. The film uses a limited setting and a limited timeframe for its story, not many nonsense distractions, it's rather straight to the point about a girl on the run from a gang of corrupt cops. That's what I personally like in action thrillers.Of course, the story is simple, characters not complex and dialogues rather basic, but who watches a film like this for that? What do some people expect here, Shakespeare?You want something simple that won't win Oscars, just to sit back and relax, then you could do a lot worse.Normally I would give it a very solid 5, but now a 6 it is."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Loved this, felt like a breeze at 80min, Nicky was a badass and I wanted even more from her. Stylized and the best sequence has to be when the lights go out and it's flashing!"}, {"id": 36, "text": "Was Bruce Willis broke and was forced to do this? Bad or there was no director doing this movie. This movie deserves to be trashed forever."}, {"id": 37, "text": "From script to acting to directing, hard to choose what was worse."}, {"id": 38, "text": "The story is pretty damned stupid. A massive and all night chase inside closed floors of a hospital, by 2 burly, armed cops who can't outwit a slim young unarmed woman several times. Several people are killed including a policeman and a security guard and no-one seems to notice. The action is piecemeal and not very well directed, although you can't help feeling a bit of sympathy for the main character, Whelan. Bruce Willis is the 'hero' who's acting is absolutely 3rd rate. I was actually slightly ashamed for him, it was embarrassing to watch and I am sure that on many occasions he was reading his lines (badly) from a screen in view. This is a 3rd rate B movie which was probably just a payday movie for Willis. Oh how the mighty fall."}, {"id": 39, "text": "Imagination to use every single way to create tension through the movie in every single scene (once the action starts).The movie is short and doesn't try to do more than it should. And that's not a bad thing, and makes the movie really good, but also doesn't make it a 10.There are some twists (little twists), and the first one comes too early. The characters are beyond shallow, which again, it doesn't really matter, but could've used just a bit more depth. There is no point, really. Not even a thin one.What's the point of the movie? It's about something? Again, even a thin theme or idea?It's really good, but it's so shallow I can't consider this one more than that."}, {"id": 40, "text": "Did you loose a bet?

Didn't know a simple concept could keep me on the edge. The hospital was well shot and there was only a couple gory scenes.... when Madison had to perform surgery to remove her own bullet(ouch).

Granted, getting a few million dollars for just a few days of work would be tempting even to me. But after doing so many of these movies, Willis has severely damaged his reputation.This particular one (yet another by the prolific producing team of Randall Emmett and George Furla) is, I admit a little better than usual. Willis, for one thing, shows up for about ten minutes this time instead of his usual five minute limit. (Though he continues to use the same awful sleepwalking performance he uses for these quickie efforts.) Production values are also not bad for a movie where most of the budget had to be designated to pay Willis his exorbitant salary. And occasionally there is a little suspense.However, the movie is saddled with an incredibly dumb script, one that constantly brings up questions that are never answered as well as characters making incredibly stupid decisions. Do emergency doors really have internal locks that can make escaping from a building impossible? Why wasn't the entire hospital alerted when the fire alarm was activated? Why didn't any other security guards arrive after the security guard radioed to his command the request to send more security guards? Why did the heroine just stop at calling Willis' character when she got to a phone instead of calling other avenues of help? Why didn't she use the Internet on the computer to send the contents of the memory chip to the authorities?I could go on and on for quite some time illustrating this movie's stupidity, but I think you've got the point by now.

(In fact, a number of the scenes intended to provoke tension just made me laugh.)There was so much that was ridiculously improbable. Here's just a very small sample. Why didn't Pierce and Tull go into Madison's room immediately after killing the guard? Why did they walk around acting as if they were confronting a dangerous person with lethal weapons as they pursued Madison when they knew she was unarmed? Why didn't Pierce ever wipe the blood from his cheek? Why was Madison apparently able to run faster with a bullet in her leg than were two fit police officers?

It looks like he's not even trying in pictures like this, and I've run across a few of them lately, like 10 Minutes Gone and Acts of Violence.

Here he's a detective who's partner is shot and killed after being set up by a couple of rogue cops from Vice within the same police department. Serpico would have had a field day.Only slightly better is Nicky Whelan in the lead role, she portrays a waitress who gets caught up in an alley shootout and takes a bullet to the thigh. Because the bad guys want to get at that bullet, they do an all out siege of a local hospital's seventh floor, closed down due to damage from a hurricane some time prior. Though some tense moments are allowed to build, you have to wonder how a person like Maddie Taylor has the smarts to attach a defibrillator to a metal door handle to shock one of her assailants. Not to mention that scene with the halon, or how she manages to stitch up her leg wound. Scumbag detective Pierce (Tito Ortiz) is no better, he shoots himself with a ricocheting bullet, is on the receiving end of Maddie's halon attack, and eventually gets shot by her to put the bad guys down by one.But the guy I have to admire in this story is Detective Tull. This is actor Texas Battle's (love that name!) second movie in a row in which he gets shot dead by Bruce Willis. Check out 10 Minutes Gone for the prior flick. He's in another one with Willis titled Hard Kill which I haven't seen yet, but if I were a betting man, I'd be thinking maybe three times the charm.

Nicky Whelan does a fine job as a resourceful waitress caught in a bad place. This appears to be low budget. I almost wonder if Willis did this as a donation to post-Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico recovery (where it was shot), on a percentage basis of gross. At the tail end of the credits, you see that the script is loosely based on real life events, but an internet search so far is not telling me what those events were, which is disappointing, as it could have explained Willis's character more.

Who were they going to blame for those murders?The acting is not great but to be fair the characters are so wooden that the actors had very little to work with. Bruce Willis as the good cop investigating the crime phones his performance in as he tends to do in most movies these days.

The main perpetrators are supposed to be Police officers and if their acting wasn't so bad it might have been amusing.The props department went all out to issue them with silencers sticking out of shoulder holsters and badges from a candy store.

Yeah I was a witness too. I witnessed one of the worst pics of 2019 in Trauma Center.

And have you ever taken in a Steve Guttenberg performance with two short scenes that scream acting 101? Trauma Center is that film and it makes hospital fodder like Coma, Halloween II, and John Q. seem like Citizen Kane in comparison.Trauma Center, with its muttered line deliveries by star Bruce Willis and its idle production values, feels like it was made by amateurs for amateurs. Director Matt Eskandari (who should know better) favors cue card, soap opera performing over capable casting. He also favors Michael Bay aerial shots over baseline camerawork. Finally, he favors short cut scripting over well, a decent script.Probably made feverishly on time and on budget (what budget you ask), Trauma Center's story involves a woman who witnesses two corrupt cops kill another cop. The woman (Madison Taylor played by Nicky Whelan) survives a gunshot wound and is taken to an isolation ward for her safety. Sadly, said cops know she is alive. They plan to find her, kill her, and take a piece of evidence she has that will implicate them in the murderous crime (the attestation is a bullet in her leg, hilarious).As a critic, I have a long-running rule. The rule is never give zero stars to a movie. Why? Because film-making is hard work and involves a lot of hard-working bodies. With Trauma Center's minuscule character development, bad consultation, and nonchalant way of short-changing the audience, I nearly broke that rule.

As for the continuity errors, there are so many to count, but my favorite is where the witness steps on a puddle of blood with her white sock and in the next scenes the bloodstain just disappears until a later point in the movie where it resurfaces as dirt, then to become a bloodstain again. Oh! and let's not forget about the memory card evidence they decide not to destroy initially and later lose the tiny card somehow, which is conveniently found by the victim on the run in a steam covered room. Characters are not plausible... a waitress (without any other kind of survival skill set) outwitting two professional killers every time... the two bad apples who are always acting like idiots and... a good cop (Bruce Willis) who sounds like a tough guy but appears to be nothing more than a pointless cameo as he is never in the main action line.

Crooked cops who cant shoot, have zero tactical knowledge, and do bunch of dumb stuff. The dumb starts off early when our incompetent duo fire a doz rounds at our victim, who is no longer visible. Maybe they had a grudge against that masonry wall, not sure. Crazy idea, walk down alley and cap your unarmed victim who is hiding behind cover. Having hit her once earlier, they are after the slug inside her, as it can be traced back to the crooked cop who fired it, because we all know when you're on a hit you carry your city issued piece. Bruce shows up and fires several times at the fleeing suspects. Totally illegal in America, but apparently not illegal in B movies.Later our victim is in hospital, in a secret room with police guard. Unfortunately not so secret that our killers find out and kill the incompetent guard. Our victim is crafty enough to escape. She steps in a big puddle of blood that she cant see for some reason. Shes wearing a sock or something on her foot but luckily doesnt make bloody footprints to her next hiding place. While barricaded inside she has idea to electrocute bad guys on other side with an AED. Fortunately for her, doors have a shockable cardiac rhythm, because it worked (AEDs only deliver a shock after recognizing V-fib, or VT without a pulse. Trust me, im a medic). Later we have another scene with a defib but i dont have time to get into difference between joules and volts. Our victim encounters another cop, but he is dramatically shot. For some reason our victim is not, even though shes 2 feet away. Again our villains dont even enter room, just shoot a but shoot bunch of rounds at unarmed victim. They finally get her and zip tie to bed. She manages to free herself buy cutting restraint with bad guys knife. Thats great for zip tie #2, but how was she able to get the knife as a sec earlier both hands restrained? Anyway instead of attacking our villain with the knife she chooses to electrocute him which wouldn't have worked in reality (see explanation above). This movie was weak.

Nicky Whelan also gives a damn about creating a compelling character that one can cheer for.The Bad...the corrupt cops played by Battle and Ortiz. The circumstances of why they have to chase down this waitress/witness is almost laughable. The two lunk heads clog around the entire film in moronic fashion. Battle attempts to portray a charismatic villain, but can't due to the fact that he has to lower his acting ability to balance out Ortiz. There are portions throughout this film where I thought these two guys were doing their best Three Stooges imitations.And Finally The Ugly.....Bruce Willis. Trauma Center is the 1st of a three picture deal that Willis signed with MoviePass film, however I can not find an exact figure for the deal. Hopefully MoviePass will get some acting out of Willis for the final two films of the contract. His supposed acting in this one was cringe worthy. I understand from reading about past film sets that Willis can be very difficult and it translates to I don't care performances, but he certainly takes it to another level in Trauma Center. I can almost bet that he never read the script, never studied his lines, sat in his plush trailer drinking and counting down the days till the end of the shoot.His performance comes across as someone who told Director Matt Eskandari that he (Willis) was obligated to do only one take and had his assistant (who was responsible for studying all of his lines) just off screen telling him his lines for the 1st time. No magic editing can fix that.Bruce Willis has never been thought of as a great thespian, but when the best performance that you can muster in Trauma Center is standing behind a shot up unmarked police car holding a gun in silence...the movie viewing public deserves better."}, {"id": 347, "text": "In Puerto Rico, the waitress Madison Taylor (Nicky Whelan) is dropping her garbage in a dumpster during the night when she witnesses the murder of a police detective by two men and is hit on the thigh.

However, she needs to spend the night in the hospital and goes to an empty floor under the protection of a police officer. But the two killers are indeed the corrupt cops Pierce (Tito Ortiz) and Tull (Texas Battle) and they will do anything to kill Madison and recover the bullet.The underrated Trauma Center is a tense and entertaining low-budget thriller. The plot is not an Oscar winner and has clich\u00e9s, but the film is not bad as many reviews indicate.

However, in my opinion, that doesn't tarnish other good parts of this flick.I really like thriller/horror films with a strong or clever female lead, the kind which the protagonist outsmarts the antagonist(s). This is it. She has a good hunch and makes good choices. I see why some people complain about the script. It is not great, but I could overlook most of it because I was concentrating on how the heroine cleverly managed to get out the situation. Towards the end, the script gets corny and cliched. Yes, it can be cringe worthy. The lead actress is not just pretty but also gave a convincing acting. She made me want to see her other works as well.If you can overlook Bruce's drunk acting and the stereotypical portrait of antagonists, instead focus on how the main character find a way to get back to villains despite her limited situation, you'll enjoy this movie.If you are seeking Bruce Willis's solid action, you don't find it here. In fact, he is not even adequate in this one. Maybe if you are open-minded and can laugh at his acting and corny dialog of some of the characters, that's one of the way to enjoy this film.This movie certainly kept my attention till the end.

Sure it was his first writing credit, but out of the almost 30 producers, you'd think at least one would've suggested a read-through by a seasoned screenwriter before going to action.The 87 min is normally a decent runtime, but to have that time in such a plot-riddled nonsense seen-it-many-times-before unnecessarily long dragged out scenes wannabe Die Hard in a hospital *finally takes a breath* story, made me begging for the ending many times.

What makes a thriller good? It's the suspense, the nail-biting, tense situations the film presents that have the audience at the edge of their seats at all times. The intimacy of the film is the main thing that makes it so fresh and interesting as a thriller, if it was taking place around a city or in a town it would not be half as suspenseful as having it all take place in a hospital. There's a couple great set pieces that use the location to its maximum. And the wonderful cinematography creates a frightful atmosphere for the audience to get engaged in.It did, on the other hand, make some clich\u00e9 plot developments. There are some moments that were so typical they took me away from a movie that was clearly trying to stand out, but was clearly forced by the studio to have some predictable plot points.Let's move on to the actors. Bruce sadly only has a few moments and he's dreadful to watch at this point in his career. There's flashes of his brilliance but its mostly late stage Marlon Brando syndrome where he looks like he's reading cue cards. Nicky carries the movie and her performance in this film was much more nuanced. You could see that she was a much more complex character.

I mean he was never going to be an Oscar winner, but he was able to be extremely watchable and usually in some pretty good films. In 'Trauma Centre' you could be forgiven for thinking he had a stroke the day before filming. His line delivery was appalling (and it wasn't exactly great dialogue he was working with to start off). I wondered whether he was trying to put on an accent or something, but I don't think he was. It was very off-putting and what should have been a strength of the film turned into a massive negative.I felt sorry for Nicky Whelan because she was giving it her all here. She was the bright light of the film and made what would've otherwise been a pretty unwatchable film bearable. There are a few reasonably well recognised actors attached to this project which makes me think the film probably looked a lot better on paper than in reality. There are even parts of the film that come off quite well and are quite tense and well shot. They are too few and far between though unfortunately.The whole premise of the movie makes no sense. These cops need to get a bullet out of a woman they shot so they can't be caught, but they didn't just fire the one bullet that hit her, they fired dozens of them.

It's a good thriller, and one that will keep you on the edge of your seat. (The Good).Acting review : Terrible. I'd normally give the actors within the movie the benefit of the doubt, yet Bruce Willis is a seasoned actor and should know how to act. He took literally less than 5 seconds to put his phone number into a stranger's phone. His conversations both on the phone and in person were CHEESE. He walked into the end scene holding onto the wall after a weak fight, where as the woman who had been through 100 times worse was in comparison in better condition. (The Bad)Bruce Willis did not need to be in this movie. The woman had it covered.Oh.. and no! Don't be deceived by other comments. This is NOT a Die Hard in a Hospital. It's more of a Home Alone in a Hospital. (The What??)"}, {"id": 354, "text": "What I want is not on you. It's in you.It looks a bit like Die Hard in a hospital wing. Only the adamant John McClane has been replaced by the brave waitress Madison Taylor (Nicky Whelan) who has to save her own skin (and admittedly, that skin belongs to a beautiful, well-shaped body) while two mean-looking fellows are chasing her. And yes, the action hero par excellence, Bruce Willis, admired in days gone by for his contributions to action films and of course idolized during that period, is also present. This time, however, he's not competing for the main prize as Most valuable actor. His contribution is quite limited and in the end you can say it's insignificant. A negligible character who clearly has to drag himself through every scene while running behind the facts.What's wrong with star actor Bruce Willis? The sympathetic actor of yesteryear, who during his heyday was able to transform every crap film into a blockbuster, is slowly but surely working on destroying his status. In recent years it seems as if he has consciously opted for bland, uninspired B-movies with a flimsy screenplay. When looking at the list of films, with him in a central role, that I've seen in recent years, there's really nothing worthwhile to discover. The films The Prince, Vice, Extraction, Precious Cargo, Marauders, First Kill, Acts of Violence and Reprisal are all monstrosities of movies that aren't even worth viewing. The only movie I liked was Once Upon a Time in Venice. It's the only film in which Willis demonstrates an unforced enthusiasm. Apparently, being an actor is precious to Willis. However, I recommend that he makes the honorable decision himself and quietly use his hard-earned dollars to enjoy a well-earned vacation for the rest of his life. And it'll spare most of the film fans a lot of annoyance.Anyway. So if you forget the lifeless contribution of Bruce Willis, ignore the many improbabilities, won't see the ridiculousness in some situations, and accept the shameless copying of some corresponding situations from Die Hard, then this movie isn't all that bad. Admittedly, there's no longer a lot of credit left. And no doubt, lead actress Nicky Whelan deserves the remainder of this credit. Although it's sometimes annoying to see how her condition can radically improve from one scene to the next. One moment she stumbles through a room while bleeding profusely. The next moment she seems alive and kicking again. Incidentally, I still don't understand why the bullet wound wasn't treated decently in this hospital immediately. Applying only an emergency bandage and waiting till after the weekend for someone to be present there to close up the wound, doesn't seem a patient-friendly procedure to me.So as a whole, this isn't a terrible movie, besides the disinterested and sleep-inducing acting of Willis. Can't stress that enough times. The idea of the incriminating buller in Madison's thight is an original idea in itself. The concept of corrupt agents and the one-location idea, where the victim has to fight for her life, can't be called very creative. This (and the resulting storyline) has been used countless times in better movies and television series. Also, the movie isn't really intense or exciting either. Although Texas Battle (heck of an artist name) and Tito Ortiz aren't school examples of actors, due to their impressive appearance and no-nonsense attitude they still provided the necessary entertainment. In short, despite its (limited number of) positive points, Trauma Center was already doomed to be offered as an On Demand film. If you are an avid Bruce Willis fan then, of course, you should watch this movie. Only I'm afraid he won't rise in many fans their opinion.More reviews here: movie-freak.be"}, {"id": 355, "text": "Whew, I'm often very forgiving &amp; I do more than just occasionaly enjoy B and even C tier thrillers, horror movies etc., but Trauma Center surprised me unprepared, surprised me in all the worst ways. After having seen nearly 2600 movies, this has very unexpecetdly become one of the worst movie watching experiences I've ever had the displeasure of taking part in.It's really impressive actually - just how bland, effortless, cliche and uninspiring Trauma Center is, it's sub-par or worse in every filmmaking aspect in use ever. And the only side that's at least sub-par is the visual side, the absolutely boring but at least functioning cinematography - on the background of everything else it stops having any importance already 20 minutes into the movie. The plot is unengaging, much more cliche that most movies I'd described as cliche, it doesn't have any ups and downs, all goes as a single straight line of the most conventional boredom. Writing's a knock-off of everything with not one splash of life. The characters are dumbed down to primitive levels, as cliche as any other ingredient in Trauma Center - not one of them will make you sympathize with him/her much. Every 2 minutes or so somebody does or say something stupid. It's no secret most movies are unrealistic, but Trauma Center is unrealistic on a ridiculous level. It doesn't help that the movie take itself seriously. The acting's not much better, average and restrained for the most part, with Bruce Willis acting like he's just there to pay the bills &amp; to do it as fast as possible. It's the worst role of his I've ever seen, no doubt. As you can probaly guess, the sum of all the big and ugly flaws makes up for an annoyingly draggy pacing, to the point that watching it feels like work.Trauma Center is, by general standards, an every-day thriller, an extremely conventional piece of filmmaking, a truly generic type of movie. Personally, I'd wish to give it no more than 1/10, but I know it's not earned that low of a mark, not when trying to be objective. Somebody somewhere will get a kick out of it.

The killers arrive to retrieve the bullet which could be tracked back to them.The premise is simple enough. The acting is nothing to write home about. Willis barely cares nowadays. This movie never had a hope with so many little flaws. It starts with the bullet in her leg. That's not the only bullet out there and the bad guys don't spend enough time at the scene to be sure that all their bullets shattered. Quite frankly, it's a silly flaw that could be solved by announcing that they have to kill a witness. Locking her in isolation leaves the issue of the medicine. She would need doctors and nurses but nobody is allowed to see her. There is no monitoring of her. There's nobody on the floor other than one policeman. She pulls the fire alarm but it's a weird fire alarm which doesn't alert anybody outside the floor. What kind of scrub area would be bulletproof? They don't need to do that. Even if they shot out the window, they can't reach the inside handle. She can still shock them. The fact is that these flaws keep happening and they could all be solved. I don't know why the elevator only goes down one level. I don't know why that janitor screams like a little girl who has seen a ghost. I don't know why Madison doesn't talk to that nurse in the morgue. I don't know why security isn't crawling all over the hospital. The bad guy who dropped the chip has no way of knowing that Madison has it. A lot of this movie doesn't make sense if one digs too deeply.

With any lesser man, one could be mistaken in thinking the dull delivery of lines, the half-witted shouting, and the constantly squinting eyes were the result of a drunken actor just phoning it in. But this is Bruce Willis and we can be assured any apparent laziness is actually genius in dusguise. He speaks the artistically crafted dialogue with the perfect pitch of blandness to convey the ennui of modern life through the eyes of the tired vexation of a cop who has seen just too much crime in the poverty-ridden streets of Puerto Rico. Now, it takes a trained eye to notice the nuances of this performance but I can tell you, it's Oscar-winning stuff! Nicky Whelan's performance, by comparison, is flat and lacking emotional realism, evidencing how Neighbours just cannot prepare an actress for the big screen; unlike Willis, who has honed his chops to perfection through acting classics such as Breakfast of Champions and Colour of Night."}, {"id": 361, "text": "Woman empties trash in alley behind restaurant. Sees bloodied man crawling towards her and two men began shooting at the man and then at her wounding her in leg. Two men shooting take off as police come responding to scene.Woman is taken to hospital and hidden by police lieutenant Bruce Willis who then takes off to find those who murdered his C.I. after assuring woman she'll be safe and giving her his cell number. Will she be safe? You got it.With the exception of the woman's acting, other character's acting are negligible. Most dialogue is stunted and barely tolerable. You find yourself questioning WHY the characters aren't doing this or that.Bruce Willis is mundane and barely afloat is his role. NOTE TO SELF: Avoid wasting any more time watching any movie starring Bruce Willis."}, {"id": 362, "text": "An elementary school 4th and 5th-grade class decided to collaborate in writing a screenplay. They decided to write a police action, bad cop/good cop saga since that's all they really knew about from playing video games most of their young lives. Hollywood has been fairly light on movies in this genre lately and decided that they'd script and shoot it as a favor to the kids. After reading the script and determining just how ridiculous it was, as the theme followed tried and true movie flops in the past, they decided to cast unknown actors and needed at least one well-known name to put on all the movie posters that would be mailed to all the movie theaters to hang in their lobby.It was problematic to find action heroes that were available for this shoot so they determined it best to get someone who hadn't produced a good action film in years. Although retired, and had forgotten how to act, Bruce Willis, after some arm twisting, decided that this was a good comeback film for him.You've seen this bad cop/good cop film a dozen times and Trauma Center delivers with the same garbage that has been found in previously bad movies for decades. Give the elementary school kids credit, at least, for learning how to write a screenplay without adult guidance and selling it to Hollywood."}], "reviews_amount": 363}
