I've never been to Cuba but it appears to show an authentic depiction of the country. Usually, when a film takes you to Cuba it takes you to Havana - but Mambo Man is set in a provincial town - what you might call the 'real Cuba'.Mambo Man follows a (true) chapter in the life story of local businessman and pillar of his community JC. I won't give any spoilers, but it takes some unexpected twists, and makes interesting commentary on the Cuban social and political scene along the way.Finally, as you might expect from a film co-directed by the owner of Latin music label Tumi Music - it's worth watching for the sound track alone!"}, {"id": 8, "text": "Very nice film, beautiful photograph that shows the beautiful island of Cuba, I hope you enjoy it like me !!!"}, {"id": 9, "text": "I love the way that movie show all the Cuban culture, its roots, and the landscapes, a good story for sure!"}, {"id": 10, "text": "Good music, real history very popular in the actual Cuba life. excelent fotography, I think it\u00b4s historic film becouse Cuba is change very quiq and this argument it\u00b4s woonderfull document of Cuba life........"}, {"id": 11, "text": "It is like living in Cuba for a while Really authentic.

That joy, intertwined with a narrative of con artists, of people trying to make ends meet, and a very pleasant high note in the final scene, makes for a very entertaining and endearing movie."}, {"id": 29, "text": "Mambo Man is an incredible Cuban flick! One not to be missed, especially for those of the Cuban culture. Relatable and a great family film.Mambo Man is about a Cuban named JC (Hector Noas) who is both a farmer and a music promoter, popular on the island for his music. When his friend, Roberto (David Parez), appears out of the blue with a business offer JC cannot refuse, JC is left scrambling to find fifty thousand dollars. Throughout the film we see JC and his family struggle with their everyday life. We see how poor the island is and posters of Fidel Castro, whether praising or fearing him. Throughout the film, Cuba is shown in its poverty-overcrowded, with residents looking for work for food and money. Mambo Man doesn't hide Cuba's flaws nor does it glorify the country, but rather shows the day-to-day life of the island's inhabitants.Another plus is the authenticity: the whole cast is Cuban and the movie is filmed in Cuba. (As a Cuban myself, I enjoyed seeing these shots of where my father grew up.) The entirety of Mambo Man is in Spanish with subtitles, with people rarely speaking English. At times, the subtitles do not match what the dialogue really says. Some lines are changed, sometimes phrases and expressions aren't included. Some of my favorite scenes are those that include music, especially traditional Cuban music made for dancing. The soundtrack includes wonderful songs that many Cubans can recognize. Mambo Man has incredible shots of the countryside of Cuba, too, such as JC's farmland, and when he and his chauffeur, David (Alejandro Palomino) drive through the city and countryside.Overall, the main plot of the film feels extremely rushed, and the not-so-needed scenes drag on for way too long. For example, at one point, JC's friend steals ten thousand dollars from him. We never meet his friend, Omar, so it seems odd to have a character who is pretty unrelated to the plot steal such a grand amount of money. Also, there are parts in the film where tourists visit JC's farm that are longer than necessary. It would have been much better to meet Omar rather than see tourists that have no effect on the storyline. In another example, JC's wife, Rita (Yudexi De La Torre Mesa) is angry with her husband about how much money he is risking, and then in her next scene she talks about how losing a huge sum of money is no big deal, and that family is what is important. We miss her character development, and it seems peculiar how in one scene she nags JC about almost losing their home and in the next she shrugs it off.The message of the film is that family is what matters most, not money, as JC learns towards the end. There are many uses of adult language; some shown in subtitles, and some not included but still said in Spanish. Heavy alcohol and tobacco depictions are shown as well.I give Mambo Man 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. It premieres on virtual cinema on September 11, 2020.Reviewed by Heather S., KIDS FIRST!

This happens immediately, from the very first minutes, when the guitar strings begin to vibrate and the magnificent, humble and ancient Cuban land is the protagonist of passionate shots. This film doesn't just tell a story, in fact. It is a kind of monument. A work destined to last potentially forever, because it is the expression of an entire culture, of an entire people. In fact, the history of JC mixes and spreads in the infinite branches of the history, music and people of Cuba. It is not an excuse to tell this country, but rather a symbol, which wishes to collect the legacy of a wonderful culture. And Mambo Man manages to communicate total, wide suggestions that seem to bring even the scent of that land to us. The film is played very well by its actors: real faces, framed with reverence and awareness. But there is another protagonist who in this film stands out for its majesty: music. The film, like Cuba itself, is crossed by vibrant, vivid compositions that have always expressed and collected the feelings of Cubans. Mo Fini and Edesio Alejandro, with inspiration and great inspiration, manage to extract beauty from the very material of this nation. There is no indiscreet aesthetic research, a spectacular photograph or dizzying camera movements. There is rather the mature and conscious gaze of two authors who want to represent Cuba, and the story of the protagonist, with truth and love. With this awareness, each shot conveys a charm superior to that of a good staging. This film, made with passion, penetrates the audience to the rhythm of music and tells us about a whole, small, precious universe, absorbing its beauty and misery. Mambo Man is a bit like Cuba: beautiful, kind and melancholic. Rese\u00f1a de Mambo Man by Prisma (Festival Internacional de Cine de Roma) Junio 2020 MAMBO MAN BY MO FINI AND EDESIO ALEJANDRO Posted at 09:10h in Reviews by prismaadminMambo Man es una pel\u00edcula que puede envolver a los espectadores en una c\u00e1lida atm\u00f3sfera so\u00f1adora y nost\u00e1lgica. Esto sucede inmediatamente, desde los primeros minutos, cuando las cuerdas de la guitarra comienzan a vibrar y la magn\u00edfica, humilde y antigua tierra cubana es la protagonista de los disparos apasionados. Esta pel\u00edcula no solo cuenta una historia, de hecho. Es una especie de monumento. Una obra destinada a durar para siempre, porque es la expresi\u00f3n de una cultura entera, de un pueblo entero. De hecho, la historia de JC se mezcla y se extiende en las ramas infinitas de la historia, la m\u00fasica y el pueblo de Cuba. No es una excusa para contarle a este pa\u00eds, sino m\u00e1s bien un s\u00edmbolo, que desea recoger el legado de una cultura maravillosa. Y Mambo Man se las arregla para comunicar sugerencias totales y amplias que parecen traernos incluso el aroma de esa tierra.Sus actores interpretan muy bien la pel\u00edcula: rostros reales, enmarcados con reverencia y conciencia. Pero hay otro protagonista que en esta pel\u00edcula destaca por su majestuosidad: la m\u00fasica. La pel\u00edcula, como la propia Cuba, est\u00e1 atravesada por composiciones vibrantes y v\u00edvidas que siempre han expresado y recogido los sentimientos de los cubanos. Mo Fini y Edesio Alejandro, con inspiraci\u00f3n y gran inspiraci\u00f3n, logran extraer la belleza del material de esta naci\u00f3n. No hay una investigaci\u00f3n est\u00e9tica indiscreta, una fotograf\u00eda espectacular o movimientos de c\u00e1mara vertiginosos. Hay m\u00e1s bien la mirada madura y consciente de dos autores que quieren representar a Cuba, y la historia del protagonista, con verdad y amor. Con esta conciencia, cada disparo transmite un encanto superior al de una buena puesta en escena. Esta pel\u00edcula, hecha con pasi\u00f3n, penetra al p\u00fablico al ritmo de la m\u00fasica y nos cuenta sobre un universo entero, peque\u00f1o y precioso, absorbiendo su belleza y miseria. Mambo Man es un poco como Cuba: hermoso, amable y melanc\u00f3lico."}], "reviews_amount": 31}
