It's more of a psychological drama if anything. As strange as the film was, I was never bored. I give major props to the lead actress as she made every scene gripping. You really come to understand her motivations and why she does what she does. I found the ending perfect, but I can see why it could polarize a lot of viewers. Overall, I adored the acting, story, and cinematography. A little strange but enchanting."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I never felt the urge to leave a review here due to many reasons, English is not my native language and I'm bad with describing my emotions accurately, but this film drove me to this point. You want it to end good for this girl so bad, cant say i have the same struggles as her but i GET it and in a way I cheered her on even though its all so horrible. Cried my eyes out at the ending because its was all right for the first time in her life and we got to see the light burst out of her beautiful eyes. Exceptional acting by Haley Bennett, the visuals are to die for. Will be one of my all time favorites."}, {"id": 2, "text": "A user here quoted the movie as Dumb girl, scores rich dude, gets pregnant realizes she hates being a housewife so she endangers child by swallowing more and more extreme bits around the house. Yep, about par for the course for the modern liberal woman.Did you understand the movie at all????? This film is about the profound consequences of trauma and how it affects mental illness. When she is swallowing things, it has nothing to do with wanting to endanger the child. The issue wasn't that she hates being a housewife; the issue is that she doesn't know who she is related to her past.Thank you for the very shallow review though."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Some of these reviewers stating this movie pushes 'leftist ideologies' seem to be focused on looking for political slants on just about everything. It's becoming ridiculous! C'mon now... the movie is about a unhappy young bride suffering from an extreme form of Pica during her pregnancy. Relate it to the mental illness of cutting oneself... since it is closely related as she becomes increasingly becomes braver with the items she swallows. It has nothing to do with ideology or politics. Watch it for the compelling story, beautiful visuals and superb acting. The horror of it is... as she starts to swallow more dangerous items, what's going to happen to her? It's a psychological thriller for sure."}, {"id": 4, "text": "The acting and visuals are great. the story line lacked that punch that could have made this a 7 or 8.the story is sad but just didn't connect with me and i was dissapointed with the end6.1"}, {"id": 5, "text": "Don\u00b4t expect any horror and thill. It\u00b4s a drama movie which contains a good portrait of a traumatized woman. Not more or less."}, {"id": 6, "text": "This is NOT a Thriller or HORROR FILM. It is a Drama about a woman over the edge who should outwardly seem like she has it all... a gorgeous, successful husband, a big beautiful home, plenty of money and she's expecting her first child. But all is NOT how it seems. Inside she's suffering deeply from depression, pica and probably some form of PTSD from her life's traumas. She's eating non-food items which are making her increasingly sicker. I won't say more except that mental illness and trauma affect people in different ways. I felt extreme compassion for the lead character watching her suffer. Don't just write this film off. It is important and unforgettable. People hurt and sometimes hurt themselves and inadvertently their own loved ones."}, {"id": 7, "text": "In what could have been a very interesting exploration of Pica, the psychological disorder, the writers chose to tack in some arbitrary larger causation ark and it simply did not work. The performances were great, all around, the visual style and pace aren't the problem either.Unfortunately the characters are one-dimensional caricatures who are not explored enough to justify the actions of themselves or the lead. In the end, the curiosity of the main theme is played down to focus on an apparent moral message.It's great when movies have a message, but when they fake it, it undermines the whole experience. In this case it appears they had no idea what they were trying to communicate and this leaves you feeling very cheated. More so than if they had simply presented a stylised series of unconnected events."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Just saw it on Belgrade Independent American Movies short festival.Very emotional topic. How our past can influence our present life and how trying to be perfect in each aspect of life can bring to different disorders.Intelligent movie, gives a lot to think about.Had a short and emotional chat with an author and would like to thank him for this wonderful movie."}, {"id": 9, "text": "This was a film that kicked off the Nightmares Film Festival that I had the pleasure of attending. I really didn't know a lot about this one, aside from that it had an interesting title. I did learn that this was the first screening that was outside of New York City, which is cool. The synopsis is Hunter (Haley Bennett), a newly pregnant housewife, finds herself increasingly compelled to consume dangerous objects. As her husband and his family tighten their control over her life, she must confront the dark secret behind her new obsession.As the synopsis states, we get to meet our main character Hunter through some interesting interactions. Her husband is Richie (Austin Stowell) and he's the youngest director at the firm that his father is in charge of. His father is Michael (David Rasche) and his mother being Katherine (Elizabeth Marvel). Hunter is not from the same class as them, so she feels out of place. There's even an interesting interaction at a fancy dinner where she is meekly telling a story where Michael cuts her off. She is trying to impress Richie and his family as she doesn't fit in.She then starts to eat things. It starts with a marble and then progresses to things that are much more dangerous like thumbtacks and batteries. When her and husband go to an ultrasound, they notice the foreign items inside. She's taken to emergency surgery to have them removed. This infuriates Richie, as Hunter doesn't know why she's doing this and he's embarrassed. Hunter is upset with him when he shares what is happening with those he works with. She is then taken to therapy as well as having Luay (Laith Nakli), a nurse, to take care of her.Through multiple sessions, some interesting information from her past is revealed. They also don't realize that she is continuing to eat these items. She wants to keep Richie happy, but the more she tries, the more she descends into this madness that has taken her over.Now I wanted to go a little bit vague on the recap here and just kind of outline the general idea. Part of this is being a festival film and also, I really want you to see this and experience the reveals. Something that I picked up on and I don't really think it is a spoiler as it gets revealed pretty early on as well as through the interactions Hunter is having. She doesn't feel that she in control of her life. Since she's trying so hard to impress everyone, she doesn't think of what makes her happy and she probably doesn't even know. On top of that, Richie and his family are rich so they have a high standard there and they're very judgmental.I will warn you though, this film really will be decisive. What happens at the end is actually a hot button issue and many people are definitely against this. I actually liked where this went and is definitely empowering her as a woman. There's also a sad reveal during an interaction with Erwin (Denis O'Hare) that made me tear up. This film does an excellent job at making you feel bad for Hunter, but also feeling hope for the future for her.That will take me to the pacing of this, which I will admit is a bit slow. A lot of that is the type of film. We don't really have a lot going on, but we do in the form of learning about this character and her troubles. This is really a character study of Hunter so we get introduced to her and her situation. It doesn't really waste any time seeing her start eating objects and the effect it has on her. Once her family finds out, it really becomes her becoming a prisoner in her own life. As I said, I really like the character growth there and how this plays out in the end for sure.This then will move us to the acting, which I would say the best performance by far is our star. Bennett is such a pretty woman and it looks like she has it all. It doesn't take long to see that she is quite timid and seems like she's put up with a lot in her life. I like to see her start to take back control to grow into what she becomes in the end. Stowell seems like the perfect husband, but we get glimpses that she's really a jerk. That grows with the film. I thought Marvel and Rasche do well as the overbearing parents of Richie as well. They really portray that feel of being snobby. I thought we had some really good cameos from O'Hare as well as Luna Lauren Velez. I'm a big fan of O'Hare from his stint on American Horror Story. The rest of the cast is fine and round out the movie for what was needed.Next would be the effects that are used in the film. To be honest, this isn't a film like that and it doesn't have a lot. We actually see Hunter put the items in her mouth, but things are then hidden. I think this is definitely a strategic move that works. We see that she actually collects the items from the toilet as well. I do have to give credit to make up as there's a scene of her eating and seeing her as she is broken down. Plus the little bit of blood we get looked real as well. The film though is definitely shot very well and I have to say we get some interesting angles and use of color.Now with that said, I actually really enjoyed this film and kicking off this festival with it really intrigued me for what is to come next. I think this is definitely an interesting character study of this woman that seems like she's happy, but never dealt with past traumas until now. It is paced in a way where it kept things moving, but not a lot necessarily happens. I like how it ends and I think there's some really good acting here. There weren't a lot in the way of effects, but what we get was good. The soundtrack didn't necessarily stand out. It doesn't hurt the film though either. I found this to be a good movie for sure. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but I think if you like types of films like this than you can definitely find some interesting things here."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Originality within the bounds of reality is a rare achievement in film or cinema these days. Haley Bennett leaves us under no illusion of the psychological strain her past and present circumstances have had and are having on her. Tormented in so many ways as so many people are in these confusing, evolving and ever changing times - our hunter gatherer minds can find all that's thrown their way a little tricky to wash down, but there are ways to compensate."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Nothing happens at all, is one of those artsy craps extremely slow, implausible dialogs, an absolute borefest to the end..."}, {"id": 12, "text": "As several users point out, Swallow is about a woman struggling for control and autonomy in a situation in which she increasingly has less and less of it - or, to put it more accurately, a situation in which she is subject to others' control more and more. So, at the same time, this is a movie about the social control over women, exerted by society.The control exercised over the main character manifests in different ways. It manifests in the the main character Hunter's husband dismissing her every time she tries to share a thought or idea. It manifests in the husband's parents' constant reminders that they are the source of the lavish lifestyle she enjoys now that she's married their son. It manifests in the oppressive upper class atmosphere, in which she's expected to be perfect, to say little, and to entertain his husband's friends and relatives. It manifests in her husbands outbursts when she makes a mistake and, let's face it, in the way she becomes secondary to the child she has in her belly. Then, increasingly, once they learn of Hunter's swallowing of various objects, it begins to manifest more directly, as Hunter and his parents attempt to control and surveil her behavior inside the house. Finally, control manifests in the trauma that drives her increasingly self-destructive behavior, stemming from an event in the past that also concerns power men have over women.Not only men try to control Hunter - her husband's mother is particularly terrifying here, communicating how little worth Hunter has without her husband under the guise of being her ally. But that is the point - patriarchy is a system of belief so ingrained that everyone is susceptible here. At the same time, she finds a real ally in a male nurse paid by the family to watch over her, from a war torn country who understands oppression.But to see Swallow as simply a movie about control is to miss its focus, which is on the lengths people will go to for a measure of independence and autonomy. From swallowing various objects to a decision Hunter makes near the end of the film, particularly juxtaposed against her dark back story, Swallow is about reclaiming choice. And all of this works, especially as it becomes increasingly twisted, because of Haley Bennett's performance and the austere cinematography."}, {"id": 13, "text": "The housewife Hunter Conrad (Haley Bennett) is happily married with the young CEO husband Richie Conrad (Austin Stowell).

Soon Richie's family hires a male nurse and a psychologist to take care of Hunter. When they decide to send her to a psychiatric hospital, Hunter learns that she needs to control of her life.Swallow is an interesting film about a pregnant wife with Pica disorder.

I fail to see what type of control over her life she believes she actually gained. So she will go back to her retail job and be a wage slave ? Is this freedom ? Whilst her husband was not a nice guy, I fell as though she simply traded one bad apple for the other. It also felt like cheap revenge to kill her unborn baby simply because she wanted freedom from her past life. There must have been a third option for her and I feel as though she did not have the capacity for introspection required from someone who find themselves unhappy and in need of control over their life.

Like others have said before, I found myself wanting this poor girl to get some real help, not what she was getting. My eyes would water up and I was even talking to the tv at her, trying to offer my own compassion for her. The ending wasn't all tied up in a happy little bow in some fairytale fashion.

As the story unfolds, you vaguely have an idea what all of it is about yet you are drawn to continually display sympathy towards Hunter(the main character), as the story's cloud dissipates, you slowly absorb the plot's unending inquiries and start to formulate answers of your own rather than what the movie is giving you, but in the end, the storyline prevailed. This movie is about a social issue of the mind that compels us to ask ourselves how far are we willing to understand and be there for people who have an uncommon behavioural, probably mental disorder. Haley Bennet is truly a versatile actress, she made sure of that with her performance in this one, there is no question to that. She was extraordinary and it was obvious that she went out her way to develop and justify Hunter's character. Hollywood truly nailed it on this one. A rare film in a totally different caliber.

Had there been any redemption or education in the film, about the topic it might has been better. It could have actually helped the world understand a horrid pathology as depicted, but instead it almost glorifies self-abuse as the awful ending was encouraging terrible thinking.It's not clever or funny, as some reviews suggest. It's not funny at all. Sick pandering about sad people.

In the film, the audience will be able to pick up on the intention that they wanted to portray how Hunter's choices became her's but the portrayal of this intention blurs the line of patronization.While feminism is also tackled given the gained assertiveness of Hunter to make her own choices, it is picked up from the consequent-ignorant angle that puts this film under the irresponsible category. It was very reckless of the filmmakers to portray the story with the danger of putting importance on choice regardless of consequences. My primary reasons being that there was no portrayal for the closure with the husband, no scene whatsoever to explain that the essence of gaining independence and control should not be to the detriment of self and others, products of rape children, and pica.

Once again there are clear good guys and bad guys and life just is not like that. Throughout the movie I kept asking myself Who acts like that ? Certain characters do and say things that seem to happen only in movies.

So much more could have been done to explore the real issue here which is what to do with oneself in a situation like this. Choosing a supposedly politically correct answer did a huge disservice to the issues the characters was going through. The best the writers could hope for was to bind power and control as the central theme. Extremely dismissive and poorly judged to end it the way they did.

The behavior becomes a form of self-harm to control and provoke a solution for an underlying neurosis, as well as for not being truly seen by her husband. Her compulsion worsens until she gets detected, which becomes a blow for the husband's ego for not being able to predict his wife, resulting in him trying to medicate and control her.Although trying to help her, his career sentiments seem to get in the way of actually recognizing his spouse for who she is apart from a housewife. Since she is lacking in self-worth, she is compliant and blames herself. The family hires a psychologist and a body guard to watch her, which exacerbates the problem. As it turns out, her condition stems from a suppressed childhood trauma, as often is the case. She lets her psychologist know her mother was raped which resulted in her own birth. This explains why the trauma suddenly came about during pregnancy, where swallowing sharp objects became a control mechanism to compensate for the fact that she was conceived in an involuntary manner. Luckily, she is able to escape her husband's efforts to hospitalize her and manages to find and confront her father, which ends up resolving her trauma.A story of a woman who needed to be seen and understood but almost ends up in a mental institution. The movie illustrates how modern formal psychology often fails to address the underlying soul, how superficial relationships prevent real communication, and how important piety, acknowledgement and family is for human well-being. It also shows the complexity and emotional depth of a woman, which is often neglected or feared by the male counterpart for not being able to understand it."}, {"id": 45, "text": "The movie features decent concept, acting, and cinematography, while throwing audience with terrible story, development, and ending.

It will easily keep you on your toes, until you know about her illness! after that, almost no valuable scenes could be observed. Through out the movie there are zero twists or developments, but would be found watchable for some reason. The really terrible thing that even ruin that mediocre impression is the ending. It is not an open ending, not a closed one, not a happy or sad one. It is just a blunt cut with the credits down leaving you puzzled, like literally what? is that it?!, it is disappointing that it starts really good and then go down faster than flush water.

Yeah, let's call it that.At its core, it's about how we deal with the things thrust upon us, that we have had to swallow and hold inside: Hunter in her fish-out-of-water marriage; her feelings of inadequacy around her husband, his parents and their societal trappings; the compartmentalized manner of her own conception.After being given a self-help pregnancy book by her mother-in-law, she fixates on a passage telling her to try new things. So she goes on what may seem like an odd adventure of eating inedible items. But pregnancy-induced cravings (for foods as well as non-foods, i.e. pica) are a legitimate and frequent topic of concern and study in the field of obstetrics.As Hunter's cravings lead to complications with her pregnancy, her over-bearing in-laws tighten their grip on Hunter's everyday life to protect their son's heir. And during one of her mandated therapy sessions, Hunter's true secret comes out. She is the product of a non-consensual attack perpetuated on her mother.From there the movie reveals its major question. Were Hunter's repressed feelings on her own creation subconsciously causing her to eat harmful things in order to end the pregnancy that tethers her to a superficial, unhappy, unfulfilling and oppressed existence?After confronting the source of her pain, Hunter ultimately takes control with a variation on the movie's main theme.

Following the lead character Hunter in the grip of an eating disorder driving her to swallow ever more dangerous objects to feel some kind of control over her stultifyingly pampered life: that would have been enough to make a compelling film that could make the audience feel empathy for her plight and want to see her get free of it.But instead the film becomes all about these abstract, political and ideological reasons for everything: it's The Patriarchy!!!, MEN!!!, it's Rape Culture Drove Her To It!!!!!!! which are simply activist fantasies, and even within the constraints of this fictional story don't make sense. And because of that, the words and actions of the characters being made to illustrate these abstract concepts - particularly Hunter's husband and his family - never seem believable or relatable or even fully human.Towards the end, especially, every event seems fake and false: the idea that Hunter's disorder can be explained because her MOTHER was raped is just downright bizarre, and makes me worry that the creator of this film is as hysterical and deluded in real life as the soil-chewing character at the center of it.Haley Bennett in the lead is very good, and practically nothing about her individual performance would have had to have changed to have made a good film: the issue is only the Gender Studies thesis her performance is crowbarred into, which ruins any logic or connection at every turn.The mechanism by which her character apparently finds closure is as unbelievable as the rest, and then the aborion ending being presented as only a liberating, joyous, healing experience is needless, disturbing, intentionally hateful and insulting. It could have ended the exact same way and still been believable if it simply showed the grim and bleak reality of a now homeless mentally ill person out on the street with nothing and no-one left in her life, but as it is it feels as sugary, patronising and artificially inflated as a Beyonce girl power anthem being lip-synced for a whooping and pink-hatted Oprah Winfrey audience.

Throw in his crazy parents and we're led to see exactly why he turned out this way.Next, as if that wasn't enough, she gets pregnant and this triggers an outrageously harmful psychological condition caused by a repressed issue of guilt and self loathing.The only redeeming part of the entire movie was her confrontation with her father. The interaction seemed real and I was surprised they presented him as a man who had clearly changed and turned his life around.The ending made complete sense considering this type of liberating movie it was obviously designed to be.

That said Swallow is an entertaining movie that will get you into conversations about the subject, it surely did for me. The cinematography was on top, quality imaging, everything well shot, and as the story unfolds you never have a dull moment even if it's slow paced. Good acting from the cast as well, Haley Bennett the main character gave a good convincing performance.

I was looking forward to seeing a great stylisitc horror film weith some disturbing images and bits of political critique. All of these stuff are there, but in wrong portions. The first half feels that is really building to a crap story. By the time the character statrs this brand new mania of swallowing sharp objects i was really interested to see where that could go. But the film does not really fully embrace this idea. Instead, we are seeing the main actress under surveilance and it nver explodes to a horrendous masacre that could have easily come out of such an over-the-top mania.As the film goes on though, it becomes obvious that this is not a gorry horror film but instead a kind of a disturbing take on the meanipulative relationship between this couple. The man is the paradigm of a dump rich, so much that it feels really cliche and courtounsih and kind of annoying that she really thinks he really loves her. She just cares for his images and shirts and house. The main actress is more of a housewife that has to do the hosue chores and she is badly treated by her husband. So, to me swallowing htings works more as a metaphor for the fact that she has to swallow al this mean behavior because societry says htat women ido the work in the house and men are the ones in charge. I reallyl liked that idea, it's clever and really makes the film more mature, but the chancee for a maginficent horror with over-the-top humour and disturbing context is nver really there. The entire 3rd act is about her journey to find her family and get away from her husband and his family who are pretending to love her and treat her right. And then we have the geniously done scene were she just opens the tv and is watching sth while eating soil, a metaphor to pop-corn of course. This scene brought me so mutch laughter and joy because it played with this idea in a hillarious way. If only the film had more of such scenes that portray how too-much the whole scenario feels like, it would be a far more enteraining and memorable ride. Insead, from a point and on the film becomes a drama about women trying to find a place in a world that mistreats them. And yes, the message is great and the connection to her mania is quite clever. It shows how harshly women have been and our trreated by weathy, dump people and families and how inprisoned and lonely their life feels like. But, I wanted so much more form such a bold idea. It's like the film had a chance to blend splatter horror, disturbing images, clever comedy and political and social critique about how the society shapes women's lives and puts us in tiny boxes. Yes, it sounds like a difficult feat to do, but if it just tried to be less safer and do more creative stuff in the end... damn... it would be a dream! It's becomes your usual faminine drama, which is fine, but c'mon i wanted more.After all, besides my desires, the fiolm did not dissappoint. It had a bunch of disturbing moments, the social and political messages work fine for the story and the direction and presentation are great and feel really atmospheric and well-thought. The performances are great and Haley Bennett was amazing in this one. The soundtrack is great too, gives quite an energy to the film.Swallow has a great texture, but, by the time I've swallowed it, I wanted it to be a little more pointy, a little more on the edge."}, {"id": 71, "text": "Very badly directed movie.

Haley Bennett is in almost every scene and she competently carries this movie with her quite remarkable acting range. Not knowing much about Pica, I dismissed that the compulsion to eat soil or nails or whatever was just ridiculous, but the scene in which she couldn't help but look at the thumbtack on the kitchen counter, with all the tortured expressions on her face, single-handedly educated me on this form of mental illness. It was as if the object was summoning her, giving her an opportunity to possess something she could be in control of. This movie was definitely a worthy rental, and could have been an intriguing blockbuster in the theaters if the pandemic hadn't shut everything down! My one complaint is about the ending which seemed a bit rushed and abrupt.

But the third act is a political stand about positive abortion. Yeap, they throw that in your face without dealing with the actual storyline that from most part of the movie is going in a different direction.

Haley Bennett is terrific in the lead role. I love that it showcases the point that even if you have everything a lot of people aspire to get - wealth, marriage, not having to work etc. - that it far from guarantees happiness. It's the old adage of Be careful what you wish for. The Swallow aspect of this movie is really only there for a point of difference. I understand why they have to name the movie that, but I genuinely believe it would be better off if they'd gone with something different.The ending of this film was the highlight for me. It was handled in such a classy and thought-provoking way. Not everyone may feel satisfied with it and would prefer more of a justice angle to have been taken, but I really liked it.

Externally, she looks like an ice-cold pretty blonde, but there's something vulnerable about her. Her eyes hide some dark, ugly and sad secret. Her in a movie about a strange subject matter I know little about was exciting. I anticipated a psychological thriller about what compels a woman to swallow inedible and harmful objects. More of her backstory pre-marriage would've been nice. Where's the character development? Instead I got a visual lecture about lambs being slaughtered to bring lamb chops to our plates. Am I supposed to feel guilty about eating meat? Is this a vegan psa? A psychiatrist actually asked her patient why her Mom didn't abort her because she was a product of rape. The patient responds her family is right-wing religious nuts. My Jamaican, lifelong Democrats parents, don't believe in abortion. Why is this movie pushing an agenda and generalizing people? Then, there's the total disregard for life, as if it can literally be flushed away like waste. The acting was good. Agenda pushing aside, it wasn't a bad movie.

He didn't want to watch it at first because he said the her eating things would give him bad shivers all throughout... but we finally decided to watch it. We came across this movie after watching The Girl on the Train.I don't think the trailer for this movie does it justice. But it does lay the story right out on the table.What I found most captivating about this movie was how much of a sweet soul Hunter is. The main character. She's so soft spoken and liked having a purpose. She'd get upset like anyone else, but she's way more pure than anyone else as well. You really feel for her.I don't want to spoil the plot twist (if you can even call it a twist.. rather a plot add-in) but it was powerful and in my opinion had a message. A message that dealing with problems head on, looking at fear right in the face can be just that, powerful. And helpful at that. And if you watch the movie you'll see why.What I ended up liking most about the movie was it's ending. Simple with a strong message. In simple and few words, I'd sum up the message to, You Never Know What Someone Else Is Going Through. What I took from the ending was to be kind to our neighbors, our sisters and most importantly, strangers. You could simply walk past a person on the street not knowing how awful their day has been. Everyone is going through something. And everyone puts on a brave face to the world.I really really liked this movie!! Very simple but relatable. We all do things and react certain ways when we're older from experiences or traumas we faced when younger. And it *IS* possible to change our ways. And to become whole again. Every experience and trauma is sure, different than the next. But progress is possible. And life can be beautiful and simple at the same time.I'm someone that, if I like something? I'll watch it again in a year or something.. movies &amp; tv shows. I like to end my reviews with mentioning if this is something I'd re-watch or not. It's not captivating enough to re-watch. But it is a great one-time movie, with a great message!! Purposeful like I said."}, {"id": 138, "text": "Swallow has the building blocks of a great film: an enticing premise, striking visuals, and an earnest attempt at psychological depth. For a debut feature, there is a fair amount to admire as Carlo Mirabella-Davis comes through with a few compelling images and unsettling moments. Unfortunately, though, they're just that: images and moments, fleeting and disconnected, adrift in a film that feels amorphous and undercooked.Davis sets the stage for a deep dive into the psychology of masochism, self-harm, and shame only to frustratingly skim the surface. Crucial character revelations are doled out via clunky expositional therapy scenes. Complex psychopathology is boiled down to the point of contrivance. Heavy-handed and banal moments abound - a narcissistic husband comically absorbed in his phone over dinner, a hush ripples through a party as a character experiences embarrassment, a sex offender psychoanalyzes himself on command. Save for a few scattered moments, it's consistently trite and settles for cheap theatrics.Its biggest saving grace is Haley Bennett, who gives a convincing performance despite the lackluster material. She has an alluring quality and impresses a number of times with both restrained and emotionally intense moments. It's a shame, though, that her character feels increasingly inconsistent as the film progresses, amassing an unlikely blend of conflicting traits that warp to suit the disjointed narrative: naive and aloof at times, domineering and unhinged at others.I do admire the film on some level for its attempt at tackling this challenging subject matter and there are some sparks that fly here and there. But it isn't enough to conceal the serious foundational flaws, and the film ultimately rings hollow.Strong 2.5/5"}, {"id": 139, "text": "Writer and director Carlo Mirabella-Davis delivers her feature debut Swallow, a character study, a film built on psychology of abuse, isolation, alienation, depression and obsession. In its center, Haley Bennett puts on a great performance as a newly-wed, newly pregnant housewife who's psyche is slowly crumbling and who can't find any stable ground or control over her life. Swallow is a rarely rich movie, but not with plot, characters or action.Swallow is a carefully and patiently composed psychological study, clothed up in pastel-like colors and sure-handed, competent and clean-feeling cinematography. The viewer follows Hunter (Haley Bennett) as she struggles to find an emotional ground in her new life in which she has rushed in unprepared. Even though Hunter has it all - wealth, money, free time - Swallow makes a good point in saying that materialistic means do not guarantee happiness. Hunter's husband and his family are a controlling, untrustworthy and egoistical bunch, making her suffer even more. Trying to escape the painful routine, Hunter develop a compulsive, obsessive habit to swallow various small things, rocks, needles, marbles, even batteries. On the journey we also learn about the weight of past traumas on her shoulders - on the journey to the eventual resurrection of the mind and free will. Haley Bennett shines all throughout this journey, in a brave and intimate portrayal of a troubled woman. Swallow isn't a plot-based movie, but that should already be apparent... It also doesn't exactly fit in the horror genre &amp; long story short, the way its marketed could be misleading to a lot of people who'll like it less for those reasons. There's a level of absurdity and surrealism, but well self-acknowledged and tailored together truly tightly, making Swallow feel like a borderless yet solidified piece of mood and contemplation cinema. An art-house with such a psychological weight that it makes up in substance where plot and some other usual, conventional elements do not.Despite Swallow being a successful and impressive oddball future cult drama presenting (always) relevant issues in women and, truthfully, the entire society, it also has flaws, like a pacing that is consistent to a fault (never really picks up), lack of story and the fact that it won't satisfy the more mainstream audiences. Not that I care much, I recommend this to those who get intrigued by what can be described as odd or weird as much as myself.

We don't get a string of explanatory diatribes, we get her performance and it absolutely works.This is hard to watch at times though. Our lead character does love up to the title. She swallows things. Things that shouldn't be swallowed and it's hard to watch but I found it incredibly effective.Swallow is wonderful example of slowly building psychological distress and simultaneously a display of Bennett's skill.

A tough film to watch and the format/medium of the story is told using the disorder of swallowing things as a means partially to fee powerful (deeper than just that).Her existence is a light trying to be bright after such dark beginnings and the end is tragic in the way that history hasn't quite repeated how you'd hope but the cost or her gaining control is not without its victims.Tragic, sad and very poignant.Highlights boundaries and how people are just awful and controlling if you've not learned how to establish boundaries. Men must watch this (I'm a 40yr old white heterosexual male, married with 2 kids)."}, {"id": 143, "text": "Swallow follows Hunter, a young woman who has married into a wealthy family. Despite her privileged new life, she is emotionally stifled in both her marriage and her domestic life, and the realization of this is compounded when she discovers she is pregnant. She soon develops an unusual coping mechanism: She begins to ingest inedible objects, leading to potentially disastrous consequences.Though marketed as a horror film of sorts, Swallow is truly more of a psychological drama. Visually, it makes nods to a number of horror films, namely Rosemary's Baby and the works of David Cronenberg--but the narrative arc, though distressing and at times suspenseful, is not exactly horror, despite having its fingers on the pulse of it. No less, this directorial debut from Carlo Mirabella-Davis is a powerful odyssey through one woman's extremely dangerous psychological disorder.On a purely cinematographic level, Swallow is stunning--it is bathed in colorful contrasts and sleek locations. The interior of the home in which it takes place evokes a repressive 1950s feel in terms of its decor, which falls in line with the Stepford Wives tone it evokes. The visuals, however, are only mere supplements to the screenplay, which is a truly original piece of work, and one that travels into places rarely, if ever, are brought to screen. Haley Bennett's performance here is quietly measured and wholly effective; as much as the character plays up the role of subservient wife/coquette for her husband's sake, Bennett manages to generate a constant, quiet undercurrent of anxiety, insecurity, and impulse to sabotage that leaves the whole film feeling as though it is teetering on the brink of chaos.By the end of it all, the film resolved itself in a place I had not necessarily expected, but it is a no less fitting conclusion to this very unique story. Definitely worthwhile viewing for fans of psychological dramas or deep-dives into the nature of mental illness. The journey here is haunting, nail-biting, and poignant by turns. 9/10."}, {"id": 144, "text": "A very impressive debut feature film from director Carlo Mirabella-Davis. This movie is full of beautiful coloring, cinematography, environments, and music. It's tastefully directed, edited, and acted, and the intriguing concept even has a wrap-around meaning that is...somewhat easy to swallow, in the end. When I finished the movie last night, I felt a bit like the ending felt lackluster and rather disconnected from the rest of the film, but, upon thinking about it as I awoke this morning, I saw the direct parallel between everything, which really gave the whole experience true cohesion.It's pretty clear though, that the strongest suit of the entire film, is the colossal performance by lead actress Haley Bennett, who is a new face to me, but one that I will not be forgetting. She sells her spellbound character with flying colors. By the end of the film, she may very well have struck you with her emotive capability.The only thing that stops the film from being a harder recommend is that it is a true slow-burner, all the way through, making this movie more likely to fare better with the patient, and those who are fans of film as artistry. Due to this, I also don't see it as having much replay value, but overall this is a decadent offering and still one of the best movies I have seen come out in 2020. Very curious to see what both Carlo Mirabella-Davis and Haley Bennett do next."}, {"id": 145, "text": "A Pica disorder would surely spell suicide for me, as I have trouble even swallowing the smallest pill. So fear has a way of piquing the curiosity; figured I'd give this one a go. Haley Bennett is, as always, a beautiful eyeful. The girl you wished lived next door with that classic, zaftig, reverse S-shape figure. Instead you get some Frances McDormand look-a-like always asking if you have a spare beer. In the past, Bennett has been kneecapped by lousy directors and insipid scripts. Those films were so dull and repetitive with plain landscapes best viewed through kaleidoscopes. Not this one. The cinematography is lush, vibrant and, at times, stunning. As are the settings along the Hudson Valley. And how about that house! Sadly, she squanders it in this. Her performance teeters on near Xanax overdose. Maybe she was going for this, considering she plays a woman not only with Pica but also PTSD. Still, there is a sleepwalking through the role thing happening here. Her movements are glacial, much like the film's pacing. At least her character develops. Near the end, her ice melts, and we see some of the old Haley we know and love. Signs of life. The rest do not. They are more like bad ideas about characters, skeletal and under-imagined, rather than actual, fleshed out characters. This makes the entire storyline hard to, well, swallow...like a battery or a jack.Since I'm at the end of the review, I'd like to address one more thing. Something that gave me tsuris and caused me to take umbrage. I nearly gave the movie a 1 out of 10 because of this. The gratuitous, heartless depiction of animal cruelty in the beginning of the film has no place here or anywhere for that matter. I see what the ham-handed director was trying to do with this. Symbolism. Metaphor. Whatever. It's a cold, cruel, clumsy attempt at film poetry. Go and study the films of Herzog or Roeg. Watch how the masters do it without shock, just substance. It's what they don't show. What they leave to the imagination. This is what makes the lasting impression."}, {"id": 146, "text": "So after seeing the original, (where a woman with an unusual birth defect comes to a doctor who has an unorthodox solution to make the best of her situation), I decided to watch its companion film; Swallow (2019), close to 47 years later!

We were desperately searching for this film. Nowhere to be found! Confused, as we called in earlier to ask if the store had this film, we went to the clerk to see what gives??? Stunned to find that the film was misplaced in the thriller section. Well, I was angry, I myself have two kids (Jake, age 8 and Porter, age 4). To know, that films like this could be easily checked out was unnerving to say the least. I asked the clerk for his name and business card and told him to expect a call to his manager about this. Anyway, i did the right thing. So we rented the damn thing and went back home extremely anxious. We both grabbed our preferred essential oils (I personally choose Grape Seed Oil - try it) pulled down our trousers and put on Swallow (2019). Boy, was this a different freaking movie or what!? It took a good while before the girl finally put the first marble in her mouth. Me and my bud looked at each other with raised eyebrows and grinning smiles (the kind of smiles where we see all teeth and gums). But then... that's it!... I mean things happen sure, but no pizza delivery guy or any kind of police/inmate situation. Nope, just normalcy like eating dirt or having Syrian men lie underneath beds with you, stuff like that. We do learn things though, for sure. Apparently Syrians don't swallow marbles because they're being shot at? Can someone confirm this?? Anyway, we were left hangin'. In conclusion, we thought we'd get Deep Throat 2 but instead we got Swallow (2019). 7/10For more reviews pretty much like this one, follow me y'all !"}, {"id": 147, "text": "I've never heard of the condition called Pica .

How about a push-pin? A battery? Any other items normally considered inedible? If not, you likely don't suffer from the psychological disorder known as pica - an eating disorder at the center of the feature film debut from Carlo Mirabella-Davis. While pica may be new and confounding to most of us, the real story is what drives someone to swallow items that could be harmful and cause severe pain?Haley Bennett (THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN) stars as Hunter Conrad, a newly married trophy wife to spoiled and handsome Richie Conrad (Austin Stowell). Richie is so entitled that his even more entitled dad (David Rasche) makes a big deal out of promoting his son to partner by proclaiming at a dinner party that he earned it. Oh and this is after the parents bought the newlyweds a stunning home with a view. It's obvious Hunter 'married up' from a socioeconomic perspective, but her GQ husband pays more attention to his cell phone than he does to his wife or the picture perfect dinners she prepares. Hunter's Mother-in-Law (Elizabeth Marvel) offers up awkward support and passive-aggressive compliments ... such as a self-help book entitled A Talent for Joy.The book is a gift to Hunter immediately after Richie tells his parents We're pregnant! A passage in the book mentions to 'push yourself to experience new things'. It's at this point where Hunter sees herself become even more of an accessory within the family. One morning she spots a decorative marble and pops it in her mouth. She seems to take pleasure in this, and ... um ... after it passes, displays it as some type of trophy. Soon other items join the marble on display, until finally, Hunter is in so much pain, she's rushed to the hospital for surgery.Pica is a disorder that's difficult to understand. Haley seems to be complacent, having no real persona other than her pretty face and pristine wardrobe. Swallowing the items evidently delivers the feeling lacking in her life - a life where her job seems to be becoming the perfect wife, mother, and daughter-in-law. Worried about the safety of the unborn baby, the family hires Luay (Laith Nakli), a Syrian live-in nurse, to keep an eye on Hunter. Oddly enough, the war-toughened Luay shows more compassion to Hunter than anyone in the family.The film shifts gears a bit when we start learning more of Hunter's backstory during her trips to the psychiatrist (Zabryna Guevara). This backstory is of course tragic and explains a great deal about Hunter's strange compulsion. It also leads to a sequence with Denis O'Hare, who is a welcome presence in most any movie. The two share a scene that allows Hunter to fill in the gaps of her life.Director Mirabella-Davis doesn't treat the rich as caricatures, but rather symbolic of the self-centeredness that seems to go with wealth. We see good in places we don't expect it. We lack the trust in places we should be able to depend on. Additionally, we question whether finding one's true self through genetics makes any real sense when compared with just making up one's mind about the kind of person they want to be. This is a disturbing, trippy, darker-than-expected film with an interesting score from composer Nathan Halpern. When it veers from the skirts of horror and suspense towards political and social topics, the film loses steam and tries to cram in a bit too much. Still, it's an unusual and creative film with a terrific performance from Ms. Bennett, and leaves us looking forward to the next Mirabella-Davis project."}, {"id": 149, "text": "This movie was a wild ride from beginning to finish, I've never seen anything like it in my whole life and I highly doubt I will again. The tags for this movie threw me off a little bit, but I think that's understandable considering this movie pulled from elements of drama and coming of age sentiments and when consider the content of the film. This is definitely a hard watch and very gross throughout the majority of the film, that aside, all of those moments are drowned out by the context of what's going on in the film. There's abuse, manipulation, selfishness and so many heavy things going on surrounding what is presented to us in the trailer. With that being said, though, it makes for some really incredible and moving moments that left me speechless. This is one of those films that at times could be predictable if you think about it, but a lot of the time what happens is very unpredictable at the same time. It's one of those movies that leaves you thinking and reflecting, despite some flaws. Of course, it's not the ideal or perfect movie and I'm not sure if and when I'll watch it again, but I can't say I don't have the urge to do so. The acting here by Haley Bennett is absolutely superb, I feel that without her presence in the film this wouldn't have been nearly as good. She's one of those actresses that I'm going have to go watch more movies featuring her considering I haven't seen many of her movies except for some from years ago that I barely remember haha. Overall though, if you're looking for horror or to be scared by this film, I don't think this is particularly scary and only set in that genre solely(as I've mentioned above). How the movie is made almost makes it seem like it doesn't a genre because of how different it is, it's definitely a work of art. Had this movie come out not during the pandemic it probably would have done better in numbers than it has. But I think at the end of the day the art of a film will always matter more than trying to make money or cater to the masses, this film is a very good representation of that. I recommend taking the movie with a grain of salt though, it's purely fictitious and meant to promote a deeper meaning.

It's never quite horrific enough for horror fans, there's not a lot of suspense, and it's probably too disturbing for more traditional drama fans, but it packs a major, unexpected punch thanks to an astounding performance by Haley Bennett.Swallow revolves around a recently pregnant housewife named Hunter (Bennett) who spends her days cleaning, eating, and watching TV. Her husband (Austin Stowell) and his parents are somewhat dismissive of her and have a habit of cutting her off before she can speak. In a cry for help, Hunter begins eating strange items such as marbles, paper clips, and batteries.Her new hobby goes unnoticed for only so long before she's outed and her new family tries to get to the bottom of her behavior and we learn that it could be tied to a less than ideal childhood.Bennett's holds Swallow together with her sad, haunting performance. Never have a series of forced smiles at a dinner party been so painful to watch. She's in just about every shot of the film and her performance is what you come out of the film remembering.The film takes a turn midway through where you might get nervous that the filmmakers aren't sure where they're going, but it ends in a satisfying and very pro-woman way which I appreciated.Swallow is one of those kinds of films they just don't make very often. It's very character driven and isn't afraid to get a little nasty along the way."}, {"id": 151, "text": "If you liked: The Assistant Invisible Man ShirleySwallow is a 2019 film about Hunter - a young, pregnant housewife who has a seemingly perfect life. Coming from a bad background, she managed to get a good husband who provides her with anything she needs, and her in-laws are nice and understanding.But then Hunter discovers something peculiar about herself. She stars to feel an insatiable urge to swallow different objects, that should not be swallowed. A glass ball here, a chess piece there.. And although she doesn't realize this, this new diet is the only thing that she could ever decide for herself, the only thing that she has power over; because her life has long turned into a nightmare controlled by somebody else, without her noticing it. One of the worst things you could do to a person is to stop them from expressing themselves. To silence their voice in such a way, that they think you're actually doing them a favor. And then they got to ask themselves: am I a pretender or am I an individual?Swallow is a very tough and a very serious film. Like Bombshell, it uses cinema to express things that are incredibly hard to express with words. There has been a trend on domestic horror, which take place in the real world, where everyday things turn into something horrifying, and where all the monsters are the people around us (Hereditary, The Assistant, Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always). Definitely not for action lovers, but that doesn't make it one ounce worse."}, {"id": 152, "text": "On the plus side this is a well-made movie and the location on the Hudson River above NYC is very picturesque. For me the main reason to enjoy this movie is the performance of Haley Bennett as the afflicted young wife, Hunter. She is really good in the role.There is a malady called pica and if you look it up you'll find all those things depicted in this story, eating ice, swallowing metallic objects, eating paper, eating dirt, etc. The story attempts to tie Hunter's behavior to aspects of her birth and upbringing, and includes some sessions with a therapist, but the sum of its parts is muddled. We see the story arc but it does not tie up neatly into a whole story.Hunter's new husband is the son of a very wealthy family and he himself is head of a corporation. The whole family, son, dad, mom, treat Hunter as a curiosity, a mystery to be solved, dictating what she should do, even forcing her to have a male nurse follow her at home 24/7 to make sure she quits swallowing things that might yet again send her to the hospital.Naturally she reaches a breaking point and has to get out of the situation, but where does she go from there?A moderately interesting movie, I watched it at home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped."}, {"id": 153, "text": "Hayley is a revelation. She gives a masterclass in restraint and control, creating a superbly complex character with loads of psychological undertow, with a minimum of gestures and facial expressions. She makes overactresses inlike The Streep appear ridiculously and unnecessarily over the top. I recently re watched Julie &amp;Julia, and couldn't stop laughing all the way through at the clownish rendering of Julia Child by Ms Streep. Seriously, who thinks this sort of tiresome overacting is thespian art? If I were Julia Child's estate, I'd sue the entire production of that sorry film for the caricaturing of a real historical person they were collectively responsible for. Just go away the lot of you. Let smouldering young artists like Hayley shine. What a mesmerising performance! Giving a potentially mawkish premise dignity and complexity, despite a weakish third act. This is acting beyond the method or the typical histrionics of Hollywood royalty. She is a terrific counterpoint to the in-laws from hell and the wimpish toddlerish mummy's boy husband. The gruesomeness of her final act of rebellion against all this socially sanctioned conventionality and repression becomes totally acceptable as her way to take some control over her life. A gorgeous woman, with conventional movie star looks, whose emotional and other intelligence burns fiercely under the surface. She couldn't do anything other than to act out of such intelligence. Hayley, you go girl, can't wait to see you in ever better movies worthy of your extraordinary talent."}, {"id": 154, "text": "Carlo Mirabella-Davis makes a strong case for body autonomy in the form of 'Swallow', set against the backdrop of pica - an eating disorder. It's told almost entirely from the perspective of Hunter Conrad, a supposedly fine homemaker who is living with her husband (the wealthy CEO of his father's corporation) at their wonderful lakeside home. Hunter is initially shown to be happy playing the at-home-wife's role and considers herself lucky to be where she is - we're told she hails from a lower strata of the society. She enjoys deciding the drapes of the house, planting flowerbeds near the pool, and cooking meals for her husband.The signs of her obsession to consume inanimate items is spectacularly showcased in a family dinner scene. Hunter is coerced into telling something embarrassing by her husband, but her father-in-law deems it trivial and cuts her off midway to discuss more significant office matters. Hunter then gazes at ice melting in a glass and noticeably crunches a few cubes in her mouth. This is shrugged off as a thing that happened.Before we know it, things escalate. Hunter begins to feel a sense of momentary liberation with each object she consumes and defecates. The horror here is intricate but not always palpable, and that's the beauty of it. That she ingests reasonably sharp objects while being pregnant, will make your stomach churn to a fair extent. Haley's performance is incredible - the mystifying smile she puts up after gulping stuff down is a knockout! The supporting cast, featuring the likes of Austin Stowell, Denis O'Hare, Laith Nakli, David Rasche, and Elizabeth Marvel, is quite solid.The film then moves to a subplot concerning Hunter's past. In the meantime, a domestic help is hired by the Conrads. The caretaker relates to Hunter's turmoil - he's from war-torn Syria. There's an amusing scene where she hides under a bed (after trying not to eat soil) and he just lays by her side, comforting her. What follows felt like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of the opening scene from Leigh Whannell's The Invisible Man (my bad that I watched Swallow weeks after The Invisible Man, maybe!).The closure to the aforementioned subplot is, while not too convincing, completes Hunter's character arc in its own peculiar way. I'd have liked some more exchanges between Hunter and her mother, or even some of her acquaintances, instead of just the Conrads. I get it that the writer-director wants to focus on how the husband and the in-laws begin exerting more of their authoritative influences on her body (now carrying the family's scion). But, for the film to have had greater impact, it should have shed a little extra light on how she ended up with Richard, how the Conrads do not have a clue of her background, and more on those lines.Nathan Halpern's twitchy music and Davis' unusual choice of visuals (and color palette) compounds the severity of many a scene. While it's not recommended for everyone's viewing, it's a film that I'll keep in mind for those who seek unsettling, psychological horror."}], "reviews_amount": 155}
