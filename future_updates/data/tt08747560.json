I did not expect a movie with such a different story in an industry which is laden with generic stories of hope, love and themes alike.The story was also eye-opening as I was not aware of the concept of 'honor killing' (Not too sure if this is the right term) within the community of the elderly. I am really saddened to learn that this actually happens in India and I hope people would change their perception of the elders. This movie paves the path towards this as it presents the elderly in a new light.Indians praise the Korean movie scene which has loads of movies with unusual stories. Guess what? We have an excellent candidate to contend now!I only have one problem with the movie. The opening scene has a small logic flaw whereby the elderly person actually managed to walk immediately after waking up from his coma. This is technically not possible at all. However, bear in mind that this DOES NOT affect my opinion of the movie as it is still a masterpiece!"}, {"id": 1, "text": "A Gem for tamil cinema Ramasamy sir and master Nagavishal lived as Karupudurai and Kutty...

I see a National award for Nagavishal this year. Brilliant dialogues and excellent presentation from the director Madhumita. Background score was perfect encore. Sarcasm aplenty, this will keep you hooked.This is a story about the old man KD who is wanted dead by his children for monetary gain and the orphan child Kutty who was left to die at a temple. The kid like old man and the mature Kutty form an outstanding combination. The story treatment is absolutely fabulous and poetic.This movie is more than the checklist that some keep referring to."}, {"id": 6, "text": "This beautiful movie comes in a time where movies r filled with mysogyny n loads of fitments just for commercialisation to cater to the business of cinema ignoring the Art n craft of story telling in a natural way.

The cast has been brilliant delivering what is expected of them. The chemistry between kutty n KD just went straight to my heart leaving a great impact on me. These movies have to be lauded for the purity in it. The team has done a great job and I wish Director Madhumita makes more such pure movies with great art n craft.

Ageing is not a curse but an experience and it varies person to person. KD's simple aspirations gets fulfilled with the help of Kutty. Both characters are intense and they have done a commendable job. I loved the expression on Valli when she meets KD. Interesting observations made by Hitler to find KD is more than Sherlock Holmes. Muthu plays a key role. EQ of Kutty is beyond imagination and hope the society matures to nurture such kids like the HRC person. It's a treat from beginning to end without any nonsense.

How KD evades this blasphemous act and join hands with a quirky but kind-hearted kid on a journey of wishful thinking! The emotions are played our real and pure.

Cinematography was exceptional, showcasing the rustic beauty of the southern countryside. Dialogues and story writing were too good. Climax is too good! One negative aspect is that the subtitles were pathetic!

Quite many a time, seriously ill patients with advancing age with the myriad of medical illnesses that complements the geriatric population often gets admitted to his unit. Invariably, the patient's children would insist that their moribundly ill elders get all the best treatment that money can buy. The oft-repeated dialogue would be, money is not a problem. My friend knows it is no use flogging a dead horse but like a good servant he is, he obliges, every time.The tide would be going against the acutely ill patient. The next of kins would, however, stay hopeful. The life is literally hanging on a thread, living on a prayer. But hope lies eternal in the human heart.Days move ever so slowly but the patient's condition did not improve. Slowly, the number of visitors hanging around the visitors' lounge becomes thin. People have to go back to their daily routine. One has to live for the living. Occasionally, the nurses can hear arguments amongst siblings. One busybody nurse overheard one relative threatening to stop contributing to the family coffers. Then another would butt in to say that the treatment is the least the family offer to the patient. And yet another would throw in the towel citing economic reasons. Collectively they all would agree that the successful one amongst them take the tab.Soon it would be a single relative hanging around to get daily updates on the patient's progress. Then the Universe will speak and lead to an amicable curtain call so as to give a suitable closure to the whole brouhaha. Nobody gives what the patient wants. The living decides what is best for the dying.Everyone says that there is an absence of sufferings on the other side. One can enjoy of all kinds, eternally satiating all the senses at a divine but first, one has to die. That is the problem. Nobody wants to die no matter how much one is convinced of life after death. This offbeat but entertaining drama tells of an unconventional bond between an 80-year-old man, KD, and young orphan boy, Kutty. This octagenarian was in a coma for three months. Lying in his daughter's home, given up by doctors, he holds on his life. Refusing to die, he becomes a burden to his 5 kids. They just want to go on with their lives. One sibling wants to marry off her daughter. Another is waiting for his inference to settle his debt. The youngest child, however, does not like the idea but relents anyway when collectively the family members decide to terminate the old man miseries by performing euthanasia using traditional village methods. By a twist of fate, the 80-year-old came around at the precise moment, overheard the conversation, and scooted off the scene on a local bus. He paid the fare for the last stop but the bus broke down in the middle of nowhere. KD decided to hang around a small temple, help around the temple, and make acquaintance with Kutty.His friendship with Kutty gives KD a new lease of life. Kutty, an orphan, a street smart boy, was left at the doorstep of the temple at infancy. For the first time in his life, Kutty found love in an adult. Kutty made KD's bucket list and together they try to fulfil the list. The family, upon realising KD's disappearance, assigns a private investigator who is hot on the old man's trail. Another entertaining story with a picturesque spread of the Indian countryside. It has its fair share of quirky moments as two members of different generations try to find commonality.A lesson to learn: Do not let your family members decide the fate of your life. When your faculties are no longer yours to make a decision, they will make decisions that suit them or what is expected of them by society. Your suffering will be their bargaining chip. Write a legally binding declaration of refusing resuscitation when the situation arises. Have a difficult but necessary discussion of opting to turn off the plug when things do not look promising. Let people remember you as the ambulant and cheery person you are; not as the pain with tubes that drained half of the family heirloom, if there is any left."}, {"id": 220, "text": "A charming small movie about the relationship between brave Kutty and solely Karuppu durai (later he names him Kd). Madhumita narrates the heartwarming story of an old man, who leaves his house as he hears a plan of killing him after waking up from Coma.He meets a stubborn orphan Kutty who lives in a temple.Kutty shows no respect for Kd ,argues with him but Kd loves to be with him. Madhumita places beautifully designed scenes to make the journey smooth.The scenes where they discusses and finishes all wish list is truly a treat to watch and it stays with you. Bgm aptly switched mood from humour to intense emotions and switching seems to be quite natural and organic. Mu ramasamy-Naga Vishal combo provides an engaging flow to the movie and On screen,they share wonderful individual performance too.Ramasamy really amazes in emotional scenes when kd hears the conversation initially and when he says to Kutty about his school admission. Dialogues too were funny enough and spot on . The only drawback I found was the lack of clarity towards the climax . Kd in short is a journey of pure joy."}, {"id": 221, "text": "Karuppu Durai (Mu. Ramaswamy) is a bedridden old man. One day,his children (except his daughter) plot to perform a traditional ritual of euthanasia on him as they think he will be a long term burden to them. They are also eyeing his property. Karuppu overhears this,and summons as much energy as he can to escape from the house. He takes a bus to a nearby locality and spends the night at a temple there. In the morning,he is greeted by a cheeky young boy (Nagavishal) of about 7 or 8 years of age who scolds him for sleeping at the spot which he has reserved for himself. KD soon finds out that the boy is an orphan who was adopted by the temple pandit. From then on, the old man keeps getting into trouble with the boy, but soon enough, circumstances change and both of them become close buddies. The boy creates a bucket list for KD,as he's already in his twilight years. In the meantime,Karuppu Durai's children enlist the help of a guy to track him down. This is a heart touching tale of an unusually close bond between two people,one whose life is almost ending,and of a child whose future is just about to unfold. How long will this friendship last? Will KD's family find him and put him to involuntary death? The director must be appreciated for injecting lots of humour into what could possibly have been a depressing story. Nagavishal, in his debut role, wins hearts with his cheeky mannerisms and toothy smile, while Mu. Ramaswamy warms hearts with his frequent bursts of laughter. All in all, this story is about making the most of what we have, even under pressing circumstances."}, {"id": 222, "text": "Have never witnessed such a poetic travel with an orphaned boy and an old man who is deserted by his family..

The Back ground score is a story teller by itself.The Pulse of the movie is its nativity, In most of such village based stories, while the entire cast is native looking and dark, the heroines are mostly the calendar girls of Vijay Mallaya who are pathetic in their roles. But in this movie the heroine is a 70 year old lady with wrinkles in the face who comes in for just 2 shots. But the shyness that she brings in that face in a split second just by itself is worth watching this movie.
