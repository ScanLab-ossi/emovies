The film revolves around the evolution of cricket in Afghanistan.A country that has been ruined by wars in the recent and past. But the true sacrifice made by the Afghan teenagers and their rock solid belief of indulging in non-violence,is something that uplifts the sentiments of the viewers. The film has got a twisted ending and keeps the viewers glued to the screen,till the final ending. This film shows how revolution can be brought about even if a single individual changes his mind,thereby influencing an entire community. The storyline has a lot of parts which are indeed very true and the screenplay has been absolutely fantastic.The initial part of the film is a bit slow,oscillating between the past and the present life of a doctor and his family who are stationed in Afghanistan. Amidst turbulence and action,how peace paves the way for the better to happen,is something that has been well depicted in this film.All in all cricket is something we all love to watch,talk and hear about.But building a cricket team in a disturbed nation is something that tests the true character of a person.

The movie mildly attempts to give you a view on innocent pakhtuns children and the brainwashing that goes on by the adult taliban and the fear that is instilled in them.I give this movie a 7 mainly for its attempt to give people a view of Afghanistan today through the vision of children and I would ask people to ignore the poor ratings and watch this movie."}, {"id": 444, "text": "Kudos to the entire cast.

The Director captures the mood of a haunting war destroyed Afghanistan as well as the raw and simple innocence of children. Cricket is not just a sport but a metaphor for a life that can be lived to simple rules- a team game that can overwhelm traditional clan enmities. Without really attempting to , the director exposes the hollowness of extreme right wing fanatics. Not through any display of masculinity and force but by demonstrating the alternative to terrorism. The background of Afghanistan real cricket team and what it had to do to play international cricket in war torn country comes through. Set in the beautiful Afghan landscape with Nature at its best. An enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar. I really loved this film and highly recommend this to everyone.

This one is different since it shows young boys of a refugee camp in Afghanistan being groomed to form a cricket team by an ex Indian Army doctor ( Sanjay Dutt) from India, who had lost his wife and son there in a terrorist attack. On the other side we a local Taliban terrorist Rahul Dev objecting to his boys playing cricket since it was coming in the way of him using these boys as suicide bombers. Both Sanjay Dutt and Rahul Dev have a confrontation where Rahul allows one match to be played. A plain tale told in an equally plain though engaging manner. However the director has captured the outdoor location effectively, the songs used have good lyrics and add to the impact of the scenes. The cinematography is excellent which makes the film visually appealing. Sanjay Dutt acts adequately within the narrow scope provided to the character.

I have never seen such a heavily upvoted movie in my life.I think IMDB is going to suffer from this, as obviously they aren't doing anything about it.Amazon ignored their fake reviews for years until their customers finally got fed up and it became a well known joke. The same is happening here. I'm thinking IMDB is getting paid as some of these accounts are obviously created with help. 1 review in the last week with an account of 8 years? Whatever.With all the ads, and trailers you'd think that this website would at least try to keep it honest.I'm slowly moving to other sites as this is just getting out of hand.

The visual backdrop and cinematography are breathtakingly stunning and you can clearly understand the intention of the director Girish Malik's vision about giving war torn children a positive motive to live their lives. Their harsh experience and upbringing is taken into consideration when you see the child actors arguing with Sanjay Dutts character (some of my favourite parts of the film). It's definitely a fine balance of entertainment and serious cinema while not being too expositional which Bollywood could do more of.All the actors have been finely cast, from Rahul Dev's stellar performance as the negative Talibani to Sanjay Dutt bringing to life a role that portrays a broken man doing his best to overcome his past trauma of losing a wife and child, so you do end up sympathizing with him. Kuwarjeet Chopra also does well, bringing a subtle edge again refreshingly devoid of melodramatic acting doing justice to his part. The child actors, a firm favourite throughout bring in a quick witted and raw sharp appeal which ends up making them see the 'real deal' surrounding the chaos and destruction caused by the adults they're bound to and who come to save them. The end of the film looked like it was heading to be a victorious win of the underdog in sports genre films BUT without giving it away, the unexpected twist leaves you stumped and saying that was cleverly done!"}, {"id": 642, "text": "In a country where children have seen more terrorism than books and bats, promoting cricket is an impossible task. Netflix Torbaaz movie is a story of hope. Hope .. of a happy life, of humanity, of fulfilling dreams, of a better tomorrow. The theme of this film revolves around terrorist activities happening in Afghanistan.Torbaaz film is a heart touching story that shows the mood of people battling fanatics and children living in refugee camps.How do children brainwash by terrorists, what effect does it have on them and their family. All of this is shown in the film. Girish Malik, who wrote the script, is quite weak and fails to hold up for two hours.The director was also not impressed with this sensitive story. Length is also a big reason for this. The initial one hour of filming only takes the story.The story moves extremely slowly. At the same time, the story picks up in the second half, but in the Climax, it is scattered like a card.The theme of the film and the thinking behind it is good .. positive. Bringing together fascism and cricket is also interesting. But coming to the screen, the soul of the film is no longer there.Sanjay Dutt is cast in the role of Naseer Khan. He has a good rapport with the kids .. especially in the emotional scenes. However, there was a shortage of a cricket coach. Also, when Sanjay Dutt is in the film, some action scenes are also expected, but there is a disappointment here.Nargis Fakhri looks like a bag in a small roll. The talent of Rahul Dev in the character of terrorist Abdul Qazar has also been completely lost by the director.Well, the strongest side of the film is the children .. makes 'Torbaaz' worth watching for two hours .. especially Eshan Javed Malik, Rehan Sheikh, and Rudra Soni.Overall, Torbaaz can be omitted because it does not deliver the intense massage with the intensity it deserves. It is a cumbersome film made on a good subject, so giving it two hours would be a waste of time."}], "reviews_amount": 643}
