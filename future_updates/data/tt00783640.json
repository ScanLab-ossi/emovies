I never cry watching movies but this one really touched my heart!!! A must see! :')"}, {"id": 1, "text": "I totally loved the movie. My mother, my aunt and I went to go see it and it was very emotional for us. I'm so glad to finally see, what went into getting our cousin, the Congressional Medal Of Honor. Also, just putting this out there. It states here, William Hart Pitsenbarger Jr but he was not a junior. He was not named after anyone, except for his middle name, which was his mother's maiden name. I would also like to note, that Diane Ladd played Alice Pitsenbarger but Alice Pitsenbarger was not Williams' mother. His mother passed away in 1991. Alice was his fathers 2nd wife. Williams' mothers name was, Irene Emma (Hart) Pitsenbarger. I know this because William was my family. My great-grandmother and his grandfather, were brother and sister."}, {"id": 2, "text": "After seeing 1917 I really wasn't expecting much when I started watching the movie. 1917 would be a tough act to follow. I have to say now that at least for me...the true war Story vs a hearsay war story was way better.. At the time I knew nothing about William Pitsenbarger. I'm glad I refused all temptation to do a Google Search before watching the movie, I simply followed the story and was not disappointed. Beautifully written and I'm sure you will tear up, once you hear multiple witnesses describing the Airman's heroics."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Beautiful made movie! It's a movies which didn't bring out the violence of the war, but a emotional and touchy story of a hero. It's really rare that we even see a Vietnam war movies. I literally cried throughout the whole movies. Very glad to see. Great pick on actor and subject! Love the concept that this movie has brought hope to our life. PTSD was well written and showed in front of us. All the suffers that those veterans had been through. Great storyline based on real story. For sure that this story has heart , I really hope that people can see, feel and understand what veterans had been through and provide support for them. Definitely recommend!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "This was a great movie. People who nit-pick it miss the point. Movies are supposed to entertain us, they are not history lessons. Sure there are a few mistakes, but nothing that detracts from the story or the man's heroism.And for you guys talking about his sergeant strips that change did not take effect until Oct. 1967 and this action happened in April 1966. At the time of the action his 3-stripes indicated Senior Airman, which is still an Airman.Sit back and enjoy the film. I'm sure you won't regret it. God bless you William Pitsenbarger."}, {"id": 5, "text": "First of all, I have never seen a movie take on a war story like this. Think Hacksaw Ridge, meets Saving Private Ryan without all the gore. It's not about the nations, the generals, the guns, or the tanks- it's about the people. The Last Full Measure is a Drama that happens to be a war movie. Plus, you have never seen performances like those given by William Hurt, Ed Harris, Sam Jackson, Diane Ladd, and Chris Plummer. I got to see the movie at a special screening in Washington DC, and the entire audience, including military brass, had tears running down their cheeks by the end. And, trust me, they weren't tears of sorrow-It leaves you with a feeling of joy and gratitude for any solider who places themself in the line of fire. Anyone who doesn't appreciate this film has no empathy. I would highly recommend seeing this in theaters, not just for the action, but to fully appreciate the nuances in these actors' eyes. I went with my grandmother who doesn't usually like war movies, and she won't stop talking about it."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Second review I 24 hours being off work sick has its advantages!! I saw the low review point on this but watched it anyway because of the cast, it nearly has a better cast than the Irishman !!!! I'm not American ... I did not serve in Vietnam nor do I know anyone that served in that war as some keyboard warrior reviews seem hung up on. I enjoyed a well written well acted movie and I'm not ashamed to say I sat here and cried for the last 10 mins, not something I do for movies I think ET in the cinema was the last time. This movie slowly wrapped its storyline around my heart, gripped me till the end and and didn't disappoint. Disregard the low ratings and rants from wannabe movie critics this is a movie to enjoy and cherish every moment of they don't make them like this too often and when they do movies like this have a habit of falling between the same cracks spoken in the movie. Enjoy it for what it is, a journey for more than one person including the viewer."}, {"id": 7, "text": "On occasion I have been courageous. Sometimes I see it in others. But where and in the time I live, is the easy abundant safe culture, becoming devoid of values of character and promoting self interest above all else. This story is important, since in time, it may be seen as a fictitious fable that few will be able to identify with. A few need to live and tell such stories. More than anything, I'm glad I have the insight that allowed me the privilege of seeing and understanding this movie. War doesn't leave us, it simply changes shape. Nowadays we have the war for control of our minds, wallets and spirits. No blood spilled, just dumbing down. This is a well told story of humility, selflessness and sacrifice. I won't be around later when no-one identifies or cares about this story, or other stories like it. And I wouldn't want to live in that time anyway."}, {"id": 8, "text": "An EXCELLENT Movie..Fantastically True Story,Great Stars,acting top notch.All round a VERY Moving,Gripping Movie...Top Marks"}, {"id": 9, "text": "This is not a war movie.

But the soldiers have nothing to do with the decision. I see this at a very human level, a story of great sacrifice and going beyond one's job or duty to save others lives at one's own peril. The movie provides an opportunity for those who haven't been at war to experience the trauma of loss. Particularly of a person who saved your life. I never saw the point of medals given posthumously. I now see why. This movie educated me through my heart and my empathy, not through my head. The actors, the direction, the music and the editing was just right. There are cheesy parts; they are brief, its like too much icing on a good cake. One can easily ignore them and enjoy the movie"}, {"id": 14, "text": "What an incredibly touching movie (with a beautiful score I might add). Of course it is still fiction and part of the story needs to be redirected. But what an accomplish and feat of a film to get to the core of Pitsenbarger as well as the lost and forgotten men. It's not a typical war movie (as it focuses on the aftermath, the honoring of a hero and those that fought for him for over 30 years). In doing so, keeps it unique and fresh. It focuses on PTSD, veterans and the effects to loved ones, friends and family. I found myself in tears at various moments and just leaving as though I saw all the effort and years put into making this film. Phenomenal casting all around. Great directing by Todd Robinson."}, {"id": 15, "text": "I really enjoyed this movie, a lot of truth and a lot of forgotten honor."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Just finished this. The heartache felt by those vets and the burden they carry for fighting an unpopular war leapt off the screen for me. We owe them for what they gave up and gave us. All gave some, some gave all."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Inspired by a true storyCareer Civil employee Carlton Stanton (Bradley Whitford) assigns Scott Huffman (Sebastian Stan) an assignment to look into Retired Sgt Tully's (William Hurt) request that Helicopter Medic (AIC) Airman First Class William H. Pitsenbarger (Jeremy Irving) be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions back in the mid 1960s in the Viet Nam War. Currently, AIC Pitsenbarger holds the Air Force Cross. Stanton doesn't think this will go anywhere and that is why he gave the assignment to Scott Huffman because Scott is 3-months away from losing his job to higher ups. The word was there was not enough documentation to award the MOH.Scott Huffman takes the assignment and must interview former members of Charlie Company that AIC came down from a helicopter to help Charlie Company apparently in an ambush in Viet Nam. He helped the wounded, put wounded in the basket to be uplifted by the helicopter and ended up staying put to protect others when Sgt Tully told him to come up. Then he grabbed a rifle and ended up being shot.This is a very well told and well acted story and at times you may need a box of Kleenex.Notables who were in Charlie Company: Samuel L. Jackson as Billy Tokada; Peter Fonda as Jimmy Burr; Ed Harris as Ray Mott, and John Savage as Chancy Kepper who wrote the After Action Report of that battle; Robert Pine as Huffman Meridith who took Scott to the exact place in Viet Nam where the battle took place and you will see a lot of blue butterflies.Notables Other: Cristopher Plummer as Frank Pitsenbarger; Diane Ladd as Mrs. Pitsenbarger; Dale Dye as Senator Holt who tried to get the award approved in Congress but was shot down; Alison Sudol as Tara, Scott's wife; Hannah Black as young Jenny, Billy's love interest; Rachel Harker as adult Jenny. Here's the thing: Scott Huffman can get nowhere to get the MOH, Medal of Honor, for Billy Pitsenbarger and even turns down a promotion to be an Under Secretary of something. Now you have to understand that Scott Huffman is a fictional character and goes to the press to make his point. This being the case how did AIC Pitsenbarger actually get the MOH posthumously? I have no idea. This was not addressed. If this is inspired by a true story how is this left out? I asked this question because at the end of a true story normally, there is a statement at the end of the movie that tells what happened to the main character(s). This didn't happen in here. Then I found out Scott Huffman was a fictional character.Oh, one more thing. I saw Michael Imperioli's name in the credits, but I don't recall seeing him in the movie. If you watch this and see him as Jay Ford, let me know where he was in the movie.All this aside, takes nothing away from this well told story. I did check out that William H. Pitsenbarger did receive the MOH posthumously. The better title of this could have been The Cost of War.And William H. Pitsenbarger: May God have mercy on your soul and thank you.

Maybe someone never touched by an armed conflict directly, maybe someone who believes peaceful tactics are the best defense? I'm not certain.But I am certain this movie is worth the 90 minutes. Movies packed with well-know talent tend to do fairly well, although I don't think those who gave their time for this project were in it for the fame, or even the money. It was a project that needed to be completed, and people needed to know who Airman William H. Pitsenbarger, Jr. was, and who he was for so many men that day in April 1966.I'm confident in saying you'll enjoy this movie, perhaps not as much as I did, but it's worth investing your time in.

Each of the veterans (actors) in this film do a very good job of letting the world see the different ways in which each of deal with what took place in our individual wars. The friends that we lost there and here the feelings of sorrow the fears that still visit us daily and nightly can never full, I think, be portrayed but these actors do justice to them.

This is the lowest rating I've attributed to a film in quite a long time, and I see just about everything PG-13 and above.This film draws you in, initially, with that typical and predictable lure of ignorant government official learns a life lesson bit. Once it arrives at a place where the story begins to unfold - where most movies gain their momentum - this film remains stagnant and boring. It's either over-acted or under-acted, depending on the scene. Extremely anticlimactic.The highlight seems to be around painting the picture of a truly all-American hero with zero flaws (even Captain America had flaws), inside and out, who is deified for dieing on the battlefield among men he didn't know.

Highly recommend this serious, realistic dramatic movie."}, {"id": 96, "text": "I really enjoyed the entire movie and was caught off guard by the depth of emotions that were examined on screen and those the movie pulled from viewers! Their representation of PTSD was very accurate. Until my life was threatened again in 2001, I didn't know that I had lived most of my life with PTSD and knowing that helped me to forgive myself for some poor decisions and misunderstood reactions to others. It's not an easy diagnosis to live with or to fight to get rid of and this movie showed us that many victims are struggling all the time, but often out of sight. I was really grateful for the scenes where folks were encouraged to remember/talk about the issues. Sometimes people try to stop you from remembering/talking because they are afraid you'll stress out and blow a gasket or something - exactly the opposite, learning to talk about the issues with less emotions is what we are subconsciously driven to do. Being told, even indirectly, that you are a dangerously, emotional person who needs to be silenced and controlled does not encourage you to trust the person making that assessment. Some just don't want to hear your story as it makes them uncomfortable, but those are often people who either suffer themselves in silence (pray and sympathize for them) or they are just selfish - enough said on that! If you have someone in your life who needs to talk, try to allow that or help them find a safe place to do so.Although I kept the tissues handy throughout the movie, the dam broke over the Medal of Honor presentation ceremony. Having grown up in the time that many of my friends served and some died during the war the government officials still can't/won't call a war is still depressing and frustrating. People died, a lot of people, people are still bearing scars or minus limbs and families are still mourning the loss of young adults who gave their lives/peace of mind and sometimes pieces of their bodies - just like in a real war!I'm not very good at naming my favorite type of foods (probably the last meal eaten - Mexican, Thai, Indian or a huge salad), my favorite color (well, finally I do have one - purple, the color of our dog's vests for Psychiatric Service Dogs) or my favorite movie, book or song - again, probably the last one I watched, read or heard.The MOH presentation ceremony near the end of this movie is easily my favorite part of this fine film. It was great watching group after group rise to their feet until almost the entire room was standing. This should be a reminder to politicians and others that war, even when it's not officially called a war, spreads it's tentacles and touches lives far removed from the participants. And, it affects those lives, not for just a little while, but for the rest of the time they are alive.Wars, even those that aren't called wars, are serious, destructive and life altering for many. All who respond to protect others, are in my mind, heroes worthy of recognition - those in our armed forces, law enforcement, fire fighters, ambulance personnel and medical personnel treating others from the emergency room to the operating theater.This is an excellent movie to share with friends and family, Based Upon Real Life, historical with an outstanding cast!"}, {"id": 97, "text": "The Last Full MeasureThis movie tackled some very difficult subjects with a clever script and brilliant acting. It is very much an American story and certainly not for everyone.The narrative vehicle was a naive and ambitious administrator, played by Sebastian Stan, as he learned so we gradually understood, the meaning of posthumous honours, human valour, closure, selflessness and the enduring pain of those who survive.I can't say I enjoyed the movie by I certainly experienced it in a visceral way. Whoever developed this dry script into this movie deserves a Hollywood medal as it was a tour-de-force without descending into mush or sentimentality."}, {"id": 98, "text": "I loved every minute of it.. A story of a war hero never told.. Sabastian Stan does a great job in his lead role for the movie.... Get your tissues out for there will be tears"}, {"id": 99, "text": "A friend of mine recommended this film and said it made him very emotional. The story of William H. Pitsenbarger got to me as well, not so much regarding the thirty two year struggle to get him recognized for a Medal of Honor, but for the fact he didn't make it while saving the lives of fellow soldiers when he didn't even have to be there in the thick of battle. The story follows along conventional lines, as a career Defense Department civilian (Sebastian Stan) reluctantly takes on an assignment to investigate the circumstances of Pitsenbarger's denial of the MOH when first nominated. Setting aside a potential career promotion, Scott Huffman (Stan) is persuaded by the stories of fellow soldier combatants and the resolve of Pitsenbarger's parents to pursue the opening of the case to a rightful conclusion. Though the movie offers flashbacks of Vietnam war footage, that's not so much the focus of the movie as the loyalty and honor held for the lost airman by those who didn't even know him during the ferocious battle in which he died. For a similar story of courage under fire, but with a better outcome for it's hero, try the 2016 film Hacksaw Ridge, the story of Private Desmond Doss during World War II.

A story of courage under fire while facing impossible odds. I felt the producer, director, and support staff took the time to do this right. The actors are the finest in the business, but the people whom they portrayed made the story so human, so real. The fighting Vietnam was intense and friendly fire happened, all too often. Calling in an support fire while bullets and explosions are all around you, hitting you, is an impossible situation to be in. The director takes you there to experience. The editing is so well done that the viewer is drawn into middle and experiences the tension, the fear, the reality of the order of battle.

His audience, many who were not alive during the Vietnam War, learned how a bloody battle's survivors fought for the airman who had saved them, so he would receive the sanctioned acknowledgement he deserved.Watching this movie, I gained an appreciation of Pitsenbarger's sacrifices, the post war emotional and physical challenges of soldiers who fought in Vietnam over 50 years ago, and the struggles of working with military and congressional government officials.I left the theatre with the refreshed awareness that persistence and fresh perspectives really can make a difference."}, {"id": 125, "text": "The movie should be about Pitsenbarger and getting to see and know him.

Fittingly (since the aspect of Abilene most memorable for me was one of its livestock slaughterhouses), THE LAST FULL MEASURE documents how Operation Abilene was carefully crafted to become a slaughterhouse for the 100 or so men of Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment (the Big Red One), April 11-12, 1966. Just as most of the meat-packing personnel suffer severe PTSD symptoms throughout their shortened lives, THE LAST FULL MEASURE explores the effect of equally bloody gore upon the survivors of Operation Abilene. Surely this film is leading the 2021 Oscar Race right now, given the fine acting of an all-star cast, the deft plotting (packed with unpredictable twists or curve balls) and its verisimilitude. My main takeaway is that some traumatized vets such as Jimmy and Ray require lots of guns and ammo for therapeutic purposes. However, combat disabilities leave many of these heroes impoverished.

Pitsenbarger.Other heroes were the men who served briefly, but epically, in Vietnam with him, of the First Infantry Division.The real story would have been compelling enough. When this movie told the real story, it was noble and poignant. The movie faithfully depicted Pitsenbarger, an Air Force rescue squadron Pararescue Jumper, volunteering to replace the wounded medic of the Army platoon in harms' way. It showed him exposing himself to constant mortars and bullets. And it showed very accurately, him taking off the flak vest that was his best protection, and giving it to a grievously wounded Army soldier named Fred Navarro, whom he did not even know, so that he may live. And it showed him making a fateful effort to take up arms to thwart enemy advances on those Army soldiers, so that again they could live at the cost of his own life.It showed the extremely emotional Medal of Honor ceremony, where then Air Force Secretary Whit Peters delivered extremely powerful narration, and it showed the determination to successfully upgrade Pitsenbarger's medal to the top award for valor that our nation can bestow.it showed the scars that many from that battle suffered for the rest of their lives. The movie portrayed all of these momentous events in accurate and therefore powerful ways.Sadly, the movie also introduced falsehoods into the narrative, to depict political intrigue that simply never happened, and in doing that, it rendered a disservice. Truth is, the awards package was initially weaker than it should have been, and the medal was downgraded by senior theater commanders to the Air Force Cross, the top Air Force award for valor and the nation's second highest honor.The reasons it was downgraded to the AFC from the Medal of Honor are murkier than presented in this movie. There was never the pointless and petty squabble on the US Senate floor that this movie falsely represented happening.So, why does a flawed movie earn ten stars? Because, sometimes in life, what something achieves rises above the mark and overcomes ordinary limitations. By telling the truth in the faithful manner, by telling the true story of what William Pitsenbarger did, this movie rises to the level of perfection. The wrongs are too weak in comparison to detract from the strengths.That ultimately echoes precisely the perfection that Pitsenbarger's true actions meant to so many who needed his supreme sacrifice, his last full measure of devotion.It will take someone to watch the movie to understand and accept why!"}, {"id": 185, "text": "Reel Tunez Movie Review (1/27/20): The Last Full MeasureAfter seeing Black Hawk Down years ago, I really felt like seeing movies like this left me (and others) feeling like they lived through the hell of war and battles, and I've generally avoided many of these, but The Last Full Measure is an incredible story of bravery, honor, and true sacrifice!The story takes place in Vietnam, and is based on the true story of a REAL American hero.. William Pittsenbarger, a Air Force airman/medic who incredibly and with true bravery ended up sacrificing his life to save many others.As a USAF veteran, I watched this movie with a little more understanding of the mentality of those in the military.The quick notes of the story are based on this Air Force airman who put his life on the line and left the medevac helicopter to support his Army comrades who were under very heavy enemy fire with many killed and many severely injured. He was put up for the Medal of Honor (highest award for military bravery), but instead posthumously given a lower recognition. For over 30 years, those he saved fought the system to give him the true recognition he deserved. This is the story of that recognition, with flashbacks to what occurred which are sprinkled throughout the story.As a vet who didn't see combat, but who studied what occurred in Vietnam and with friends who are Nam vets, I can understand (but truly not know.. thank God) the horror these military members went through. None of my older Vietnam vet friends ever openly talk about the horrors, but every one of them clearly show the scars of that hell.. and for that, I and all who have served recognize and thank them for their bravery and their sacrifice! Some volunteered, some were drafted, but nearly all stood up to serve when called. All of them deserve our thanks no matter what the outcome of any war (or Un-declaired war), fight, offensive, or simply by serving their country in a way that always puts them in a situation where their lives could be sacrificed.This movie had a major cast that included: Sebastian Stan, Jeremy Irvine (as Airman Pitt (Pittsenbarger), Samuel L.

There are constant attempts to pull at heart strings to get away with it - and there is no relief from the sentimentalism anywhere. A good film should ebb and flow, build and relieve pressure and pathos. The pace of this film is slow throughout, the sentimental content is always on full blast, to the last detail. Of course the main character's wife is pregnant. Of course Samuel L Jackson's character is introduced fishing at the creek with his grandchildren. Does it still hurt grandpa?

The information in the film should be shown to all but not in a 2 hour feature film format. The only factor keeping this film's score from dropping is the fact that its heart is in the right place. The film is really trying to do the right thing with the story but where it completely falls apart is the execution. The film is presented so blandly and poorly that it becomes incredibly boring. The bore factor is made worse due to the 2 hour runtime. Whenever the veterans are not being interviewed, the film drags really heavily. It's incredibly boring and it's made worse by the fact that I don't care that much about Sebastian Stan's character. Most of the characters were very one note for me. They had little to no development besides two of them. It's very unfortunate because the two characters the Director tried to develop, I actually cared about. He has shown that he is able to make good characters based on real people but he just couldn't do it with the other characters. This lack of characterization isn't helped by some of the performances. Christopher Plummer and Ed Harris do a pretty good job but everyone else is okay or not great. Peter Fonda and Sebastian Stan had the weakest performances. I love Peter Fonda and it's really unfortunate this was his last film role before he died. Fonda and Stan displayed almost no emotion in their performances. They recited their dialogue in a really boring manner and felt out of place with the other actors. Samuel L. Jackson and William Hurt were fine. Their performances weren't that special and they were just kinda there. The cinematography and editing were very bland and boring. None of the shots were visually interesting. It was just bland back and forth shots except during the action scenes but during the action scenes, the camera is shaking so much that it's difficult to tell what is going on.

That manure is shoveled by politicians, movie producers with no clue, and history revisionists.This is the story of a young man who did something that went way over and above his training and mission requirements to save lives and fight beside men he didn't know. He gave all and made the ultimate sacrifice.People are whining and griping about the inclusion of a friendly fire incident, the guy's uniform, and other nonsense. BS. The truth is that there may have been a danger close fire mission that interrupted evac choppers and could possibly have resulted in casualties - but that's the nature of war and also not what the story's about.It's about a Medal of Honor recommendation that was downgraded to an Air Force Cross - possibly due to military bureaucracy, to cover up faulty intelligence, to not draw attention to a poorly planned operation, inter-service rivalry, or just plain laziness. You make the call. It doesn't matter.What does matter is that a Medal of Honor was wrongly downgraded and congressional &amp; Pentagon politics compounded the travesty for 34 years. It's a fantastic movie - in fact one of the best about that time &amp; place. Watch it - if you're a veteran, you'll understand. it's well worth your time."}, {"id": 195, "text": "This is inspired by the true story of Vietnam War hero William Pits Pitsenbarger. It's 1999. Scott Huffman (Sebastian Stan) is a civilian Pentagon staffer. He's connected, ambitious, and persuasive. Tom Tulley (William Hurt) is trying to get the Medal of Honor for his war buddy Pits. Huffman sees it as a dead end task and a waste of time. He'd rather spend his time on the budget and climbing the political ladder but he is forced to write up a report. As he tracks down the soldiers in the incident, he discovers the valor and honor in the men.There are quite a few great veteran actors here and they are all showing out. That's the best part of the movie. Their pain and their suffering is all on the screen. Everything else have some difficulties to varying degrees. First, Sebastian Stan has the A-hole character down pat to start the movie but he is unable to give a smooth progression to his character. I wonder if he's the actor for this role or maybe they should call up Captain America. Second, there is some political simplification and some naivety in the writing. It can't be that much of a political hit to give that Medal of Honor. In fact, there would be some salvation and political gain by doing this. It's like a defense attorney bringing out an ugly fact first and paint it in the most favorable light. Finally, there is never any problem with calling out a politician like that if you're worried about advancement. Hitting one side would make you a hero on the other side. Welcome to the game. This is a military warrior film. It may be inspired by a true story but reality of this true story is somewhat questionable."}, {"id": 196, "text": "Excellent movie and thank you Todd Robinson for making it. The acting is superb and the story needed to be told. As a 40+ year Army veteran, I cried numerous times and could not leave the theater right away because the movie took me through tremendous emotion and experiences. The real veteran's story clips at the end made me pray and thank God I made it through all my years safely. Thankfully the house lights didn't come up right away for my eyes were wet with joy and sorrow all at the same time and I just sat there and was the last one to leave the theater. Thankfully the theater didn't have the cleaning crew come in immediately following such a heart tugging movie; and fortunately, my father's name is not on the Wall even though he flew in Vietnam on 3 different tours for that would have made the movie unbearable. I normally don't write movie reviews, and in fact this is the first time. I was quite upset to see the professional critics chew up this movie listing technical deficiencies and other who cares crap and, in my opinion, totally missed the message of the movie. I'm glad it was not another Hamburger Hill, Platoon or Apocalypse Now - I think we've seen enough of those insanity war movies. War is ugly, hard and harrowing and thank God there are men and women who still put on the uniform everyday for a very UN-grateful nation that believe the military is Puffed Up and over paid. Vietnam veterans were spit on and pushed aside when they came home and they only did what soldiers had done before them. They were labeled Baby Killers and cast aside to fend for themselves.Hello Critics! The message was powerful, needed and shows hopefully many Americans just what someone goes through in combat and how when they come Home they never really heal. That to me is what the story really was. One of the characters made a mistake which cost lives and resulted in friendly fire. In a very chaotic battle for life with literal hell all around, the lieutenant called in fire with the wrong location and paid for it the rest of his life. The guilt of a survivor can be tremendous and some soldiers wish they had died with their comrades in combat. This movie, thankfully, did not make Vietnam veterans out to be crazed psychopaths but honest hurting Americans who paid an extremely high price in a very unpopular conflict. The ending was beautiful as the main character did not fail under pressure with the military/government bureaucracy but pressed the final battle for just one Medal of Honor recipient and by so doing showed everyone in the movie theater and I pray everyone who sees it that the actions of one man, and the actions of all veterans, touches more than just one family; it touches us all if we are willing to listen. Now, we step onto the field of battle of our own choice, there is no draft now, because as flawed as this nation is and how ungrateful this nation is on a whim, I served and others serve so that Americans can have a choice and dislike a President verbally, visually, on social media and outright slander a President with no fear of retribution - try that in China, Iran, North Korea, Russia or many other countries. One critic made a statement that the ending was poor because it left the audience feeling like it was all right now after the big presentation. I don't think so at all! Nowhere in the movie did it indicate that and they all lived happily ever after. On the contrary, it did an excellent job of showing a little bit of closure for many who had not forgiven, had not forgotten, brought their pain out from the darkness of their being, and made them meet their ghosts. People still tell me thank you for your service but I wonder how long that sweet appreciation will last. My totally made up assumption is that these critics have never seen or smelled war and don't know how to even spell military. They have not sat in a helicopter or an airplane and flew over the wire wondering if they will return. They have not laid in the bunk at night and wondered if the regular mortaring and rocketing of their base will find my bed as I sleep. (Just so you know the explosions get louder as they get closer.) If a critic did read my rant, they would probably comment on my grammar, syntax and the length of this review and totally miss my intent that The Last Full Measure is an excellent movie and I'm glad I experienced it and decided to see this one and not a whimsical fantasy movie about a doctor who can talk to animals. Thank you again for making this astounding movie and thank you to all the actors who did a phenomenal job portraying heroic Americans. Well done!"}, {"id": 197, "text": "The Last Full Measure is not a perfect film; it has quite a few problems from the screenwriting standpoint. However, the story is so compelling, that it overcomes these shortcomings, and we are left with an emotionally satisfying conclusion. Over 60% of Vietnam-Era veterans did not see combat in Vietnam. And whether they did or didn't, they faced the same problems after coming back home. These problems have never really been addressed in a Hollywood film. Hollywood films like to focus on the John Wayne Vietnam aspects of war; not the real life problems faced by returning veterans, such as the classic WW 2, Academy-Award winning film, The Best Years of Our Lives and The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit as well. This is where the screenwriters falthered. What about the other men in this combat situation? They were all just stereotypes; with no character development. What were their lives like after they returned? How come they didn't charge into the jungle against an enemy that had them surrounded? Pits was a hero; but the scenes of him charging into the VC was a bit unrealistic and inadvisable for the film. No one with a brain would do such a thing; especially someone without any combat training. That scene was gratuitous and manipulative; there was no need for it. The man was already a hero and deserved the medal for what he had done already. Recently, at a dinner for my university, the former university president, when informed that I was on the docks in Okinawa shipping Agent Orange to Vietnam, advised me to keep that part of my life as a secret; I wanted to punch him in the face. But I just ignored what he said, because it was obvious he was not a veteran. And that was in 2014. In 1972, I remember coming back and wearing my fatigues to the college campus because I had very few civilian clothes. I was treated like I had some type of communicable disease. One of my professors asked me why I wore military clothing, when it was fairly obvious that I was against the war via my other actions (marching in VVAW activities). I said why dont you judge me by what I do instead of by the clothes that I wear. Anyway, this is a good film and better than average for the era. The ending was satisfying as well. I just wish Hollywood would make one film about returning Vietnam Veterans that were NOT in combat (over 60% of us); it might prove interesting."}, {"id": 198, "text": "The Last Full Measure is a new war drama film directed and written by Todd Robinson, the director of Lonely Hearts and Phantom.In the film, Scott Huffman (Sebastian Stan) investigates a Pentagon employee as to why military medic William H. Pitsenbarger (Jeremy Irvine) is still not honored to receive a Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during the Vietnam War. To get an answer to this question, Scott Pitsenbarger interrogates his family and war comrades. Thus learning about a conspiracy against Pitsenbarger, Scott now decides to risk his career to ensure Pitsenbarger's justice and deserved honor.Despite being promoted as a war drama, this movie is actually more of a detective movie, where Scott Huffman tries to gain information about the conspiracy against Pitsenbarger. The war drama aspects are more prominent in the film as flashbacks, which are shown when the interviewed characters tell Scott about their experiences with William H. Pitsenbarger. By telling the story in such a way, the film has acquired a more wordy tone.The film is also more about the experiences that other soldiers have with William H. Pitsenbarger than that the film is really about William H. Pitsenbarger himself. A Vietnamese war hero like him actually deserves to be honored in a better film or documentary.The main cast actors such as: William Hurt, Christopher Plummer, Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris play the older versions of the Vietnam War soldiers, who tell their stories to Sebastian Stan. In the flashbacks, the soldiers are played by younger and more unknown actors. Peter Fonda also stars as one of the old war comrades of William H. Pitsenbarger. He died of lung cancer last year and this has become one of his last films."}, {"id": 199, "text": "30JUL2020 {5/10 stars C} Recommend? Yes; Should have been more about Pitsenbarger not Huffman, slow content and a lot of flashbacks is the reason for 5 stars.Ok movie. I agree with another review, it would have been nice to know more about the man this movie was made about, William Pitsenbarger (Pits) instead of seeing so much about Scott Huffman. Maybe seeing so much about Scott was intentional so the audience will see his transformation as he learns more about Operation Abilene and what Pits did that day. This movie seemed longer to me than it actually is. Due to all of the conversations and flashbacks that last a long time and happen throughout the movie.There was nothing good or heroic about the Vietnam War. The whole catastrophe was brought on because of lies about the Gulf of Tonkin incident and LBJ. Web search Gulf of Tonkin incident. If you want to watch a more in-depth series about the Vietnam War search on IMDB for The Vietnam War mini series from 2017. It was broadcast by PBS. Take what you see with a grain of salt because the creator Ken Burns has his own bias about the war.58,000 plus American soldiers died in the Vietnam War. North Vietnam was engaged in a civil war against South Vietnam. At no time did North Vietnam attack or invade the United States. The U.S. government invaded Vietnam and embroiled itself in Vietnam's civil war. At no time were the freedoms of the American people threatened by the North Vietnamese. American troops that died in Vietnam did not die in the defense of our freedom here at home.There are 10 episodes and each episode is about 1h20m long. Watching the mini series it is appalling to learn how many US troops died fighting various battles for nothing. Frequently the USA won battles to take control of various hills. After winning they would usually abandon the hills and the Viet Cong would easily, without force, come occupy that hill again. How many thousands of US troops died fighting senseless battles that didn't even amount to gaining ground or stopping the Viet Cong?! What kind of military fights and has thousands of men die to gain ground and than does not maintain that ground to keep the enemy away?! That's a stupid way to fight a war, no wonder it was such a disaster!CONTENT ADVISORY: Very little if any profanity. Because this is a war movie there is a lot of blood and men being shot, killed, blown up and talk about friendly fire. Many scene's of blood, wounds and gun shot wounds while Pits and other soldiers try to treat the wounded.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}(Tangent: I'm a very patriotic natural born citizen of the United States. The USA military industrial complex has become a HUGE money maker for the US government (through taxes), military contractors, suppliers etc. I am tired of the endless wars, foreign wars, proxy wars, my country fighting battles for other countries and the USA using NGO's to invade and control other countries. I'm also against the UN, WHO, IMF and all other international agencies that think they call the shots and can tell countries what to do.Citizens of some countries protest and get angry about their countries being occupied by the United State military. That's good, more people should protest more frequently. The US military is not the World Police for resolving disputes or a knight in shining armor that comes to the rescue for another countries when there is trouble. Both good and bad kingdoms and countries rise and fall due to military conquest, this is the natural order of things. Even male animals fight or battle for the ability to mate and pass on their genes, humans sometimes use war in a similar way. Strong humans survive war and pass on their genes and the weak oftentimes do not.If you want to save your country from terrorism or being taken over by an invading force you need to use everything at your disposal to defend your country and not expect someone else or another country to do it for you. Your country is your house and it is your job to defend it! Get to know the invading force to learn if there is common ground where a compromise can be reached, use the media or press to share information about the invading force or create your own source of factual information with videos, a blog, newsletters etc, and of course use force to stop and remove the invading force.)"}, {"id": 200, "text": "The Last Full Measure details the lengths taken and dedication given to bestow a posthumous Medal of Honor on William H Pitsenbarger. A true story revolving around a Vietnam war veteran, the sacrifice he made, and the lives of those he saved should make for compelling drama. In fact, while watching the movie, the viewer can tell there is something there. Unfortunately, the writing feels all too much like a colour by numbers script with fake highs and feel good moments that aren't truly earned.This is a shame, as the cast assembled, with familiar actors such as Sebastian Stan, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Samuel L. Jackson and more are more than up to the task. One can clearly feel them elevating the script to a better place. Plummer and Jackson are especially noteworthy in their performance.However, in the end, this is let down by a script that is slavish to hit all the right beats, and to manipulate the emotions of the viewer. Which is unfortunate, as even without other background information, Pitsenbarger clearly deserves better."}], "reviews_amount": 201}
