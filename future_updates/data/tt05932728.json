The bad reviews are backlash against Gibson and Safinia for false rumors about their conduct on set. Icon productions and Voltage failed to complete the script which left huge plot holes. That was Gibson and Safinia's gripe and lawsuit. They wanted the movie COMPLETED not FINISHED.It's a great film, great story (fill the gaps by reading the book synopsis) , great acting. Just enjoy it ! This was a passion project for Gibson, Penn, and Safinia and they were screwed by the production companies.This is why I almost never look at critic reviews. I've seen countless movies that they drool over that I think are trash, and have seen plenty that I find entertaining that they rate collectively below 30%"}, {"id": 1, "text": "It seems to me that there is some critique-conspiracy going on around this movie. I just found out there were some legal issues surrounding this movie,but I still don't get all those bad reviews about the movie itself. Normally,I wouldn't even look those up,but they are just popping up whenever I want to google something about the plot or the true story behind it. Anyways,the movie was really enjoyable. The acting was great in my opinion,the story was interesting and captivating. It was shot beautifully. It is not perfect tho,not all parts could hold my attention,but it's a film I would recommend to my friends."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Interesting true story well played by competent actors. Written without insertion of political, sexual or cultural bias for a refreshing change."}, {"id": 3, "text": "First of all, I didn't ever think Sean Penn could out perform his role in Mystic River for which he won the oscar for and is one of my favorite movies. But he took his role in this film to a different level and couldn't have been done any better by anyone else. Mel Gibson's role was just as powerful and I don't think anyone could have done it better than him and goes to prove that Mel can still play a leading role and still be considered at the top of the list to make a memorable movie. Sean Penn will definitely be a contender to win another oscar and in my opinion, he should win it again because I highly doubt he'll be surpassed this year by another actor. This year's oscar belongs to him hands down. The Professor and the Madman is a remarkable story of history that deserves to be told and rewarded."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This film is for real cinema lovers, who dont need special effects and flashing images to get excited. I had no expectations when I sat down to view this amazing piece of work. The acting was superb, period costumes on point, casting down to the children, the broadmoor guards all wonderful. Sean Penn deserves an oscar for this extraordinary performance."}, {"id": 5, "text": "When politics and social messaging run rampant in today's movies, it's hard to find a good story (even better when true) with a script and actors who sign on to simply do the job at hand - making a quality film worthy of anyone's time. It doesn't matter who you are or what your views are to be completely engrossed and enlightened by this one. It has friendship, courage, kindness and sadness at its heart. It's also further proof that reality is stranger than fiction. Not over-acted or overly anything. Ignore the critics again on this one and enjoy a little known story you won't forget."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Walked into the film with no expectations or knowledge of what it was about, except that it starred Gibson and Penn.Walked out of the film blown away. The script, cast (each and every one of them), the story... all beautifully portrayed.Though-provoking, heart-wrenching and inspiring."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I wanted to see this movie as soon as I heard about it. Yeah, I know, Im a bit of a word nerd. To find out that Penn and Gibson were going to star in it absolutely fascinated me. It does not disappoint. It is 2 hours long and yes, it is a bit slow, but this kind of movie can't be done in any other way and it is a story, I thought, had to be told. Penn is dynamite!! I love his acting style, where you can see his character's feelings from head to toe. He simply drew me in in every scene to the point where scenes without him in it paled in comparison. Im not much of a Mel Gibson fan, but enjoyed his performance. I thought he and Penn had great chemistry."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Of those movies that teach you to value life. Let's see what you did wrong and a way to amend your path. The importance of forgiveness and love, between reason and madness. I think it's one of the best movies of recent years and with a brutally magnificent Sean Penn, perhaps with his most legendary performance, and that's hard to say with a resume like his. In short, a very well directed film, with emotionally descriptive scenes and with a cast of the first order. Do not go looking for shots, bursts of simultaneous action and rampant sex. You will not find them. I recommend this movie for people who see beyond the basics. For a moment I am grateful that I did not pay attention to Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I can because of you......Heart wrenching masterpiece in all its glory and heartbreak. Do yourself a favor and watch something that will benefit your soul and restore your faith in humanity."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Not a lot to say. Great unknown, at least to me, story told and shown beautifully. Oh, and check the filmography of Eddie Marsan and Natalie Dormer. Especially Natalie in Elementary...she personified one of literature's greatest villains masterfully. Finally. WATCH THIS MOVIE!"}, {"id": 11, "text": "Hollywood has been in free fall so long, I almost forgot good movies were still possible.Very interesting story from the VERY beginning.ORIGINAL.The characters are FANTISTIC...Remember what it was like to care about the characters?Acting, flawless.And no selfish writer inserting their damn PERSONAL politics!!!"}, {"id": 12, "text": "I haven't seen a movie this good for around 10 years.

This is a timeless film; well acted, a slice of history often forgotten. It should be seen by anyone with sense."}, {"id": 15, "text": "This movie, its story and interpretation fall into the category of divine. It is long and about the making of Oxfords' dictionary - how can it be so addictive? A true work of art. I am no historian but from what I searched I found that the story is very close to the truth. We are so used to seeing the truth being ugly... Have we forgotten or are unable to marvel at it when it is beautiful? I don't understand the bad critics. Truly don't. The story could not be more amazing. It is also educative. The acting - Superb as you would expect from both the leading actors. The plot so engaging. Can't help but feel that Hollywood (maybe the world?) still hasn't forgiven Gibson for being human and making mistakes. Ridiculous. He has talent beyond frontiers. Stop bullying him and evaluate him for his work."}, {"id": 16, "text": "A few years ago I started to wonder if Hollywood creativity is dry? Now, with this epic movie; not in its events, but in its richness on both the human and artistic sides. A representative performance at the highest level. Four characters centered around; the character of Professor James Murray, played by Mel Gibson and his wife Ada Murray, played by Jennifer Ehle and Dr. William Chester Minor, played by Sean Penn and the wife of the murdered Eliza Merrett, played by Natalie Dormer. These personalities were at the top of their artistic representation, not to mention the characterization of the character and the depth of the human dimension of each. I humbly think that this film will enter Oscar 2020 nominations as the best film and another nomination for the best actor performance to Shin Bin."}, {"id": 17, "text": "I read the book, and hesitantly decided to watch this movie. After reading the book, I felt the story lacked substance. When I saw that they brought out the big guns, Gibson and Penn I thought they were going to cover for a lackluster story. I was certainly wrong!! The story is told at a good and thorough pace, and demonstrates the kindness and passion leaving us with an amazing story. Kudos to all. I hope this movie wins some awards."}, {"id": 18, "text": "This is the best movie i have seen this year, the compassion, love, class, integrity and empathy is insurmountable. The story is remarkable and i was so grateful to have seen it, and now plan to read it."}, {"id": 19, "text": "A film born, literally, of words and the paradoxical. This incredible true story highlights the captivating and tragic friendship between two brilliant men. Where words become a code of friendship and the thin line between beauty and madness.The Professor and the Madman is based off a noval by Simon Winchester. The story tells of Professor James Murray (Mel Gibson) who is charged with drafting the first ever Oxford dictionary of the English language. Murray, knowing the enormity of the task, appealed to all English speaking people via a letter skillfully placed within the covers of books asking them to help gather every word, definition and date they came across, inviting them to send their words by post.William Chester Minor (Sean Penn), a former American military surgeon, who mistakenly killed an innocent man due to his schizophrenic delusions of being chased and haunted by a man from his past, was condemned to living in an asylum, after being declared insane by the English courts. Minor, receiving a book from the asylum guards as a Christmas gift, found the appeal made by Professor Murray, thus beginning a whirlwind of brilliance, maddness, forgiveness, friendship and love. The professional critics loathed this film for being off rhythm and slow, and Mel Gibson not promote the film at all due to legal battles. The beauty of this film is in the storytelling and the true to life tonal cinematic contrasts that keep this film perfectly off-balance. There's the impenetrable darkness that surrounds Minor's story that can be seen and felt in the film. Watching Penn reach into his abilities to project the pain of a burning mind held captive by mental illness was truly an honor to watch. The other side of the story is sunnier, which also can be seen and felt with Murray trying to balance being a father, husband and editor, as well as a man of God battling his way through the doubt of Oxford leadership.Its truly a shame this film didn't get the credit it deserves. It's a hidden gem of cinema."}, {"id": 20, "text": "This is the first time I leave a review as a user. I felt I had to. I cannot believe the metacritics on this movie! The critics have just lost all credibility for me. I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie. And I've seen a few. The story, the plot, the themes, the build up, the acting the score. Finally, a Hollywood film I enjoy.Never you mind the critics! You deserve an oscar. Penn especially."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Marvelous film from start to finish. Who would have thought that a film about a dictionary could be so enthralling. All the cast were superb special mentions to Eddie Marsan and Steve Coogan (another great performance after Stan &amp; Ollie). Don't be put off by the story watch and enjoy a memorable Film."}, {"id": 22, "text": "This is the tale of the unorthodox beginnings of the Oxford dictionary. James A.H. Murray, who has limited schooling, impresses and leads a group of Oxford professors in the undertaking. He is aided by an American schizophrenic, Dr. William Chester Minor who is locked up in an asylum for the criminally insane. He shot and killed a man, believing he was an individual who was after him. It appears some of his issues may be PTSD.Mel Gibson plays the professor and Sean Penn the madman. This is a well acted period piece that most likely few people will see and then they will be shocked on Oscar night."}, {"id": 23, "text": "The Professor and the Madman is an excellent documentary/drama! The men's lives who were portrayed in this film are owed a debt of gratitude for their service as the English language is ever evolving and growing. At the time these men undertook the task it was a monumental task of incredible proportions. All they had were small pages of old letters, documents, or books that were long out of print that had old words used only a few times. These men went through all the records they could find and established the English language and it's vast vocabulary the best they could so that we have what is available today. They created what is known as the oxford dictionary which is the most complete English dictionary in the world. The acting is very well done and on par with the time period. A great movie the entire family can watch! It's sad there are not more movies of this caliber these days, I have to admit I was very surprised to see a movie I could show to my whole family in 2019 that was not a cartoon/computer generated movie."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I love my unabridged Oxford English Dictionary and I loved the book by Simon Winchester. Against all odds, this film lived up to both. Two masterful actors, bad boys shoved into Victorian manners, brought these quirky characters to life. But it was the script, credited in part to John Boorman, that carried the film, using the power of words that the OED celebrates. Mel Gibson and Sean Penn get their share of great lines, but even Jennifer Ehle as Murray's wife gets a star turn. Everyone else is great, too (Eddie Marsan makes the most of his small role!)."}, {"id": 25, "text": "There are no words to describe this beautiful movie. Well cast and award winning acting.

Its worth to see, ill recommond it."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Context, history, performance. The film carries it all. It doesn't choose sides in madness. It's not glossy. It's real.

At the end of the movie my wife and I looked at each other and said Wow LoL Not a car chase nor guns or bombs going off and I still enjoyed the heck out of this movie.

Not a silly hollywood film but a true classic. Sean Penn pulls off a spectacular acting job, and Mel Gibson is in his element once again. It would have been interesting to see what the Director had in mind as a final cut without being kicked out, so maybe a Directors cut will happen down the road. Regardless of the legal aspects, it still is a wonderful film especially about a subject that could have easily been rather dull by any other creative team. 8 stars"}, {"id": 30, "text": "Hey, I enjoy a Marvel comics flick or action adventure as much as the next guy but this is a REAL movie watching experience.The story is amazing, surprising and true!

The iPad was out of juice and died. I was going to change the channel, but next thing you know I was sucked in and watched the whole thing. it was the same thing as happened when I read the book. It just sucked me right in. The book had more about the dictionary, which did not diminish it, but it's no surprise they had to have less of that in the movie. This story is remarkable.

The story has more than one dimensional drama that provokes hard questions about the sense of creativity, redemption, friendship, family and loyalty.Above that the story was carefully written and performed to depict the strength of the English language. The language used in the movie was more than just a tool of expressing ideas and more than just a subject, but it has a unique character.Mel Gibson and Sean Penn really put their best in this movie, and Natalie Dormer's role here was so amazing and is superior to her performance in the GOT series by a heavy factor.

Today they would have diagnosed Dr. W.C. Minor with PTSD rather than schizophrenia. I wish they would have made it clear that Dr. Minor was forced by army regulations in the Civil War to brand someone, because I doubt many people watching the film understand that aspect.

It is about things that really matter and it's well told."}, {"id": 114, "text": "I thought the story here was fairly compelling, though after a while I began to find it almost comical the amount of time and effort that was being put into defining the meaning of a single word. All for a good cause of course, because this was how the Oxford English Dictionary came about, but even with Dr. James Murray's (Mel Gibson) devotion to duty, one intuitively realizes that a project like this could never be finished. Finished in the sense that the language would at some point stop evolving. It's a pretty safe bet that 'emoji' wasn't in that first edition.In an unusual pairing, Mel Gibson and Sean Penn are cast opposite each other here as meaningful collaborators, but it comes with a twist. Penn's character is a former Civil War Army surgeon found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. The man truly is insane with regard to the conspiracy he holds in his mind of an elusive stalker who is intent on killing him. The narrative doesn't give even an inkling of anyone who might be out to 'get him', so to speak, and that delusion remains with Dr. William Chester Minor (Penn) throughout the story. However in his more lucid moments, Dr. Minor is repentant over the death of the man he mistakenly killed, and spends his entire prison life attempting to make it up to the victim's widow, both monetarily and by way of teaching the woman how to read. In time, Eliza Merrett's (Natalie Dormer) initial negative assessment of Minor turns to thoughts of forgiveness and love, an idea that Minor can't cope with in a rational way. Taking it to an extreme, Minor castrates himself to insure that he can never return favor back to the woman he caused to become a widow.Penn, who I'm no fan of, really does do a remarkable job in the role of Minor, particularly during that phase of the picture in which he envisions no chance at redemption given Mrs. Merrett's ambiguous profession of love. As Mr. Murray struggles with his own efforts to move the dictionary process along, his relationship with Minor becomes personal upon repeated visits to the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum where Minor is held. With unlimited passion, Murray prevails upon the authorities to come up with a way to free Minor and provide him some measure of relief from both his imprisonment and his self imposed mental isolation. In due course, Murray himself is vindicated for the passion he put into his work at Oxford, and is allowed to continue leadership on the team that eventually fulfilled the mission some years following his death.It's probably fair to say that not all viewers will find the film quite as intriguing as I did. It moves rather slow and the subject matter is rather tepid, so action junkies ought skip this one altogether. For others though, the picture can be quite engaging with a lot to offer if you're a fan of the principals and wish to witness some very fine acting.

After having her life destroyed by the death of her husband, leading to prostitution to support her family. We are lad to believe that something in her psyche finds forgiveness (and possibly LOVE) with the man who murdered her husband to begin with. REALLY? THAT part of the story left me bewildered.

This movie also has a lot of plot point elements that should be interesting but aren't which you can only blame on the directing. Too many elements and too many messages and all told in the most banal way. The costume design and production sets are well done but then why wouldn't they be considering how many films, and series have been made about this time period just in the past few years. I really wanted to like this movie but half way thru I was too bored for words. I also felt like I'd been bludgeoned by victorian era nerds. There's just too many historical messages they're trying to get across both clumsily and 'ham handed'. 1) the story hinges on sympathy for penn's character. Fail. Epic fail. 2) the story hinges on sympathy for mel gibson's character. Fail. The story is cliche. To make it a dramatic piece they of course have to make the main character struggle against great adversities but they never quite make it relatable and clear how difficult it was to make a dictionary, or what real adversities he had to deal with. It could be done but it wasn't in this movie. Similarly they never quite make it relatable and clear how backward psychiatry was in the victorian period. It can be done and it has been done before on film but not in this film. 3) the story hinges on sympathy for natalie dormer's character. Fail. Her performance was wonderful to watch but I wonder if she knew how comical she looked in different scenes with regard to the context of the story. We only see her a few times but we're expected to believe that she makes this great transition in every scene throughout the movie. I know that they're dumbing down films for audiences but this is a bit too far. My advice to everyone behind this production, go back to film school and pay attention this time. I predict that this movie will be a flop and the backers will claim it's a film genre not in favor by the audience today but that's nonsense. If it was a well told, well cast, well acted story, audiences wouldn't hesitate plopping down $15 to see it.Here's one not in the movie: definition of twiat - an adjective; little used phrase for stupidity or complete ignorance.

His portrayal of the schizophrenic William Chester Minor who, having spent almost 40 years of his life in Broadmoor psychiatric hospital, became one of the single most significant contributors to the orginal Oxford Dictionary of English is superb. He captures the flaws of this paranoid etymologist warts and all, and gels very well with Mel Gibson who, as the compiler of the tome - Dr. James Murray - also turns in a good, strong and, latterly, sympathetic and understanding performance too. This is essentially a double-hander with Natalie Dormer, Eddie Marsan and Steve Coogan helping to explain the story and releasing some of the emotional steam from time to time. It's a little slow in places, two hours could have done justice to this interesting story, but just not this version - it seems overly padded at time.

I wondered why I hadn't heard of this movie coming out and it turns out there was a legal battle about its release and Mel Gibson refused to promote it.

The supporting cast is top notch. The widow, the security guard, superintendent doctor and so on. This is a film everyone involved believed in... And for good reason. It's a shame nobody else did. This is not an easy watch, but it isn't a brutal one either. The director and cinematographer really did a wonderful job of using architecture as a character in this film.

In some ways, it\u00b4s the story of OCD, and what men will do in a quest for completion. Sean Penn\u00b4s performance is truly outstanding as the \u00a8madman\u00a8 wracked with guilt over a crime which was itself a result of equally guilt-ridden, phantasmagoric delusions. He came to believe that he was being pursued by a soldier whom he had harmed (branding him with a \u00b4D\u00b4 for \u00b4deserter\u00b4 on his face) during the war. Ultimately, it appears that he has gone nuts as a result of profound regret for all of what he did during his military service. As for Mel Gibson, he is pretty convincing as the Scottish autodidact and polyglot who somehow persuaded Oxford to allow him to head up the massive dictionary project.I would characterize this as an intellectual film, as there is lots to think about here, including the distinction between criminals and the criminally insane, the role of psychiatry in \u00a8treating\u00a8 such persons, and of course some critical perspectives of academia and bureaucratic institutions more generally.Action flick aficionados will likely be bored to tears, as the only signs of violence are the branding and what appear to be holes drilled into the poor madman\u00b4s head as a part of the new \u00a8more invasive\u00a8 treatments of which he was made the victim.

We don't really get much insight into Dr. Miner's illness and the baddies aren't so bad. Ian Gruffudd is under utilized, imo.The only part that annoyed me was Mrs. Murray. I swear, if it's a biopic about a man and his accomplishments, there's this need to put something for the women to do. Some scene or context that is magnified as some counter-balance just to lure women viewers, I guess? It's a tired trope and annoying.I saw this in First Man as well and we don't need it.

Through a series of improbable events, Minor connects with Professor James Murray, a man obsessed with the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary.

We aren't required to demonize him in order to reject his methods any more than we are expected to reject a man with mental health issues who murders another man in front of his wife.

The book is Charles Dickens Great Expectations. Not surprisingly, the film has a Dickensian feel to it in the well-rounded characters and the broad sweep of British life in the nineteenth century.The focus of the film is the coming together of two improbable friends and soul mates. The names Sir James A. H. Murray and Dr. William Chester Minor sound like a couple of British upper-class males. But Murray is brilliant linguist who is an autodidact and the antithesis of the typical Oxford don. For his part, Minor is a shell-shocked veteran of the Civil War, who is eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. This unlikely duo will team up for a sublime scholarly achievement.The two men meet by correspondence and begin their collaboration on one of the most ambitious publishing ventures in human history: the Oxford English Dictionary, a massive, twelve-volume compendium of 414,825 words. The unique feature of the dictionary is the quoted examples of the words over time. The illustrative citations number 1,827,306.Of course Murray and Minor did not complete the work in their lifetimes. Murray died in 1915 at a time when the dictionary had reached the letter t (turndown). In 1920, Minor died in America, where he was eventually deported. By the time of Minor's death, the dictionary had reached the letter v (vywer).The film is worth viewing both for the remarkable story of the dictionary, but also for the stellar performances. Mel Gibson is perfect as the iconoclastic linguist and family man Murray. But the truly unforgettable performance is that of Sean Penn as the mad Dr. Minor. The secondary roles were also brilliantly performed, especially the role of the widow Mrs. Merritt. Her transformation from loathing the man who killed her husband to eventually falling in love with him was somehow made credible by Dormer.A genuine buried treasure that has slipped under the radar, The Professor and the Madman will endure as a testament to the human spirit and creative genius of two eccentrics who joined forces to change the cultural landscape in the modern age."}, {"id": 295, "text": "Could not make it through this.

The direction is sort of lifeless throughout the movie, and it makes moments of earnestness seem far more melodramatic than they ever needed to be. The themes that were hinted at in this movie were never fully developed, and in the end, we come away feeling a bit unsatisfied with how the whole thing wraps up. That being said, I learned a lot about the Oxford dictionary, far more than I ever thought I would have, and the story beneath it all is quite fascinating, which is why, I'm sure, this was Gibson's passion project for a number of years.

Luckily, one of the key contributors in 19th Century England, in real life, was a deranged surgeon, a veteran of the US Civil war called Chester Minor. Dr Minor was imprisoned indefinitely at the notorious Broadmoor asylum - and lucky not to be executed - after his paranoid delusions (probably caused by PTSD) caused him to shoot dead an innocent man one night in London. Dr Minor thought the man was out to get him, when in fact he was just walking down the street. Sean Penn makes a great fist of playing Dr Minor, as an almost irretrievably damaged man. In several brief flashbacks, we see Dr Minor performing amputations and even brandings in his years of Civil War service. At the asylum, Dr Minor is treated with great respect and kindness by the resident psychiatrist, who encourages him to take on a project - reading books to create definitions for the new dictionary. The offer is much appreciated by the dictionary's editor, a Scot played by Mel Gibson, whose perfectionism, and the sheer scope of the task, means he's unlikely to meet the ambitious deadlines of his own editors. It's only later on that Gibson realises that one of his key contributors is ''mad'' and incarcerated at Broadmoor at Her Majesty's Pleasure'' for murder. Gibson has a good eye for visual effects and poetry. I loved the settings, acting and design of this production. The script is great. However the film goes on too long. We're expected to believe that the wife of the stranger that Minor killed - a poor London mother of many children - visited Minor many times and even kissed him. It just doesn't make sense to me. I actually switched off the movie at this point as being too far-fetched. The mother character was also too doe-eyed and melodramatic. It didn't detract, however from my enjoyment of the earlier scenes. Sean Penn brings great compassion to his character - who wouldn't go made if they'd spent years as a field surgeon in the Civil War? It makes a good case that working on a project greater than oneself - a pioneering dictionary - can give even the most broken man self-respect, joy and purpose. The movie suggests that for Dr Minor, redemption might be possible. Maybe at one stage he could have even been released. However if you read about what happened to him later in his life, it's not a happy ending, which is sad."}, {"id": 317, "text": "Sean Penn and Mel Gibson did a great job acting the bazaar characters in this film which must be a compilation of several stories.

Shemran, an Alan Smithee-like alias if there's ever been one). I find this decision suprising as for most of the film I could have easily bought this as a Mel Gibson-directed work. As a filmmaker, he might not have the strongest of auteurial signatures, but said signature that can most easily be defined in the depiction of gore, a fascination with language and Christian faith elements (most obvious in The Passion of the Christ and Hacksaw Ridge), definitely makes an appearance here.Not content with Gibson-like directorial decisions, the screenplay fortunately digs deeper into some topics than any Gibson script has. Penn's character's arc in particular is well-developed in creating empathy towards the mentally ill, which is still not common enough nowadays, nevermind in a time when phrenology was still a valid study. The word redemption, so rare yet supposed to be the most Christian of virtues as well, gets a very strong definition with this character arc. Obsession is touched upon as well, not to Aronofsky-an levels, but still enough to be worthy of a mention.Considering the unforeseen depth of the treatment of these topics, it's truly unfortunate that there are some cases where the movie relies of the most shallow of tropes to force tension. The worst case of this is the almost-mustache-twirling-villain characters, with no depth or motive beyond antagonizing and foiling our brave heroes. One case in particular is not as tragic when a (until then) well-developed and rounded character inexplicably takes that villanous turn, at least having given us a solid base before. Additionally, the visuals suffer with some establishing shots clearly having made with inferior digital video quality, creating a jarring effect that takes you out of the movie.

Professor and the madman seemed to be available nowhere and has not had a cinema premiere in Denmark. I got hold of a Italian blu-ray, and boy am I glad I did!The movie is a gem about unlikely friendships, forgiveness and how creativity and innovation can overcome the most impossible obstacles.The making of the first dictionary is a fantastic story, the performances are though the roof ( I still cant decide on who did the best acting) , but the ending felt a bit truncated and abrupt in some way.I hope this movie gets a revival and the reviews it rightfully deserves.THANK YOU for this splendid film, that proves that there is still a little heart and brainpower left out there away from blockbuster-land."}, {"id": 322, "text": "James Murray (Mel Gibson) survives on obsession.

THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN is based on the biography by Simon Winchester, but is as exciting as any fictional story can be. The script that in any other circumstances would earn an Oscar nomination has sustained serious damage by various law suits and troubled production, which forced the director Farhad Safinia (a many time Mel Gibson collaborator) to take his name off the final cut.

This is a spectacular story, given that is amazingly based on history.There are elements of a thriller, a love story and a buddy drama. All wrapped up nicely into a historical package.

So, one bored morning I decided to give this movie a shot. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The acting by everyone (apart from one side character who is the villain to Penn and Gibson's characters in this movie) was fantastic, and I felt truly moved by their performances.This movie does more that tell the origin of the dictionary, although it does manage to do that in an interesting way. This story is about redemption, love, frienship, and the terrible mental health practices that existed in the early 1900s. At times I felt pride, at others I felt digust and contempt. 'The Professor and the Madman' isn't afriad to get its hands dirty (or bloody), but it does so without over the top gore.

Because of Dr. Minor's contributions to the Dictionary work, Murray tries to get him partial credit for the work.

And this from someone who wholly disagrees with Penn's politics and much of Gibson's personal history.The critics should stick to their praise of aliens, super heroes, explosions, and CGI.

Clearly, I also love language and knowing that it has played a very important role in human evolution has made it all the more dear to me. This movie celebrates the lives of lexicographers who put an enormous amount of effort in cataloging and researching each and every word of a language to make it more accessible for everyone.The movie is about the genesis of Oxford English Dictionary. An autodidact, James Murray who hadn't had much of a formal education is assigned to be the head of the project because he's a genius with languages. The task is humongous and needs contributions from speakers of English from all over the world. A particularly prolific contributor is Dr. William Minor, a retired US Army Surgeon, presently in the mental asylum, who in a fit of delusion, had killed an innocent man. Both men are very passionate about their literary endeavor and slowly develop a great friendship.This is a powerful movie that illustrates how a deep passion towards a goal can bring out the best in even those who seem to be beyond redemption. The scene when Dr. Minor tells the asylum Superintendent that he should be allowed to contribute to the dictionary as he will be alright with this work is particularly poignant. Another heart-warming scene is the one between Dr. Minor and the widow Merrett where he describes to her how reading makes his demons disappear. The film also raises interesting questions about repentance, redemption and love. All the cast turned in stellar performances.

The interpretations of both Sean Penn who played as Dr. William Chester Minor and Mel Gibson who played as Professor James Murray were exceptional. I also have to say that the interpretations of Jennifer Ehle's who played as Ada Murray and Natalie Dormer's who played as Eliza Merrett were equally good. Regarding the direction which was made by Farhad Safinia, I believe that he did a good job on it and he presented very well the stereotypes of that time, the difficulties of life on that time and how high society was influencing people and their opinion.

Apparently, the movie was hardly marketed to the viewing public, and I missed it until it came on my streaming services. The big-name cast--Mel Gibson, Sean Penn, Stephen Dillane, etc.--caught my attention, so I watched it and really enjoyed it. It's hard to believe that Gibson and the director wanted to dissociate themselves from the finished movie, but from what I read, they had strong creative differences with the studio and didn't feel that the final product reflected their vision. It's based on the true story of the creation of the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, and the personalities and personal sacrifices made by the men and women involved in this monumental project. Sean Penn plays Dr. William Minor, an essential volunteer contributor to the OED, who was also mentally ill and confined to an asylum (one which, as portrayed in the film, seemed rather luxurious for its era). Gibson is Professor James Murray, the Scottish editor in chief of the dictionary, who befriends Minor. The movie focuses more on Minor's heartbreaking struggles with his mental illness and treatment, and his relationship with a young widow played by Natalie Dormer, who is luminous and seems almost too angelic at times, but perhaps that was how Minor viewed her. The Professor and the Madman offers excellent acting and a rich, moving, interesting story based on real events (and seems to be rather faithful to the facts for a movie). There are some gritty, grim scenes that portray the real, horrifying situations that these individuals endured, but I was never disturbed or grossed out.

Many younger folk may not realize how amazing the OED is. When I was in college I owned a set that was printed in such tiny font that you needed a magnifying glass. it was the gold standard of dictionaries.

Marsan, Fox, Dormer, Andrews... the list goes on and on. Based on that alone, it's a joy.Marsan once again is wonderful, and Fox gets to play another really nasty, sleazy creep. He's so good at that!And even though I detest Gibson and have never been a huge fan of Penn, I thought both of them were stellar in this.There has apparently been a lot of criticism of this movie. I saw nothing really terrible about it. The story made sense. I didn't notice any gaping plot holes.

The script, the settings, costume design, the cinematography, the music, the pace of the film and most of all, the outstanding acting performances hold this film together. I saw one braindead critic say Penn was overacting but clearly that critic has no empathy or understanding of the human condition. Imagine being a person involved in a terrible war, having to brand someone and then later committing murder thinking it was the same person coming to torment them and then having to deal with the guilt as well as the dead man's wife and 6 children who were starving due to this being set in a time long before the welfare state. Clearly this critic (and his ilk couldn't) as it seems he thought Sean Penn seemed a bit too sad at times and didn't play the role as one whose favourite programmeis likely to be Thunderbirds might expect. No doubt with Gibson and Fox in the cast, there is a need to run this film down by some people ever eager to cast the first stone along with a few boulders to boot.

Therefore, I will say nothing about Mr. Penn.The movie is terrific. I liked almost everything about the film, and have only one quibble. Ms. Dormer's character is supposed to be a poor, widow; yet she constantly wears a different outfit of high quality (as does her children) in every scene.

However, none of these things can stop us from thoroughly enjoying it.First of all, the story itself is very interesting. I don't think there are many films (Hollywood or non-Hollywood) that examine so closely the challenges and the hard work that comes with the writing of a dictionary (in this case, the monumental Oxford Dictionary of the English Language). In addition, the film should be commended for the manner in which approaches contrasting themes like insanity versus logic, redemption versus damnation, open-mindedness versus prejudice etc. Both Gibson and Penn give extremely solid, if not powerful, performances and so does the rest of the cast, even if the script sometimes feels noticeably weak. Despite the cliches, the dialogue is quite convincing and this is how we get real-looking, three-dimensional characters to whose ordeal and suffering we can relate.In short, The Professor and the Madman is a very satisfying and enjoyable film.

Use one word instead of a whole sentence to state your meaning, but maybe that just me;) CONS: Like I said beautiful story and wonderful acting but, In my case there was a small annoyance, like the camera shaking when great dialogs were performed. The dialogs seemed therefore chaotic and not stand-fast when it was meant to be stand-fast making the emotion of that moment fleeting away quickly, but that is my pet peeve.

Sherman due to legal battles), which is unfortunate, as the wait has certainly not been worth it.It's nothing to do with Gibson as such, whose as good as his been over the last decade or so as real life Oxford dictionary master James Murray, but despite a sizable budget, a formidable cast and the amazing story of how the most well-known dictionary of all time came to be, Madman wastes every single tool at its disposable along its journey to shine a light on Murray's trials and those of Sean Penn's murderous and clearly insane war veteran Dr. William Chester Minor.The film is nothing more than a series of boxes being ticked off, told with little heart, care or imagination and where fault is to be pinpointed is hard to do as Safinia himself and Gibson disowned the project well before final completion in a bitter feud with its financiers, who ended up taking matters into their own hands and finalising the end product and extra filming courtesy of Todd Komarnicki, in what's a film that was abandoned by its heart and soul.Not many films end up achieving much good when these type of unfortunate circumstances and bickering's take place and while elements of the lethargic offering lay mostly at the feet of this issue, its also no excuse for its extremely tame and care free delving into of the dictionary's birth and the friendship that sprung up between Murray and Minor.Completely overplayed by a mumbling, jumbling Sean Penn (who has been out of form for years now), Minor is tough character to portray no doubt but as our decade spanning narrative takes us along for the journey these two men took, by the end of it we end up feeling just as cold as we do when we first meet these men as Safinia and Komarnicki fail to create any spark in the editing suite or in the filming of this material that makes a tour hour run time seem like an endless slog.So much so that not even the likes of supports such as Natalie Dormer, Ioan Gruffudd, Steve Coogan or Jennifer Ehle can add any extra spice to a film that so clearly could've been but unfortunately isn't, a missed opportunity to shine a light on an intriguing friendship centred around an important moment in our human history.Final Say -Facing an uphill battle to even have seen the light of day due to behind the scenes raucous, The Professor and the Madman would've been served better to remain heard of but never seen as this dull and uninviting drama fails to ignite in any way, shape or form despite its loaded material.1 luscious beard out of 5"}, {"id": 343, "text": "The Professor and the Madman is a biographical drama film based on the non-fiction book The Surgeon of Crowthorne by Simon Winchester. Starring Mel Gibson and Sean Penn in the leading roles, it takes an otherwise improbable subject for onscreen treatment and turns it into something surprisingly entertaining.In 1872 in London, retired US Army doctor William Chester Minor (Sean Penn) is put on trial for the murder of an innocent man but is later found not guilty by reason of insanity and is sent to Broadmoor Mental Asylum. Meanwhile in Oxford, Professor James Murray (Mel Gibson) is given the monumental task of overseeing and editing a collection of every word used in the English language. In an attempt to aid him in this difficult assignment, Murray sends out written appeals to as many English speakers as possible around the world to contribute their own definitions of words. One of these appeals finds its way to Broadmoor, which Minor comes into possession of and decides to send in over 10,000 entries, some of which are of incredibly obscure and rarely used words. Stunned by these unique contributions, Murray decides to meet with Minor and the two form an unlikely partnership in creating what would later become the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.On paper, the origins of the first English dictionary ever conceived sounds like it would never work as a film in the broadest of terms. However, thanks to the efforts of the great acting from its two leads and the proper treatment of its historical subject matter, The Professor and the Madman succeeds on screen for the most part. Throughout the film, we are reminded how large the English language truly is and how every contribution counts towards us gaining a better understanding of the importance of expanding our vocabularies. While I wouldn't say it's essential to have an unyielding love of etymology (the study of words) like I do, I believe it certainly comes in handy when watching something like this. Personally, I'm part of that niche audience who likes films about historical events no matter how overlooked they are so I can't really speak for all potential viewers out there. With that in mind though, I think there is enough for casual filmgoers to appreciate that shouldn't bore them too much.Director Farhad Safinia, who previously collaborated with Mel Gibson in 2006's Apocalypto, juggles the two intersecting plotlines of a schizophrenic doctor and an Oxford professor with varying degrees of success. He chooses to juxtapose the character of Dr. Minor, whose brilliant mind has been permanently damaged by his civil war PTSD, with that of the steadfast Professor Murray, who has a strong determination to complete what he has been assigned with, and this combination of conflicting personalities is what drove things along for me. The anticipation of knowing that these two will eventually meet and decide to work together makes for an intriguing story and had me curious as to how it will turn out. There were times, though, where it felt like moments of sensationalism were added in simply for entertainment purposes rather than as a means to advance the plot. For example, there were some long and drawn out scenes involving Dr. Minor's collapsing mental state that felt unnecessary and didn't really add anything to the story. Thankfully these weren't too frequent but they still left an unfavourable impression on me and likely anyone else who might be watching.Both Sean Penn and Mel Gibson played their roles convincingly and had solid onscreen chemistry with one another. Their personal lives aside, I still think the two of them are great actors capable of holding the viewer's attention even through some of the most exposition laden of scenes. Penn has always had a knack for playing mentally unstable characters capable of bouts of impulsiveness whereas Mel Gibson has often shone as reserved individuals whose unpredictable nature may or may not be acted upon. This film uses their talents to its advantage and it comes as a surprise that this is the first time the two have starred alongside each other as their interactions felt uncannily natural to watch. I wouldn't mind seeing more films with these two actors in the future should they ever choose to work together again.Overall, while casual viewers may be put off by the concept of a film about the origins of the dictionary, I think there should be a select few out there who will appreciate the efforts in bringing such an important but neglected historical event to the big screen. It's easy to take for granted the language that over 20% of the world's population speaks but it's nice to know that a film like this exists to help show us that it can still make for something entertaining. I do wonder, however, if there will be a spiritual sequel involving the creation of the Thesaurus. I guess we'll have to wait and see/view/perceive/observe/watch...I rate it 7/10"}, {"id": 344, "text": "...is one of those movies which is better as an IMDB one-sentence description than the two hour biopic that one-sentence description describes, and which could also easily pass for a straight-to-video release if it wasn't for its oddly first-rate cast.Eddie Marsan is excellent as usual, building the most sympathetic and likeable character from almost nothing. Mel Gibson is beardy and Scottish. Sean Penn is an incomprehensible mess.Natalie Dormer is apparently incapable of aging over the several decades in which the film is set, and Jennifer Ehle is entirely unnecessary.Steve Coogan is a nice addition, and Stephen Dillane gives the most intriguing and nuanced performance, as a well-meaning phrenologist quack unintentionally doing terrible harm.The movie has a cheap, flat, made-for-British-TV look about it, with not a single memorable shot in the whole thing. The script is poor. The editing is confusing. It's a half hour too long and it drags. The attempts at building tension and drama and emotion are cliched and hamfisted. The Oxford 'bad guys' are about at the level of Scooby Doo villains.For all that, it's still somehow a watchable movie - if only just, and only just the once. But with a story like that to work from it really should have been the next King's Speech, the next Beautiful Mind, the next Imitation Game.It's not."}, {"id": 345, "text": "By all accounts, the film's production was a complete mess. Missing scenes, unfulfilled obligations and lack of promised finance all led towards a lawsuit and a distinctly splintered release. It was so bad, apparently, that Gibson actively discourages his fans from watching the thing, and the director - who may or may not have been replaced during filming - is credited only as 'P.B. Shemran'. Thankfully, aside from having a couple of out-of-place 'GoPro' shots, 'The Professor And The Madman (2019)' doesn't seem to be affected by its tumultuous creation. It tells the tale of the man who spearheaded the first edition of the Oxford English dictionary, while also chronicling his friendship with a Schizophrenic doctor residing in Broadmoor Hospital. It's an entertaining enough period piece with an interesting setting, even if it isn't exactly enthralling or, even, all that memorable. The performances are good and the script is steady. Ultimately, it's a generally solid experience. It doesn't have all that much impact, though. In fact, it sort of goes in one ear and out the other. That's not necessarily bad, mind you. The piece passes the time admirably and it is, perhaps surprisingly, generally well-made. If you think you'll like it, you probably will. 6/10"}, {"id": 346, "text": "If I am to fashion a book, I'll need a spine.Sometimes you are awed by cinema films because of the immensely beautiful special effects and the use of unparalleled images. The other time it's the inventiveness of a story and the way it's structured. And in other films, you look with admiration at the way certain actors play their role. Is it obligatory that a movie looks phenomenal to you? Or does it happen sometimes that while reading a novel, in which the sophisticated juggling with words creates literary excitement, you have difficulties to keep your eyes open and your head nods back after a short period after which a little snoring is heard? Well, in that case, it might be better for you to ignore this film. Because in The Professor and the Madman there are no breathtaking special effects to be found and the emphasis is on the literature from this world. For me, this was a masterful and fascinating story about how the world-famous Oxford Dictionary was put together.Even though this takes place around 1850, there are certain facts that can be found in our contemporary society. And, of course, there are also substantial differences. The film is not just about the realization of an almost impossible assignment with limited resources. It's also about the existence of class differences, scientific ignorance and the application of inhumane practices in psychiatric institutions. It demonstrates the pretentious behavior of the wealthy class and the political juggling in intellectual circles. And in between these topics, there's the Scotsman James Murray (Mel Gibson) who, with the help of countless strips of paper, miles of knitting yarn and with a ton of patience, tries to contain and interpret every existing English word in literary history. An assignment that requires immense efforts to the detriment of his wife and children.I'm aware that literature (at least for me) isn't exactly a sexy subject. I already assumed that this film wouldn't be intense or exciting. But just like with Kill your Darlings, this historical drama fascinated me. And this because of the challenge Murray took on. I looked in disbelief at the method that was applied. And I was constantly wondering if this was achievable. It's an era where people didn't know the word digital yet (one word they don't need to concentrate on) and they didn't have computers at their disposal. No indexed work file with linked cross-reference tables on which one could release SQL statements, to do big data analyses. No, everything was scribbled down with old-fashioned ink pens on sheets of paper and then attached to the walls. Can it be more primitive? It's wonderful to see that James Murray actually applies the principle of content management here by encouraging the English people to write down English words and send them to them by mail (indeed no e-mail).It's mainly the brilliant acting of the gentlemen Mel Gibson and Sean Penn that makes the film more interesting. Gibson plays the Scottish academic and autodidact who, despite the opposition of the established values from the Oxford Board of Directors, is appointed as the driving force behind this renowned work and is a model of perseverance. My favorite scene is where he's introduced to these intellectual snobs who don't even bother to hide their aversion. The moment Murray lists all the languages he knows and I saw those bewildered faces of the narcissistic academics, it immediately reminded me of the scene in a student bar with Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting. There, too, such a rich man's son with a snobbish attitude was put in his place in a brilliant way.Mel Gibson's sparring partner is William Chester Minor (Sean Penn), an American army-doctor and war veteran who is haunted by delusions. In a phase of extreme madness and schizophrenia, he kills an innocent passer-by and ends up in the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. In short, an institution for criminal madmen. The doctor on duty there, Dr. Richard Brayn (Stephen Dillane), initially envisages a decent treatment (which leads to certain privileges such as a large room with a gigantic library). But towards the end, he eventually seems to be a supporter of terrible techniques anyway. It's thanks to a book that Minor received from his victim's widow (In my eyes, the weakest aspect in this film) that he finds out that Murray asked the English people for help. And that's the impetus for Minor to get to work and to overload Murray with thousands of words for the dictionary. The way Penn plays this tormented and insane man is simply formidable. And yes, this tends to look like overacting. But isn't it necessary to portray this type of individual? Minor is after all nuts.There are several facets that are beautifully worked out. Such as the detailed decor in which the story takes place. London during the 19th century with its typical costumes, way people behave and attributes. But above all, the interaction between the two extremely brilliant gentlemen is perfectly portrayed. Two tortured intellectuals. The one because of the obstructions and impossibility of the assignment. The other because of the inner demons that make his life unbearable. An individual suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). An unknown condition in those days. The dialogues in which the two gentlemen show their love for English vocabulary is sublime to watch. The way in which they both perk up while saying one word after the other with a smile is a feast for the eyes. Perhaps the corny storyline about the widow Eliza Merrett (Natalie Game of Thrones Dormer) didn't really fit in with the whole and the emphatic message about regret and forgiveness was a bit over-the-top. But despite those shortcomings, I found this historic film based on true facts fascinating enough. So if you have questions about the origin of dictionaries, you shouldn't miss this film. At the same time, you also have an idea about academic intellectualism (and their self-righteous and arrogant attitude) and the horror of 19th-century psychiatry. But what I wondered the most: are Gibson's and Penn's beard the result of natural beard growth or props?More reviews here: movie-freak.be"}, {"id": 347, "text": "Was very interested to see this having heard Mel Gibson bought the rights to the book on which it is based back in 1998 and had been developing it as a passion project ever since. I become even more fascinated by it having heard of all the production troubles that happened, with Mel and Director Farhad Safina suing Voltage Pictures and basically disowning the finished (or unfinished) film....But I was willing to give it a try. I thought it was an excellent film - thoroughly involving, well acted by everyone, crisp intelligent dialogue, beautifully shot, and by the end it moves you and leaves you thinking. The movie concerns the ambitious undertaking of compiling the Oxford English dictionary. Gibson plays the professor and Penn the madman, and the film examines their unusual friendship that proves to be a very fruitful partnership as well...There were some events that happen over the course of the movie that I found to be...unbelievable. Whether or not they actually happened I am not sure, but it certainly didn't ruin the movie either. I felt maybe they could have developed Penn and Gibson's relationship a bit more as well...But overall this was a solid movie. Good to see Mel Gibson can still act!"}, {"id": 348, "text": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDr. William Chester Minor (Sean Penn), a former American civil war commander, is found not guilty by way of insanity of murder, and sent to Broadmoor Mental Asylum. After saving the life of a young guard, he wins special favour among the guards and senior doctors at the asylum, and is allowed to indulge his seemingly crazy tasks that they can't make sense of. Meanwhile, Professor James Murray (Mel Gibson), a commoner, is attempting to write the definitive edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. The two men form an unlikely partnership in achieving this task, whilst developing a personal friendship and affinity for each other's cause.The recessionary air still lingers over Hollywood, where anything that doesn't guarantee a cash return won't make it to the screen. Whilst rehashes of long dormant franchises still seem like a sure bet, more obscure, independent stuff can still find itself banished to the wayside, as seems to be the case with Farhad Safina's historical biopic set in 19th century England. While the story of how the concise Oxford English dictionary was put together is an interesting story in itself, it maybe doesn't have the right dynamism for a feature film, a problem that makes itself known in Farhad's film.Such a lightweight story gets a much needed boost by having two powerhouse leads to inject it with some passion and gravitas, and so we have Gibson retrieving his Braveheart Scottish lilt, and Penn saturating his role with the deranged intensity he's known for. While both seem committed and immersed in their roles, there's an unfortunate hamminess and over-emanation to them that wears them down a bit. Safina doesn't pace the film evenly enough over the course of two hours, and the really starts to drag in the latter half.It's a story that needed to be told, but maybe film wasn't the right format for it. It just isn't enthralling or edgy enough to really get into it, especially for its duration. The historical accuracy of the time period, and costume design, is convincingly caught, and the performances, from the leads as well as a supporting cast including Eddie Marsan, Steve Coogan and Laurence Fox, are too impassioned to be truly awful, but you come away thinking it might have fallen to the wayside for other reasons than it's profit margin. **"}, {"id": 349, "text": "In the era where superheroes and over the top special effects ridden adventure flicks are ruling the cinemas (and TV), it is rare to get to see such a down to earth historical drama that relies on a good script and acting. Mel Gibson and Sean Penn give us performances that overshadow any CGI helicopter flying through the explosions. Works of Natalie Dormer, Eddie Marsan, and Steve Coogan are doing very well themselves, and all the principal cast has good chemistry between them. The directing is quite straightforward and nothing flashy or stylish. One can say, that the direction lacks any style, but the more we have time to focus on the inspiring story and appreciate marvelous acting. It is interesting to learn how superficial were many of the intellectual decision makers even back then. The World has always thrived only thanks to very few (insanely) dedicated people with clear goals. Rest of us has always been tag alongs including those who seemingly are in power to make changes.A well crafted historical movie that is much more interesting than its original premise might promise. And don't listen to all the professional critics."}, {"id": 350, "text": "My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. All the actors are very good in their roles, and especially Sean Penn as the madman. My only gripe is his mumbling which required us to turn on the subtitles to be sure we knew what he was saying.This movie is very historically accurate, as the movie opens in 1872 London we see Sean Penn as American Civil War veteran Dr. William Chester Minor, chasing down and shooting a man he thought was out to get him. At his trial he was declared innocent by reason of insanity then spent the next 38 years in an English mental institution.At that same time Mel Gibson as James Murray had been put in charge of assembling the comprehensive Oxford Dictionary of the English language, a monumental task that eventually took several decades to complete, carrying on after Murray died. It turned out Minor had experience and skills that helped greatly and eventually the two became friends even though Minor remained institutionalized. He eventually returned to the USA and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.This is an important chapter in human history, the writing of the comprehensive dictionary, and it was nice to learn what all went into it with some good points about human nature and the ability to forgive."}], "reviews_amount": 351}
