{"name": "Run", "titleId": "tt08633478", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "An innovative variation on a theme that will keep you engaged with some ratcheted tension buttressed through two excellent performances from Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen. Does require the odd leap of faith and occasional suspension of belief but by no means the worst film from the genre you're likely to encounter."}, {"id": 1, "text": "So as many reviews have stated, there was a certain amount of predictability to the film. I will call BS on people 'knowing everything that would happen' - I doubt they knew it would end how it does.The complaints I saw in the reviews are mostly people unwilling to embrace the suspension of disbelief, and I think that is their loss. Of course there are things in here that are farfetched and inaccurate... short of BBC films, you will find that in pretty much every movie. Just because you happen to understand the medical jargon going on in this one doesn't make it less believable than the film you had no 'real world' knowledge on. I think this is a pet peeve of mine.Common complaints again, talking about how a woman could kidnap a child and make her sick, and nobody would notice. WHHHHHHHHHHHHAT? It's like you folks have never heard of munchausen by proxy. It happens a bit more than you'd like to think. They specifically address how this goes under the radar by her use of veterinarians, the fact that she has changed her primary doctor 12 times in a short period of time, home schooling, etc. Are there holes in the plot here? Yes. But they do try to fill in most of the gaps.Another complaint is why the daughter doesn't really do anything to stop her mother. Sharp objects around, etc. But this is, until a week ago, a mother who she believed loved and took care of her. Stockholm syndrome can kick in as a teenager, after a shorter period of time (i.e. Elizabeth Smart who might have been rescued months before had she been able to speak up). Children who are abused frequently can't retaliate. This aspect is not at all far fetched.Like I said, there were parts of the story that were predictable. You knew from the previews that mom was making her sick. Not far in, after seeing how isolated she made them (and the fact that it was clear she wasn't going to let her daughter leave the house), you assumed something else had transpired (ie the kidnapping). The part at the end where she is slipping mom the pills - I did not see that coming.To the acting, Sarah Paulson was great. She did a great job with the subtle creepiness. When the daughter is looking things up online that first night, they do focus in on Sarah after she gives up (sitting in the kitchen watching her try to google things)... but it would be a lot easier to miss her already sitting there when the daughter comes down the stairs.I think the actress who plays the daughter is still coming into her own, and I definitely don't think this is the best genre for her, but she wasn't bad.While predictable - I enjoyed the movie. It is a more subtle, creepy film. I also think they have a lot of nuanced stuff going on with accessibility that went over a lot of reviewers heads (like where mom's escape is only thwarted because the wing is not accessible).I will say, the part where she ninjas out her window, into her mom's room, back to her room (for the inhaler), was just a little ridiculous. :)"}, {"id": 2, "text": "I love Sara Paulson and she always delivers. Of course, it seems alot like Gyspy &amp; DeeDee story, but it's not exactly the same. It's what also makes the movie that much more thrilling, to know it actually happened and happens more then we think.Either way, it's a very good and a definite must watch, especially during quarantine if you like thrillers! I am sure you will enjoy this movie, it doesn't get boring or leave you feeling as if the ending was missing something."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I thought the movie started off a little slow, but i really enjoyed the way the real action started and i also liked the ending. All in all, it was a great movie, from the plot to the amazing performances, especially by Sarah Paulson, as usual."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Originally intended for release in theaters this smart, intense thriller was sold to hulu and premiered Friday. The brilliant Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story) stars as the mother of a supposedly sick child that she's spent 17 years taking care of her. The young woman Chloe, played by solid newcomer Kiera Allen begins to suspect her mother may be the one keeping her sick. The movie is intense and edge of your seat filled with clever twists and turns. Although the material is familiar its executed creatively by Aneesh Chaganty of the criminally underseen Searching. This would have been great in theaters but is still damn good at home.****/5 Eric: ****.5/5"}, {"id": 5, "text": "I didn't watch any trailer(s) for this movie before I saw it. So I can't say if the trailers give too much away.I'd say, don't watch the trailer to this movies and you'll be impressed.Performances were great all around and the directing superb. A wonderful thriller that was well thought of.Predictable at times, sure. But still a good film and way to tell the story.Give it a watch. I know I'll see it again sometime."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen (in her acting debut) provide us with great perfomances, a very special dynamic duo that for that alone is worth watching the movie. Both are the best of the film. The script, by Aneesh Chaganty (also the director) and Sev Ohanian, is good enough to get to know and develop the two characters, find out what the problem is and reach the climax. It may be a simple story, but it is still excellent. Finally, what every thriller needs, a good scoring, is achieved in this film thanks to the talented Torin Borrowdale. Without a doubt one of the high points of the film. It's a light and exciting ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Sarah Paulson is my favorite, but this film isn't her best. I waited for months for this to come out and I'm left wondering why I was so excited. The trailer gave everything away. You knew the whole story before it even started. There was little to no character development and everything just felt like it was 0-100 with no pacing whatsoever. Also, the makeup department for Sarah's final look-the hell were you guys on when you came up with this? I actually laughed when I saw her.It was an okay movie. One that you'd be pissed if you spent money on. Same old story, same old acting. Also, nobody knows how to act an asthma attack."}, {"id": 8, "text": "I am so used to seeing Sarah Paulson portray the victim, I've never taken any of her dangerous and frightening roles seriously until this one! I was literally terrified of her performance in this movie , but I still cared for her character in a way. Kudos to the young actress who played Chloe in this movie, very well done. I give this 9/10 I found it to be a solid thrilling ride that has some heart to it!"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Apparently you can kidnap babies from hospitals, no problem and you can also remove all the equipment from the heart monitoring machines and set off all the alarms and noone cares.Predictable as hell, too many plot holes, a ridiculous ending and a waste of 90 mins."}, {"id": 10, "text": "This movie had so many plot holes that it felt like a comedy. The mom can just steal a baby from the hospital? She poisons her daughter for years and no doctor ever notices this during her frequent visits? What did she do with the mailman's car? Nobody cared the mailman was missing? Why did the daughter never pick up one of the many sharp or blunt objects around her and hit her mom? The mom leaves all her important documents in a box sitting out and labeled? Why would she tie up her daughter's wheel chair and not her daughter? This is how the whole movie goes. The only redeemable quality of the film was Sarah Paulson's super creepy acting. Also, this story has been done so many times. I would not even waste my time watching this."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I really loved this film for a few reasons, first of course being the stellar acting. I also liked the daughter's character being given such a fierce sense of determination. There were a few plot holes for me, namely that the daughter wouldn't be smart enough to play along with a lunatic to get to a point where she had access to help. That and the ending seemed a bit formulaic for me (although the 'code blue' deal was great). But other than that, I thought the buildup was really excellent. What tension while the whole deal was revealed! A bit over the top but a really fun ride."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Run is a very good thriller . It has amazing acting from both the actresses . Sarah Paulson was creepy and the girl who played her daughter ( can't remember her name ) was spectacular !! This movie is thrilling and tense but it fails on one major factor . The plot . It's filled with plot holes some minor and some major . That's why you have to put your brain aside for this movie . Nonetheless , it's a great movie"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Went into this movie with no expectations , didn't watch the trailer either , the film does seem to be a little slow at first but builds the tension more and more as the film goes on , has a few twists in that I didn't expect , has a good ending also , without giving away any spoilers I recommend you give this film a watch, I was pleased \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d"}, {"id": 14, "text": "This movie was mediocre at best. Don't believe the people giving it 8 or 9. The plot has been seen many times, it was super unrealistic, and the ending fell flat. They tried to market it as a horror/thriller but nothing about it is thrilling. It's a drama through and through. I will say though, the actors did amazing with what they were given. Sarah Paulson was her usual self, good, not award worthy. But Kiera Allen really stole the show. She made the movie (which dragged on for what seemed like 2 hours) watchable. If you enjoyed The Act or have nothing else to watch, give it a go."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Omg - this was so bad, predictable, ridiculous, and boring. You know everything that is going to happen within the 1st 10 minutes. And anything after that you don't really care about. I probably fastfordwarded though at least 30-45 minutes and didn't miss a thing. Don't waste your time."}, {"id": 16, "text": "If you watched The Act, also on Hulu. viewers will not be surprised by the plot.

The acting is fantastic, while the story is mediocre. The story does a wonderful job of being thrilling, but it mainly doesn't go anywhere. I knew everything that was going to happen even though I didn't know anything. However, There was one scene I enjoyed where Clare says, you need me. The acting was just phenomenal in that specific scene. Overall, it's a one time watch that you'll probably forget."}, {"id": 20, "text": "This film was mediocre at best. I don't get the 8 or 9 star reviews. I would've enjoyed the movie, but it was highly predictable. The story has been done so many times. There's nothing fresh or new about this film, it's overdone and it seemed rushed. The movie literally goes fron 0 to 100 within the first 15 mins...and so many plot holes.Otherwise, Sarah Paulson did an amazing job as always. And Kiera Allen seems so familiar, but she did an awesome job especially for her film debut. I just wish Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian had written a better script in comparison to it's predecessor because (don't lie) we all knew what was going to happen in this movie."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Why bother with this crap. It's like a low rent attempt at a thriller but you already know the ending. The lame attempts at suspense are more annoying than anything. It's a bad lifetime movie to be honest. And I like lifetime movies! It's also overly directed, the music is overwrought and the acting is not great. How can they waste Sarah Paulson! Come on man!!!"}, {"id": 22, "text": "This movie was recommended to me by someone whose preferences are generally similar to my own. And so, with an open mind, I turned on Run. Wow. If it was possible to give zero stars, that would be my rating. However, if Run was intended to be satire, I'd be much more generous with my stars. This movie was so bad, that I could not turn it off. it held me captive in much the same way that Chloe's crazy mom kept her captive. Plot holes galore. So this young girl lives off the grid and her crazy mom has free reign to keep her under control? No involvement with doctors, teachers or any social service agency, and yet this young girl is depicted as being seriously disabled. The characters are strictly one dimensional. A few highlights: Chloe wheeling herself into a pharmacy and announcing: I'm disabled let me cut in line!, and then telling the pharmacist that she and her mom are playing a scavenger hunt game which involves identifying a mystery pill , and the pharmacist exclaiming, I love games! but maintaining her professional ethics by refusing to identify the pill. The pill reference is central to the main plot element. Or, another highlight, Chloe pulls herself out of her window and drags herself around the roof in order to gain access to her mom's bedroom. I thought that scene would go on forever. The hospital security guys appearing just in time to intercept Chloe's mom who is kidnapping her, (for the second time!) from the hospital. The best thing that I can say about this movie was that I found myself laughing out loud and I am not a laughing out loud kind of person. In this time of extremely limited entertainment opportunities, a few laughs are not a bad thing."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Sarah Paulson should have never tarnished her name with this stinker. It goes from 0-60 in a bad way. And don't even get me started on AAAAALL the botched medical aspects (and on a movie based on medicine, that's a big deal). I honestly don't know how I finished it."}, {"id": 24, "text": "That was really bad written and don't believe all the 9 and 10 reviews they are all fake made by the cast and crew! I just don't get what was the whole point, it just sucks so hard that I can't believe this has been done intentionally - surely something went horribly wrong somewhere, there has to be some excuse for the lack of any intelligence."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Started off ok then when it got to the part where Chloe is locked in her bedroom then does a Spiderman across the roof it gets stupid.The ending is awful.I love you mum . . . stupid"}, {"id": 26, "text": "So everyone knows Sarah Paulson by now, even if some think she may be overrated due to her success of never having a day off. One still cannot deny that she is a good actress. This time however I was astonished by this new lead actress that had me captevated from start to finish.The funny thing is I kept thinking throughout the film how terrifying it must be for a person in an actual wheelchair to watch this film, as Kiera Allen's performance was so convincing it's like you are there with her every moment. Turns out after I read up on her she is paralyzed in real life. Not that it even makes a difference based on performance. She sure made a hell of an impression on me! I hope we see more of the very talented Kiera Allen. The film deserves a 10 just based on her performance. Highly recommended."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Damn, I really appreciate a movie with a plot twist that I don't expect at all. I've seen similar plotlines, for example the show called The Act. But what made this movie so much more enjoyable than The Act was the choice of actors. Sarah Paulson's facial expressions made me feel so creeped out and I am stunned by Kiera's acting. It was a lot more dramatic than the characters on The Act, although the one criticism would be that some of the dialogue could have been better written. I feel like Sarah Paulson can play so many different roles in movies and she did so well in this one. YES! I was actually shaking throughout the entire movie! It was soooo thrilling to watch!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "...by which I mean, the writers smoked some really good stuff. While high, they thought up the first half of this film. The next day, tired and muddle-headed, they struggled to regain the magic - gone. Ended up doing a lukewarm retread of a syndrome already covered much better in Sharp Objects &amp; The Act. And while it's cheap-popcorn fun to hate pretty much any recent Arah Paulson character, the thrill feels sick and tawdry afterwards, as in: Need a shower. Here's a challenge, or two: (1) Do not write or discuss a script while not of sound mind, and (2) Write a part for Sarah Paulson that allows her to be likeable or at least relatable. The writers &amp; producers of this one missed the boat on all of the above. Direction is tight, with one of the best tracking sequences I've seen in a while - for that, and the first half of the movie, along with Kiera Allen's performance, it gets a '5'."}, {"id": 29, "text": "I had no expectations but this movie was surprisingly good. I can imagine this story in the real life so definitely worth it!"}, {"id": 30, "text": "This is just the same thing as the act.Spoilers:And why this kinda story lasts this long. Make sure you commit perfect suicide so these kinda parents don't freaking survive. Very frustrating to watch."}, {"id": 31, "text": "It was a great movie for Hulu, the 2 main actresses did a phenomenal job, it kept me on the edge of my seat,overall I give it a 9"}, {"id": 32, "text": "We all should come together to end the Sarah Paulson pandemic."}, {"id": 33, "text": "I am amazed by this movie because of good and realistic topic. It reminds me of real life cases like Michael Schumacher, Stephen Hawking, foster families, and evil family relatives. Topic is scary, real, serious, and teaching. It raises our awareness for disabled, sick, injured, imprisoned people. Also movie gets more interesting towards end, as things develop. But actors, locations, number of people and static activities make everything too boring, annoying, negative. I expected more reasonability, confidence, science, investigation. Instead, it is too ignorant, and more looking like a setup or even unreal, except for the topic."}, {"id": 34, "text": "This movie has so many plotholes it's painful to watch! The plot was obvious from the get go and it doesn't help that Kiera Allen is inept at acting. There were many times I thought I was watching a fish gasping for air when all the time it's simply Kiera Allen subpar version of a human.I would rather watch paint dry than ever see this boring snorefest ever again.

If you insist on watching it, you'll see how you'll have to wait till the cows come home to figure out whether you're watching a thriller, a horror or a drama. Unfortunately, none of these come to pass. Simply 'inserting' the lead actress (whoever that is) into a script full of plotholes and all over the place won't cut it. You might just find yourself following my advice, going into the kitchen, filling with water a glass that your mother in law gave you as a present and dropping it on the floor accidentally on purpose. 'Ooops' will be your only reaction.Yeah, not to mention the highly unoriginal story and the embarrassing ending..."}, {"id": 39, "text": "I'm a big fan of Sarah Paulson's, but this is just not up to any kind of standard.

A complete and total waste of time."}, {"id": 41, "text": "I really enjoyed this movie. The most effective suspenseful elements in this movie are within each scene: the anticipation and build up of what's going to happen. I don't really think the trailer diminishes anything, contrary to what others have said, because you would know what was going on within the first 10 minutes of the movie anyway. That is, if you've seen more than a handful of thrillers in your life.The movie is good but the actors are great. They are why I rated this movie a 7. You'll get what you'd expect from Sarah Paulson: excellence. But this was my first time seeing Kiera Allen, and I thought she was great as well.If you like jump scares (or at least the anticipation of them), and suspenseful psychological horror films, check this movie out.

Have seen the directors first film Searching and loved that as well. Both main leads acted very well and it was a shame the film had to end after 1 hour 30 mins. Looking forward to seeing what the director does next."}, {"id": 49, "text": "I was intrigued by the premise of this movie. I was aware of the miniseries The Act and the documentary that preceded it Mommy Dead and Dearest, the story of Gypsy. An extreme case of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSbP). This film does show the dark side of it, but not well enough. It barely scratches the surface of the disorder however, it does show the manipulation from the provider to the surrounding acquaintances of the family. These being the postman and local pharmacist. This is more like a take on Misery instead of the story of Gypsy and how she was manipulated by her mother. Run instead shows how the victim uses her knowledge and skills to single handedly fight and break free from chains of confinement- literally and metaphorically. I think the main problem was the perspective of the script. It's too much like Misery, which was written in the form of delusional toxic fandom. The script just substitutes the line of I'm your number one fan for I'm your mom. For which in the circumstance of Misery, serves that story really well. Using that same approach with Run doesn't work. Delusional? Yes. Toxic? Yes. But with MSbP, which this film wants to show, doesn't show the extreme lengths a provider will go in order to stay in that position of power, so to speak. Providers will literally torture their victims, break bones, bind feet, blind, etc. to ensure that they are always needed. In some cases providers will kill their victims to gain additional sympathy from close friends.This movie doesn't show MSbP properly. It's toxic delusional mothering to be sure, but it is not a good example of MSbP. For that watch the documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest and the HBO show Autopsy Confessions of a medical examiner- the story of Marybeth Tinning. The latter will chill your bones.Spoilers Where Run also comes up short is the ending. The prolonged torcher Chloe inflicts makes her no better than her mother was. I would've preferred a one time retribution- kicking her mother down the stairs before the police shot her and she fell. Just so we the audience can cheer for Chloe getting her own little revenge and then growing up and having as normal a life as she can. Whereas in the actual ending we see a bland role reversal. Not fitting for the story and source material it comes from. There's more potential in the source instead of what's in this story."}, {"id": 50, "text": "It's Friday night, dark and cold outside and Taco on my plate, let's go!

Sarah Paulson plays her part very well and Kiera Allen does a superb job.What lets this movie down is the writing and directing.

Not to mention quite a few things did not add up.The directing/editing is also a letdown as some scenes are unnecessary and drawn out seemingly there just to get the runtime to 90 minutes.I could recommend this for the acting, however the script fails in my opinion and most will figure out what is going on in about 10-15 minutes."}, {"id": 72, "text": "As has happened several times before, an interview with the director and lead actor on NPR put this movie on my do-list.

It does well in creating this claustrophobic and isolated setting for the main lead after she is presented with the harsh truth of her mother when she decides its time for her to leave the nest and go to college. That was a nice touch for the movie to take plot wise, it didn't present some unrealistic and terribly cliche conflict for the film to take flight. The daughter becomes skeptical about the mother when the mother's stories and decisions become questionable. I really enjoyed watching the movie, I just thought the ending sucked. This movie plays out like 10 Cloverfield Lane, where the buildup is solid and well paced, and the ending just destroys the entire process because its so outrageous and outlandish that it doesn't fit the initial presentation of the story or its characters.The greatest thing a film can do is bring a reasonable closure to its leading actor/actress and end there... like Scream, its the most satisfying ending in my opinion; but no... this movie decides to have the daughter treat her mother the way she was treated at the end of the movie which really took away from Chloe's innocence; I think if they had never put that pointless crap at the end of the film, it would be way better! The ending was just very frustrating to be honest.

Kiera Allen was great as the protagonist and once the plot got going she really made the film.

My main problem with this movie is that there are many plot holes that kind of bring you out of the emersion. Things that you just know feel off, or just shouldn't really work.

I think it was originally meant to premiere in theaters until the COVID pandemic hit and delayed it among many major Hollywood productions. So it ended up on Hulu as one of their original movies. I'm still not 100% sure about how I feel on Sarah Paulson. While I generally think she's an actress who is very good at relaying deep emotions, there's also something annoying about her acting style as she has this languorous speech pattern like she's trying to hypnotize the person she's talking to. She's also famous for her nonstop crying and screaming. Anyone who has seen American Horror Story knows what I'm talking about. So, why, you ask, if I'm not the biggest Sarah Paulson fan (as so many people seem to be) am I rating this flick so highly? First, this is a very well done movie. Second, Paulson's hystrionics are dialed down immensely in this to the point I actually like her performance. Finally, Paulson is not the actual star of this piece. That honor goes to newcomer Kiera Allen in a brilliant film debut. It is Allen's character that really drives the plot.Run is the story of single mother Diane Sherman (Paulson) and her 17-year old daughter Chloe Sherman (Allen). Chloe was born with several debilitating birth defects, including paralysis, asthma, and diabetes. Diane has dedicated her life to care for Chloe, including home schooling, a strict dietary regimen, and supervising her medical care. A wheelchair-confined Chloe is pretty good at taking care of herself and is incredibly smart. Allen, who is actually disabled in real life, is a revelation as she is required to do many hair-raising physical stunts while still staying in character. And in actuality, Allen gets way more screen time than Paulson as the film is told almost completely from Chloe's POV. In particular, I like how incredibly smart and clever that Chloe is. Every move that makes feels like it's coming from a character with actual common sense. In fact, Chloe may be one of the smartest protagonists that I've ever seen in a horror movie. Plus, for once, the minor characters aren't dumb as a bag of rocks as they usually are in horror films.The first half of the film cleverly makes you wonder if there's really something off with Diane or is it all just in Chloe's mind. The second half pays it all off. It has an old-fashioned horror movie appeal with a very simple plot and believable characters. No tricks or silly special effects. Just a straightforward plot that allows the viewer to go along with Chloe on her journey of self-discovery as well as finding out the deal with her mother. Also, the ending is incredibly satisfying."}, {"id": 165, "text": "This reminded me of the Deedee Blanchard account aka Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017), this is ok but the Deedee story is horrific"}, {"id": 166, "text": "Diane Sherman (Sarah Paulson) is an overly protective mother to homeschooled wheelchair-bound teenager Chloe (Kiera Allen). Chloe grows suspicious of the pill her mother gives her.This is a nice little simple psychological horror. The script has a few minor flaws but I can deal with that. The pharmacist is way too stupid. It could have been fixed if she calls social services. That could have led to a tense scene when a social worker comes knocking at the door. Another scene is breaking the window. It's very unlikely to work and she could have just hit it with something like a hammer. When Chloe conveniently discovers everything, it would be more intense if she tries to placate her mother. Newcomer Kiera Allen is actually a pretty good actress and I would like her to try changing gears in her characterization. All in all, this is nice but it could be even better.

We are hooked to the screen from the beginning, confronting the conflicts through the perspective of Chloe. This is a very wonderful debut for Kiera Allen who plays Chloe.

The simple story may make you underestimate the film getting to know it through the course of the film makes the viewing experience so exciting.

Is the daughter completely isolated at this house and never allowed out or to socialize? Wouldn't that tip her off right away her mother is a nut bag??

Now this should be a red flag to the pharmacist, but nope she still is getting away with poisoning her daughter since there were no cops called to the home. Just weird instances throughout the movie that would throw caution flags for anyone else to get her out of that scenario.All in all this is a one and done movie.

Regardless, she is looking forward to shrugging off her small-town life and heading to college, that is, if she can escape the control of her manipulative mother whose dark secrets run deeper than Chloe fears.Sarah Paulson has practically made a career out of playing insane characters who simmer behind her eyes, leaving you a bit frightened about when she's going to lash out. And, as usual, Paulson delivers her performance in spades. Watching her character struggle to maintain control when her world begins to crumble is terrifying because you know that whatever bad she's done still isn't the worst she can do.Kiera Allen, who plays the wheelchair-bound Chloe--and who is disabled in real life--makes her feature film debut in Run, and holds her own against Paulson's veteran-level acting chops. Allen makes you feel every bit of suffering Chloe goes through. She never stops for a second to lament her circumstances, but forges ahead as all good proactive heroines should!It's a shame watching the media parade around strong female characters like Captain Marvel, Rey Palpatine, and Mulan who are nothing more than Mary Sues in their own stories, when brilliantly written female characters like Chloe are struggling to be noticed. This movie made me think of 2019's Crawl, starring Kaya Scodelario, who played another wonderfully-written female character whose courage, wit, and proactive approach to conflict was character-driven and not magically bestowed upon them because the plot demanded it.I feel like some critics are being unfairly harsh on this movie. David Fear over at Rolling Stone called it a two-star misstep, while Jeannette Catsoulis at The New York Times insinuated that it's a bad thing that the movie doesn't rely on flashbacks. Are you kidding me?! My screenwriting professor taught me that flashbacks are the laziest form of storytelling and I agree. They're a cheap way to fill in the blanks, and Run is far more clever than that in how it unfolds its backstory.Run is a very simple story and will feel predictable to many, but it's got a few nice twists and turns that will still keep you guessing. The performances of the leads are what will grip you the most, especially Allen's-who knew that watching a character try to write a single word with a crayon would make me cheer for them? You can do it, Chloe!"}, {"id": 235, "text": "This is a new film on Hulu by Aneesh Chaganty (and co-written by Sev Ohanian), following up their cinematic debut Searching (2018) with a thriller involving a mother and her 17-year-old daughter born with several complications (arrhythmia, hemochromatosis, asthma, diabetes, and most impactfully paralysis).I will say that it's possible this movie is better than I liked it, but if so it would be for its directing and acting, and less so about the writing. I felt like there were holes everywhere, and perhaps too much is thrown at us too soon for us to properly care for the characters and their situation. This kind of movie has been done before, without much new added to the table minus the wheelchair aspect. There were a lot of elements set up for what could have provided a stronger ending delivery and punch, but most of those beats were one-note and used up earlier in the film rather than connecting a strong inner-weaving as Searching was able to do.I went in blind, and it's likely better that I did given that the trailer is somewhat revealing. I don't think it had a high enough ceiling in the first place to eclipse any wild lack of expectations I already had. My only expectation was in the hands of the creators, and the most redeeming quality this movie will likely have on audiences is I hope they become aware of Searching and see it at some point... which is what I hope most of you all can take away from this. That was my favorite film of 2018, and Run will fall to the wayside as somewhat compelling yet completely forgettable.

While anxiously waiting to hear back from an university on her application. She soon discover that one of her medication may not be her own. Which causes her to dig up more information if her mother is really helping her or her mother is hiding something.Run is a effective thriller. Putting the audience on the edge with a poor helpless girl. Which she is unable to walk. Her mother sheltering her away with no computer besides her own. No cell phones. So Chloe is unable to really reach for outside help besides her mother. The direction did a good job in leaving you on the edge of your seat. Chloe trying to seek help while her mother is distracted with something. But moments later her mother is creepily lurking near.The plot may be covering similar concept grounds that lifetime movies have done before. But thrilling nonetheless. There is a twist that may shock viewers.Sarah Paulson plays a creepy obsessed mother really well. Kiera Allen also did a good job in playing a struggling daughter.The film does pick up the pace with thrills and suspense which may have you gasping for air when Chloe is trying to seek help away from her mother.

All of the mystery and thrills get exhausted in the first 35 minutes and thereafter, it's a straightforward, predictably mediocre film. It's almost like the writers (Changanty himself &amp; Sev Ohanian) ran out of ideas in the second half and what ends up on the screen is plot-holes galore. I mean, I simply cannot like a thriller where the antagonist stocks all evidence of her wrongdoings in a goddamn box for the protagonist to conveniently find them at a crucial juncture in the film. That's just ridiculous!The good thing to have come out of the weirdly titled 'Run' is Kiera Allen. She puts up a more-than-decent performance that keeps the first act and parts of the second mostly engaging. Sarah Paulson is fine as the creepy, protective mom but I wish her character had better detailing (those scars were such a useless decoy!) . The film seems to have been designed to evoke the feels of reading a Stephen King novel (noticed the Kathy Bates Easter egg) or watching one of M.N Shyamalan's earlier thrillers. In fact, some wide-angle shots are effectively chilling. The quest to unravel the mystery is, though predictable, fairly more exciting in the initial bits.On the whole, I felt that Run was a rather hollow effort in creating an emotional thriller that places the subject of abusive parenting at its forefront. It does offer a few big acting moments for Kiera Allen (who's a wheelchair-user in real life) but forgets to flesh out Paulson's character. 'Run' isn't a solid follow-up to 'Searching', but I'll still keep an eye out for Chaganty's next."}, {"id": 238, "text": "* There is no end credit scene *The director Aneesh Chaganty and crew brought an overfamiliar storyline.

I expected more from him since his directional debut Searching (2018), was fantastic and even though this was a common film I thought maybe there was a twist but sadly it was already done before making it annoying and predictable.The composer Torin Borrowdale knows how to really set the thriller atmosphere. No matter how repetitive the movie was I was impressed by the suspense in certain scenes and the music set it perfectly making me feel very edgy.Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen's performances were fantastic but I couldn't deeply feel for the mother because it lacked depth in the script making me not be able to feel for her situation. By not having her have more depth it created a chain of events of me not be able to feel for the daughter as well.

The last, couple years we have seen a numerous movies tackle the illness know as M\u00fcnchausen by Proxy, where we essentially see a mother poison her child. I feel like i've watched this movie 5 times before.The movie is also very predictable, with might have to due, with my previous fact that we have seen this movie already.

Run certainly doesn't come close to the lofty heights of Searching, one of my top 5 movies of 2018, but it delivers a satisfying, tense thriller in a short runtime. The plot is quite straightforward and is predictable, but the performances and direction keep us on the edge of our seat anyways. The basic story is pretty one-note and I'm not even sure if the advertising is trying to hide it. Even so, as you'd expect if you watched Searching, the attention to detail is excellent here. The set design is great, with small details throughout the house adding to the immersion. Paulson has a fun role that she thankfully doesn't go too off the rails with, but it is absolutely Allen who steals the show here. It was a great choice to get an actress who actually uses a wheelchair for the role, because the movements, especially quick ones when she's trying to get going quickly or be sneaky, would fall flat on their face if she wasn't deft in using the wheelchair. Not only are the wheelchair scenes completely natural, Allen's gradual turn from nervous bargaining to intense fear is fantastic. I really hope we see more from her in the future, because she'd honestly make my top 5 lead actresses of this year right now. The script isn't quite as tight as in Searching, and the final scene (with the line open wide) was quite silly and detracts from the resolution up to that point. It's not a movie that will stay with me because it doesn't have enough to say psychologically or thematically, but I was nervous and completely engaged from start to finish."}, {"id": 241, "text": "I had pretty high hopes for this movie and I am a big fan of Sarah Paulson.

There is no real building of tension, and everything is too over the top to make it feel even remotely believeable or powerful.As the topic the movie explores is such a serious and sensitive subject it should be treated in the same way, but this movie somehow manages to make it feel like a cheesy gimmick.They tried to include so many different layers which ultimately failed to add to the 'horror' as . There were so many things that would not be possible for someone in a wheelchair.

Run solidifies Chaganty's place in Hollywood as one of the most technically impressive directors working today. His undeniable talent allows him to effortlessly generate incredible suspense throughout the movie's entire runtime, and his second feature-film is no exception.Possessing the type of premise I enjoy the most in thrillers, Chaganty and Sev Ohanian's screenplay is packed with excruciatingly long takes, filled with extremely tense dialogues, shocking developments, and a brutal amount of pain. All are enormously elevated by one of the most physically-demanding, emotionally powerful performances I've seen in the last few years: Kiera Allen, who uses a wheelchair for mobility in real-life, turns her acting debut into a genuine, realistic display of the challenging obstacles people with her condition have to overcome daily.Sarah Paulson continues her trend of playing truly evil characters, and I advise her to keep following this dark path of phenomenal interpretations. Her interactions with Kiera are remarkably intense. Story-wise, even though the constant revelations are narratively shocking, most of the script's developments are somewhat predictable. However, the movie logic problems stretch believability to a point beyond my limit, ultimately becoming one of those films people will either deeply enjoy or really hate depending on how nitpicky they choose to be.I'm as moderate as I can be, and the truth is, I didn't really think about these logical issues during the actual viewing. Having in mind Run's brilliant technical attributes (notably Nick Johnson and Will Merrick's editing, and Torin Borrowdale's score), its two impressive lead performances, and its endless suspenseful atmosphere, I can't help but recommend it to every fan of the genre.Rating: B+"}, {"id": 243, "text": "Plot: I found it extremely thriller and psychological!

Run is probably more popular than Searching already from the record breaking views on Hulu. All of us Searching fans have been waiting for this one for a while now. I'm sad to say Run doesn't quite hold up to the standards of Searching, but this is still a good movie. Sev Ohanian and Aneesh Chaganty know how to make a compelling story. Every step of the way I wanted to know what would happen next. How Searching filled itself up with mystery and twists till the end overpowers this one. Run's setup is not like that in which you know what is going to happen, but how it will unfold is the mystery. That's where it suffered for me. Just the expectations I had from the writers, directors, and raving reviews before its release had me with such high hopes. In the end I got a good movie, though.The performances is where the story shines most. Sarah Paulson has been the center of attention for this one because of American Horror Story and how well she does with horrors/thrillers. She is convincing, but because of the writing you know what's going to happen with her and everything. For her first feature, Kiera Allen does fantastic. We're with her mainly the whole time so we can really connect with her. Portraying all these health issues can be challenging for an actor. She makes it look almost easy with how well she did. I'm sure come Chainsaw Awards and all those, she'll be in conversation. I don't have much else to say about Run. It's good but didn't wow me.

Kiera Allen is respectively terrific and will become a big name. You can tell that this film is heavily inspired by films from the past like Mommie Dearest and Misery for example.

Still, there are several tense &amp; thrilling scenarios in store here and the plot sustains its grip on the viewers for the most part. However, the payoff isn't rewarding enough.It doesn't take long for the main plot to surface. It actually does a tad too early when more time should've been devoted to make the mother-daughter bonding feel real &amp; authentic before sowing the seeds of doubt &amp; suspicion in our protagonist. Acting is impressive from both Sarah Paulson &amp; Kiera Allen, for the former is believable as the crazy mom while the latter renders every facet of her character's physicality with precision to steal the show.Overall, Run is a competently constructed example of its genre(s) that manages to keep us invested in the outcome despite the predictable storyline but unfortunately fails to stick the landing in the final moments to wrap up on a fulfilling note. The finale still works, albeit in a formulaic &amp; generic way. Underwhelming when compared to Chaganty's previous feature, Run is still far from a disaster and a slight adjustment in expectations should yield a satisfying enough experience for most, if not all."}, {"id": 247, "text": "Run is the newest Hulu original film.

Her daughter then suspects that her mom is keeping a dark secret from her.Run was a film I wasn't planning on watching because I don't have Hulu and it didn't seem like something to get Hulu for. I still wouldn't get Hulu just for this movie but that doesn't mean its bad. I was at a cabin that had Hulu and I watched this film at the cabin. I was utterly surprised. I thought this film wasn't going to be that good but ended up being something much better. To start, the story was wonderfully crafted. From start to finish it had me on the edge of my seat. The only thing I didn't like about the story was one little bit at the end. I just thought it didn't need to be there at all. Besides that the story was wonderful. It was cool to see how the mother and daughter bonded at the start. It showed that they both actually did care for each other at one point.The acting in the film was probably the best part. Kiera Allen as the disabled girl was a fantastic choice. She needs a wheel chair in real life so it added to the performance a lot. I bet if they got someone else that wasn't in a wheel chair, the part would have been portrayed a lot differently. Sarah Paulson gave a marvelous performance. She always plays such a creepy person in movies. This film wasn't her best but it was a darn good performance. The daughter and mother were really the only two actors in the film besides for some other little parts that some characters had.As I said in the title, this film is actually thrilling. There are a lot of movies that just aren't scary at all that have been coming out. The two films this year that actually freaked me out are Run and His House. His House is a marvelous film I would defiantly recommend checking out. This film was a nail biter though. It had you asking many questions to your self during the movie about character decisions. The main character wasn't dumb or anything but the mom was the one that made you think. There were also some really intense sequences were the main character had to get something done but the mom was pretty close to her. Those always make me freak out a little bit.

I now understand why some people hated this film. However I cannot agree with that sentiment. Many reviewers are describing it as rehashed, predictable and full of plot-holes... I don't think the trailer helped because it showed too much of what is a relatively simple, but not overly-used plot. I suppose many people don't realize that this film deals with a subject that is a real phenomenon, it has a medical name and everything, but is little known and hard to believe. Also, as many arm-chair quarterbacks are guilty of, it is easy to point out characters blunders and short-comings from the laz-e-boy with the benefit of being able to see all the way to the periphery of their situation on the big screen in front of you... Here are the facts... Sarah Paulson brings a level of sinister to her character that I was not expecting having seen her in many other films, yet she also evokes empathy throughout. Newcomer Kiera Allen shocked me with how well she played against the veteran actress, displaying a natural acting ability that assures me she will have a successful career in Hollywood, despite the fact that she actually does use a wheel-chair in real life... The cinematography is super solid utilizing static camera work, mid-closeups and camera angles which enhance the suspense and story-line.

I enjoyed it, no doubt about that, but it never managed to grip me and put me on the edge of my seat needing to know what was going to happen next.The story was just a little bit basic for me.

The film does have a PG-13 rating which is usually a red flag of a very safe movie, however 'Searching' had the same rating so I wasn't too worried about that. 'Run' did feel extremely safe though. Any minor scenes of violence that do occur typically happen off screen for the most part. The pacing in this film also seemed just a little off. There are some very over-long and drawn out scenes with not a lot going on.The acting in this film is superb. Sarah Paulson gives her everything to the role. She's almost worth an entire extra point for the film all by herself. Also new-comer Kiera Allen in her debut film blew me away. I would never have guessed that she was new to the industry.
