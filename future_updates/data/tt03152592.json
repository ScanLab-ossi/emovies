Why they couldn't have just kept this as an origin story of how the gang met and started solving mysteries is beyond me. Instead the story spirals off into a million directions and is filled with tons of poorly executed pop culture references. The animation is stellar, but the plot diminishes this one a lot. I'm not expecting it to be just like the TV series, but my kids got more excited at the beginning of the movie and started to lose interest as it went on. Sometimes I wonder if these screenwriters working on kids movies actually have kids. So disappointing and a big missed opportunity."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I realize that Scoob is basically a kids' cartoon generic movie. I realize that I am long past the target audience's age. However, I grew up a fan of the original Scooby Doo cartoon. I was 4 years-old when the cartoon originally aired and I have fond memories of those Saturday mornings. The people responsible for making these new movies have taken most of what made that show good and thrown it out the window. The ghosts and monsters weren't real. There was always a rational explanation behind everything that went on. Part of the fun was trying to wrap my 4 year-old brain around how the bad guys were doing their evil deeds. But a movie based in anything approaching reality wouldn't work as a big, over-bloated, CGI mess like SCOOB. It's unreal, it's loud, and it leaves nothing to the imagination. The film consistently makes fun of itself in that I'm-smarter-than-you, self-referential way that I find so annoying. It's a shame to me that young kids today will not grow-up understanding the charm of the original Scooby Doo."}, {"id": 2, "text": "My boyfriend and I waited months for this. He loves scooby doo. He bought his niece scooby doo for christmas, to promote his propaganda of Scooby Doo. He woke up today, the 15th May, his first words saying its Scoob day!. We brought snacks in the middle of this pandemic and brought them home. We watched it, and I saw the light from his eyes leave when Simon Cowell (????) was introduced, when blue falcon dabbed and made cringey jokes, etc. He's a ruined man. Velma does not sound like Velma. All for a shared universe, you've destroyed a man. The first 15 minutes were good though hence the extra star lol."}, {"id": 3, "text": "For those hoping to watch a fun origin story of scooby doo or maybe a fun giant epic mystery adventure film, unfortunately this film misses that mark. What you should expect to see is another average CGI animated cliche and extremely bland and predictable super hero film. This film tried to accomplish too much during its runtime, that is ends up accomplishing nothing!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "It doesn't matter what age we are when it comes to Scooby Doo it was, is &amp; always will be a must watch. Now if you're following the Scooby-Doo animated / Cartoons series or movies then you already know how cross overs are common &amp; Scoob is no different you'll see other Characters from Hanna-Barbera such as Blue-Falcon and his Dog , Dick Dastardly from Wacky Racers as the main Antagonist alongside Muttley with a Cameo providing you the total nostalgic journey especially if your 90's kids or older. Film follows how Scoob and the gang met when they were children's following the Scooby-Doo theme song 'Scooby Dooby Doo Where Are You? We Got Some Work To Do Now' with same picturization as we've seen in 90's. The Movie is set-ed in modern times where you'll find IKEA , Netflix's jokes along with Insta &amp; Selfies. The major weak point about the movie was the mystery part as when it comes to Scooby Doo there has to be a ghost, ending with that iconic removal of Face Mask following 'Those Meddling Kids' but sadly you wont see that this time and that's Sad Very Very Sad."}, {"id": 5, "text": "This movie dies after the first 15 minutes. It starts and it's super cute and actually resembles Scooby-Doo. But then it just goes off the rails. It has stupid cameos, pop culture nonsense like dabbing?? It was so basic. The plot was just nonsense and boring.I don't love the animation style they look like they are made from each plastic and the voice acting is kinda off putting because for the most part non of the characters sound like any incarnation of them from the past which is strange as some of the old cast members spoke about wanting to return and were disappointed not to be asked.My other complaint is there want really a main monster to fight against it seemed to randomly pop up in the end. It just didn't seem like Scooby-Doo"}, {"id": 6, "text": "Did not have the classic Scooby Vibe. Trying to hard to be hip.

Why have today's kids grow up with Scooby Doo being this way ? It was truely a disappointed. Keep the fans of older Scooby Doo and keep us out of it. Don't put references of the originals in something that isn't Scooby Doo at all.

Shouldve made this movie with the original animated Scooby Doo movies in mind and it would of been great..."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I really wanted to like this movie. I truly did but this is not a Scooby-Doo movie. First of all PLEASE tell me why do they insist on having REAL monsters when the whole point of Scooby-Doo is disproving the supernatural. This is an ORGIN story and the origin of Scooby-Doo is having fake monsters. They completely ruin that aspect in the movie and have some type of underworld concept with 3 skulls opening the portals to the underworld. What on earth is that?! This is not the Scooby-Doo I grew up with. I'm so angry at myself for buying this movie such a waste of my money. On top of that it's more of a Blue Falcon movie rather than a Scooby-Doo one. It has ZERO mystery in it and the comedy is forced and will age badly in a few years.The only good quality is the movie has great animation. Other than that I hated it and I will be contacting Apple on getting my money back.I'm a HUGE Scooby fan and I was immensely disappointed. :("}, {"id": 10, "text": "Another CGI 'product' that chucks out all of the charm of the original in favour of contemporary post-modern gibberish and self-referential jokes that do nothing but make all of the characters smug and unlikeable.

I was expecting so much more from it. It looks like scriptwriters were inspired by TikTok rather than by original series.

I won't be watching this movie again and I'm a bit mad at myself for wasting money on renting such a mediocre animated film/ story. Completely kids eye candy at best , nothing more here ."}, {"id": 18, "text": "I can see what they were going for by crossing over with other Hanna-Barbera characters, but in doing so, I think that they stripped away a lot of what makes Scooby-Doo so great. I was always drawn in by Mystery Inc's skepticism to all things supernatural and as a child, I felt that I could dip my toe into something spooky but the humour and adventure would balance it all out. Even in this film, snippets of the gang's spooky hijinks were the highlight for me and without that - I feel that there is no Scooby-Doo. In saying that, the animation was beautiful, I do love these characters and I think that Zac Efron was a perfect casting choice for Fred. I feel thankful that this has gone straight to streaming rather than a wide theatrical release, as I can only hope that a new generation finds a better entry point into Scooby-Doo rather than this film."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This felt like a straight to VOD B-list film you can find on Netflix or Amazon Prime, not a high quality Theatrical Release that it initially set out to be. Honestly, the first 15-20 minutes were the best part of this film and we got a really good origin story of the entire gang. It just spirals out of control and into absurdity from there, in a semi self-imploding kind of way. I'm not sure what the screenwriters had in mind when they set out to write this. Feels like 3 minds have been cramped into this film, giving rise to this incoherent mess that could have been much better."}, {"id": 20, "text": "This Scoob! Movie goes pretty much against the series we've all known and loved. It shows the movie's origins, and set, to be in the 21st century, with instagram posts, dabs and other honestly cringeworthy scene, as most pop references are way out of fashion and awkwardly shoved in with the script. The team doesn't solves a mystery, but instead basically tries to stop a super villain whose identity is known from the start. The only paranormal thing appears near the end and is...Actually paranormal, which goes against the series' concept : debunking paranormal activity. That appart, the music choice is really bad, and there are also political messages mixed in the movie. Velma ethnically Latin American in this movie, she even speaks in Spanish once. There are is also a commentary about Toxic masculinity when two of the protagonists are arguing in a comedic manner. The beginning of the movie was good and some scenes were alright. I was about to put a 3 star review, but then remembered that the little robot with a vacuum head is only there so that WB can sell merchs to little kids.So in conclusion, this movie is pretty much like a bad fan fiction made by a middle school teen who signed up in the political club.

Totally different concept of Scooby doo in this film."}, {"id": 25, "text": "The mystery gang isn't entirely present in this new spin-off of the Scooby-doo franchise. There isn't any mystery to this film, the plot is EXTREMELY predictable, just by watching the commercials for this. The jokes weren't funny and were rather cheesy and outdated. Totally waste of money and time whether you rent or buy the premiere of this flick. I would recommend waiting for this to release on redbox or streaming services . Totally flashy, lame and overall forgettable kiddy movie."}, {"id": 26, "text": "I had so many expectations. Scoob! sets on a completely different track from the original stories, which I would welcome if it was better written.

They're clearly superior."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Not a bad movie but I don't know why you would choose to make a Scooby-Doo movie and not include Matthew Lilard, Grey DeLisel and Frank Welker.

If you stopped this film right after the recreation of the opening credits it would be perfect. I didn't enjoy Fortes Shaggy, and was upset that Fred, Velma and Daphne have very little to do. A strong story arc could have been for man and dog. We have three sets of man and his dog. We could have made Blue Falcon and Dee Dee as one character, the original Blur Falcon had a biracial daughter, and gave some story beats to Dyno Mutt. I'm tired of the theatrical films be about a real ghost. Why! That's not Scooby! It worked in Zombie Island because there was a history and it was later in their careers. I want the gang to solve a real detailed mystery that's fun. How hard is that?"}, {"id": 78, "text": "Is it good? Not really. Is it bad though? No, it's quite nostalgic actually. Love the characters but not the plot. Watch it with your children and i am pretty sure they'll enjoy their mystery inc experience."}, {"id": 79, "text": "Scooby-Doo is a franchise that continues to this day and the idea of this film may have been an attempt to create a Hanna-Barbera cinematic universe, as if we really needed another one. We already have Marvel, which is just pretty good in my opinion, and DC, which I'm kinda mixed on. Not to mention, the title of this film doesn't even give you the hint that it's mixing in other characters from the Hanna-Barbera animated TV shows.I liked the beginning of the film. It had some neat character introductions that puts you in the right mood and a provides a couple laughs here and there. It's not an amazing opening, but it was an interesting one that starts off on the right foot. But then before you know it, the film pummels you with jokes that fall flat, a few predictable cliches, and some character development that tries to connect with the opening, but then a certain cliche before the climax ruins it. What could that cliche be, you ask? Why don't YOU guess then? Huh?If there are a few good things about this movie, there was the opening as mentioned before, the animation somewhat resembles the show, the actings alright, though the performances could have been a little better, specifically Will Forte as Shaggy and Ken Jeong as Dynomutt. I do think Frank Welker does good as Scooby, but he wasn't a perfect impression of the character.Honestly, I wish this film got me going nearly to tears near the end because apparently people were crying at it, but I didn't really feel much because I predicted the next thing that happened because of how freaking predictable the film was especially around the climax.So in conclusion, this film had some potential, but it definitely isn't worth 90 minutes of your life. It started off promising, but it weakened as the film continued. That is why this film gets a 3/10. Thanks for reading."}, {"id": 80, "text": "This was a fun one. Loved seeing Muttley. My 11 year old son loved it and so did I."}, {"id": 81, "text": "As a Scooby-Doo fan, this movie was strange to watch. Like, it works as a Hanna-Barbera tribute (and it's apparently supposed to start a Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe), but not as a Scooby-Doo movie. In fact, it doesn't feel like a Scooby-Doo movie at all.Animation: This is the best thing about the movie. The animation is wacky, fluid, and nice-looking. However, it would be better if they animated it in a limited way, as a throwback to the limited animation of the Hanna-Barbera days.Writing: Hoo boy. Some parts of the writing were really bad. Scooby suddenly gets a big ego, Daphne, Velma and Fred were jerks to Shaggy and Scooby out of nowhere, etc. However it's not the worst thing in the world. Also the twist ending is just ugh. Of course Shaggy wouldn't die.Characters: Daphne, Velma, and Fred don't play a big role in the movie, as it's all about Shaggy and Scooby. I will admit that Shaggy and Scooby's arcs were decent but flawed. Dick Dastardly is the best character in the movie, as he has a reasonable motivation for being evil, and the part with Muttley nearly made me cry.Music: The music is pretty solid. I like how they did a cover of the original theme song.Enjoyment: The Hanna-Barbera references are great but overall it was a mess of a film, and only slightly manages to squeak by with an extra star, I would have rated it 5/10 otherwise. Will Forte should never voice Shaggy ever again."}, {"id": 82, "text": "I absolutely love this movie!

All in all, this movie is a great addition to the Scooby-verse."}, {"id": 83, "text": "The whole family liked it. A lot of other reviews are harsher than they need to be so I'm giving the 10/10.

However, The end did make me shed a few tears"}, {"id": 89, "text": "My Kid life was full of Scooby Doo and really enjoyed this one with the kids... full of laughter and nostalgic feeling. Loved the animations and the voice performances... really wish for more \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe"}, {"id": 90, "text": "I seriously had such a great time watching this. The animation was beautiful, the soundtrack and the score was great, the voice acting was solid, and the nostalgia was so enjoyable.Being that Scooby-Doo recently had its 50th anniversary not too long ago this is definitely a great tribute to go out on. For me the main highlight of the film is the relationship between Shaggy and Scooby, we get to see how they first met and how they got hooked up with Fred, Daphne, and Velma which is very touching. You can really tell how much they care for each other and that they're always willing to watch each other's backs even in the toughest of times. Plus they actually get to overcome their cowardice and save the day at the end without doing it inadvertently which is awesome.The other characters are pleasant too, the Blue Falcon and his crew have these funny interactions with each other and the Falcon Fury is a very cool mode of transportation. The Blue Falcon himself has an interesting dive into his character, he's had crossovers with Scooby-Doo before, but this time his son Brian has taken on the title for his retired father to carry the legacy on, he's very friendly and loves to please his fans but the downside to him is that he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer and is a bit of a coward which does drive Dynomutt and Dee Dee crazy, people do feel pressure when trying to live up to their family's legacy so you can really feel for him and it's really satisfying when he overcomes his fear. Fred, Daphne, and Velma do sort of get pushed to the side but they at least still play a part in the story and I like how they manage to figure out what Dick Dastardly's scheme is and how much they're concerned about Shag and Scoob's safety. Dick Dastardly is a decent balance between being entertainingly silly and terrifyingly intimidating, it's fun watching him get annoyed at the drop of a hat whenever his minions fail him or if he's trying to show off and at the same time it's pretty unsettling seeing what methods he uses to get what he wants such as his oversized airship, robot minions that may look adorable but are actually dangerous, and even perfectly disguising himself to fool the other characters. But believe it or not Dastardly actually has a selfless motivation in the film, it turns out one of his past schemes cost him his sidekick Muttley, so he vows to do whatever it takes to get him back, and when the 2 reunite, it's actually surprisingly touching.All the humor is on top form and there's not a single joke that doesn't hit, it mainly relies on slapstick and wordplay and so far I can't think of a single one of them that I didn't find funny. It also used a lot of the original Hanna-Barbera sound effects which might not be fitting for a high-budget CG animated movie on paper but being that this movie is based on a Hanna-Barbera property I think it works to the film's advantage, especially since the animators were trying to stay true to the silly nature of the animation from the cartoons.When it comes to the voice acting it's on point, even though there is one nitpick I have with it. Shaggy was voiced by Will Forte and he was absolutely fantastic, he used a less dopey voice which might've been different from what most other people are used to but I think that was because of a controversy going around stating Shaggy might have been a stoner, even then he could still capture all of his mannerisms, his witty banter with Scooby, and the cowardly awkwardness that makes Shaggy vulnerable, I consider him one of two of the film's best casting choices. Scooby was reprised by Frank Welker and is the only original cast member they got, he does just as good as he's always been but the nitpick I have with the cast applies here, Welker has been voicing Scooby since the early 2000's but he's also been Fred's voice ever since the franchise was first created, so I don't feel comfortable with the fact that they would even bother having him voice Scooby if they're not going to let him voice Fred as well. I honestly think they should've gotten a celebrity to do Scooby's voice to stay consistent with the rest of the cast, like Nick Nolte or Sam Elliott. The Blue Falcon (or Brian as he's sometimes referred to) was voiced by Mark Wahlberg, and for his first official debut in the realm of voice acting he really pulled it off, he makes BF sound very passionate and confident while at the same time acing his more vulnerable to a T, you can tell he knew to give in his all for his very first voiceover performance and I consider it the other best casting choice aside from Will Forte as Shaggy. Fred was played by Zac Efron and he definitely did a solid performance in the role. While technically this is a role you could give to anyone and would turn out the same no matter who you pick, Efron definitely sounds like Fred and did his best with what he's given to work with. Embracing a responsible leadership persona as well as a naive guy who's trying to come off as cool. Even if I still wish they let Frank Welker do the voice. Daphne was played by Amanda Seyfried, and this also happens to be her first time voice-acting as well. There's not really much to say about her performance other than the fact that she makes Daphne sound very kind-hearted and friendly, they didn't really give her much characterization beyond that but that doesn't mean I'm calling her the weakest character as she's still pretty similar to how she is in the cartoon. Velma was played by Gina Rodriguez, being nerdy, cynical, and sassy. Admittedly Velma happens to be my least favorite out of the main characters as she was always treating Shaggy and Scooby horribly whenever they tried to bail out of a dangerous situation and never had any regard for their safety. But in this movie she's thankfully been toned down a few notches and is made to sound more innocent. Rodriguez really pulled off those mentioned character traits and made Velma sound very likable. Dick Dastardly was played by Jason Isaacs, using a very intimidating old-geizer and at the same time sounding similar to Dastardly's original voice actor Paul Winchell. Dynomutt was played by Ken Jeong, I surprisingly had no idea it was him doing the voice until I saw his name in the credits, he totally had me fooled. I like how he played Dynomutt with this neurotic wit and made him sound genuinely annoyed by Blue Falcon's bumbling antics. Captain Caveman was played by Tracey Morgan, he was very funny and sounded like he was having fun in the role, but I never actually watched the cartoon so I don't necessarily have much of an opinion on his take or the way Captain Caveman was even written.I think overall I only have one issue with the film. My gripe with Frank Welker not voicing Fred is just a nitpick, but the issue I have is that I think the story should've been more of a big mystery that the gang was trying to solve as opposed to a crossover with a superhero since the Scooby-Doo franchise is all about mystery solving, but that doesn't ruin the film in any way and I'll just take what we're given.So there you have it, I highly advise you to check the movie out if you haven't already. It was funny, touching, nostalgic, and just very fun to watch. Now somebody please give these filmmakers a Scooby Snack."}, {"id": 91, "text": "It was very funny, had an awesome adventure to it, and had a lot of nostalgia too it.

I did thoroughly enjoy how it brought in the old Hannah Barbera characters, almost making it its own universe again and not necessarily a Scooby Doo movie. (Not to mention the intro bringing back some major feels from my childhood) My 2 year old loved it, and anything that can keep my hyperactive child still for any length of time is a winner in my book.

It featured a lot of cameos throughout the film and had a decent amount of comedy for adults. The characters didn't really sound like themselves (or what we're used to) but it didn't affect the movie that much. Wish they would have had Matthew Lillard though.If you're a die-hard Scooby Doo fan, you won't lose sleep missing out on this. Don't think it should get a 2 star rating though."}, {"id": 136, "text": "I was really hoping this would be good. It looked promising but ended up being bad. It's not horrible but it could of been so much more. I liked the villian of the film, but the other characters just didn't feel right.

Watch it with your kids if you want, but I don't recommend watching this under any other circumstances."}, {"id": 137, "text": "I liked the movie and the quality of it but I don't understand why they didn't used the normal shaggy voice?

The movie would have gotten an 8 if they didn't change up voices."}, {"id": 138, "text": "The animation is great nothing to say about that. The jokes are almost always funny with some minor exceptions, I really liked that a few of the jokes were very cartoony and in a way almost paying homage to the old scooby jokes that's been around since 1969. The problem comes in the story, there just isn't a mystery and the plot has kinda been used before in the live action movie. Basically Shaggy and Scooby are friends, they get chased by something, they fight which leads to scooby being captured. He get's to know he is super important to the evil mans plan. A big dog appears they fight it and wins. But this isn't really the problem, the problem is all the extra characters that takes up way too much screen time when they could have focused way more on scoobys and shaggys relationship and developed the story more but instead they give a lot of screen time to extra minor characters that aren't very interesting. But overall it has a good message, funny jokes, good animation but way to many characters for such a short story"}, {"id": 139, "text": "Braxton Martin 2 days ago72% Not every movie is amazing and not every movie is bad I've always been a fan I was Scooby-Doo whether it's just casual or I'm a big fan. Although I do think there were some creative decisions in this movie and some of the jokes were nice and it was great that they got the original voice actor back to voice Scooby-Doo I don't think it was the greatest Scooby-Doo movie ever but I do think it was good for starters it had stunning animation and I'm glad it featured some other Hanna Barbera characters but the voice cast at least most of them I don't think it did that great of a job. Zac Efron was okay ask Fred I just don't think the performance of Daphne and Velma was that grade the storyline wasn't the best for a Scooby-Doo movie but it was okay I like the fact that they re curated the theme song in the beginning of the movie and I think there were some other creative decisions but overall it's a good movie it's not the greatest though but I definitely could watch it again. Spoiler section So this whole movie the story is a mess Dick dastardly is the main villain and he had a dog when he was younger as a sidekick for his evil doings but when opening a portal to the underworld lost him and must get Scooby because he is the only dog who can open back up the portal due to him being the only living descendant oh they all mighty powerful dog who was the dog of the owner that created the portal to the underworld in the first place this really didn't seem like a Scooby-Doo episode or anything Scooby-Doo at all Scooby Doo is a mystery series and there wasn't much mystery to this plus it's just barely including the other characters except for Scooby Doo and shaggy and doesn't even feel like a Scooby-Doo episode it did help that they created the theme song in CGI but it still wasn't great Simon Cowell was in this movie and he played himself once again at the end Dick dastardly pulled up some clever sleeves and decided to wear a Simon Cowell mask so they would think it was Simon Cowell but then of course they knew that Simon Cowell is a famous celebrity and doesn't have enough time to pull a scheme like this so they pull the mask off and shocker it's Dick dastardly this movie didn't have much of a story it was very predictable but it didn't have some good things about it like every movie does although it did not exceed my expectations and did not meet them at all I'm lucky it wasn't a theater movie cuz I don't think I would have had the greatest time playing a bunch of money at the theater but then again it's a great milestone for it to be the first theatrical animated Scooby-Doo movie so maybe it did deserve to be in the theaters let me know what you guys think."}, {"id": 140, "text": "Firstly, the visuals in the movie are beautiful with clean animation and a vibrant colour palette.The pace of the film is fast and generally the story is all over the place.. They start off by making it out to be a story driven by the meeting and the development of the group, revisiting classic themes by basically remaking the old 'Scooby Doo Where are you?' Intro, however the backstory that a lot of us thought we were going to get didn't come about, as the plot of the movie strayed from ANY form of mystery, and suddenly became and action, superhero plot.A feature of the movie that I found to be really odd too, was the out dated cameos and references; a Simon Cowell cameo was funny when Shrek 2 did it in 2004, now it's pretty dead and lackluster ((Also a dead reference doesn't become more relevant the more times you bring it up.. Just like how my reaction to Simon Cowell didn't change within the 4/5 times he was brought up throughout the film)).Whilst trying to do something new with the Scooby Doo franchise, they've some how come to the conclusion that it would be an amazing idea to create their own strange cinematic universe.. It's JAMMED with Hanna Barbera franchises all mixed into the story.. Making me unsure why this film is actually presented as a Scooby Doo movie when characters from other franchises are in it just as much as Mystery Inc.*Also, who's idea was it to make Scooby Doo the literal key to the gates of Hell?All in all, I wouldn't say the movie is TERRIBLE, however what is pretty terrible is the mistreatment of Matthew Lillard in this situation :) I had pretty high expecting for this movie as a Scooby Doo fan, was pretty disappointed and felt let down by the choice of replacing Shaggy ((Sorry Will Forte, but Matthew Lillard does it a HELL of a lot better))."}, {"id": 141, "text": "I thought it was great!

I think the story was way too all over the place with robots, then a superhero, then the underworld and what not. It lost a lot of their iconic punch lines and were replaced with random Netflix and social media references. Not to mention they even left out the song that was one of my personal favourite part from the movies.I think im just gonna stick to watching the old movies and probably gonna give up on any new ones to come as I think the animation and the rest are gonna stay like the ones in this movie.

Gina Rodriguez, while also fine at emoting, didn't even make an attempt to do Velma's voice - unlike every single voice and live action Velma in the history of the franchise.Other complaints: Simon Cowell - really? What year is it, 2005? And why is 'Fred is a dumb jock who happens to drive the Mystery Machine' being resurrected? Mystery Incorporated and Be Cool, Scooby Doo had an intelligent, psychologically complex Fred, and Where Are You's Fred certainly wasn't a meathead.

It begins as Scooby and Shaggy joining a superhero squad, to Scooby LITERALLY opening the gates of hell and fighting Cerberus.But, even it not being a Scooby-Doo movie, it is damn entertaining!

About as interesting as you would think a bunch of 40-50 year old writers would make a kids focused movie. The cliche and severely outdated jokes (Gerard Depardieu?!? Yeah, some 8-12 years old kid is really going to know a b list French actor from the late 80s...hilarious) &amp; obvious nonstop homages (The Jesus scene from The Big Lebowski, the arena fight from Thor 3, and The Rabbit scene from Monty Pythons Quest for the Holy Grail) make this unbearable. There are some nice touches of the original show, but those are mostly all used in the first 15 minutes and then it's just eye rolling (Simon Cowell. Not an homage, an actual reference to American Idol era Cowell circa 2007) and downhill from there.Also, as a side note, I'm all about teaching kids about the concept of consent, but being heavy handed with it, not once but twice within 5 minutes between a boy and his pet dog just feels odd and creepy. If you watch this movie, expect this level of subtlety throughout (expect random social justice catchphrases that are very oddly and glibly used.

Waste of money."}, {"id": 156, "text": "Let me say this, it exceeded my extremely low expectations from the reviews but this is still a 4/10 review, so there are some flaws with Scoob but some positives that keep it from being lower so I'll get those out of the way first.The first 10 minutes or so were good, about how Shaggy met Scooby and formed Mystery Inc. and fight the ghost in the haunted house, we never got that in any Scooby-Doo series or movie before Scoob. The animation looks decent and stylized enough. Stylized CGI is always a treat especially in this day and age, like I saw with Trolls World Tour. The final battle/ending was kinda well executed with the Mystery Machine being shot into flames and Mystery Inc and Blue Falcon fighting that 3 headed monster and Shaggy leaving Scooby for a little bit before coming back. That cliche is starting to stay its welcome but I guess it's fine here.Now onto the negatives of the film. First of all, the voices seem very off for the Mystery Inc. You don't have Grey DeLisle as Daphne, who was honestly my favorite in What's New Scooby-Doo. Also you don't have Frank Weller as Fred, or Matthew Lilard as Shaggy? Instead we get Amanda Seyfried, Zac Efron, and John Forte. I don't mind these new voices but man did they miss out a ton.Second, the story is mangled up for Scooby-Doo movie standards. It's just a generic kids film story where the characters defeat a bad guy and the movie's over. I guess there's a little mystery in here, but not enough to feel like a real Scooby-Doo plot.Third, it's more of a Blue Falcon movie than a Scooby-Doo movie. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are barely in this movie after the first 15 minutes and until the last 30 minutes or so and even Shaggy and Scooby are shifted to the side after Blue Falcon and Dyno-Mutt are introduced. They try to start this Infinity War-styled universe within 90 minutes, which is not enough time for a universe that big to set up. You need at least 1 or 2 movies beforehand for it to work.And lastly, there's the cringy humor. With Blue Falcon dabbing like it's still 2016 and smartphones and #hashtags and selfies all over the place, this movie is going to be dated real quick. In fact I only laughed 3 times throughout this movie, meaning that it failed the 6-laugh test to qualify as a comedy. Also Simon Cowell is in this? I'm sorry but Simon Cowell is NOT a Scooby Doo character!All in all, it's OK. I suppose it's good for young kids, but honestly there's way too many better films to show your kids, hell even in 2020 we got the Sonic movie and Onward, which I recommend both over Scoob.

They were something I watched time to time as a kid, but this is just OK. It is worse than the normal cartoons because it just is. (It was never going to be very good). The story is OK. It widely used format in both cases with a friendship going through a little fight, with shaggy and scooby, and hiding in your fathers shadow with Caption Falcon. Neither of these were bad, it is a story that still evokes some emotion and using characters we know only helps it. The movie was mildly funny, it included too much humor revolving around Caption Falcon being an internet star (I feel like this type of humor is mostly stupid and misinterpretation of internet culture.) The movie made me laugh. The humor was dumb and pretty low level, but sometimes that is fine (humor is just meant to make you laugh and it did). A movie gains a little bit when certain actors star in it, in this movie that was Mark Whalburg and Zac Efron, both actors that star in other movies and have a character and personality behind the voice the other movie with them have created in my mind. I don't think that any of the characters were misinterpreted in this movie they still entertainingly played the roles of their characters and they successfully played it of for humor. (From my limited knowledge of the interactions of these characters. The plot overall was mostly dumb, but kept me mildly interesting to find out the lame lingering question. The villain was funny and funny henchmen. It is average mustached villain with a plan for riches, but also has a heart for his partner in crime. The animation was good nothing great. Scooby Doo in this movie is the decedent of Alexander the Great's dog, which is stupid but funny how ridiculous it is. The movie culminates when Shaggy decides to sacrifice him for Scooby, which is a sweet moment. (Though like most movies there is no real consequences not that there should have been). Of the 3 animated movies that have been released digitally this year. This was the weakest. Love able Characters masked over a generic story. Some dumb humor that was hit or miss. Every thing was OK. It is not worth the $20 to rent it, but there is also not much coming out to watch.

Every character they put in it was mishandled to the point of nonrecognition, the plot moves so fast and all over the place that it gets distracting and the payoff was not worth it. There are some good points in a few of the characters but they are misused or just flat out underused. The CGI is colorful and easy to watch but the story elements are terribly plotted and 80% of the jokes just fall flat.

These movies have been...decent but nothing special. I have pretty much learned to not really expect anything beyond basic plot lines and story structure. So, like I mentioned earlier, my expectations going into the new theatrical movie weren't beyond the base level. But I have to say: the movie's actually not too bad.Don't get me wrong. It won't ever live up to the likes of Zombie Island or even the first live action movie. It doesn't recreate the same vibe as the original series does, though the movie does make several nods to the overall franchise, and they're very fun to catch. This movie, while a decent approach at getting a new generation to love the Great Dane as much as we did, is not really for the fans of the classic Scooby-Doo. The mystery aspect is pretty much nonexistent and is replaced by a more action/adventure and sci-fi genre. The monsters are pretty much real and Blue Falcon and Dynomutt are actual superheroes that exist within this universe. They have powers beyond the ones they did in their original series. And overall, that really isn't a bad thing. This is a different Scooby universe, so the limitations of science fiction and the supernatural are nonexistent as well.This movie is equal parts hilarious, heartwarming, and action-packed. There are a lot of jokes in the movie that actually do land fairly well. The new voice cast actually do a good job with their respective roles as well. Would I have preferred the usual voice cast for the movie? Yes, but I understand the reasoning for the change.The relationship between Scooby-Doo and Shaggy is very interesting to watch. And when it gets to the end, you really for them in ways that you never really did before with the original incarnations. The emotional integrity of this film is actually top-notch considering that it is an animated film about a group of teenagers solving mysteries, in as many words.Overall, there are definitely aspects of this film that I enjoy. But as a fan of the classic Scooby-Doo shows, I can't help but feel (a bit) slighted somehow. I understand that, as time progresses and Scooby-Doo continues to live on, evolutions of the franchise are predestined. And that's fine. In fact, I encourage that. But there's still a part of me that longs for the vibe that the original series provided. But there is also a part of that realizes that that will most likely not happen. And this film just further cements those thoughts. But that's still perfectly fine. This is an enjoyable film, but it isn't completely nostalgic. It does what it sets out to do without completely alienating its original fanbase.

The white characters were all stupid or bad guys, and the latin characters seemed to be hard core liberal... which isn't bad but it seems like it is really aimed at saying kids like mine can ONLY be liberal if they wanted to be smart. I think it's not taking all people in mind when they made this movie. I have my own political views, but personally I like to let my kids have a choice. This seemed really brainwashy.

Just like some cops can mess up but that doesn't mean all will. This movie had a lot of things that seemed very brain washy at my kids, and it made them feel uncomfortable. They started asking why the CHP was a bad guy, then asked if grandpa could be (he's a chp). The basic story line was awesome. I just wish they didn't hide those adult messages in the movie. Parents should have the right to teach their kids."}, {"id": 186, "text": "More of an action packed superhero with various cartoon characters than the mystery solving Scooby-doo stories we all know and love.

I appreciate Hanna Barbera bringing in their old characters back. I appreciate trying to put a new spin on Scooby but this is not how you do it. You don't alienate the character's, you don't make the movie mostly about Dick Dastardly and yet somehow not explain him to the young viewers. Fred never builds a trap in this movie.

The only thing(s) that doesn't flow with me is some of the corny jokes, the voice acting wasn't the best. But they did there best! Also I wish the storyline would be more better invested and more about the Mystery Inc. the dialogue in this film is cheaply well done. Plus it seems like they cut a middle section of the film.

The crew was in the movie but not as important as always."}, {"id": 221, "text": "Quoting a lyric from Billy Joel, I've seen the lights go out on Broadway, but for me, the lights flickered on and off. This movie was great, but not grand. It's a wonderful MODERN take on America's crime solvers. (Notice how MODERN is in all Capitals. Hell and Crap are the only words to describe the language in this film, said by Brian and who else, Velma. I predected.) Now, the voices are decent, but can't hold the candle to the voices we grew up with. I had a little tough time getting used to the voice of Velma, but that does NOT mean Gina Rodriguez is bad. She's good, but i much prefer Mindy Cohn. The action is crazy and sometimes resembles the 1969 fashion, the humor is modern as hell. and the characters are fantastic. Overall, This movie like i said, is a great MODERN remake. To make a long story short, If you're a OLD SCHOOL Scoob fan like myself, stick with the James Gunn films alongside the direct to video animated movies. But if you wanna go Back to the Future; ba dum tsss, Scoob is definetly the movie for you.

Meant to be the grand launch of a 'Hanna Barbera Cinematic Universe' released to great fanfare, due to the pandemic it ended up being shunted to VOD, released in cinemas in some countries, in others not, before ending up on DVD, where it probably has found its actual home.This isn't old-school 'Scooby Doo'. The mystery element is sidelined, making way instead for super-heroes (because there hasn't been enough films about them recently...), A list voice actors taking over the roles from the folks who do the straight to DVD films, and a lot of pop culture gags that probably won't endear the film to future generations. Daddy, who's Kelly Clarkson? etc.It is however an awful lot of fun, I enjoyed it far more than I anticipated, and if you can embrace this new take, then you may well enjoy it too.I hope it does end up launching a shared universe series."}, {"id": 329, "text": "Missing the classic premise of what a Scooby doo cartoon/ movie is but I enjoyed the film nonetheless.

Our whole family loved it."}, {"id": 331, "text": "When this was announced I was very disappointed that Warner Bros were going to try and recreate the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Hanna-Barbera characters. This film changed that opinion. Spoiler Alert: Scoob is closer to Wacky Races than Scooby-Doo. In a way, this film takes place as a sequel as well as a stand alone film. The animation is really well done and the mashup of Hanna-Barbera characters was worked in to the film well. Scooby-Doo fans will likely be disappointed as this is not a Scooby-Doo film, despite the title, this is a Hanna-Barbera character based film. In a way, it was like a nostalgic Easter Egg hunt. There are many hidden references to a variety of Hanna-Barbera shows. There are obvious ones, but then there are lesser known ones scattered throughout the film.It was disappointing that Matthew Lillard wasn't in the film, it is hard to watch the baton get passed yet again. The all star cast did a fair job when compared to their predecessors, Casey Kasem will always be the best Shaggy, followed by Matthew Lillard. Amanda Seyfried did an excellent job with the role of Daphne, in a way, that was the best part of the film- other than Simon Cowell. The message of the film is also well presented, though it seemed forced at times, especially towards the end. The ending is another complaint I have with the dance party montage- it was entertaining during the first few family animated movies released with it, but now it is starting to get old. But that shouldn't bring down the rest of the film. When watching this movie, it is important to seperate this from other Scooby Doo works. This is not a Scooby Doo film, while it is not as good as the classic series (Scooby-Doo Where Are You, Whats New Scooby Doo, etc.) or the direct-to-video films, Scoob is definently worth a watch. It is better than one might think at first glance. It is also enjoyable and appropriate for all ages- that being stated, it's not worth the $24.99 digital price- as it was initially released at, its worth renting or getting on sale."}, {"id": 332, "text": "Don't go in with expectations. Just sit back and enjoy it. Like when you were a kid. It's that simple."}, {"id": 333, "text": "Scoob shows the origin story of the mystery incorporated gang we all know and love and how they met, Evil villain Dick Dastardly ( Jason Isaacs) plans to unleash the demon dog Cerberus into the world, where the gang find out Scooby has a surprise heritage that makes him very important, I had a lot of fun with Scoob and felt like it was an entertaining ride from start to finish, but definitely with it's flaws, so let's get talking about it.First of all I loved the humour, animation, nostalgia and added background into Shaggy and Scooby. The movies animation was fantastic, it looked incredibly realistic and visually stunning with the character designs of all the characters excellent. The movie was also very funny. The familiar humour from all the characters was there and it completely worked, with similar catchprases and the comedic chemistry between Shaggy ( Will Forte) and Scooby (Frank Welker) working throughout the movie. The movies nostalgia was great, especially in the beginning it really bought me back to my childhood, with the catchphrases fun monster catching different things that I remembered when watching growing up, and even when the newer plot and story world came in (which we will talk about later) they still managed to balance the nostalgia well. And finally I also liked the added background into Shaggy and Scooby, I really liked that they added how Shaggy and scooby met, it was charming and made you understand the characters a lot more which we never got to in the past tv shows, so this did a good job at giving more depth to the characters we all know and love, how they met Fred (Zac Efron) Daphne (Amanda Seyfried) and Velma (Gina Rodriguez) also was well handled and made the friendship between the whole gang feel more real and deep instead of just meeting as adults.My few negatives for the film that bought it down a fair few grades for me was the rushed pacing, underused characters, uneven tone and dialogue, and the irritating characters creating predictable conflict. The movie to me felt much too rushed in places, this just impacted the more heart-warming scenes and the amount of time that was given to the background to the characters. I also thought there was some underused characters, a lot of the movie sadly just felt like the Shaggy and Scooby movie, there just wasn't enough of the whole gang together, Fred, Daphne and Velma sadly often felt like afterthoughts or in the background which was a shame as the movie worked the best when the whole gang was together as a collective group. I also found the dialogue and tone very uneven, I often found the movie was trying to hard to relate to a modern audience, trying to incorporate Netflix and normal day to day things into Scooby doo for me didn't work and created a tonal imbalance in places. Finally I found some character very irritating and they caused very predictable conflict. The character of Blue Falcon (Mark Wahlberg) was just bad an annoying, he solved no real purpose for the movie only to set up annoyingly predictable conflict where it was obvious what the right decision was but everyone followed him and let the villain get away with his plan, it was just sadly poorly executed in places and Blue Falcon was a bad character.My next few positives would be the charming and heartwarming tone, the likeable characters and balancing of the nostalgic and new tone/story world. The movie had such a charming tone between the characters and such lovely charm and chemistry with each other and some really sweet moments with each other, the recurring theme of the importance of friendship especially between scooby and Shaggy was done in such a heartwarming and touching way and it was handled very well. All the characters were also just as likeable as they have always been which was excellent, they all had their personalities we have grown to love and they were expanded on here to make their characters being even more likeable, I also thought that they managed to balance the nostalgic plot and character elements with the movies new story world and tone that worked really well, for me all the new plot etc added was great and really bought the material up to date in order to make it connect with a more modern audience.My final few positives would be the fun villain with clear motivations and great final act. I thought the villain of Dick Dastardly was a lot of fun, he had the campy fun personality expected with villains from scooby doo and he was always entertaining to watch, they also did a good job at giving him clear motivations, he actually had multiple reasons for his actions against the gang and what he was doing that in a way made you understand his character. The final act was also a lot of fun, they built up to the climax so well and it was worth it, all the things that made the movie so great with its characters and tone was all thrown into the final act and they didn't hold back which I loved and I was left very satisfied with the ending and where the movie could go in future instalments.Overall, despite the movie trying to hard to be something it's not in places and having a few dialogue and character issues. Scoob is a constantly entertaining ride from start to finish, blending the nostalgic elements of the old tv show with a new story world and plot to gain new fans."}, {"id": 334, "text": "Scoob! is a co-production from the United States and Canada from 2020, so these slightly over 1.5 hours are a pretty recent release. The director is Tony Cervone, a pretty experienced filmmaker, who has also delivered in other fields that are/were part of film production, mostly the animation department, but this should not surprise anybody because this movie here is of course an animated movie from beginning to end. What it is too, is a Warner Bros and Hanna Barbera production. Very appropriate that Cervone has worked on many Tom and Jerry projects, but this one here focuses of course on Scooby Doo and the gang as you can already see from the title. The photo I really find a bit misleading because not even the first ten minutes are about Scooby as a child, so the shadow character is far more dominant. Also if you take a look at the credits here, you will find many, many names of writers. This surprised me a bit, but then again not too much because it is sometimes the case for films based on characters that have existed for a long, long time. The Marvel movies are the best examples. One who is not part of the list is Joe Ruby and he died a few days ago, but his contribution to the Scooby Doo franchise will always be on our minds. And for many also in their hearts. Now it must be said that these over 90 minutes here were created in a way that has a bit to do with the old show, but not that much really. I liked the old show, didn't love it. Of course, each of the three supporting characters from the gang get their moments too. Velma can contribute something technical when she uses the other dog to inform the characters about being kidnapped. Fred is the hunk who admittedly has not too much material here other than jumping Cerberus towards the end on his own to show us how courageous he is. And Daphne, well, she has the least material. All we find out about her really is that she is good with people and could work as an influencer. I must admit I was crushing on her back when I watched the show in my younger years and it has not changed until today. The voice actors who portray these three are also kinda fitting character-wise I suppose. And their inclusions also show us that this is/was a pretty big project. Scooby and Shaggy are still very likable after all these years. That much is safe. I must say I was a bit confused though by Scooby calling Shaggy Raggy all the time, but it was okay with the explanation. I already mentioned that the first seven minutes or so take place ten years earlier. We see how Scooby and Shaggy meet each other for the first time and how the human helps out the dog that is being chased by police. And we find out that Shaggy was a bit of a loner apparently. I think it was a nice introduction, also what followed immediately afterwards when the gang solve their first mystery. Now that was for once typical in terms of the story with what they did back then for the old show. A human antagonist disguises himself as a monster or ghost this time to chase the kids away from a collection of electronic devices that he stole and hid inside a creepy house. But the kids deliver and the bad guy is caught. So much for the introduction.A little later, we are in the now and the action movies forward. Simon Cowell (voicing himself) gets a most random, but still somewhat entertaining inclusion here that was still kinda funny. It may not have served to create the key conflict, a story about friendship, but it was alright nonetheless. I thought this film was always the best when it did not take itself too seriously, so the idea about the ailing friendship between Scooby and Shaggy before realizing they are made for each other again was not among the film's highlights, but something else was: The comedy. I smiled and laughed quite a bit here, which is also why I would never say this movie is weak, let alone a failure. The Harry Potter reference early on is fun and let's be honest RBG is perfect for Velma. I still did not like her German voice. Way too deep. Luckily, she did not exactly have too many lines. There are more inclusions about Facebook (Facedog) or Netflix too that were kinda funny. But not only the dialogue writing is pretty good and entertaining for the most part, I also liked the slapstick comedy really, which was among the biggest strengths of the old show and is good here as well. I could mention a dozen examples, but let me just mention one, namely at the very end when apparently our two heroes are forced to split up and have these areas for their hand/paw to launch the application we see them go back and forth and at one point the speed gets so high that one character accidentally slaps the other for two or three seconds. But not in a hateful way, just in a playful accident kind of way. I am sure not too many recognized this scene/moment, but for me it was pretty memorable and funny. As for the main antagonist, he was alright I suppose. Not too great, but tolerable. His transformation into Fred was especially interesting because the indicators that it was not the real Fred were pretty amazing for younger audience members to see and figure out it is the bad guy, especially after they knew he had that ability with the hot police woman scene from earlier. By the way, one thing I forgot to mention when I talked about the voice actors is that Scooby is once again voiced by Frank Welker. For everybody else, they got new people, but he is kind of an institution like J.K. Simmons for Jonah Jameson and made the character his own. Speaking of the dog character, it surprised me a bit how there were so many dogs in this movie. Definitely no coincidence. Besides Scooby, we have the one who is part of the hero team, we have the bad guy's companion (certainly reminding me of another somewhat iconic film dog with his laugh), maybe the only one who can warm his heart and finally we even have the Cerberus that may count for one or even three dogs. Up to you to decide. Normally, you did not really see other dogs than Scooby on the show, but then again the episodes were only 20 minutes or so. And as I said in the title here, comparisons are not the greatest choice anyway. There are parallels here and there, especially when they take care of the stolen goods hoarder early on or also when Scooby and Shaggy dress up as employees of a restaurant when they are chased by these metallic creatures at the bowling alley. The duo dressed up a lot on the original show. But there are also major differences, actually too many to name. But as these differences are nonetheless a success from the creative perspective, I am not mad about/at them one bit. On the contrary: Had they just copied style and story of the old shows, maybe the movie would have gotten a better reception, but I would have liked it less I'm sure. I am perfectly fine with the bold new approach here in the second half. Also these little metallic creatures at the bowling alley scene felt like taken from a nightmare sequence and I honestly thought this would be one. Scooby and Shaggy are pretty good in ditching these robots and also the bad guy's laser shots later on. Anyway, what I also wanted to say is that these robot creatures reminded me a bit of the Minions from Despicable Me here and there. Well, in the widest sense really, but they do not seem downright evil. Okay, finally a few more snippets: The neckband inclusion was decent, one of the better aspects from the rather forgettable drama plot about friendship. The final inclusion of Cowell again. It's him. Oh no, it's not him. This was funny too. Scooby seemed to be a lot more courageous than he was on the show. Shaggy was more his former self. Scooby is blood-related to the beloved dog of Alexander the Great? Hear, hear. The Scooby snacks could have been included more here, not just briefly early on when it is about the name and late when we see Daphne has two hidden, even if both inclusions made me laugh. Okay, I think that would be all then. Pretty sad that I was the only one in my viewing. The movie is good and deserves better, even if it is not great either. Of course, the animation is fairly decent too, which needs to be added and should not be taken for granted, even if it is the case with all big studio animated films these days. So in short, I give this film a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out. Go watch. This will most likely not have a chance to get an Oscar nomination in the animated feature category and probably also not be featured too prominently with the upcoming Annie Awards, but I feel that for me personally it could make the top5 animated movies of 2020 and I would watch a sequel if they make one. The ending certainly implies the possibility that it could happen if it is enough of a hit commercially. After the mission is before the mission. Positively recommended."}, {"id": 335, "text": "Solid beginning but then really downhill from there.

I could have gotten down with the idea of weaving in captain caveman and wacky races, but in the end it just completely lost track of what Scooby Doo is all about. There was no mystery to solve, which for me made the catch phrase I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling kids at the end, irrelevant. It had potential, but they blew this.

It is undeniable that the animation of the incredible feature, however, that is not enough to save the film, which is predictable, self-explanatory, superficial, moreover, things are very easy to solve and there are several narrative facilitations and the main defect of the film is that it just doesn't look like a Scooby Doo film, because it has no mystery and the main thing in the series (at least for me) was to try find out who the villain was under the monster or creature fantasy. But the film is not all bad, besides the animation being great the film has good jokes, it is fun to a certain extent and I recognize that for children from four to eleven years old, who are the target audience of the film, it works a lot well, but for a slightly older audience, it doesn't work much anymore."}, {"id": 373, "text": "2D animation doesn't translate well to 3D except this everything is the same as original Scooby-Doo TV series plus adding that now they are in 2020.

In terms of entertainment, I'd put it on the same level as the first live action Scooby Doo movie (which has proven equally divisive). The fact is that it's a simpe cash grab, and it goes for easy fan serviice rather than clever plot.

It had a nice away of introducing the characters to us and each other. I really like how Scooby and Shaggy both start there friendship over food because that's their character and its great that this is shown. Also, during the trick or treating part, i like how the gang came to solving mysteries as it literally shows how each of them would react in the TV shows. The last part of the 13 minutes was in my opinion the best scene in the movie as it showed an almost perfect recreation of the Scooby Doo intro from 1969 and that truly hit me with nostalgia. But then, it went down hill from there. Firstly, there was no need for Simon Cowell there because it made the fallout between the gang a joke and i know it a children's movie but that scene is what lead to the moral of the story, friendship because in the end friendship saved the day. So basically, i think Simon kinda ruined the moment. Secondly, whats the deal with Velma's voice, she does not sound like what is expected of her and what is typically heard throughout the TV shows and previous made movies. The last point of many i could make is one of the main point, WHERE IS THE MYSTERY?! Usually i would expect a clue leading to a villain but no, the villain was exposed from his first appearance (just after 20 minutes into the movie). I mean they could have put some effort in to make it a mystery and have the Mystery Inc do some proper mystery solving to figure out who the culprit is. For a second, when i saw Simon being unmasked as the guy behind the mask, i thought maybe, just maybe it has a good ending and a relevance of Simon it it but of course it wasn't. Overall , this movie definitely requires improvement to the characters, to the story line and 100% to Velma's voice."}, {"id": 445, "text": "Watched this with my 8 year old nephew who is as big of a Scooby-Doo fan as I am. We've seen anything and everything Scooby-Doo so when we saw the trailer for Scoob! we were incredibly excited. The first 10-15 minutes of the film are very good, excellent set up and showing how the gang met and solved their first mystery, que the theme song sequence and a recreation of an opener we've all seen before but still love. And then it went downhill from there.The addition of Blue Falcon and Dynomutt was overpowering Scooby-Doo and Shaggy. Not to mention the Blue Falcon is not the one we know and love, while Dynomutt has none of his goofy playful humor. Throw in another Hanna-Barbera creation with Dick Dasterdly and Muttley to play the villains with a bunch of tiny evil robots reminiscent of Minion's and a cameo of Captain Caveman sounding... Well nothing like Captain Caveman. This movie broke my nephew's heart by just being another bubblegum pop culture kids movie.I can't blame the kid, he's a smart cookie and wanted to solve a mystery. We have a game of trying to figure out who the bad guy is in all the Scooby-Doo shows we watch. But this had no villian to unmask, no mystery to solve, just a bad guy with a seemingly unprovoked need to open the gates to hell to steal some gold, now if it had been to actually get Muttley back... That would have made more sense, but he was just doing it for the gold. Besides the lack of mystery, my nephew's biggest complaint is that Fred, Daphne and Velma were separated from Shaggy and Scooby for 90% of the film!!! Instead Scooby was off playing a superhero and Shaggy was skulking around while the rest of the gang had really no idea what was happening. Plus there was a solid two minutes of characters yelling 'DICK!!' that just felt entirely inappropriate even though it is the villians name, it just felt they over did it to get the adult movie goers laughing.My nephew did enjoy the graphics though and the music, he thought Blue Falcon dabbing was funny and I did find the Netflix and IKEA references pretty cute.

The movie itself wasn't super bad but it definitely wasn't very good either. The jokes are hit and miss, like there's a running gag with Fred loving his van but it doesn't really go anywhere. There's a really funny scene that falls to the wayside at the end with Fred morning his van's death and decides to attack the monster and gets flung to the side. The product names and attempt to bring the film into a real setting is obvious and takes away from the story at points. Fred Daphne and Velma are wasted potential in this movie as Velma is just the super geek, Daphne is the kind but girly girl of the group and Fred is just an idiot... I hate how every depiction of this character is treated like he's super dumb. In Mystery Incorporated Fred is clueless but his character has a story arc and writing that shows there's more to his character other than being dumb. The actors that were chosen for this film were good but again wasted. A lot of this film was wasted for cheap jokes and bad attempts of character moments. The blue falcon is shown to be very incompetent at his abilities and is at odds with his Sidekicks due to him not being the same hero his father is. Bryan (his name) is quickly shown to earn his sidekick's respect and trust at the end of the movie to quickly wrap up that plot to move on without too much care. Dick Dastardly has a really good moment when he's shown to trying to get his treasure and his dog Muttley back from literal Hell. There are a few good moments of his character grieving that get underwhelmed by jokes or need to move the plot. There are some good moments which is why I didn't rate it under 5 stars, some of the jokes are funny and some of the writing is done pretty good at key moments. There's a cool montage of the characters growing up and going through their old adventures with the original but newly covered scooby doo theme and it was nice touch to see. It was also cool to see Captain caveman make an appearance being expertly played by Tracy Morgan... though he's shelved not too long after he's introduced. I think this movie could've been so much better if the writing of the characters and story points were given more time to be worked on.

It's a shame the cartoon is a classic; the made for TV will only be fit for the trash can. Save your money, avoid this movie.

I watched some epispodes, but I never really gravitated to that show and characters. But even with watching so little episodes, you can tell it is very different from the cartoon. It doesn't feel like Scooby Doo. There aren't any mysteries of haunted houses. This is a superhero movie wth Scooby Doo characters.The villian is actually pretty good. He has a clear motivation and you understand what's he doing and why he's doing it. He can also be funny which is perfect for a kids movie like this.The voice actors did a good job. The stand-outs for me are Mark Whalberg, Jason Isaacs and Frank Welker.The movie is really funny and a lot of the jokes land well. Especially with the character of Fred. Whenever he's on screen he gives that funny vibe and you can't help it but to laugh whenever he tells a joke.The biggest problem for me is that this is just a generic kids movie. It follows the same formula as all kids movies. Set-up a relationship with two characters, seperate them and make them reconcile, earn the power of friendship and save the day. On top of that, add a bunch of pop songs. The movie is afraid to take risks and shake things up. Because that, it doesn't add anything new to the genre, it doesn't add anything new to the Scooby Doo characters and it's just forgetable. If i'm in a mood for Scooby Doo, I won't watch this. I will watch the original cartoon. If I'm in a mood for a 21st century kids movie, I won't watch this. I will just go watch the Lego Movie. My point is that this movie doesn't stand out in any way.I conslusion, I don't think that a generic kids movie is worth 20 dollars.4/10 you can skip it, you're not missing much."}, {"id": 525, "text": "Gone is the 60s attire and tone and music that has been a staple of Scooby forever, replaced with awful 2020 setting and music...and no, I'm no boomer.

For some reason they felt the need to make Velma into a Spanish girl who switches into speaking Spanish like Dora the explorer. Why not just add a new character to the team instead? It's not like they haven't recruited other people temporarily before. It's just seems like unnecessary pandering. I also don't understand the Simon Cowell thing...weird. The other thing that really bothered me is that Scooby talks a LOT...like abnormally so, and in full sentences too. That is not something I remember seeing in anything previously and my kid watches a lot of Scooby. I don't care for the 2020 plot setting either...they use cellphones and hashtags and stuff. It just feels so not Scooby. Whole I'm at it, Fred looks weird and they made him into essentially Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin level of stupid.

Metal minions.... for me, this is an indicator of the lack of ideas in the writers of the cartoon.For fans of cool graphics it is a disappointment. 2020, but the film doesn't exactly reach the level.The main characters infuriated me more than forcing me to empathize. Especially Fred - a dumb-headed beauty.Jokes? I smiled only once. The complete primitive.Attitudes of children...

However, this only lasts 15 minutes, and from there the movie stops being a Scooby Doo movie and starts being a superhero movie, with Dick Dastardly as the supervillain, and Blue Falcon and his gang as superheroes, with the Scooby gang stuck there in a movie that is not their own.Because let's face it, just like in a James Bond movie we have certain expectations, in a Scoob movie we also have expectations, and they are not met. That distinctive type of adventures where they explore a haunted location and, after many scares, end up discovering that it was all a not supernatural trick by some criminal, is not here, except for a brief nod at the beginning. Instead, we get a generic modern children's movie, with characters running around from chase to chase, battle to battle and explosion to explosion without a compelling plot, while making pop culture references. The plot involves saving the world from a large-scale supernatural threat (really supernatural, none of the subversion characteristic of the source material).So, if we forget about wanting a Scooby Doo movie and focus on the movie we get, it's not very good either. You can see where they try to have jokes for the adult watchers, but they lack the wit and talent to make them funny. They occasionally remember that this is supposed to be a Scooby Doo movie, and they have traditional gags like having Scooby and Shaggy, in the middle of being chased by the critters, turn around and serve the critters as waiters, disconcerting them for a while, but it's too little and done without much talent. You also get a scene where two male characters fight and a female character says it's toxic masculinity, which is kind of a hateful message to send to children.In short, if you want a Scooby movie, this is not it, and if you want a generic modern kid's movie, this is not a good one."}, {"id": 528, "text": "This will probably be the entry in the Scooby-Doo franchise that is going to equally divide its audience, with each side giving its own valid reasons. Some viewers are going to appreciate the modernization of the story, while others will wish it had stayed in the late 1960s. Some are going to get a kick out of the pop culture references, while others will ask themselves why they are in a Scooby-Doo movie. Some will appreciate the superhero theme, while others will forget that Blue Falcon and Dynomutt have existed in the past. Some will recoil at the childish crude humor, while others may giggle at it. Some longtime Hanna-Barbara fanatics are going to love the tie-in with other characters, while others are going to call it a forced attempt to kick-start a shared universe. It'll be very interesting to see how the overall consensus falls, and it'll also be up to the individual to form its own opinion. At the end of the day, it's a kids' film. That's the best anyone can say about it. It does what it can to introduce this franchise to a younger generation through those quirks and contemporary computer animation, while at the same time, it does have enough weight in the story and aims closer to the source material than more recent attempts, even when it doesn't always digest easy. It'll be up to you to decide where this lands. Obviously, it's more focused at entertaining today's kids than being a great entry in the Scooby-Doo canon. However, if it connects with the long-time meddling kids that grew up with the characters for over half a century, then it has definitely earned its extra Scooby Snack points."}, {"id": 529, "text": "Entertaining, and well animated, but lacking anything original or memorable, Scoob! unfortunately falls victim to the market, rather than succeeding in anyway as a film, as it tries too hard to please audiences in the most embarrassing way imaginable.The film tries very hard to seem important, memorable, and funny, but lacks any of the three qualities- as its nature is awfully self aware but without any of the fun of being so. The jokes in the film don't land, almost every time, and many of them are odd references to modern day things, which feel so out of place in the film. I love the look of the film, although the human characters besides the main cast can seema bit blocky at times, the animation is clever and on point, and I always found it to be an interesting journey to look at.However, the film feels incredibly lazy, and seems to do nothing more than the pure basics on getting its story out and told. It feels like a cash grab rather than a true film, which is sad, coming from a long time Scooby Doo fan. I went in desperately wanting to ignore the opinions that I had heard, and enjoy the film for what it is, but sadly there isn't much to offer. As for the voice acting in the film, it isn't anything special. Voice actors too seem out of place, and seem to fit no purpose other than having a famous talent behind the screen, but sadly their interpretations of the characters don't seem to match the characters they are playing.I will give a shout out to voice actor veteran Frank Welker who gave a good performance as Scooby Doo as always, and Jason Isaacs, as the surprisingly enjoyable villain, Dick Dastardly.In the end, Scoob! Is far from a boring film, its soldily entertaining, but ultimately forgettable. It is riddled with cliches, its formulaic, often out of place, and at times can honestly be quite cheesy.

Disgusting, unbelievably formulaic, I understand that they would have to remove some of the 'classic' scooby doo storylines/tropes/etc, but they completely changed everything about these characters. I have grown up with Scooby doo, and this is the worst media to ever come out of the franchise. The animation wasn't even great, character design was so inconsistent, no cohesive moral to the film. I'm honestly not even going to go into more detail on this. It doesn't deserve my attention. I'm really sad.

You already have people that do all the voices that people love and they work for much less.Story was weak. Not your typical adventure. Not really an origin story, or a good one. Too many cheap low hanging jokes instead of story.Seemed like the goal to making an amazing animated Scooby feature film, but then the studio got their claws in it and miscast using celeb's, gave us on the story, and just cranked it out.Warner's cash grab for a Trolls clone in Scooby disguise?This falls at the bottom of worst Scooby projects.

I think the animation is best on the Mystery Machine because it makes the Mystery Machine look beautiful. The feel of the movie is very upbeat and fun. The beginning of Scoob! stayed true to the original premise but the ending did not stay as true to the original because they fight the real supernatural not a human pretending to be a monster. The Casting of this movie is excellent, Jason Issacs did a great Dick Dastardly, and Ken Jeong is amazing as Dynomutt and his dialogue is amazing. It was fun seeing him do a serious character for a change. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is at the beginning on Halloween when they solve their first mystery after meeting each other and my second favorite scene in the movie is at the end when they fight Cerberus. The theme of this movie is Friendship, an important thing right now because it is something everyone needs to get through these trying times. Throughout the movie, we see other characters from the Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe like Dick Dastardly and Muttley, Captain Caveman, and during the end credits, we see Atom Ant, The Great Grape Ape, Jabberjaw, Dr. Frankenstein, and Dr. Benton Quest who we see is currently developing R.O.S.I.E.

I loved that they brought back an old villain and kept his comedic value. Not only that but there is plenty of adult humour which was funny to watch.the only problem which has been raised by many is the voice acting, yes it does lack a bit by not having the original voices which everybody is familiar with.

It's a blink and you miss it moment, but it's right there. All of the awesome of the movie is just bonus after that moment. Turns out the other theme is empathy. Velma points this out at the end and I was ready to bawl.This movie is filled with shout-outs to classic Hanna Barbera cartoons.

While the CGI looks good and there is a decent heart at the center of the story, there are a lot of misfires. The characters seem off, the voice actors miscast, and the constant pop culture references feel really out of place.Also, where is the mystery?! Scooby Doo is about solving mysteries, not some pseudo superhero adventure that splits the gang up for most of the movie. I don't have a problem with Blue Falcon being in this film. The problem is that the Scooby gang felt sidelined so that WB could set up some Hanna-Barbera cinematic universe. This seems to be common theme at WB (see DC).

I'm a fan of the original 1969 animation, plot- and style-wise, and I absolutely hated what happened to the series later on (changed the drawing style and introducing new directions such as romantic relationships). I loved the dark, gloomy and mysterious atmosphere of the original series, which was sadly discontinued - I'm guessing - to make it more kids-friendly. It did make it feel more mainstream. What I liked about this particular movie is that they kept characters recognisable. Of course, a lot of elements were modernised, but the outfits were kept almost intact (even Fred's ascot made a glorious appearance!) and the Mystery Machine looked exactly like it did in 1969. Some character features were softened to make them more appealing. I had a good laugh seeing Velma dressed as Judge Judy for Halloween, and generally I felt like modern pop-culture references were not misplaced. I did not like bringing superheroes into the picture in attempt to please everyone, though it wasn't the first time it happened, and I did like Dynomutt a lot. The plot, sadly, lacked any mystery and felt like your average superhero movie (which is fine, but keep 'em separate!). Much more classy and cool twist would have been using that Mr. Rigby character from the beginning as a villain who decided to take revenge on the Mystery Inc. for putting him in jail when they were kids.

With cel animation and live action already having been done before, this time around the option was to go all in with CGI. This presented some advantages in terms of better special effects and presentation, and I highly appreciate the choice to stick very closely with the original character designs. Story-wise, it could have been better. It felt a little rushed and convoluted. It wasn't really clear what Dick Dastardly's motivation was, nor why Blue Falcon and Dyno-Mutt had to get involved....other than to give a little fan service to fans of Hanna-Barbara. In fact, it's not entirely clear who the target audience is for this film. It seems a little confused between whether it was aimed at today's kids or today's adults who grew up in the age of Hanna-Barbara cartoons of the 70s and 80s. Young kids today won't know recognize Blue Falcon, Dyno-Mutt, Dick Dastardly, Muttley, or Captain Caveman because they haven't been used in years. They certainly won't understand the memes and meta jokes or get the references to Netflix, Tinder, or American Idol...which seem like they were added in to make sure that the adults are watching, but seem awkward and out of place in a Scooby-Doo cartoon.On the other hand the story takes a huge departure from the classic premise of Scooby-doo stories. It feels a more elaborate take on some of the direct to DVD cartoon films produced over the years but, again, far too complicated than it needs to be. In fact, I think it's strongest points were it's colorful animation, flashy visuals, and celebrity voice acting. Take those away, and there's really not much left.In conclusion, Scoob! is definitely an interesting take on this classic cartoon and had it not been for the covid-19 pandemic, who really knows how well it would have done in theatres around the world. The choice to go straight to digital platforms was a no-brainer, because had that not happened, it probably would have collected dust in the Warner Bros archive. Give this a watch, especially if you're a long-time fan of the series and looking for some nostalgia (keep an eye out for quick references to other classic cartoons in the background), if you're watching with young kids, you made find yourself trying to explain the plot along the way.

The Mystery Inc gang split up when Fred,Velma and Daphne get assigned for some task and leaves Shaggy and Scooby alone. They are recruited by Blue Falcon and team to stop Dick Dastardly from unleashing a ghost dog and is in search of Scooby. That's the entire plot though.

You get to relive some of the Scooby Doo things from the 2D animation done in 3D and, it's not bad. There were certain scenes from the movie which really takes us back to the original style. There were some giggles here and there. The villain was quite okay Scoob! suffers the same problem as the recent animation movies and there wasn't really much anything memorable in this. We don't get to see half of the gang much before the third act. Many of their jokes failed,but,might get a laugh from kids. They put a lot of references from WB characters and you'll understand within 10 minutes into the movie. Like Sonic,this also has some huge product placements. Also,there wasn't any mystery here,it was all straight forwarded. Personally, I'll forget about this movie eventually.

There are tons and tons of Scooby doo movies that I grew up and still enjoy that are light hearted and me and my family watch, I don't understand stand how you could mess up a movie where the plot is basically laid out. Why is Velma a Latino who thinks the metric system is superior? Why is that the only thing I could remember about the characters in this movie who don't act like themselves? Why did they split up the gang for the entire movie? Why are there pop culture references and dance party's? If you are a legitimate scooby doo fan, you won't like this. As a movie as a whole I didn't like it either. I've never actually been in a movie before where I wanted to turn it off and leave but my dad paid $30 for it. As a stand alone movie I might have just said that it was meh. But as a Scooby doo movie, no. In final, it felt like they wrote a script in a day, than had some boxes the check off to make it modern or whatever, and the as the last step, renamed the characters to the Scooby doo gang. Instead of this watch the phantasaur, camp scare, zombie island (A bit more scarier ;), return to zombie island (that one was hilarious), mystery incorporated, the OG originals, Scooby doo meets Kiss band and basically anything else.

You know I'm gonna have to be honest here though and say, I really wanted to love this more. The first 15 minutes of this movie were actually perfect, if the rest of the movie had been exactly like that, this could've been a 10/10 for me. It was hitting the right nostalgic beats with the origin of the Mystery Inc gang, their very first mystery, and a verbatim recreation of the original show's intro. I was getting so amped for this movie after that intro, and then, that was it. It never really bounced back from that strong opening and stumbled into generic family movie territory. The script makes a huge mistake in SPLITTING THE GANG UP, WHY??? For 3/4th's of the movie Scooby and Shaggy are not with the rest of Mystery Inc, and it became clear to me that the filmmakers were more interested in using this film as a spring board for a future cinematic universe. They try to include as many outside Hanna Barbara characters as possible without much rhyme or reason besides their significance to the story structure. We do get to see characters like the Blue Falcon, Dick Daststardly, Mutley, and even Captain Caveman, but this isn't what I really wanted to see, I wanted to see a SCOOBY DOO MOVIE. This movie needed more of that team dynamic and mystery solving and it just didn't have very much of it. This movie had so much potential as it looks REALLY GOOD, and I loved how it tries to be faithful to the aesthetics of the original cartoons with the designs and the sounds. It just needed more of what made the original show so great, and it really missed the mark for me. I'm not gonna say those live action movies were great by any means, but as those were written by James Gunn, you could tell he understood what Scooby Doo was all about, and I think those definitely do a better job than this did for me at least. Scoob! is a cute and safe movie, but it could've been so much more, if you're a huge fan of the character, absolutely watch it! I would just lower your expectations as this is aiming for much younger audiences and that's really all it wants to be.

Despite being a dedicated lover of all things to watch, the latter half of my life has had relatively very little cartoons and animated movies in it, specifically the PG kind, maybe it's the fact that my favorite genre is horror... However, I was counting days till Scoob! to see where has it come, is the magic and nostalgia there, and also the voice cast is pretty great. And, you know, Zoinks!I was the most skeptical during the first couple minutes, but once the whiffs of sweet smell of nostalgia got stronger, or, in other words, once confirming the presence of the familiar spirit of Scooby Doo in his early days, I knew it's going to be a decent ride. Having said that, Scoob! is a shaky balance of that spirit, and everything modern, including the plot, comedy, action, so forth. The intro gives us the team as kids and tells the story of how they all got together before cutting to present day, from where the overall plot goes pretty clich\u00e9, but it is, after all, a movie for all ages, most importantly the kids. A copy-and-paste-for-every-next-movie supervillain with its own kind of minions, no one's seen that a hundred times before... The plot and the action, while definitely solid on their own terms, is neither what really delivered nor what I came for - the real attraction were the characters, comedy and some healthy sentimentalism, simple, heartwarming lessons. The whole Mystery Inc. team, along with Blue Falcon's team, is captured in a charming, lively and fun aura, teaches the value of friendship and human decency, crack a lot of jokes of which a handful prompt a laugh, and, basically, bring on the heart and humor of the original series. It is when they are thrown into a big, loud, trendy, messily energetic, chaotic-universe-building sci-fi adventure romp, when Scoob! has its biggest issues. Come the third act, a good portion of it has grown tiring, and I found myself wishing that they had went for a more grounded, more small scale endeavor, with a plot having more focus on the mystery team itself, and not splitting it on so many characters. It's as if there was a try-hard objective of making Scoob! as similar to every other big animated movie as possible, and it backfired.The voice cast does a terrific job - Will Forte provides a Shaggy voice that feels like a glove on hand, Scooby's channeled by the veteran voice actor Frank Welker (who has been the voice of Fred Jones in a multitude of various Scooby Doo animated movies and series, done in this one by Zac Efron), Jason Isaacs screams villain Dick Dastardly, Mark Wahlberg's the insecure Blue Falcon, and many more have fun in their characters. I couldn't recognize the voice of Dynomutt, and I'd never have guessed it was Ken Jeong...The animation's actually better than I thought it'd be, very vivid, sharp, colorful &amp; the visual dynamic is overall well done. Sound design doesn't fall behind as well, even here you can hear the familiar antics of original series, plus the soundtrack has some serious throwback pieces. At the end of the day though, regarding the visuals as much as the plot, I wish Scoob! was less spectacular and more contained.I'm very happy I took up watching Scoob!, even with all the flaws it's an amusing journey with the unfortunate aftertaste of some wasted, unused potential.

Direction never helped an already badly written movie rather makes you confuse which one was bad and which one was worse.It seems that Animation studio hired newcomers fresh out of school in order to match the budget. Only thing which stood out in the movie was rigging of characters and props (yes, I know about animated movie making) average shading and lighting.I think it would have fared far worse if it was released on theaters.The person who edited the Trailer did a very fine job but movie failed to match the expectations raised by the trailer. Somethings should be left untouched because poor execution ruined them.

And a bigger mystery with bigger monsters is what they get!Much truer to the original series than the newer shows or movies- Scoob is a fun watch and a good intro to the series for kids who haven't seen any Scooby Doo before. We had so much fun watching classic Scooby in a modern movie.Parents should know that some of the humor is crude- there are some phrases you aren't going to want repeated 8,000 times. While there are some scary images and suspenseful moments- nothing is scarier than the original Scooby Doo Where are You monsters or scares!BE AWARE that this is an early theatrical home release! Which means for the next few months, until it comes out on DVD, the movie will be about 20 to rent and 25 to buy. This is still a great deal and cheaper than taking the whole family to the theater!Warner brothers also has a great family movie night packet to go along with the movie that you can find by googling scoob party pack! It has coloring sheets, recipes and more! You can also find our full parent review, lessons from the movie and discussion questions at down the hobbit hole blog dot com.

Film Critic"}, {"id": 547, "text": "I remember staying up all night with my friends during the once a year Scooby-Doo marathons that Cartoon Network used to do, we'd try to stay up all night at least though I don't think we ever did make it. Needless to say the characters have always been really close to my heart and even as I've grown older that has never changed. I loved the live action movies that came out years ago, and I tentatively enjoyed every new show that has come out over the years.However, I must admit that I was apprehensive about the announcement that WB were launching a Hannah Barbara shared universe and that Scooby-Doo was going to be its launch pad. Even worse was when I heard that Matthew Lillard wasn't going to continue his work with Shaggy (not that I don't love Will Forte) as I think Lillard has earned his place as the best Shaggy.Luckily my apprehension was misplaced, I really think they nailed Scoob! in every way I couldn't have dreamed of. The animation is beautiful, paying full tribute to the classic styles without feeling like it was out of place. The voice acting and writing is incredibly well done, with solid jokes for kids and adults alike, and the story was fast paced, but very fun and easy to follow. The movie is just full of heart, and it's clear that the people who made the movie put a lot of their own heart into it.This movie is well worth your time."}, {"id": 548, "text": "I noticed a lot of negative reviews on here and thought I would chime in. Scooby Doo has been my favorite cartoon for as long as I can remember, but also it's important for me to remember the vast array of series and movies that came out of this franchise and how different they all are. This movie is no exception.First of all, this is definitely a modern kids film designed to compete alongside Disney and Minions. I will be the first to admit that most of the humor got a little sillier than I'm used to for Scooby Doo; but again, I am not a child of this generation, so it's forgivable. However, that isn't too say that I failed to find any jokes to be funny. There was quite a bit of cute humor that doesn't necessarily make you laugh out loud but still brought a smile to my face heading them come out of Scooby's mouth.Apart from the humor, the story also fell pretty far outside the range of a Scooby Doo mystery. Don't be mistaken, not every Scooby movie revolves around the exact same type of mystery, but it would have been nice to see them dabble in it a little more spooky. Again though, even though the Scooby elements missing from the plot were made up for with the characters. Despite the lack of Matthew Lillard and other original voices, the characters kept all of the charm of the characters throughout the show (s).Was this movie Big Hero 6? Definitely not; but I don't think I would have wanted to cry anyway. I cannot say Scoob! has any sort of thoughtful plot or emotional complexity, but it still has a solid heart and it does try to tug at the nostalgic parts of Scooby fans even if they are overpowered now and again by some of the more meta jokes.TLDR; Altogether, Scoob! might not be a masterpiece, but it's definitely not a disaster. This movie is a genuinely fun time that approaches it's characters with love even if it might lose them in it's oversimplistic plot. It's not a perfect Scooby movie and we could have gotten a better theatrical first release; but if you can put yourself in the mindset of a kid ready to eat anything Scooby brings to the table, then this is a solid three course meal."}, {"id": 549, "text": "Scoob! (2020) - [7/10]This was the first film I watched that was premiered through VOD, and I'm really happy. It lived up to my expectations and in some ways exceeded them. Ever since I was a child, I have loved Scooby-Doo (1969 - ). I grew up watching every adventure with Mystery Inc. I could, and I think I can confidently say I've seen almost every Scooby-Doo (1969 - ) film and television show - it's a part of who I was and who I am now. I grew up with these characters, so to see a completely new animation style, casting, and story direction had me excited, yet nervous. I was excited to see the gang back together, but was nervous to see a new story. The idea of superheroes, super villains, and then Mystery Inc. scared me. I thought, That's not Scooby-Doo (1969 - ). That's a corporation trying to cash in on the 'superhero trend' and revive a beloved series. Thankfully, I remembered that Scooby-Doo (1969 - ) has always had ridiculous adventures - from becoming literal samurai to getting trapped in a video game, and I realized that this was just another fun, outside-the-box adventure. The adventure in Scoob! (2020) is a fun one, filled with some twists, emotional moments, and powerful messages. That being said, not everything in this film is executed to perfection, and you can tell that some elements simply don't live up to the best of Scooby-Doo (1969 - ) television shows and films. One of the biggest worries I had with the film was the casting. Will Forte as Shaggy, Gina Rodriguez as Velma, Zac Efron as Fred, and Amanda Seyfried as Daphne. How could they replace the perfect Shaggy, Mathew Lillard?? Something just didn't sit right for me when I found out that he wasn't attached to this film, but then I heard Will Forte's take on good ol' Shaggster. I was pleasantly surprised. It lived up to Lillard's Shaggy and was quite original at the same time. That's how I felt for the rest of the cast as well, pleasantly surprised. They were able to balance nostalgia and originality in their performances, creating something enjoyable for new and old fans. This concept goes for the majority of the film, wonderfully balancing originality and nostalgia to both revamp and respect the Scooby-Doo name (1969 - ). The revamping came in many forms, some good and some bad, but overall was pretty effective. The first, of course, is the animation style. It is very different from the other animated styles seen in the series, but it is really good. It took a little while to get used to, but in the end it just felt right. Secondly, they revamped the story of Scooby and Shaggy. They take us back to a new origin story, one that doesn't involve a puppy farm or Coolsville, Ohio, but one that involves a lonely kid and a lonely stray. In some ways, this new origin story is more effective than the original, but in other ways it isn't. I wasn't very fond of how Scooby and Shaggy met Fred, Velma, and Daphne, but I thought that the way Scooby and Shaggy met was quite emotional. The world was also revamped, taking a modern (if not futuristic) setting. This makes a retro series feel new and fresh, creating the ability for the series to continue and impact future generations in the years to come - which is very exciting. I am happy to say that Scooby-Doo (1969 - ) will continue being classic Mystery Inc. for years to come, because of this film. Overall, Scoob! (2020) is very enjoyable. I loved when it would reference the original series and films through the use of iconic sound effects, imagery, and even the recreation of the legendary Scooby-Doo (1969 - ) intro. But, I didn't like how some of the characters were overshadowed, such as Fred, and underdeveloped, like Daphne. It's more of a story about Scooby and Shaggy than it is about Mystery Inc., so it kind of makes sense that they weren't as prominent (or developed). I also didn't like the pacing, there were moments that needed to slow down and moments that needed to last longer; I think a longer runtime might have helped in its pacing. I would have loved to see this film in theaters, but I think it was the perfect release for VOD. It is a chance for families to get together and watch something that is enjoyable for everyone, in the safety of their own homes. I think it has a really good message (especially if you're a dog lover) about friendship and family. I highly recommend checking out it out this weekend with family and close friends. Scoob! (2020) is original, yet familiar, bringing together the culmination of a couple generations - both new and old - to create a satisfying adventure for the entire family that will make you relive memories you had somehow forgotten."}, {"id": 550, "text": "I am currently in that nostalgia of Scooby-Doo after watching this film. You know the fact that I love animations and my main inspiration for it was the cartoons I used to watch. But, lately there have been some adaptations that really butchered the feeling. Yes, I am talking about that live action hybrids The Smurfs, Alvin and the Chipmunks and many more like that. You cannot forget the Raja Gosling version of Scooby-Doo don't you. I was low on hope but then I came to know that it was a product of the WAG, who have literally shaken up their animation department with The Lego Movie and since have been giving good to great films. Their new film is Scoob which is now the second animation film after Trolls: World Tour to get a VOD release. How did I feel about the film? Make sure you read my whole review below.So, Scoob is a 2020 animated film starring Zac Efron, Mark Wahlberg and many talented voice actors. It is directed by Tony Cervone who has previously worked with Spike Brandt on some of the Tom and Jerry direct-to-video films. The story revolves around Shaggy and Scooby, who break themselves from the Mystery Inc. to show that they are not the weaklings. The events which occur after the incident essentially rounds the entire story. The screenplay of the film is fun for the most part. Let us begin with the positives. The main idea of the film is really good. This film tries to explore the idea of friendship and believing one another with Shaggy and Scooby and two other human-dog pairs. Granted they spell it out for the target audience but still we can forgive it. With this central idea, the characterisations of the film stand out for a family film. The main conflict of Shaggy and Scooby in the film is the best part of the film with their budding relationship and how their relationship grows and they grow as persons. This film has a fun vibe in it and it is mainly for the fans as nostalgia fuels our experience to be a better one. The writing of the film stepping apart from the basic structure of a regular Scooby-Doo episode tries to make a big Hollywood-style adventure film in the unique Scooby-Doo fashion. It works partially. So, let us go to the negatives now. My main gripe with the film is that they give Fred, Velma and Daphny lesser time to shine and mostly the audience wants these characters to get more screen-time than some of the new characters who are just the allies or obstacles. Also, the slapstick comedy of the film used minimally does not work that well. The director of the film clearly did try it with the experience he has with Tom and Jerry films but like in those films, they miss the mark. Also, the dialogues of the film are basically filled with Buzz Words and yes they bring down the quirkiness of those lines. There are some essential elements in a Scooby-Doo film that have to be there like the climax face reveal. This film as it was stepping away from the pattern unnecessarily attaches a joke into the film that feels out of place. This film's fun vibe comes from its animation. It goes for the cartoony style 3D animation like in Hotel Transylvania or some of the WAG films like Storks. It is very good and the creativity in display is really good. The backgrounds of the film are as cartoony as the character design. To start with, it pops out of the screen with its colour and just the bounciness of the buildings. The character design is good. It stays true to the classic design of the Scooby-Doo cartoon and effectively renders it in 3D. Although, I have complains on this one. The childhood version of Shaggy and Scooby haven't really de-aged well for me and their designs do not really give a feeling that they are kids. The adult version of Fred in the film too just does not render well. The film has some very well choreographed action scenes and their framing makes it even better. They are not amazing but yeah they are very nice. The voice acting of the film too is very solid. Even though the dialogues are ordinary, the voice actors make it work to give the fun feel of the film. Most of the humour in the film is because of the voice acting and their love to these characters. Yeah, one more thing, the Simon Cowell cameo is really good. This film needs nostalgia to make it a very good watch. It tries to be cool to the audience with its buzz word filled dialogue and due to this it loses its original nature. But, the animation and voice actors step up and make the film a good watch for the most part and a good time with your family.

Enough time has passed since the Scooby-Doo franchise saw a major theatrical release, and it's now in a place where it could do something really unique and interesting.Instead they do... well, whatever this was.Perhaps the biggest complaint about this movie going in was the lack of the original cast, particularly Matthew Lillard and, although the change in voice is a little off-putting, it's by far the most minor issue this film has.It's a love letter to not only Scooby-Doo's past, but Hanna Barbera in general. There are a lot of references to keep fans of the company in general over the years satisfied. In theory, that's a fantastic thing. However, when a studio focuses the majority of its time adding in little Easter eggs and bits and pieces of fan service, it very quickly loses sight of what matters.Scoob! is a beautifully animated film that's absolutely stunning to look at. The story, however, is an absolute jumbled mess, an excuse for the studio to cram in as many references and jokes as they possibly can. And, although the jokes were funny, a lot of them just didn't fit the tone of what Scooby-Doo is supposed to be.Ultimately, this movie offers nothing special. It'll come and it'll go, but it won't be anything memorable, even 2 or 3 years down the road. The overall impression is that it's an intense effort of fan service that, as a casual fan, I can't get behind. It was dull, boring and unfocused. The script needed to be fine-tuned and slimmed down to be more concise instead of bogged down with filler and there needed to be more of an element of mystery, which is the bread and butter of the Scooby-Doo property. And here, it's totally missing.Unless you have a young child or are a diehard Scooby-Doo/Hanna Barbera fan, this is a definite SKIP."}, {"id": 552, "text": "Things I like about this movie:Shaggy first meeting Scooby-Doo at the beach when he and Scoob both were younger.The bowling alley scene.The film's title logo is shown 2 times during the end credits.

Already familiar with me, as a kid I used to watch the All Star Laff-A-Lympics cartoons.Made in CGI, you have the origins of how Shaggy met Scooby Doo. They even recreate the original title sequence in CGI.If you are eagle eyed you will spot references to Scooby Doo and other Hanna Barbera carton characters such as a poster of Hong Kong Phooey.More prominent is Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, Captain Caveman, the villain is Dick Dastardly and in due course Muttley makes an appearance.Dastardly is after Scooby Doo who is the last descendant of a dog that belonged to a famous warrior. Dastardly plans to use Scooby Doo to unleash the three headed Cerberus.The fun is Scooby Doo, Shaggy and the rest of the Mystery Machine gang. It is updated with plenty of pop cultural references.I thought Blue Falcon was the weak link, the plot was a bit naff but my children enjoyed it."}, {"id": 554, "text": "Scoob definitely has its hits and its misses, but on the whole it's definitely a fun, easy watch. The start of the movie, showing the origin of the gang and particularly focusing on Shaggy's character, was fantastic and easily the best part of the film. In the early part and throughout the film, the homages to the past iterations of Scooby Doo were really well done. The recreation of the SDWAY theme song was really smart as it's not just homage, it also establishes all of that as canon in an unambiguous way. The characters are all well written in keeping with past iterations while still feeling fresh. We don't focus enough on Fred, Daphne, or Velma to really get a lot out of them, but Velma is well written in her moments and Daphne only really has her relationship with Dusty to contend with, but it's such a great plot line that it made me love her character in Scoob and wish we had more of her. Really, this is a film about Shaggy and Scooby's relationship (along with Blue Falcon). I really like the choice to focus on Shaggy, and the film is clearly aware of the similar plotlines it's retreading (especially Monsters Unleashed, where Scooby and Shaggy had the same uselessness concern). The opening shows his insecurity and desire for friendship really well, and the importance of his and Scooby's friendship is truly what drives the film. Yes, like all Scooby Doo fans, I would've preferred to have Lillard back as Shaggy, but while it wasn't great, Forte could've been worse. The gang, insofar as they were used in the film, are pretty satisfying. The problem is that aside from Shaggy and Scooby's friendship, they are largely shoved aside in favor of Blue Falcon and Dick Dastardly. BF was comfortably the worst character in the movie, as he was too brash and stupid to be believable. The emphasis on their struggle with Dastardly also made the movie a superhero movie about fighting each other and getting to places first, and didn't have a real mystery element. Dastardly's relationship with his dog was nice to see, but we don't get any understanding at all about his character and why he wants the underworld so bad (obviously to get his dog back, but he wanted it before then. Maybe it's just greed for money, but either way poorly explained). The actual plot also makes no sense at all - how do the skulls do anything, how are a three-headed dog and building actually physically constructed, and so on. It works more on a symbolic level of having a heavy price to pay for greed and the climactic decision requiring true friendship to make things right. In addition to having plot elements that don't hold up to scrutiny and a story that's a simple superhero story lacking a mystery, the script tries far too hard to be hip. It is a witty script at many points, with small clever jabs and more nice references to gang history, but it goes overboard with irrelevant cultural references. In the future it'll likely be seen as even more dated by the overabundance of things like dabbing, tinder, and especially Simon Cowell (really, why was he in this movie?). So yes, Scoob has its flaws, but it does have a beating heart at the center with the message that loyal, deep friendship will persevere through adversity. If there does end up being a sequel, I hope they'll stick to the bits shown earlier in the film that show what Mystery Inc is all about: solving mysteries as a team of close friends."}, {"id": 555, "text": "I was pretty hyped to see this from the trailer, as I have loved Scooby Doo since I was a child. I am 30 now. After viewing, I have to say that my expectations were met. It's definitely awkward in some ways as we see young Shaggy using a cell phone, listening to 90's music, despite being an origin story (you'd think they might be set in the 50's or 60's), but with those gripes aside, I still thought this was a cute and funny move overall.The animation style was nice and clean and none of the characters were changed too much. I thought the voice actors did a great job overall. I thought the script and humor were cute, quick-witted, and funny. Ultimately, yes, this doesn't feel like a Scooby Doo classic episode as the mystery is pushed into the background and it's more along the lines of a superhero movie like The Incredibles for instance, with many Hannah-Barbera characters making an appearance. But for what it's worth, I do not regret purchasing the movie. It was only $5 more than to rent, so I figured I'd make the leap.I feel I'll revisit for the script and humor for sure, but just don't go into it expecting the gang to tackle a mystery and I think everyone will enjoy it, despite the flaws in the continuity."}, {"id": 556, "text": "From the original cartoon to the live-action films from 2002 and 2004, I've always had a soft spot for Scooby-Doo stories. When I heard they were revamping the property once again and going back to animation, I was actually pretty curious. Hearing a solid cast was being assembled for the voices and having liked some of the writer's previous work, I was going into this one with some minor expectations. Sadly, Scoob! is an absolute mess of a movie. Yes, it has its moments that I admittedly either felt emotion towards or found clever, but they were way too spread out to fully enjoy.The first ten minutes of this movie shares the backstory of how the entire gang came to be and it's easily the best portion of the entire film. The simplicity of young kids stumbling upon each other and accidentally solving a crime was a joy to watch. Sadly, once time passes and the story kicks in, it becomes far too interested in pleasing all audiences at once. After Shaggy and Scooby are kidnapped, they realize that Scooby has a destiny that may in turn just destroy the world. On top of that, characters like Disk Dastardly, The Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, Dee Dee Sykes, and Captain Caveman all come into the picture, making this film far more complex than it needed to be.When I say that this film is trying to please everyone, that almost seems like an understatement. There will be instances where the hottest popular songs are playing and characters are doing dances that young kids today would do, but then a minute later there's a joke about someone's Tinder dating profile. I really wasn't sure who this film was supposed to aimed at. On top of that, there's a running joke about Simon Cowell that would completely go over kid's heads these days and the older crowd who might get a laugh from it at first will just think it's a very dated reference. This movie was just a weird product all around.The biggest problem this particular rendition of Scooby-Doo faces is the fact that it really doesn't feel like Scooby-Doo at all. It's one thing to split the team up, which this movie does quite often, but it's another thing entirely to take away the mystery aspect. After about 20-30 minutes into this film, it decides to become a superhero actioner. This might have been a neat little accent to a broader story, but Scoob! straight up becomes a huge action movie by the end. Whatever happened to making a clever mystery film?In the end, this review pretty much broke down why it's not a good movie, but that's really not to say there's nothing good here. I probably enjoyed a solid 30 minutes out of it for being clever and hitting a couple of subtle jokes out of the park, but it just wasn't enough to win me over. I wasn't interested in the secondary characters at all, even though Mark Wahlberg was enjoyable as the voice of The Blue Falcon. As a Scooby-Doo mystery, there wasn't enough meat to the story to really become attached and the superhero aspect was completely uninteresting, so if you have very young children who just enjoy seeing nice animated visuals, then this may do the trick. As a narrative film though, it's all over the place, which is too bad, because it started very strong."}, {"id": 557, "text": "There are a few slight Liberal moments such as a reference to Ruth Gather from the Supreme Court.Every character seems to be the same, but slightly worse. The voices are a bit oft putting. Fred being the biggest offender. Gone is his very manly voice and he has a slight pre-pubescent tone. Totally a disgrace to Fred's manliness. It seems over the years, Fred went from a smart, manly, brave leader, to a coward. He is essentially Shaggy.Of course because it's 2020 Hollyweird, the girls are smart, brave, sophisticated and well put together. There simply isn't enough personality diversity in the characters. The girls act like men, the men act like girls.Blue Falcon makes an appearance as is beyond terrible. He is nothing like the Blue Falcon. He's egotistical which is fine, but never fun. That is the real problem with the movie, it never seems fun. Scooby and Shaggy disappears, and that is essentially the MAIN plot. Of course their are mysteries throughout and it all ends the way we are expecting, which is fine.The visuals and sound is pretty good. The music sucks though. The main theme is butchered at the beginning. It's not very good overall. The score itself is fine, but when applied with words to form a song, it is awful to say the least.I recommend watching for curiosity. 6.5 out of 10."}, {"id": 558, "text": "I was looking forward to watching Scoob, but I never expected it to be anything too great or awards-worthy. I just wanted to have a good time, and I did with certain elements.Unfortunately, for the most part, Scoob is painfully average. The story is mediocre, and so is the script. It didn't feel like a traditional Scooby Doo narrative, because they introduced many elements which would appeal to children. I can see that children probably would enjoy this film a lot more than adults, and I myself can't get enough of superhero films, but it felt out of place in a Scooby Doo story.There are a number of adult jokes, which I appreciated because it gave me a chuckle every once in a while. Some of the regular jokes also worked for me. Apart from that, there isn't anything particularly good about the script, and the number of pop-culture references was far too much. This made the film feel like it was pandering to the younger generation, by throwing in recognisable brand names instead of focusing on creating a strong narrative.Thankfully, there are a couple of redeeming qualities. The animation was beautiful to look at, and the voice actors did a nice job. There has been much controversy around the casting of Will Forte as Shaggy, instead of Matthew Lillard. I don't mind, personally, because it's the studios film. Lillard isn't entitled to play this character, and I ended up liking Forte in the role.The dynamic between the characters was nice, even though the main gang was split down the middle for the most part. Apart from the animation, my favourite part of Scoob was actually the relationship between Shaggy and Scooby, and how they have become dependant on each other. There was a lot of emotion on display in parts, and I really liked it.I can't call Scoob a good film because of the mediocre plot and script, but there weren't any elements which I thought were downright bad and I actually enjoyed a couple of aspects.

I mean in terms of animation and CGI style. So like it or dislike it? Well that is, of course, a matter of personal preference. I must admit, though, that I did enjoy it. I found this particular style of presentation of Scooby Doo and the Mystery Gang to be refreshing and enjoyable.As for the storyline, well this is a Scooby Doo! adventure, so you pretty much know what you are in for here. There isn't much of any deviations from the usual form, for better or worse. But hey, isn't that what makes Scooby Doo! so enjoyable?I must say that I think it was glorious to have Dick Dastardly and Muttley to appear in this 2020 Scooby Doo! adventure, and it was really a trip back memory lane to watch these two pseudo-villains on the screen again. I actually don't think I've seen them since I was a child.This is an animated movie, so it relies on having a proper voice acting team, and Scoob! doesn't fail to deliver there. There is both familiar voices and new ones to the cast list, and people were doing great jobs with their roles.I am rating Scoob! a seven out of ten star rating, because I was impressed and I was entertained.

It looked good from the trailers, but I was a little concerned because the live action films haven't aged very well.I can definitely say that this was a solid film though and definitely kept me entertained. Plenty of throwbacks for nostalgia and it's really cool that Warner Bros seems to be setting up a Hanna Barbara universe. All voice acting was actually really good. It took some getting used to with Shaggy, but Will Forte did manage do sell me on his performance. I honestly nearly forgot that Fred was voiced by Zach Efron and the rest of them were so convincing that I didn't even think about who that voice was. It felt like the gang to me.The plot was a bit convoluted at times, and not everything was executed well, but it was by no means bad. It's just good family friendly fun that anyone can enjoy.

Any callbacks and references to past Svooby-doo are completely shallow.This movie is 100% a studio milking its intellectual property without any regard for the proprty itself.The only enjoyable parts of the film are the opening sequence with young scoob and shaggy (which has its own issues such showing a dog eating Halloween candy which genuinely has me concerned impressionable young viewers are going to give their own pups chocolate) and one gag near the end involving Scooby snacks that was vintage Scooby-doo. Two decent moments throughout an entire movie, ouch.I understand that franchises need to adapt and develop, but this frankly missed the mark on all levels. For anyone who thinks the issue is that there is no way to make Svooby-doo modern and fresh while also respecting established principles, I would say that Spiderman Far From Home has a plot that 100% would have worked as a Scooby-doo movie (twist on the identity of the villain, main character(s) have to adapt to unfamiliar environement, story is modern while not being forced and the the technology makes sense for the mystery involved) and most people liked that film, so updating the franchise was far from impossible."}, {"id": 564, "text": "There are a lot of elements about this that worked for me &amp; some not so much.

Because they are the Mystery Inc. team also part of much of the movie, the movie doesn't really feel like a Scooby-Doo movie, but more like a superhero movie where Scooby-Doo has a cameo. For a better Scooby-Doo movie, you better watch another Scooby-Doo animation or episode of the TV series. Even the live-action movies are more entertaining to watch with the family than this new movie. For people who are not very familiar with Scooby-Doo and the rest of the characters, this movie may seem a bit unclear, because after a quick intro, the characters are not further developed in the movie.The animation is also made entirely with computer designs and illustrations. The characters look different and more modern if you compare this animation film with the old Scooby-Doo animated series and older films.The voice acting is done well by the cast. Will Forte and Frank Welker manage to make their voices sound like the characters they say. For example, they still appear to fans of the characters as they are used to from the characters.

It likely would have made some decent money at the box as it's kid friendly.The movie is somewhat of a standard Scooby Doo mystery while incorporating an homage to Hanna Barbera.While the intro shows how Shaggy and Scooby meet, there's not much origin story. It springs into a near reference to the live action movies of the early 2000's. But then turns into a standard Scooby mystery where they have to stop a villain and his evil plot.Dick Dastardly was never a Scooby villain, but was actually a character on another HB show called Wacky Races. The same goes for Blue Falcon, Dynomutt and Captain Caveman, who were on other shows. There are also some hidden references to the Hanna Barbera cartoon dynasty throughout the movie.Scoob! has a huge cast, which plays their parts fairly well. The original Scooby voice plays Scooby, but the rest of the characters are new. They did tweak Velma to be Latina, which isn't obvious except for a few words. Will Arnett sounds a lot like the original Shaggy.I feel like people ripped this movie for the box office fiasco, and the fact it was made to seem like an origin story. While not as good as the classic cartoon, it does give a fresh look at the characters.There are some minor adult humor/references that would likely go over most kids heads and give older viewers a possible laugh. But overall any age would not have an issue watching this."}, {"id": 567, "text": "I noticed the movie was for rent on Amazon, but at almost $20.00 for rental, I passed. I saw it was on HBO Max, so figured I'd watch. I've been watching Scooby Doo since the first episode, so I am an old time fan. IF the pop culture references weren't there, this may have been passable. There is always a reason that cartoons , movies, tv shows try to limit the amount of current references, especially non-historic, in the show. The movie will not age well at all. I'm aware of the cartoon cross references: Blue Falcon &amp; Dynomutt, Cap'n Caveman &amp; DeeDee. But Simon Cowell? There was no real plot. Which was it: discovering what Dick Dasterdly was doing or the split between Shaggy &amp; Scooby, the team breaking up? Subplots are fine, but it's supposed to be something underlying the plot, giving something more NOT more important or same importance. Just before this, this the gang split &amp; what? Minimal on Fred, Daphne &amp; Velma. Shaggy &amp; Scooby, together but separate once with the Blue Falcoln, then Shaggy alone, Scooby with the Falcoln. This was a Blue Falcoln &amp; Dynomutt movie. I don't mind CGI movies, but could we have gotten the characters done right? Except for Scooby &amp; Muttly, no one looked or felt right. Fred was definitely no muscle at all, unintelligent &amp; no traps. Where are the traps? Velma didn't have any bright ideas, no jinkys from her. Daphne was window dressing &amp; that's all. Shaggy &amp; Scooby weren't hungry or complaining about being hungry. Scooby talked too much. Dick Dasterdly had a major oversized face &amp; chin - more ridiculous than it should have been. And the voices? I have no idea it would be a great idea to change up the actors, but it DIDN'T work. The voice actors were good but they were not the characters. They sounded wrong. Scooby was fine, I mean who can go wrong with Frank Welker. But Will Forte is NO SHAGGY ROGERS. If you insist on getting new people, then make sure they can do the voice. It's not always the timber, tone, whatever, but about how much it actually is the character. Long time fans, catch it free. Don't waste the money.

Reminds me of the orginal live action Scooby Doo movie from back in the day as it works well being a satire on itself.One odd flaw to the movie is that it stars Scooby Doo and the Mystery Inc. gang but it's very not Scooby Doo in that they don't do the common Scooby Doo formula that is the back bone of a Scooby Doo Mystery. The characters are on point but it feels like a different universe with the mystery they are solvingWhoever made this movie thought it would be a good idea to take Scoob outside of his element a little. Not sure if that's the risk you want to take when the dog has not had a theatrical release in like 16 years (and that last release, Scooby Doo: Masters Unleash was the opposite of good).If you are a fan of the broader world of Hanna Barbara cartoons than this movie does add some childhood nostalgia for you. The trailer shows that the Blue Falcon is in the movie, but there are a few other Hannah Barbara icons that make it in the movie. Great fan service is you are into the universe beyond Scooby Doo, but in most shared cinematic universes you would do one of two movies before you have this sort of Avengers Assemble moment.This movie was way more serious than I would have expected a Scooby Doo movie to be too. I mean the massage on friendship gets very extreme. Not what I was expected.Overall, I liked it. It's like it's trying to show you everything Scooby Doo has done in his very impressive 51 years as a cartoon character (who has more animated series and stright-to-video features than Scoob?), all in one movie.

I am getting a little tired of the name origin game but at least, Scooby Snacks make a lot of sense. I'm fine with doing a young Scooby gang movie. Scooby jr.'s voice sounds a bit old but otherwise, everything looks pretty good. It could have been a Monster House but then they grow up. The movie loses me as soon as Simon Cowell shows up. He's annoying in real life and in cartoon form. It turns into a supernatural superhero super-complicated movie. Are they trying to make a new Avengers cinematic universe? I don't know.

In the movie we see a stray dog, with no name taking a roll of kebab meat from a Greek takeaway shop, and is being pursued by a policeman on a bike. The dog manages to give the policeman the slip and hides himself and the roll of meat in the sand, disguised as a couple of sand mounds. At the same time a lonely young boy, Norvil Rogers is listening to his music on his phone, which, seemingly knows he is lonely and every record seems to depict that too. Eventually turning to a podcast, which does the exact same thing, he continues to walk down the street. while by the beach, he spots the two mounds and has an idea, putting faces on them with shells, and then sits to have his lunch with his 2 new friends Shelley and Sandy. The dog is listening as the boy talks to the mounts, then suddenly appears and they, after scaring each other sit to eat the lunch together. All of a sudden the policeman appears and says that he needs to take the dog, the boy claims that the dog is his. When asked his name, the name Scooby-Doo comes from somewhere in the boys head. Once the policeman leaves the boy introduces himself to the talking dog, but says everyone calls him Shaggy. This is the moment that Scooby and Shaggy meet.

The best joke in this movie is 10 minutes in, involving Ruth Bader Gisnburg being a Slytherin. That got the hardest laugh out of me. I did enjoy some of the jokes that make fun of how dated the show is. (It's like Shaggy was written by a middle aged man who thinks saying like a lot is how hippies talk). I didn't appreciate some of the crasser humor that earned this movie the PG rating. Jokes about dropping F bombs (meaning Falcon bombs), Just Falcon Around, Tinder being misunderstood to be an app that delivers firewood and Velma being a bit of an SJW by shouting toxic masculinity! These are jokes that might fit in a Dreamworks movie that came out in the early 2000s, but they certainly don't belong here. They should have focused more on being a Scooby Doo mystery, but this is more of a Blue Falcon crossover movie. It's entertaining, but only for a one time watch.

I'll admit, the first ten minutes of the movie are good, when they show Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Fred during their childhood and meeting each other for the first time. It was good to see how Shaggy and Scooby met, and they even go as far to re-create the opening credits of the original classic Scooby-Doo series, but after that is when the movie goes downhill.The movie cuts to ten years later, and Mystery Inc. is going into business with a famous celebrity, but he cuts Shaggy and Scooby out of the deal. They get depressed and go bowling, only to see that the bowling pins are evil robots. They are rescued by Dee Dee Sykes, Dynomutt, and the annoying wannabe hero, Blue Falcon. Blue Falcon is probably the worst character in the whole movie. He tries to act like he's a superhero, but he's a cringe-worthy coward.The robots are created by a silly generic villain named Dick Dastardly, who feels like a rip-off of Snidely Whiplash, cheesy mustache and all. This is supposed to be a Scooby Doo movie, but they make it more about the side characters, rather than the main characters. Dick's big evil plan is to release a giant ghost dog into the world. That's it! There was hardly no mystery, no g-g-g-ghosts! no monsters wearing masks. This movie left a bad taste in my mouth, and made me nostalgic for the original Scooby Doo cartoons from the 60's, so I bought the complete series on blu-ray from Amazon. This movie makes the 2002 live-action movie look good. If you a lover of Scooby Doo and the original classics, I would not recommend SCOOB!!!"}, {"id": 573, "text": "Scoob! is a CGI animated film reboot of the Scooby-Doo franchise created by Hanna-Barbera Productions. Featuring the voices of Will Forte, Zac Efron, Amanda Seyfried, and Jason Isaacs, it is passable entertainment for today's young audiences and hardcore fans but forgettable mediocrity for everyone else.Since they were little, Shaggy (voiced by Will Forte), his dog Scooby-Doo (voiced by Frank Welker), and his friends Fred (voiced by Zac Efron), Velma (voiced by Gina Rodriguez), and Daphne (voiced by Amanda Seyfried) have been solving mysteries together as the group known as Mystery Inc. One day, Shaggy and Scooby decide to go their separate ways from the quintet after being told by the group's investor that their addition to the team is useless. Shortly afterwards, the two of them are attacked by robots at a bowling alley but are eventually rescued by the superhero Blue Falcon (voiced by Mark Wahlberg) and his partners Dynomutt the Dog Wonder (voiced by Ken Jeong) and Dee Dee Skyes (voiced by Kiersey Clemons). The three heroes inform Shaggy and Scooby that the robots belong to the supervillain Dick Dastardly (voiced by Jason Isaacs), who plans to use Scooby as part of his plan to resurrect the monstrous three-headed dog Cerberus from the underworld to bring about the end of days.Continuing the trend of contemporary film reboots to TV shows from several decades past, Scoob! is yet another typical example of something old hastily trying to adjust itself to the current trends of today's audiences with mostly embarrassing results. We see Shaggy listening to Spotify on his phone, Blue Falcon sharing his heroic escapades on Instagram, and Fred having a startling revelation that Netflix actually costs money (Shocking, right?!). Perhaps I am showing my age here, but I don't find any of this particularly funny and I think it feels like a desperate attempt to stay relevant and as a result, it loses a great deal of what made Scooby-Doo special in the first place. I suppose really little kids who don't know any better may derive some enjoyment from this, but most older viewers like me will be rolling their eyes in annoyance. I'll admit there was one scene involving Fred interacting with an attractive female police officer that made me chuckle so there's that at least.In terms of what happens in the story, there isn't really that much mystery solving going on, as we are merely told about Mystery Inc.'s past successes in foiling the bad guys' plans rather than being shown directly. This is a big missed opportunity for the audience to see how tight-knit the group's relationship is with each other and it doesn't give us that much reason to care about them in the long run. Only Shaggy and Scooby had some scenes where the friendship between the two of them felt genuine but as for Fred, Velma, and Daphne, their interactions with the former two were so limited that if I weren't familiar with the source material, I'd say they were more work acquaintances than long-time friends.The film's use of CGI looks nice as the animators did a good job capturing the likeness of Scooby-Doo and the other Hanna-Barbera characters in a 3D art style. However, as I was watching, I couldn't help but miss the old hand-drawn style of the original cartoon series. In this deluge of CGI animated feature films being made left, right, and centre, I realise that I have become somewhat desensitised to how nice they all look, and because of this, none of it wows me anymore. For this reason, I believe that Scooby-Doo was made to be done in hand-drawn format only, as no other style comes close to recapturing that charm.Each of the actors played their characters well, with Frank Welker as Scooby-Doo, the only one from the original cast to reprise his role, clearly being a standout. It is hard to imagine any other actor voicing the iconic talking dog considering how long he has played him for. Welker was also the original voice for Fred but that role has since been taken over by Zac Efron in this film. This was likely done to make him sound more youthful and even though Efron doesn't do a bad job, he just doesn't sound as good as Welker did. Additionally, Will Forte gives Shaggy that likeable laid back vibe that fits well alongside his dog friend and Gina Rodriguez and Amanda Seyfried also had their fair share of fun moments as Velma and Daphne, respectively. However, it is Jason Isaacs who steals the show as the devious Dick Dastardly, giving the character that sinister British drawl in his own personal style, separating himself from Dastardly's long running actor Paul Winchell. I hope Isaacs sees fit to reprise the role should we see Dastardly in a future Hanna-Barbera film adaptation (a Wacky Races movie perhaps?).Overall, it was inevitable that Scooby-Doo would get a reimagining for today's tech-savvy audience, as it happened similarly with the early 2000s live action films. I personally believe that the more modern something becomes, the more it loses sight of what made it so popular in the first place. I miss that sense of mystery and that rawness to the animation of the older cartoons that this one is lacking. Sure, the original series was far from perfect, but it still has that appeal that made it an enduring mainstay in pop culture whereas this one will likely be forgotten about in a matter of years. All I can say is that young kids will probably enjoy it but all others need not apply.I rate it 5.5/10"}, {"id": 574, "text": "Scoob is well animated and has good surprises up its sleeve; too bad it's aimed at a younger audience and fans of the original TV series will be left wanting more. .

The voice cast could've been better, although I really enjoyed Mark Wahlberg as Blue Falcon. His performance and one liners actually made me laugh out loud a few times. Another issue I had with Scoob is that the original Scooby-Doo never spoke as much as he did in the film. What's the deal with that and why is Scooby having full on conversations?

The original score is good for the most part. It also has important messages for the children watching this movie. Finally, the credits animation is just about identical to that of the show. Good qualities aside, this movie does have some problems.One of them is the voice actors being different from the tv show or the older movies (not a big deal). Another being the pop culture references (Pop Vinyls, Simon Cowell, the Dab dance, popular songs, the Cats musical etc.), product placement (Google Maps ripoff, Netlfix, Tinder, etc) and shameless self promotion (references to DC Comics, Harry Potter, A Star is Born, etc.) Another problem is that they are always trying to be hip every 5-10 minutes with all the modern day internet references and innuendos. The final problem being some of the obvious clich\u00e9s present in every movie, even this one.Overall, I like this movie more than I dislike it for what it is.

On Trick-Or-Treat, the two meet Fred, Velma, and Daphne, who help him get his candy from a haunted house, leading to their first mystery. In the present, the five have become the mystery solvers they are, and are ready to become a real business. However, the investor ends up being Simon Cowell, and his harsh words about Scooby and Shaggy causes them to leave the group. However, when little robots attack them at a bowling alley, they are brought onto the Falcon Fury, where they are put under the protection of Blue Falcon, who is actually Brian Crowne, the son of the original Blue Falcon, and Dynomutt, Dog Wonder, as a supervillain named Dick Dastardy is after them.Yeah, as this starts off a new cimematic universe, there will be a lot of differences. Mystery Inc. is mostly recast (with only Frank Welker reprising his voice role as Scooby). Also, some character dynamics have changed, with Blue Falcon and Dynomutt being the most obvious, as the hero, being the son of the original Blue Falcon, is a showboater and as cowardly as Shaggy, with Dynomutt being the more serious one trying to get Brian to take the superhero business seriously and stop being a goofball. We also get some Dee Dee Skyes, one of the teen angels, as the pilot of the Falcon Fury, and even Captain Caveman join in on the fun.While this is a good lineup, the film does have some flaws. Shaggy's new voice actor almost nails the part, as his voice sounds high enough, but sadly, it is not as raspy as Shaggy should be. Also, Captain Caveman speaks perfect English instead of the gibberish he is known for, and Fred has some moments where he doesn't think, but do stupid things, and some of the jokes can be gross, but it has a good story and moral, some of the locations are clever (and named after actors and other people involved with Hannah-Barbara shows)."}, {"id": 577, "text": "I'm not a Scooby-fan, just to be clear.

It has great animation and character designs, It has a pretty good cast of voices, even if Frank Welker is the only returning actor from the original voice cast, It has a really heart warming message about the power of friendship, It has very impressive visual effects, It has some pretty good bits of humour, and I personally think the music and soundtrack for this movie is pretty damn catchy.In fact I loved this version of Scooby-Doo! so much that honestly i think it could win an award or at least be nominated for that matter.Those are just my thoughts, and I personally hope that at least some of you other Scooby-Doo! fans out there will agree with me."}, {"id": 579, "text": "First of all, the animation was excellent with enough details to make it look huge at times and enough stylised characters to avoid being uncanny.But sadly, that's the most positive thing I have to say about it, because even though I consider it to be better than the live-action movies from the early '00's, it just isn't good enough to be more than mediocre for different reasons but one in particular:The corporate footprint is enormous! This is most obvious in the cast which is all a-list celebrities even though the usual voice-cast for the many earlier and ongoing iterations of the beloved gang is still available, but I guess they weren't popular enough.It's also a superhero themed movie and a supposed start of a Hanna-Barbera cinematic universe. Superheroes are huge, cinematic universes are a big trend and the MCU is huge. These considerations make it feel more like a product of statistics and market analysis than its own thing.For the kids it might be fun and I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy at least some parts of the movie like the villain and his good humour and sympathetic motivations, and I think the set-up for an HB cinematic universe was surprisingly well done considering all the cameos there were in the movie.Lower your expectations, because even if Scoob! isn't terrible, it's pretty generic and bares a big corporate mark."}, {"id": 580, "text": "Who doesn't love Scooby-Doo? Outside of Raja Gosnell's garish live-action features (which play like hip reinventions but also behave as if we should be closely familiar with those iterations of the Mystery Inc. gang, hence the melancholy of their split-up early in the 2002 movie), the Scooby-Doo franchise has been pretty consistent in entertainment value.It hasn't always been great, nor have the monsters always been criminals in suits (see Zombie Island or the 13 Ghosts saga, finished last year with an overdue finale), but it's almost always lovable, particularly with how self-aware it's gotten after Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated and the string of movies that started coming out around the same time. With Warner Animation Group's new film Scoob!, I confess that things seem off again. There's always something strange about Scooby's theatrical runs, even as this one eventually ended up on VOD for obvious reasons.For starters, it forsakes franchise-long casting traditions in favor of hot, marketable celebrities, including Zac Efron, who replaces Frank Welker as Fred, even though Welker was right effin' there as the voice of Scooby (whose vocals he has supplied in almost every piece of Scoob media since Don Messick's death, apart from such films as the live-action series, Zombie Island, and that one Johnny Bravo episode). The more recent meta-humor usually had timeless observations and, if not, was strangely in-tune with modern memes; now the jokes are wannabe-hip at the risk of aging poorly (see the absurdist John Cena cameo vs. the new film's references to Netflix, DJ Khaled, social media, and dabbing).The film also does the cinematic universe thing made famous by Marvel, but I will be fair to Warner: this isn't the first time the classic Hanna-Barbera characters have been shown to inhabit pretty much the same reality. Remember when Fred Flintsone met the Jetsons? Or Wacky Races? Hell, Scooby once fought crime with Batman - you just know there's gonna be a sequel wherein Scrappy-Doo pits the two against each other while he's off creating Doomsday.This means that, in addition to Will Forte as the cowardly Shaggy (Not even Lillard is safe!), Gina Rodriguez as the hyper-intelligent Velma, and Amanda Seyfried as tough but airheaded Daphne, the rest of the cast includes characters like Dinomutt (Ken Jeong), his partner-in-crime-fighting The Blue Falcon (Mark Whalberg), one of the Teen Angels (Kiersey Clemons), and even Captain Caveman (Tracy Morgan), who makes even less sense to me. Is he there because Scoob joins forces with The Flintstones in the next movie? I know he was in other shows but I mainly know him from The Flinstone Kids.I forgot one: Jason Isaacs as Dick Dastardly, the Wacky Races antagonist who became the lead character of Stop the Pigeon (as it is colloquially known) years later. His convoluted scheme involves a Greek-mythological dogpocalypse, hence why Dynomutt arrives to enlist Scooby and friends for their greatest adventure yet. I dunno, I kinda miss solving mysteries and unmasking con men. We couldn't have saved this for a future crossover?Scoob himself also speaks more fluently than most of us will be used to, and liberties are taken with his origins. This is mainly a warning to whoever cares deeply about Scooby-Doo lore, but it does speak to how insincere the movie feels. Its Hanna-Barbera references are cute but it doesn't play like it's a real Scooby-Doo film as much as it simply uses the marketable characters (vaguely understood as they may be) to tell a cooler story. The prologue is promising enough, full of callbacks, ghosts, and Hanna-Barbera sound effects. Then the actual movie gets going.Regardless, you and the family might have fun with it. The animation, although the shift from 2D to 3D is unneeded, isn't restricted by excessively hyperrealistic rendering. The characters inhabit a more three-dimensional space, but they're allowed to move as energetically as the heroes of Ast\u00e9rix. Characters can still move quickly and humorously whilst also being insanely well-rendered, of course, but it might result in the odd mix of cartoonishness and realism I discussed re: Onward (probably before then, as well; I repeat myself a lot)."}, {"id": 581, "text": "Scoob! is a 2020 American computer-animated mystery/comedy film produced by Warner Brothers and is based on the Scooby Doo franchise. Scoob! Is directed by Tony Cervonn and stars Zac Effron, Will Forte, Mark Wahlberg, Gina Rodriguez, Amanda Seyfried and Jason Isaac.At a young age I loved the Scooby Doo franchise and remember watching the films on repeat which must have been incredibly annoying for my parents. This starts off as another great addition (for the first 15 minutes that is), it's got the theme tune and the origin story of Scooby and Shaggy is great to watch, however where this film falls off is when they are abducted and Blue Falcon is introduced (although Mark Wahlberg does a great job voice acting). The charm of Scooby Doo has always been that it feels grounded and feels like it can happen as they solve the crime and unmask the villain at the end. Taking a turn into the superhero genre was inevitable but it could have been done so much better, the main villain is weak and the cowardly superhero with the same old redemption ark is an addition I never wanted to see in a Scooby Doo films.This film was always going to be nostalgic but sadly the mystery aspect was missing, this just creates another generic animation compared to the heart of the previous films. The plot feels too big for the movie making it feel more like the third or fourth instalment in a franchise, rather than the more modest scene-setter it needed to be. This takes away the chance to get to know this set of the team personality as hardly any time is spend on the other team member until the third act but Scooby Doo bring a nice nostalgic presence which is expected as its his film, however, the fact that we spend so little time with the team as a whole takes away from the special group dynamic the show portrays, this means when the group is thrown into a dilemma you don't feel anything you should as you don't have the connection with this set of characters.People who are looking for classic Scooby Doo will be disappointed in this film as it feel too large and outlandish for what is supposed to be a down to earth franchise. Hollywood needs to understand that Superhero films work but shoving superhero's into pre-existing franchise is never a good idea and only hurts the movie in the whole as well as the constant references to pop culture.Scoob! Is a average film, I enjoyed moments and hated other but ultimately it doesn't feel like a Scooby Doo film, it lacks the mystery that the franchise is known for and this massively hurts the film as that's what Scooby Doo is all about, the film has heart, but lacks all the nostalgia of previous films. The computer animation is a downgrade compared to the classic cartoons and the villain is awful at times but good voice acting and the fact that the film can be slightly enjoyable at times makes Scooby Doo an average enjoyable 2020 release.Scoob! brings new ideas to the table but feels too far fetched for the down to earth nature of the franchise and would have been better suited to being an episode of a TV show but the Simon Cowell cameo is great and it is still enjoyable at times."}, {"id": 582, "text": "I am a HUGEEEEEEEEEE Scooby Doo fan and this was one of my most anticipated films of the year. I was really upset when they decided to release via VOD, but oh well. This film was fun and enjoyable. Definitely nothing special and it definitely doesn't reinvent Scooby Doo, but I found myself having fun with it. However , this did not seem like a Scooby Doo movie. It felt like they put all our favorite Scooby Doo characters in super hero movie. Before it came out my one knock on the trailer was that I didn't want Blue Falcon to be part of the movie. After watching it, the Blue Falcon and his crew did not do too much in the film and I don't know if they were needed. I did really enjoy the Mystery Gang. However for most of the first half of the movie they were separated. But when they were together it was awesome to watch. Scooby and Shaggy's relationship in the movie was very cute and I thought the writers did a good job with them. The 2nd half of the movie was definitely better than the 1st and it ended well. I would have rather this movie been more Scooby Doo...ish, if you know what I mean. Like I said I am a huge fan, so some of the crowd pleasers that were in the film I really enjoyed. This definitely wasn't as good as I hoped for, but I had a lot of fun with it. This was also my first experience with VOD and it was ok, but I would have preferred to watch this on the big screen.

There is so much time in this film devoted to Blue Falcon and Dynomutt that I can't tell if the studio forced these characters into the film, or if the writers originally wanted to make a film about them and were told to include the more popular Scooby characters. Resulting in a film more about saving the world and less about a mystery. The voice actors are also fine in their respective roles (with Zac Efron surprisingly standing out as Fred) it's hard to hate on them as they are all clearly talented individuals who are more than capable of performing these roles, but for many people and myself included Matthew Lillard, Kate Miccucci, Gregg DeLisle, and Frank Welker are these characters right now, and they've been voicing them for a long time, let them do the film. But it's Hollywood so I digress. All together there is truly nothing wrong with the film, it will entertain kids, and it will introduce them to some classic cartoons like Blue Falcon, Dick Dasterdly, and Captain Caveman all of which could make entertaining films in their own right, but I feel there was to much time devoted to them and not enough devoted to the Scooby gang themselves which should have been the focus of the film. If this Hanna Barbera Universe takes off, I'm still intrigued but, this is not the way it should be done."}, {"id": 584, "text": "The movies is an OK children's movie... it's not at all on the same level as movies such as Zootopia or Wall-E that are suited for both children and adults... This movie is purely aimed at children and most adults will find the movie obnoxious. There's also multiple times in the movie where things happen that are outside the realm of possibility, which isn't something that happens in more adult-centered animation movies like those that I mentioned above.The biggest problem that I have with this movie though, is the fact that the creators Scooby (Hanna-Barbera) didn't care about destroying over 40years worth of canon and lore with their beloved franchise, by allowing Scooby to all of a sudden be able to talk not only words, but full freeking sentences. Scooby has never been able speak in full sentences or have full conversations with humans, and yet in this movie he is able to do exactly that... it honestly shows a lack of integrity and lack of care for the franchise by a company that has grown money-hungry and disconnected from the ideals of the original creators of the character (Joe Ruby, Ken Spears and Iwao Takamoto).Overall it's a completely average animated film, aimed at children, but what's more important about the film, is that it marks the last time myself or my family will ever watch a Scooby-Doo film or series. This isn't my Scooby."}, {"id": 585, "text": "When I heard about this movie and given that I love the Scooby-Doo chracters and the dog itself, I had high expectations for this film.However, Scoob! fails at all levels and failed to reach my expectations I had.Firstly, it is the most generic kids hero movie I have wathced, it feels like its is just a following a movie blueprint, it does not do anything different or which makes it stand out from other movies.Secondly, the dialogue was aboslutely rubbish and was missing the humor and heart that many previous installements had, I don't think I laughed during this film once, that's how unfnny the movie and the dialogue is.Thirdly, although I thought it was cool to see the Scooby-Doo characters 3D animated which is the reason I watched this film, but honestly, the animation is very lazy and dissapointing considering that this was released in 2020, many CGI animation films that were released a decade or more ago (Toy Story 3, WALL-E, etc.) were better animated than this.Also, where the heck did the orignal Scooby-Doo dialogue, why isn't there any references to previous installements. I even felt like at some point that this movie does not belong in the Scooby-Doo franchise given the lack of Scooby-Doo references.Another thing, which honestly is heartbreaking when I see it, is that I truly believed that this movie had a lot potential and had the potential to be a successful movie, however it did not achieve its full potential.Also, one question that I have is What kind of a loving God would give Scooby-Doo fans a film this awful?, I mean I've questioning that since being halfway through the film.Anyways, to all of you, even children and die-hard Scooby-Doo fans, DO NOT WATCH this movie. It is awful and it fails and dissapoints at all levels."}, {"id": 586, "text": "Unlike other reviews, I'm gonna give this one a fair review.So I finished watching the new movie Scoob! from Warner Animation Group (The studio behind The Lego Movie, Storks, The Lego Batman Movie and Smallfoot) and I have some mixed feelings and a huge mixed opinion on this film. I'm gonna go through the flaws in this movie first and then I'll get to the good stuff.The FlawsFirst, there are some pop culture references, the references aren't that good, I mean the Netflix reference didn't feel right for me and some characters like Fred did not do good with their performances. I'm not saying their performances are awful, they're okay but they could've at least did better with their act and some of the humor didn't worked for me. And finally, the writing. Some of the writing of this movie is just weak when it comes to some of the way the characters act, bland pop culture references and bland comedy. I'm not being toxic to the writers,(unlike that horrible infamous YouTuber, Mr. Enter, who attacked writers in show like Spongebob or Family Guy) I'm not attacking them, but I expected better from them, I mean they've could've come up with better writing, but I also give the writers some credit.The Good StuffThis movie makes me laugh, good writing, great humor, great animation, an interesting story and a wonderful moral. The crew behind this movie did a really great job about building the cinematic universe of Hanna-Barbera into a whole new level. Some of the humor of this movie is also pretty good, the comedy gives us some great cartoony vibes just like in other Scooby-Doo show like, What's New, Scooby-Doo? or A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. They also used Dick Dastardly as the main antagonist of the film and besides, I like Dick Distardly and his performance in this film is really top-notch. They also used a few easter eggs in this movie, not the easter eggs about other movies like The Lego Movie, Storks or Smallfoot, the easter eggs from Hanna-Bareba cartoons. The animation is really amazing to look at and the rendering is cool too. Also, the moral of the movie. The moral of the movie is so fantastic and important, it tells us about friendship and friendship is one of the most important things in the world, I mean the friendship between Shaggy and Scooby really grew on me and that is a great thing.Overall, I wouldn't say that Scoob! isn't a bad film, it's not great either but I would easily call it pretty good and I can honestly give this one a pretty good (and also average rating) I give this one a 7.6/10"}, {"id": 587, "text": "This movie was made with absolutely no heart. They took everything special about Scooby and the gang, threw it in the trash, and replaced with generic, tasteless plot. Mystery Inc gang never felt like actual gang, they were seperated 90% of the movie and solved a crime only at the very beginning. The main conflict wasn't properly explained at all because of how quick writers wanted to get rid of Daphne, Velma and Fred. Best friends fought over NOTHING (that made you even think they didn't care about eachother in a first place, because we never even seen actual details about it and emotions of Mystery Inc towards it)so that friendship (of Scoob and Shaggy that took the whole movie) could save the day.The jokes were completely stupid because of how much they tried to appeal to 'modern kids' WHILE also explaining said jokes. I laughed only once, at bowling pun, but they quickly ruined it by explaining it... It's one of the first kids movies that didn't even make me chuckle.I wanted to set 2 stars for this movie only because of how good CGI was, along with character design, but the writing part completely dissapointed me...Just to be clear: I am young and grew with along with this franchise because of how much I loved it. I was very excited for this movie, but in the end it completely ruined my expectations. I am scared of what Scooby Doo franchise is going to become now.This movie is good only for little babies, age from 0 to 7, the ones that are more into flashy CGI and dorky moves rather than storywriting."}, {"id": 588, "text": "This movie is mainly living on the nostalgia behind it and I am completely okay with that. There are a ton of references to other Hannah-Barbara properties in this movies and I feel like the more you know about Hannah-Barbara the more you will enjoy this movie.I went into this movie skeptical because of the decisions about the voice cast (and scooby-doo does not have a very strong track record when it comes to feature films). I really enjoyed this movie, the animation is great and story is entertaining. It does have a feeling that it is made for kids but there is surprisingly a lot of action and adult humor that will fly over kids heads to keep adults entertained.I have three main problems with the movie. The first being the child voice acting at the beginning of the film is weak. It just sounds very cheap, fortunately there is less than 10 minutes of it and it passes quickly. The second being some of the jokes don't land, there is a clear differences in joke style when they are writing the jokes for kids vs adult. It can be adjaring but the movie is pretty fast paced so if one joke doesn't land it moves right on to the next one. The third being there is a lack of mystery to the movie, while you do see the gang investigate, you already know the answer before the rest of the gang does so there's really no who's done it factor. I can see why this choice was made, the pacing would have been very uneven if the mystery elements were included.But overall a solid movie.

Albeit the efforts might be laudable to a certain extent; the outcome unequivocally isn't!As an ardent fan of animation, I had my customary expectency going in. Having seen the Original TV Show back in my childhood; I was eager to get another nostalgic session. Instead I got a monumental setback!Keeping aside middling positives, this sort of execution didn't work at all! A pretentious nature of storytelling, with inadmissible characterization unable to generate the amount of excitement I was diligently hoping for. Though the dialogues are funny at times, especially adhering to few modern world references. They do contribute in scanty giggles but that's far away from its supposed standards! A veiled message about friendship was indeed a good touch, the writing definitely had its moments wrapped around sentiments but not ample enough!I solely blame an incongruous dubbing work for that! Except some, others seemed unfitted with their respective roles! Speaking about technicalities; everything akin had a poor showing!So to conclude, I never imagined a Scooby Doo movie to be this bad.

I even remember enjoying the live-action films, though I'm about to revisit them and see if they hold up. All that to say I'm not a Scooby super fan or anything, but I do like the world.This just felt so desperate though. I don't know if Hanna-Barbara is trying to build a cinematic universe but good lord if they are they went to the DC school of doing it. Don't establish anything, just push out a movie and jam it full with a tremendously unnecessary number of characters and hope no one notices what a mess it is. There's not even a real mystery here, just some forced separation anxiety and desperation from Shaggy. Speaking of, since when is Shaggy so wildly insecure?Regardless, there were a few chuckles to be had and I thought the animation was fun. Also, Wahlberg was surprisingly good in this, as was Jeong and Welker but Wahlberg legitimately threw me for a loop.This was just a frustrating experience. It feels like the creators were so desperate to create a universe they didn't think to make a good movie in the process, which is especially disappointing because there are glimpses of clever writing here they just get lost in the nose. I managed to catch it on HBO Max, so if you can get it there it's probably decent background noise but I wouldn't pay for it."}, {"id": 591, "text": "This film is all right. It more or less makes sense, there's nothing really terrible about it, and I didn't lose my rag while watching it. The problem is that it's an Indiana Jones plot that's been given an enema made of classic cartoon characters.I was never really a fan of Scooby Doo. I certainly saw them but the characters never really resonated with me. That's not to say they weren't good cartoons, as from what I remember they were more mature than most of the stuff at the time and the point was a sort of reverse X-files, that the characters would investigate and disprove things like hauntings and ghosts. Considering ghost stories have not been a big thing for a while (apart from the remake of Ghostbusters which was too bad to count) and the problems with disinformation and misinformation and hoaxes that are part of life today, this idea seems ripe for reinvention. Only they didn't do that and the plot has nothing to do with it, and is an Indiana Jones fantasy McGuffin collection quest race. The fans of the original show who are complaining are justified in doing so.Then, rather than featuring the characters from Scooby Doo, they pretty much disappear, to be replaced by some superhero team thing. There's a stupid superhero (and I mean, like, incompetent and intellectually disabled and unlikely to be able to function independently in normal society, and I hate it when there's a character like that in a film just to give the scriptwriters and the antagonist/protagonist an easy ride) and a token black female character and Elastidog or whatever it's called. I don't recall ever seeing any of these characters originally so can't really comment on the source material.Then there's Dick Dastardly who's been reinvented as a supervillain. The villain actually isn't bad and is one of the high points of the film, but he doesn't resemble the original motor racer with a pathological addiction to cheating either in appearance or in personality much. He looks more like the Red Max with severe curvature of the spine, and he's an evil genius/inventor who's built a small army of robot minions and a giant atmospherically unfriendly airship.All these mixed-up characters mean that none of them really get sufficient screen time for them or the relationships between them to be developed. Shaggy is a coward who loves his dog and Velma is studious/pedantic/dogmatic. Dick is evil/noble/clever. The superhero is stupid. Everyone else is nothing apart from an occasional line.Too bad. :-("}, {"id": 592, "text": "So, I used to love the Scooby Doo cartoon, movies and even loved the first live action remake (even though it was bad), so I was excited to see this.Animation was good and it definitely had its moments with some moving moments and good jokes, but at the same they they relied too much on today's pop culture references, so it will become dated quickly.With that said, the film just wasn't Scooby Doo for me. Yes we had Mystery Inc, but they were barely together as a group this movie. They had a cute moment in the beginning of the film when we got to see them meet and solve their first mystery, but when the main plot kicked in it suddenly became a space/superhero movie combined with some supernatural elements. It was overall pretty messy and uneccesary complicated for me. I wish they just elevated the ghostly/supernatural element and kept it a little scary. Nothing Scooby Doo about it."}, {"id": 593, "text": "Scoob is the latest movie out, an excuse to do something, and an excuse for a review. It's also a bad excuse of a Scooby-Doo movie. This one I was apprehensive about, but had hopes for. It could have been such a fun blend of old and new Hannah Barbera, old classic characters interacting with each other; it's own cinematic universe just begging to blossom. Such potential, such good content at our fingertips, and as I reached for it, those fingers got crushed in the windowsill. To start with the good, Dick Dastardly is an old favorite character of mine, such a fun watch, and Jason Isaacs is perfect for him. It's got a good montage in the opening that feels like a classic episode of Scooby-Doo. The addition of Blue Falcon and Dyno Mutt was a fun choice, reminding me of Space Ghost and his potential. After that, it dives into the bad and the ugly. The voice acting is lacking on all fronts, and I'm surprised they still need big name actors for this, even though the franchise hasn't used big name people since the 60s. For a full blown CGI film, some of the animation looked shockingly bad and some looked like it wasn't even finished yet. The whole thing feels feels like a clash of cultures, half of it feels like it's made by someone who's incredibly out of touch with the last 20 years of pop culture, and the other half seems too self aware of it's modern day-setting. It's stuck in some kind of time loop; rolling between a rock and hard place, failing to say anything clever or witty about things it knows. It's the embodiment of a kid from the year 2000 yelling at you in the back seat of the car about things like Netflix, but you just sit there and roll your eyes about how embarrassing it is. Everything felt so dated, like a failed direct-to-video script from 20 years ago that somehow kept all it's references and music frozen in time, so the studio hired some intern to update it. It's soundtrack is terrible, all the songs sounding like off-cut covers, just way more on-the-nose and inappropriate. Every joke felt like it was trying way too hard, and some were just downright dumb. I recall one or two which earned a smile, but didn't even deserve a full blown laugh. For being a decent length at an hour and a half, I completely zoned out for the last twenty minutes, totally uninterested in anything that was happening. The only time I felt something was for the villain, which just makes me want to see them in a spinoff of some kind. It fell right into the trap of every animated movie nowadays; drones are the bad guys and someone needs to shake their butt at a bad pop song. Please make it stop. It's got weird pacing, sudden starts and stops, pointless drama that's struggling to matter, and weird, confusing plot twists that only succeeded in making me staring at my screen in disbelief. After seeing this one, classic Scooby-Doo is the only way to go; it's still funny, still holds up and still retains the spirit of the original. Here Scoob stands, frozen in time in the snow like Captain America, begging to be thawed out to join the Avengers and Hannah Barbera in one big cinematic universe. I say we leave it on ice.

But, all the elements of Scooby and the gang are here with some surprise additions from the world of Hanna-Barbera.Our story starts with a young Shaggy and Scooby meeting for the first time and becoming instant friends ... a friendship that would later be tested in the movie.

Through the following years, they do just that until they finally reach a point where a change is obviously needed. Little did they know that a major change was soon to catch up to them that involved a sinister plot by Dick Dasterdly to open the gates to the Otherworld.

I, for one, really enjoyed this film. The animation was second-to-none, the characters strong and well voiced, the story original and engaging, and the dynamics between Shaggy and Scooby were spot on. This isn't just a reboot of the Scooby films, it is a reboot of the entire Hanna-Barbera universe.

It's indelible to get are old times back scoob and shaggy with their team mates. Their funny action noises like which it was on cartoon network its almost like watching our old TV show scooby dooby du. For funny and animated movie lovers it's a must watch"}, {"id": 597, "text": "I had nothing better to do late last night during this COVID-19 crisis, so I just checked it out simply cause I grew up watching SCOOBY-DOO cartoons. Initially before seeing the trailer, I was intrigued by this film and it's concept, but then I saw the trailer and it looked like hot garbage with decent animation appeal.This film tries so hard to appeal to modern day kids/teens. The gang tries so hard to make sure we the audience knows that they are millennials now. The big chunk of the film separates Shaggy and Scooby with the rest of the gang, so you don't ever feel the gang's dynamic until the very end.The simple concept/standard format of Mystery Incorporated solving the mystery of the day is severely missed. Not implying it should be that way all the time, but it lacks everything that makes SCOOBY-DOO what it is and what makes it work. Maybe the creators and WB had good intentions to mix it up to plan out this Hanna-Barbera Universe they're setting up, but this isn't a wheel that needs to be entirely re-invented. SCOOBY-DOO has been around for 50+ years and for some properties, you don't need to overly tinker or fix much that isn't broken.Once again, because of Marvel, the cinematic universe is a hot commodity for movie studios, superheroes are still big and this movie tries to be a superhero film with another classic Hanna-Barbera character Blue Falcon and Dynomutt leading the charge, rather than being an actual SCOOBY-DOO film that slowly exposes a larger universe. It's also as if the executives saw an episode where Scooby and the gang had a cross over with Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, took that idea and ran with it.Also two other things in mind. I cannot understand why WB decided not to bring back Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. He is the clear heir apparent to Casey Kasem (original Shaggy voice) and he's been voicing Shaggy since, I don't understand this move. Secondly I wonder just how successful this will be on VOD due to the pandemic...I'm not so sure it'll warrant enough profit to make another entry.Overall SCOOB! is more concerned on prioritizing universe building than a simple stand-alone that can be more in a larger sandbox. When will studios learn that you cannot just expect and audience wants a cinematic universe right off the bat. Look what happened to DC, Universal Monsters, and Sony's original plans for their SPIDER-MAN franchise. Take your time and look at the first IRON MAN as a blueprint on how to get going.If you want a decent SCOOBY-DOO adaptation, go watch the Cartoon Network show MYSTERY INCORPORATED that aired back in 2011-ish. That was SCOOBY-DOO done proper."}, {"id": 598, "text": "Scooby Doo, the beloved Hanna Barbera cartoon series, is one of the cartoons that I grew up with. I remember renting the DVDs of the series and movies from Blockbuster and watching them for days in the living room. It had poltergeists, mystery solving, and of course, the memorable five gang: it had everything that could keep my attention. Then I slowly forgot about it, and after nearly a decade, Scoob! comes along.Like what Marvel and DC is doing, Scoob! Is also intended to be the kick-starter to Warner Brothers' own Hannah Barbera Cinematic Universe. I was naturally worried about this, as previous attempts to imitate what Marvel successfully pulled off has been quite disappointing. On the other hand, it was the first Scooby Doo content I would see in such as long time, so for the sake of nostalgia, I gave this one a try.Though it does feature the Mystery Inc quintet, mystery solving is hardly the focus here, (apart from the first 15 minutes), and instead the gang has to team up with Blue Falcon(voiced by an uncannily dedicated Mark Wahlberg), a superhero trying to foil the evil plans of Dick Dastardly, another iconic Hanna Barbera character that even has his own show. Building a cinematic universe is fine, I get it. But having a cross-over from the very FIRST movie is already a signal of desperacy to build a cinematic universe rather than a focus on one good story.The movie itself boasts a somewhat successful transition to 3D, and has a few charms for old fans as well (such as the hommage of the opening of Scooby Doo Where Are You? , the very first Scooby Doo cartoon), but its second rate jokes and pop-culture references(though that LOTR reference did bring a grin) overshadows these efforts and still questions the mystery of creative choices made here. It gets quite kettlesome rather than funny towards the second half, eventually leading to think that more effort should have been put in character development and focused storytelling.Scoob! Does bring back nostalgia, but that's pretty much all what I can salvage from this disappointing, but unsurprisingly mediocre reboot. And it would have been great if it weren't for these meddling executive producers!"}, {"id": 599, "text": "Oh Scooby-Doo, how can anyone not know what Scooby-Doo is?, that classic Hanna-Barbara cartoon about a group of people solving mysteries with their cartoony dog, although it's made for kids, it was pretty fun and entertaining especially when I used to watch it when I was very young, I watched the original Scooby-Doo series a lot, I did watch a couple of other rebooted series of Scooby-Doo like Be Cool, Scooby Doo and What's New Scooby-Doo but not much of them, they look perfectly fine and watchable at best, but nothing can beat the classic!, but obviously as popular as the series was, there was bound to be films based on them, from the early 2000's we got the two Live-Action Scooby-Doo films which I see as more like terrible parodies then actual entertainment and I haven't seen the Direct-To-DVD movies, so I think it's about time Scooby and the gang get another reboot, but one that actually looks pretty good!, WAG (Warner Animation Group) is back once again with another animated film that is not related to the LEGO Movie, it is the third animated film with Storks first and Smallfoot second as being their own films when it has nothing to do with the LEGO Movie universe, this has more potential with a big all star cast and other characters from different Hanna-Barbara cartoons, this could work in the typical Scooby-Doo way, so unfortunately I couldn't watch it since it's available to rent in the US right now, by I had to find a way to watch it else where, so I watched the film yesterday and..... I'm pretty disappointed by it, I did sort of enjoy it, but there is more cons then pros if I'm honest, so let's talk about it.Scooby-Doo (Frank Welker) and Shaggy (Will Forte) have always been friends ever since they first met at a young age, but now their on their biggest mystery yet, along with the rest of Mystery Inc Gang Fred (Zac Efron), Daphne (Amanda Seyfried) and Velma (Gina Rodriguez), however both Shaggy and Scooby get taken by the Falcon Furry owned by the Blue Falcon (Mark Wahlberg), they have to team up with him, Dynomutt (Ken Jong) and Dee Dee Skyes (Kiersey Clemons) to defeat the villainous Dick Dastardly (Jason Isaacs), it sounds like a typical Scooby-Doo episode with a simple plot to unmask the villain, however this is like an extended episode of the series, but not in a good way, Scooby-Doo has never really been a story drive series or anything, but this clear shows how run of the mill generic it is, the story has very trope and cliche in the book you can think of, which makes the story not well written and very bland, it doesn't help that the humour relies on very modern jokes just to get a cheap laugh, like Netflix, Ikea, A Star is Born, Dabbing and Harry Potter, it makes no sense and it's not that funny, although now and a again there is a occasional funny line and joke here and there, but not much of it, the action and chase scenes are quite funny in that Scooby-Doo sort of way that I enjoyed and the heart of that film which is Scooby and Shaggy's friendship is not too badly executed, you can they have been friends for a long time and they love each other as friends, I'll also admit the first like ten minutes while flaws did start off kind of strong, I thought this was going to get better straight after that, also the third act does get better and even ends off quite nicely, however you have to go though so much filler, unfunny humour, so much predictable moments just to get to those moments, like I said, I did laugh a few things here, I like the main heart of the film and I did enjoy be opening and ending of the film, but it's not enough to make the story be even braver then Shaggy or Scooby.The animation is... good, it's clearly no LEGO Movie or Storks, but it does look good for a Scooby-Doo film, the design of the Mystery gang we all know and love actually look pretty good in 3-D animation especially Scooby-Doo and Shaggy who look close to their cartoon counterpart, Dick Dastardly looks convincing and well designed, Blue Falcon, Dynomutt and Dee Dee Skyes look nice and colourful, the backgrounds are nothing special or amazing, but it does colourful and quite beautiful, I like creative action and chase scenes, Dastardly's robots look very cool and cute, overall it's just another good looking animated film, it even has a lot of references to other Hanna-Barbara cartoons that you can spot here and there, the cartoony slapstick really works in that classic Scooby-Doo way, however as good as the animation is, it also just looks like another generic animated film, there is nothing special or spectacular about how it looks, it just doesn't stand out from any other animated film, some of the designs on other characters look a bit generic and even a bit off, the rendering is a bit stiff and not always convincing and at best, it does look like a student project more then a actual animated film, however besides those small flaws, the animation is still well done and clearly has effort, but It's just not the best looking animation I have seen, even of this year.The characters are not who I know from the classic series, with the exception of Shaggy and Scooby-Doo who while at times don't act exactly like how they should act, they are pretty close to how they act in the series, but I did actually find them convincing enough to be Shaggy and Scooby that I actually quite enjoyed them for the most part and their friendship is nice and sweet, Fred, Daphne and Velma didn't feel like the characters I know, I mean they are fine as they are but they didn't stand out as much, same can be said about Blue Falcon who is actually the most annoying unlikeable character in here, he acts like he's a know-it-all when he's really full of him, selfish and doesn't know how to do his job, which makes him the naive goofball and Dynomutt the serious one and actually funnier then Blue Falcon, Dee Dee Skyes is really just a supporting character, that's all there is to her, she's helpful I guess? but forgettable, the best character in the film hands down is Dick Dastardly, he's actually funny, entertaining and he actually has a few touching scenes that work but are just as funny as the villain himself, Captain Caveman (Tracey Morgan) is just a character purely for fan service, he's a bit funny and fun but not much else, but it can't be a Scooby-Doo film without a guest appearance, Simon Cowell himself is in this, he's pretty much being himself and it feels out of place and strange, however even if half of the characters don't stand out, what does stand out is the voice acting, everyone even if a few a sort of miscast, do a great job voicing their characters, Will Forte does a great Shaggy, Jason Isaacs is a very fitting Dick Dastardly and it sounds like he is having fun!, Mark Wahlberg and Ken Jong are pretty funny and excellent as Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, Zac Efron, Amanda Seyfried and Gina Rodriguez are pretty good as Fred, Daphne and Velma but they could of been voiced by anyone, Tracey Morgan is always fun to watch and listen to, so half of the characters are poorly written, not very funny and very forgettable, however since the rest of the characters are actually funny and memorable, along with solid voice acting, the characters are certainly what makes the mystery even bigger!.The soundtrack is vet bland, just a bunch of forgery pop songs, except for 25 Hours by PLESTED and the theme song by Beast Coast, which I do like, everything else is nothing special and just a typical list of songs, that's it, that and the score is nothing special but that was pretty decent at least.Well.... not quite the film I wanted to see, it at least it was... something... something that I have very mixed thoughts about, SCOOB! is another bland forgettable film based on a cartoon, it has every cliche and weak points that makes it even more bland, a unoriginal story with predictable outcomes, modern humour that was never funny in the first place, characters that never left a impact on me and the animation is not all that impressive, however I think it can have some good nostalgia, a couple of good references to other Hanna-Barbara cartoons, it can be funny at times with good slapstick humour and good jokes here and there, along with good animation with some enjoyable characters and great voice acting, this is probably the best Scooby-Doo and Hanna-Barbara film compared to the live-action films, but... that's not saying much..., if you love Scooby-Doo, then you might enjoy this, but don't expect anything amazing out of it, it's mainly made for very little kids which is fine for them to watch, however there are way better films to watch for the entire family then this, this is easily the weakest WAG film, this could of been so much better if they don't modernised it, a reboot is fine as long as it's done well, but clearly this wasn't the case, it's making me say Ruh Roh! more then Good job gang! then anything else.I'm afraid I'm going to give SCOOB! a 5.2/10."}, {"id": 600, "text": "Reel Tunez... The Radio Show All About the Movies... Movie Review (5/16/20): Scoob!Though I didn't see this on the big screen (due to coronavirus making this a home movie debut), I can say that at least I didn't spend a lot to see it.The trailer looked cute, and the animation decent, but this movie was cheesy! It made the original cartoon TV series look like Gone with the Wind in comparison. Though they had some very good voice talent, the story line was pretty all-over-the-place and it was weak at best. They tried to get some other Hanna Barbara characters into it (hoping to give you SOME reason to like it), but I couldn't find anything I thought anyone over about 8 years old could like.So here's the takeaway. It was apparently meant for the under 8 crowd, and parents who see this with their kids may need some serious no-doze or extra large coffee before seeing this. It's a snooze-fest!Wanna see Scooby Doo? Catch 4 or 5 episodes of the old cartoon with your kids so you BOTH can enjoy it.I give it about a 4 out of 10 stars. Had a few cute moments.. animation was decent (though not anything like a Pixar), and voice talent was very good. But nothing can fix a weak story!"}], "reviews_amount": 601}
