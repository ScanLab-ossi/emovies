A must see for the entire family in order to ensure our children understand where we are and where we could end up if we decide to not pay attention and listen to the truth."}, {"id": 3, "text": "If you love your country this is a must see. This notion that free things will fall from the sky and rain down upon our heads for generations is a lie and a dangerous one. Socialism will destroy us if Americans do not rise up and stand against it. This movie wonderfully shows the agenda to usher in this dangerous ideology, and how we can prevent it and preserve the greatest nation in the world.Also, I'm 100% convinced the ratings of 1 are people who simply didn't watch. I've seen some really bad movies get 4s and 5s. There are people rating this low to drag it down and not even watching because so many have undiagnosed TDS."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Once again, Dinesh D'Sousa puts out a thought provoking movie that displays the left's true agenda - turn the USA into the USSA.

Welcome to the USSA if he wins. #Trump2020"}, {"id": 5, "text": "Finally, a movie that doesn't base itself on disproven conspiracy theories.

And that's because everyone either gave it a 1, or a 10. Facts vs feelings. Conservatives vs Liberals, Red vs Blue. It's the same old story. And everyone has already made up their mind. Truth is, as good as this film is, it's probably not going to change anyone's mind. It holds to the old saying, if you're under 30 and don't vote Democrat, you don't have a heart. If you're over 30 and don't vote Republican, you don't have a brain. The outliers from either group are explained by the fact that some people grow up fast, some people never grow up."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Thankful to dinesh for stepping up and speaking the truth boldly in spite of attacks.

Every American who cares about their country should watch this. I found it very factual and it presents those facts not with spin but actual evidence and witness testimony."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Best documentary from Dinesh till date. Every American should watch and vote without fail. Democrats want to destroy America, time to wake up and reject career politicians."}, {"id": 11, "text": "If Dinesh D'Souza hadn't solidified his place in cinematic history--cinematic doing a lot of leg work here--as the worst documentary filmmaker of all time, this surely pushed his whatever remaining distance he needed to claim that title.I have forced myself to watch three other of D'Souza's films: Hillary's America, 2016: Obama's America, and Death of a Nation. These films relate to Trump Card by their propaganda like quality and immense failure from a filmmaking perspective, but this sets it apart by just how embarrassing it is.The film opens up with Dinesh D'Souza walking around America with the red flag of communism poorly photoshopped everywhere. Here, D'Souza makes the pitch of his film: that Trump needs to win reelection, otherwise socialism will take over America. What does D'Souza think democratic socialism is? Well, he thinks it's what democratic socialist George Orwell was warning people about when he wrote 1984.After that, we get what can only be described as fan-cam footage of Trump and then a reenactment of Trump calling D'Souza to offer him a pardon. For some reason, the voice actor for Trump sounds like a Trump impersonation from someone trying to mock him would sound like.When it finally delves into the documentary aspects of the film, just how lacking in credibility D'Souza is becomes incredibly apparent. He can't find a singular expert on anything; just a couple prominent conservative figures, some Twitter-famous conservative, his daughter, and a woman who claimed her organization True the Vote was investigated and harassed by the Obama Administration for being right-leaning (in truth, it was investigated for alleged voter suppression and fraud). The most bizarre interviewee being someone who claims to have information regarding Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar being connected to terrorists, yet instead of turning this information over to authorities he's elected to just tell Dinesh D'Souza about it.With no understanding of what he's talking about and relying on conservatives who are clearly unlearned in what they're talking about or just lying, Dinesh D'Souza has made his worst documentary to date. Possibly even the worst documentary ever made. I mean, in Death of a Nation, D'Souza at least got an actual historian to interview: D'Souza allegedly edited the clips to make the historian sound like he agreed with him, but at least it was an actual expert."}, {"id": 12, "text": "The mainstream media will do anything to stop this president.

The course of American history may be changed forever. If your a moderate, this movie is a must see. If your a conservative, this movie will confirm what you know. If your a liberal, you'll run to your safe space, waiving the race card. Dinesh plays a mean hand of political poker.

Appreciated learning some new things. Thanks to Dinesh and his family for their courage in uncovering and delivering much needed information to America."}, {"id": 17, "text": "This is nothing more than a communist-style propaganda film to glorify dear leader Donald Trump. If you love it, you will still love him when the film is over. If you hate him, it won't make you change your opinion of him (as hard as Dinesh tries to do so). Trump will definitely go down as the worst US president of all time, so I'd say this propaganda film will become a bit of a cultural artifact, sort of like the films of Leni Riefenstahl."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Dinesh covers an excellent mixture of hot button political topics backed with evidence you can easily look up and verify yourself.

The republican party has always been in support of American ideals and haven't departed from the notions that you are responsible for yourself and can do anything. The government won't hold you back.The democrats are still trying to convince people that free is an opinion and it should be easier. The fact is it is easy, as long as you are able.

But right after the movie began, my interest grew exponentially. The film did not show any bias as the director interviewed different people of different backgrounds. The film highlighted how the mainstream media shows fake news and this is one point I liked. The part about radical Islam and Biden family's dealings with China and Iraq are the major high points(my favourite scenes). I also learnt how Mr Lincoln fought to stop slavery and free African Americans despite being a Republican. That scene touched my heart personally as the same African Americans along with radical leftists broke down the statue of Mr Lincoln during BLM protest. Overall, this film is the best documentary film ever and I look forward to watching it again! Congrats Dinesh!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "Documentary?

From the acclaimed film maker who brought you Hillary's America, Obama's America, and Death of a Nation, now comes Trump Card. Mr. D'Souza explains, in plain English, how the DemocRAT Party has become Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. The DemocRAT Party is walking around dead and very few people are aware of the fact. Once the African American community deserts the DemocRAT Party, the party will crumble like a house of cards. Truly, there is very little holding the DemocRAT Party together in 2020. Their demise is just a matter of time, and Mr. D'Souza shows it in this movie. This movie is for all freedom loving true Americans.

History is repeating itself as we live and breathe. Mr. D'Souza has encapsulated the why and how as to why we are in the most troubling times in AMERICAN History. Those with less than traditional lifestyles (LGBTQ), those who are fighting to keep their constituencies voting for them (Politicians), those who are un-American in work ethic and nature (Gen Z-ers who have been given participation medals for underperformance), the Media, the religion-less many, and those who are complainants in their own unsuccessful lives (Antifa, BLM, and etc.) embrace the Democratic Party. Much like the way The Mainspring of Human Progress documented the why and how as to America is the greatest country, Trump Card is the most concise narrative of what and why is wrong with the country and many of her citizens today. Watch to understand. But, from my standpoint, this is the why and how to these troubling times.

Dinesh had great interviews in this movie. The one muslim iman said they love the left because they are so foolish and help radical islam move forward.

In it,he tries to present arguments on why Americans must vote for Donald Trump,the incumbent and incompetent President of the United States who refuses to concede for two weeks after losing the election.Too bad that the so-called Trump Card will be played by Trump to hang on to the White House despite the fact that 24 out of 24 cases (so far as of this writing) has been dismissed at different courts at different states due to LACK OF EVIDENCE of election fraud.D'Souza presents the idea the nation is headed towards the direction of socialism which the Democratic Party adheres to. This was based on the book that he wrote entitled,United States of Socialism. He asserts that the Democrats are using various means to push the country closer into becoming a socialist state. He presents arguments such as gender politics, the destruction of capitalism, and of course the present status of the media, which is well known to the average American as fake news. He points them to the villainous Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,who is known as A.O.C. , Ilhan Omar, and the likes.He also points to the direction that voting for President-elect Joe Biden or Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will put the country closer into becoming a socialist state.Let us discuss his arguments and present why they are completely false.Before we do that,one must take note of the manipulation of facts and biased interviews that D'Souza had to present his arguments.It was evident with the participation of business people like Alan Bender and right-wing advocates were there to make his case stronger.Too bad that the non-participation of political scientists makes his case a lot weaker especially with the credibility of his interviewees in great question.The first argument that was discussed was that the Democrats are placing the US to having it a socialist state. No question that the Democrats have promoted and pushed welfare system for the poor and the needy to obtain the lower class base. Senator Bernie Sanders,a self-proclaimed Socialist Democrat,made the bid for Presidency twice in 2016 and 2020.Unfortunately,he lost twice to centrist Democrats - Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. No question that socialism is not popular among Democratic Party. Besides,the top 1% rich and wealthy have strong hold of both Republicans and Democrats with the latter just providing a welfare for the poor. It is evident that the middle class does not have any representation in both parties. Added to that, one must also realize that Americans no longer have strong hold of their government for decades with manufacturing jobs being outsourced and off-shored to cheap-labor countries as the top 1% are increasing their wealth making lobby money easily affordable. Besides,they are already wealthier - the top 1% - compared to the 99% of the Americans. Although Trump did wage a trade war with China,too bad it led the US to a recession in January 2020 because of it. The corona virus pandemic only made it worse with the lockdowns and more than 30 million Americans getting unemployed.Another argument that he presents is the destruction of capitalism. No question that corporate elitists have strong hold of the politicians of both parties.Lobby money has full control of the government. In relation to his argument of fake news, one must realize that mainstream media is no longer fact-based but rather propaganda based. They are owned by corporations whether they are left-wing or right-wing. Besides, the media hides Wall Street's illegal activities, which should put an end to D'Souza's argument about the destruction of capitalism. Corporate media is the appropriate name for fake news. Even Fox News - a right-wing based network - is part of that together with numerous left-based network like MSNBC. Too bad that his argument about fake news when the focus provided towards Trump particularly his relationship with Stormy Daniels was an extremely poor argument. D'Souza tried to present a scandal that former President Obama is involved it.A sex scandal that is. Too bad that Trump has been involved in numerous sex cases way before he was involved in politics. He himself paid Daniels to keep his mouth shut during his 2016 run. In summary, news is all about profit rather than reporting facts towards the American public. Gone are the days when it is a reliable source of news.So overall,the documentary is a poor one that will only be appreciated by Republicans and hated by Democrats. But for the independent American thinker,it is not worth one's time. Evidently, the latest election result only proves that many Americans don't intend to play the Trump Card. But nevertheless, the Biden Card could probably a sequel to it."}, {"id": 101, "text": "I want to forget the content for a moment and just review this as Cinema. Of course this is not a work by FRONTLINE, or 60 MINUTES as a result there is little research into any opposing viewpoints, the only information you will receive here is the information from those espoused by the creators, so be aware that this work was not meant to be a Documentary.There is very poor editing, writing, cinematography, and was very obviously made on a shoe-string budget. In other words a serious cinematic work this is not, nor was it intended to Be. Stats by VOD Rental ( because of COVID and lack of interest by distributors, this film never made it into theaters ) show by the third week Trump Card had dropped sixth and eighth spot and falling since with a Rotten Tomato score 198/ 74 ).Perhaps the writing is the worst, quickly I become bored of the screaming at me to wake up and realize that America, our Lives, our Future are in peril, without actually telling me what that peril was!The word term Socialism is used extensively, however my mothers food subsidies, health care and social security are blatant socialism, so I was confused what the terror was supposed to be? More Unemployment Insurance, More Social Security, More Health Coverage, More Food Programs?Some have used the term Propaganda to define this work, and that is too Fascist a connotation, however Trump Card is an Info-Promo-Political-Advertisement, so the words Preaching To The Choir came to my mind. If you believe in this world view, then this Film will underscore everything you already adhere to, there is no new information here that could not be found on the net in minutes.If you do not believe in this worldview, then this Film is a fascinating ( albeit disturbing ) insight into the thought processes of people who DO believe this content. The sense of anger and fear permeates this work, and the individuals who created this material cater to this emotive content. So perhaps unintentionally this work IS a valid documentary, just not the one that the creators intended."}, {"id": 102, "text": "If you looked at the reviews, you're probably amused by most reviews being either a 1 or a 10. Neither of which indicate an aesthetic opinion but likely a political opinion. However, from a film perspective, the quality is great. But this film is about sending a message, a message about the threat of socialism. Unfortunately, that subject probably needs a part 2 to flesh out the details, but this film provides a dramatic introductory statement about the threat of socialism. And of course, Mr. D'Souza has written books on the subject if the reader cares to dig into the subject more.Quality 10 Message 9I gave the message a 9 because the subject had to be scaled down to fit in the small window of time. Of course it had to be scaled down, viewers couldn't handle a 3 hour movie. Whether you agree with D'Souza or not, there are mind-blowing revelations in this documentary that you won't want to miss. Clearly, anyone who says it's poo hasn't watched it or comprehended the message."}, {"id": 103, "text": "To say that Dinesh D Souza is an objective documentary filmmaker would be insane. He is the Republican version of Michael Moore. Whether you agree with his politics or not will determine if you like his films. Michael Moore sis alot more celebrated because he has the left wing view. His movies are entertaining and even funny but his claims hace been debunked over and over but the left loves him ao they ignore that.D' Souza gets either ignored or ridiculed. But rarely do the facts he presents get challenged. Mostnof hus claims you can verify yourself. Obviously, we are in an election year and millions will not even give this film the time of day. It is called Trump Card and it makes the case for him to get reelected but ut us more about how the media comtrols wjat peopke see as an important story and doesn't give the public the full story because of a particular narrative they want to push. That is what is scary. The media is free and should be a watch dog for everyone in power. Not just to protect who they agree with and destroy who they don't. Anyone with any sort of intellectual honesty can see the media is nowhere near objective now.This problem is bigger than Trump or any other candidate. And people who don't like him may not care that the medua and the government itself was trying to frame and sabotage him, but one day it could be done to someone they do care about.This film does preach to the choir a little too much, but it has points that should worry anyone, no matter what your politics are. You shouldn't be ok with media corruption just because you don't like someone's politics. Or ignore it because you agree with them.Grade: B-"}], "reviews_amount": 104}
