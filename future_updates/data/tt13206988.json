Vignesh Shivn's short is entertaining and has humor though it covers LGBT. GVMs part has his trademark voice over though I felt someone else could have played the father. Sudha Kongara's short set in the 80s captures brilliantly the love and hate relationship. But, the impactful one is Vetrimaran's last short with brilliant cinematography and Prakash Raj's signature acting. It covers what the whole family has to go through because of the lead lady Sai Pallavi.

It establishes the anthology's theme in the broadest and loosest sense, and this theme is honour: maanam. Among the first images we get is that of Sathaar (Kalidas Jayaram) admiring himself in a mirror. Himself is probably not the right word. Sathaar would prefer herself. She is saving up for a gender-reassignment surgery and refers to herself in the feminine, which must have been incredibly difficult to deal with in 1981, the time the film is set in. But then, with Sathaar, I suppose there wasn't exactly an option. With her swinging gait and lilting speech, she is not manly in the conventional sense - whether she wanted it or not, she was always out. And so she probably thought she might as well go all out: line her eyes with kohl, dye her lips with betel juice, and hope that her love (for a man) is reciprocated.READ THE FULL ARTICLE ON FILM COMPANION"}, {"id": 37, "text": "This one has set the bar.Paava kadhaigal wonderfully portrays todays reality.What makes this even more heartbreaking is the fact that most of these are based on true incidents and there might be so many more left unrecognised.This movie shines light on our sad reality and hopefully changes the minds of some people."}, {"id": 38, "text": "This is the mirror to show the india. This is the true events wich happened daily in india ."}, {"id": 39, "text": "There are a very few minus points in this anthology. Unlike the recent anthology in Amazon - putham puthu kaalai - which had 3 interesting and 2 totally boring episodes - this had all the 4 episodes engaging. The first one 'Thangam' is from Sudha Kongara. It has a period setting (I dont understand the need for this. Does this mean that the current situation for transgenders have changed in villages? If yes, then its good. ) We get a very good performance from Kalidas and Shantanu. It shows the feelings of transgenders and that they have a heart too. The second installment is from Vignesh sivan and it is the odd man out in this quadruple of films. Vignesh sivan has added a lot of humour to this dark story. And it works. But, 1 problem is everything is taken so easily in this short. Even Anjali's death and the fact that its her father who murdered her is taken so easily by the other Anjali and all the people over there. They all just move on as though it was just some minor toothache problem. You can enjoy this short, if you dont expect any message or ethics. Out of the 4, this is the most entertaining and has the most different approach and gives the otherwise-very-serious and horrific-anthology a slight comic relief. But, the fact that the villain gets away with all his murders so easily is something that we cant accept. There are a few other loopholes too. BTW, the GoT inspired character is interesting and funny. But, when such people are already discriminated and isolated in our society, depicting them as a negative, venomous-people-who-wont-let-others-live-happily is something that might affect them further. The final twist was nice. Third is Gowtham Menon's Vaanmagal, which has the most relevant and a much needed story for our society. That way it touches our hearts. It was surprising to see such a lower-middle-class-family story from Gowtham Menon. However, the director takes a long time to create the setting needed for the actual story to begin. That tested my patience. Also, though Gowtham was a great pair with Simran, some other actor in the place of Gowtham would have added more weight and meaning to the whole proceeding. Fourth and the 'best' of the lot is VetriMaaran's 'Oor Iravu'. It shows the ground reality as such. What leads to the terrible honour killing and the aftermath of it. Sai Pallavi and Prakash Raj were terrific. To me, the character of Sumathi looks like a selfish person who never cared to find out what happened to her family members even after she settled down safely with her boyfriend (now her husband).This is my understanding of the story **spoiler** - There is a conservative family which belongs to a casteist society. One of their daughters has fallen in love with a low caste boy and runs away with him, as thats the only way she can get to live with the love of her heart. Sumathi is now leading a rich, modern and independent lifestyle in a city and hardly cares for her family.Even after she settles down safely, she doesnt care about her sister's future or her parents lives. How her father deals with her is the rest of the story. To me, Sumathy looks like a selfish opportunist who is done with her parents because she needs nothing from them any more. Whatever she could get from them (like education and a good childhood life), she had already taken, and now, she only needs her husband. For instance, Sumathi's stoic reaction to her sister's loss of education because of her eloping away is due to guilt or is it due to her selfishness? If she had cared at all, she could have found out about the wellbeing of her family through some friend in the village (I mean, it is always possible to just find it , but still manage to keep herself hidden from her family). She had the choice. She says 'appa, I will make them study and get them married to nice men' only when it was a matter of life and death and she had to say it to save herself. Also, she doesnt show any signs of happiness on seeing her father in her apartment. So, in the last scene when she goes through that trauma, I didnt feel as much sorry for her as should have been. But, I guess this is really what the director wanted to tell us. Because we often think that the inflictor is evil and is leading a happy life after the honour killing and that the victim is a spotless, chaste, umblemished, pure person. The director here has tried to give the real picture of both the inflictor and the inflicted in an honour killing. We all know that honour killing is horrifying and evil. However, what we dont know is that, people who indulge in honour killing are not happily doing it. Even they are deeply affected. Also the victim is not a 100% pure person either. The biggest culprit here is the casteist society which needs to change."}, {"id": 40, "text": "All 4 movies are good in their own way just watch it."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Every episode will shed u tears n every tear worth it.....

It was brave to leave out the pivotal incident - just the protagonist walking toward an imminent end.Oru Iravu - a poetic slow burn of emotions - where we are taken into plot where family ties and love take a turn towards an honour killing. Honour killings are familiar to the Indian landscape. Prakash Raj plays the role of the father with both love and remorse beautifully.Vaanmagal - Was great to see Gautam Menon play a role in this segment.

While Sudha's Thangam left me shattered, read on to know what I felt about the others."}, {"id": 63, "text": "Some films leave a mark for their warmth and positivity. Some do because they make you feel terrible. Paava Kadhaigal is a film in the latter category where the purpose of each filmmaker (it's an anthology of four stories) is to evoke a sense of dread, disgust, and sadness, and they succeed in making us feel so. Honour-killing is the central thread that runs through each of the segments, but the directors add various nuances to their respective lead characters (apart from their distinct film-making styles i.e.) rendering them all unique and memorable. Family isn't the safest place for the leading ladies in Paava Kadhaigal, especially when they've decided to swim against the flow. Does that count as sin?Thangam: An excellent show by Kalidas Jayaram (playing a transgender) drives this segment. This is an actor I've grown up seeing perform miraculously as a child artist but never got to shine as an adult. In Thangam, he gets his due. Shades of that original brilliance were felt in his character Sathaar, who is detested by nearly everyone in the village except for a best friend (played by Shantanu). Apart from the honour-killing aspect, it also tackles gender and religious issues without overcooking them. It does get a little dramatic towards the end, but as in Sudha Kongara's Suriya-starrer Soorarai Pottru, the despair is wholly felt.Love Panna Uttranum: A dark comedy segment with a few Vignesh Shivan\u2122 flourishes, this one keeps things unpredictable. It may be the weirdest of the lot, but it also made me laugh (the dwarf who played the main thug is splendid!) and feel perturbed at the same time. It's likely to be viewed as weak when compared to the plot strength of the rest of the segments, but at least Vignesh was sure of what he wanted to portray. The dialogues are inventive and the quirky camerawork supplements the tone of the segment well.Vaanmagal: A Gautham Menon film is usually one where family represents the safest zone for anyone. In this segment, he tries to subvert the idea, especially with a strong showing from himself (he's doing just fine as an actor) and Simran. Yet, it didn't strike me as a believable notion, especially knowing Menon and his familial signatures. There's a musical interlude, but thankfully no voiceover narration. It gets blood-soaked towards the end and comes packed with a twist that toys with our perception - one that didn't have the same level of impact as the other episodes.Oor Iravu: As far as the theme of honour-killing goes, this one is the most conventional. And that is if you conveniently forget the massive spoiler that was shown at the beginning of Vaanmagal. Vetrimaaran's powerful storytelling and choice of frames are worthy of many a discussion. He ignores the musical interludes of the previous segments, uses musical score minimally, and plays with two timelines effectively. This is also where the agony (associated with honour-killing) is showcased in chilling detail. Prakash Raj and Sai Pallavi are both brilliant here.In totality, Paava Kadhaigal is one of the stronger anthologies to have come out in 2020. It is dark and disturbing for sure but in the hands of these talented filmmakers, the quality of work is solid."}, {"id": 64, "text": "When it comes to the topic of protecting one's own Pride,Honour and dignity ,human beings are selfish and show their true colours even though they pretend to be 'united' and 'secular'.Paava Kadhaigal tells the devastating stories of four different incidents with the same core theme of protecting one's Pride,Honor and Dignity and how these four families would go to any extent to protect them.Thangam ,the first segment directed by Sudha Kongara is a hard hitting one, the emotional story of Sathaar,a transgender played by Kalidas Jayaram will leave you devastated. Set in 1981 Coimbatore ,the period was perfect and very convincing for the story.Shanthanu does a neat job as Saravanan,all the characters were seemingly real.The direction,score,visuals,writing all were top notch.The only negative I found was that the ending was pretty disturbing and dark ,for an extremely sensitive person like me would weep in the corner crying and thinking about Sathaar .My rating for My rating-4.75/5Love Panna Uttranum, The second segment directed by Vignesh Shivan feels like a 35 minute scene taken from the middle of a movie.This is more of a dark comedy type which is not my cup of tea,but it was not too bad.The segment was entertaining in its own way.The dwarf character was really hilarious and probably the only saving element of the segment.Anjali and Kalki does a pretty decent job as a lesbian pair fighting for their father to accept them.The writing was witty and emotional in equal portions.The characters were half baked and some characters were directly inspired like the rapper Bhavani was an exact copy of Snoop Dogg.Overall it was enjoyable. My rating-3.25/5Vaanmagal,directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon.A middle class family's dilemma when their pre-teen daughter is kidnapped and physically abused by her brother's college mate,the segment then progresses on how the family reacts to the incidents and its aftermath .GVM has done a fair job in directing and portraying the emotions of a heartbroken father at the same time. Simran's performance as an orthodox Tamil mother was the main highlight of the segment along with other actors who has done their part with full dedication. Simran's character 'Mathi' tries to inculcate her values into her daughter,Your body is like a temple and you must learn to protect it is what she teaches her daughter.GVM's segment is something where I had high expectations but it slightly disappointed me especially towards the end .The score, visuals and dialogues were situational but the only negative I felt was that the tension shown in the movie was not seemingly believable and the climax was abrupt and aimless.Overall watch it for the story and performances My rating-3.75/5Oor Iravu ,directed by Vetrimaaran.The best among the four and the most 'disturbing' segment.Estranged from her family, Sumathi a now pregnant woman elopes with a man of different caste against her family's will.Her father brings her home to put up a baby shower function, the events following her arrival in her family home remains the crux of the story.Sai Pallavi and Prakash Raj has done a fabulous job in making the characters seem believable .The scenes where Sumathi gets poisoned and begs for help will really churn your stomach and make you cry.Vetrimaran - A level 999 master in his craft has molded out an intense,gut-wrenching and disturbing segment which has some incredible performances,fast paced storytelling,thrilling score and portrays a very dark side of our society .

If you take a look on banned movies in India, you'll see a lot of movies featuring LGBT content. This anthology is a voice for the voiceless. Paava Kadhaigal shows four short films that'll cover the barriers in our society.Although for my taste it was little bit too rushed, Sudha Kongara's segment Thangam was good. Especially the character Sathaar and the actor Kalidas Jayaram were a delight. After Superdeluxe finally there's another transgender character - emphasis is on character - with actual feelings, dreams and desires.Vignesh Sivan's segment Love Panna Uttranum was a little disappointing for me. It's a dark comedy. The title makes it very clear what it's about. It wasn't bad, but the direction was very unclear.Now a big surprise for me was Gautham Vasudev Menon's Vaanmagal. This was my favorite. I'm not big fan of GVM's recent movies. But finally he's back - fantastic storytelling with his characteristics, but they didn't feel forced. I had goosebumps till the end. I believe this short film about woman's safety covers aspects not everyone talks about. The whole cast and crew was great. My favorite here.And the last one Oor Iravu, directed by Vetrimaaran, was fantastic. He's known for gritty and realistic storytelling. This is a perfect example. Sai Pallavi and Prakash Raj absolutely hooked me. And only rarely you'll see such an organic character development without forced perspectives.Hats off and thank you to everyone involved. I think all of these shorts made it very clear that those who have a voice have to share their voice. Change doesn't happen without any change. So this is hopefully not only a little change for the film industry, but for the society, too."}, {"id": 66, "text": "Paava Kadhaigal is yet Netflix anthology film. This time these short films revolve around a central theme of sin and honour.The four films have four different take on this concept. Out of the four, Oor Iravu and Thangam are easily better than the other two. Prakash Raj's performance in OorIravu sets a benchmark. Whereas, Kalidas Jayaram's performance in Thangam seems promising. Technically speaking the last film stands out from the rest. The only short film which is edited, directed and performed meticulously. Otherwise every other film has some problems, specially Love Panna Uttranum (2nd short). It has an incoherent screenplay which continuously shifts tone and hence not very pleasant to follow.Similarly, every other short apart from the last one, seems exploitative of the themes they are presenting. But having said that, this film pushes the envelope of good cinema and poses genuine questions to audience.A good watch."}, {"id": 67, "text": "I'm gonna tell about 4 stories separately1. Sudha Kongara- This ep turned out to be brilliant only and only because of Kalidas Jayaram, he nailed the role of Sathaar2. Vignesh Shivan- Okay this one was not anything emotional, but it fits to the mood exactly, humour worked out at parts and the message has been received3. Gautham Menon- Never thought he would look good look and match acting levels of Simran ma'am, this story worked out well too4. Vetrimaaran- Oh man this was soo heart breaking, even though knowing what would happen at last, I simply couldn't control my tears, Prakash Raj and Sai Pallavi lived in their rolesLastly, this is the best movie of 2020. Thank you Netflix for giving us this great thing to end this year on a high note"}], "reviews_amount": 68}
