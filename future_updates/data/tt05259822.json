Instead, I got a pretentious muddle of history and fantasy given in an underlit and murky tableau that's as dull as the narrative.Ethan Hawke plays Tesla (sans accent) as if sleepwalking. But it doesn'r matter because the story has nothing to tell us anyway. We get disjointed scenes that depict this and that, some historical and some made up. They add up to not much of anything. The device of throwing in anachronistic touches (Google, cell phone, Coca Cola, etc) backfire.

If you are interested in Tesla's life better watch documentary or The Secret Life of Nikola Tesla (1980), because beside having no real plot or any entertainment value this movie is void of most of the facts we know about Tesla so it's not even a biopic.

I had zero clue what was going on this entire film. We do get to see JP Morgan play tennis with his family for some reason. In some scenes they make the painted backdrop obvious, no clue why.

Did the style and the experiment fit the content or what people wanted from the film? I think it didn't quite fit. However, it was a marvelous attempt and and the acting was phenomenal.

And what a great man Tesla was. I used to think of Edison as the man who failed 999 times and then it worked for him in the thousand time. I used to take him as an example of hardworking and success. Now I more think of him as CEO of company who just wanted to make money, he used his invention as the mean to collect more money from people instead of helping them. While on the other hand, Tesla was the one who sought for helping people and in the end the world throw him away. As to be said that greed people wins at the end.

So we saw scene where Tesla and Edison putting ice cream each on other, including face. But hey, they said clearly that it not happened really. Yeah, I'm sure that movie would be much better if they kept that line until end. At least then viewers would know what it wanted to be. As it is made, it is just a cheap mess. And incredibly shallow. There was lot of it based on enormous wide choice of sensational writings, TV show material 'about' Tesla - actually pretty much pure imagination in most cases. What poor Ethan Hawke was needed to say (after script) about wireless transmission was so deeply stoopid that even some 10 years old kid with little physics knowledge would just smile lemonish.I feel really sorry for actors, or maybe should not ?

To say that I was disappointed would indeed be an understatement. Most of the other reviews have already covered most of the errors and absurdities. I knew things were headed downhill from the start but hoped that they were just minor flaws. But when the bar scene and the apologies for the noise of Pennsylvania rendered jackhammers and electronic police car sirens I knew this one was too far gone to recover. The karaoke scene rendition of Everybody Wants To Rule The World destroyed any appreciation that I might have had for this movie. As the saying goes; Miss it if you can."}, {"id": 46, "text": "This one hovers on the bounds of watchability, and its format- as a dramatized documentary just makes it more annoying than a pure, dramatized movie, with a Plot. Most viewers'll muddle thru the ambiguous continuity, of narration, some acted scenes, with episodic, imaginative parts, to convey idiosyncratic mind of Nicola Tesla, with his ideas so ahead of our time. But Tesla's life story shares the same fallacy as that of WA Mozart that he died in poverty. He didn't (and nor did Mozart). If you're interested more in the nitty gritty of Tesla's science and government shenanigans after his death DO watch the History Channel Series on Tesla.

I was completely fascinated by the visual, sound, timeline and dimension experiments. The overall result leads you to questions reality, and conjures the notion that Tesla's brilliance my have taken him over the edge of his own stable grasp on reality even before that becomes apparent from his grandiose claims. While we watch what at first seems a history documentary, the story line becomes more and more speckled with the modern results of Teslas inventions, we back up out of alternate timelines, break through the fourth wall into today, to land back in Tesla's bed watching him sleep.

There's also a female narrator that randomly pops in to give a brief bio of other characters- once again a missed opportunity to showcase Tesla's inner-workings and mental processes.

Unfortunately, this film just blasts a bunch of various different disjointed stories together, with far too many only tangentially related to Tesla.

At first glance one would think it is just a normal biopic about what could be an interesting man's life.

It seems like halfway through production they realised this, so occasionally something funny or interesting happens, only to have the narrator say ...but that is not how it happens and they replay the same event but now dull and boring. This narrator by the way is Anne Morgan, who in the movie is Tesla's love interest, although it never is made clear if they actually had a romantic relationship, did they get married...it remains obscure, although they are seen together ever since they met somewhat awkwardly. What makes it really strange is that she, an early 1900's character, is telling the story surrounded by modern technology like desktop computers and flatscreen televisions, mentioning things like Google etc. To top off the awkward feel of the movie, Tesla suddenly burst out in a creepy karaoke version of Everybody wants to rule the world by Tears for Fears.Having learned next to nothing about Tesla from the movie, I looked up Wikipedia and found out some interesting things about Tesla.

Obviously this is beyond the grasp of many viewers.I especially loved the humour, which in some scenes made me laugh out loud (I am sure that is what Almereyda intended).Perhaps the film's haters would be happier with The Life of Alexander Graham Bell - starring the great Don Ameche! - from 1939. Gee, it gets a 6.9 rating, so it MUST be a better film! (As of today, Tesla earns a whopping 5.7)I have long ago ceased to seriously consider the ratings given in these pages, a website which proposes The Shawshank Redemption as the greatest movie ever made. But once again I must question IMDb when it allows - as per its demographic breakdown by age and gender binary - a girl of less than 18 years to give a rating of 1. Could she even understand it?

But the script (Anne's perspective) is exploring Tesla's mind and behavior as she perceived him, and the effect of JP Morgan's daughter Anne (the narrator herself) and her father on Tesla's life and Sarah Bernhardt's competing interest in Tesla. This biopic is less about science and more about how Tesla's lover assesses him after her own death. Now that absurdism may not be the average viewer's cuppa.

Most of the blame lies with the writer-director (whose name I will not even write). His script re-defines dull, even as he commits all the crimes of film biography employed by Hollywood types who think they know how to jazz up history. He barely bothers with any kind of characterisation or timeline, and the artistic license flows like sewerage, covering everything with muck and stinking to high heaven. Ethan Hawke plays Tesla in a soporific monotone that will have you nodding off within minutes.

Scenes are filmed with old photographs as static backgrounds - similar to what you might see in a stage play. Important aspect of Tesla's life are left out completely - one of his best friends, Samuel Clemens (aka Mark Twain) is completely omitted. There are two scenes that are shown, and then the narrator tells us well that never really happened and then they replay the scenes as they did occur.

In a way, I consider this quite surprising, since she's playing the daughter of Thomas Edison, an egocentric, greedy hypocrite; I'd think this role shouldn't be too hard for her, as her actual father ihas repeatedly proven himself to be a blatant fraud, who once made an empty private jet fly halfway around the world to pick up his lucky cowboy hat, all the while preaching about the environment - not to mention moving the headquarters of his band to the Netherlands to avoid paying taxes.

It is impressionistic and high design, not a literal biopic. Anachronisms are intentional, and it roots it in today's popular view of Tesla rather than a historical one.The film makes an open question of Tesla's balance of genius and madman. The mysteries of his later life are left unanswered.There have been quite a few films and documentaries about Tesla's life which were enlightening and described what he was possibly trying to achieve.

Morgan's daughter Anne, and his breakthroughs in transmitting electrical power. Also, interesting the conflict between capitalism and altruism portrayed in this film; in the sense that Tesla wanted to create a world where electricity and basic human requirements are free and accessible to everybody; but that his vision was not quite manifested due to his ignorance of economic realities. The narrator, Anne Morgan, sort of implies that she and Tesla would have made a great team - with her providing the financial backing and the economic expertise - so that Tesla would have been able to manifest his future cutting edge inventions; which had enormous altruistic and scientific potential. But regrettably this did not quite happen, as the two of them had a falling out - with Tesla slighting Anne, by making a move on the beautiful French actress Sarah Bernhardt. On that note, I think that Tesla's love interest, the French actress Sarah Bernhardt - who starred in some of the most popular French plays of the late 19th and early 20th centuries - got a bit the short end of the stick here; as she is portrayed by Anne Morgan as a femme fatale and bad influence on Tesla. Now French women contributed tremendously to the discovery of radioactivity. And they also contributed immensely to the discovery of electricity, in the sense that the beautiful Sarah Bernhardt inspired and electrified Tesla, so that he was able to make some pretty cool inventions - if this very accurate historic film is any indication of that :) This is actually also very much in line with Einstein's relativity theory, in particular the curvature of spacetime - that at the end of the day, we all electrify each other, in one way or the other :)"}, {"id": 135, "text": "Tesla ReviewAn experimental biopic about the life of Nikola Tesla, his development of the alternate current system, relationship with Thomas Edison, and Anne Morgan, J.P. Morgan's daughter.Even though I typically dislike biopics and find them uncinematic, I have long waited for a biopic about Nikola Tesla. Having read about Tesla's life through the years, his life story seemed like perfect dramatic material suitable for theatrical film and shockingly has been exploited very little in movies having only been played a few times by Hollywood actors.Director Michael Almereyda makes a bold experimental move with the film's storytelling, perhaps an attempt to break the wheel of the boring biopic formula. The film acknowledges Nikola Tesla is unsung in history for his scientific contributions and Thomas Edison is the figure of inspiration children tend to learn about in primary schools. The film features a character who is able to momentarily pause the movie, anachronistically use a laptop, look to the camera, and gives a modern commentary like a moderated university lecture.This self-reflexive narrative style along with its highly digital-looking cinematography makes the film's dramatic scenes feel like transitional re-enactment scenes out of a lifetime documentary. In certain moments, where Ethan Hawke is acting against an obviously back-projected background with a documentary-like voice-over explaining what is happened, they downright are re-enactments.As Michael Almereyda pushes on further with this chosen off-kilter aesthetic, with its modern commentary gradually becoming more abstract with more interruptions that continually pull you out of the dramatic narrative, the film plays akin to a video art piece on display in a grungy underground art gallery with an alcohol license that is populated with skinny guys with long fringes and eyes in mid-blink standing around girls with multi-colored hair hanging about. The girl then says to you, It's a great piece, isn't it? Screw Thomas Edison. And you acknowledge towards the display answering, Yeah, it is great. That darned Thomas Edison.Ethan Hawke approaches playing Nikola Tesla as how he might be like in person, downplaying the more mythic version of Tesla as a scientific wizard of electricity like David Bowie's version from Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. Hawke's Tesla is a lonely intense man of few words who does not stand out in a crowd. He lives inside his head all day and his imagination is presented as his greatest blessing and curse. The most tragic part is that he battles loneliness to serve all his ideas. Ethan Hawke's performance holds the entire film together through its free-flowing structure.The cinematography by Sean Price Williams, who previously shot Good Time, was deliberately tight on the actors' faces. Significant moments like the lighting exhibition at Chicago World Fair are glossed over. It makes one wonder if this was all an aesthetic choice or to cover up a lack of budget compared to the grand sweeping historical shots in The Current War. It is disappointing on some level.That said, I applaud Michael Almereyda's central idea. As a fan of Nikola Tesla, I am endeared by Almereyda's romantic notion and I too would have wished things would have been more fortunate for Nikola Tesla. What if Nikola Tesla had someone helping him financially? What if Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison worked together? There were hypotheticals I enjoyed entertaining along with this film.That said, I'd have a hard time recommending Tesla to anybody unless they a) love Nikola Tesla and b) love abstract art. If you do not know a thing about Nikola Tesla and you are watching this movie to learn about him firsthand, Tesla will not teach you anything, at least not directly.

The trouble comes in a few forms...firstly there's the incredibly bad lighting, it's over exposed and flat, something a student would do at film school, then it's out of focus, then there's the dull sets, huge empty walls and spaces with a few plants in plant pots to break up the space. It's hugely noticeable. Lastly the script darting between what really happened and what should have happened with a narration running through, not good, not good at all. So I think this was filmed as a favour to a bunch of students to get them some work, I hope it has the opposite effect as the script, sets, set dressing, lighting and camerawork are all well below par. And then just as you thought it couldn't get any worse, Tesla starts singing Tears for Fears...yep you read that right...!! WTF. Clarifying that it's a Student whimsy, should never have been made, just changed my rating to 1. The only thing that carries this movie is the acting but unfortunately as everything else is so bad I have given it a very low score. If you are interested in Tesla (and you should be) this is interesting but you won't know what's real and what's not so it's of no use. Read a book."}, {"id": 139, "text": "Like another reviewer said, this thing is all over the place. The inventor's portrayal is dull, depressed and uninspiring. Tesla's life was anything but these things. Unfortunately, the audience is not given a chance to learn much about the inventor and his history from this picture. It's a low budget production but it could have been a decent movie if the script wasn't such a let down. The actors play is mostly okay, though Tesla is portrayed as such a boring and uninspiring type. I am really sorry here for Ethan Hawke who played the role. His character here is clearly by design overshadowed by Eve Hewson playing Tesla's friend (love interest?). It seems life fewer and fewer directors have the guts to portray an interesting male protagonist in the current social climate. The historical Tesla was an honorable, emotional type, a genius and a man popular with women who dressed in a flamboyant manner (when he was doing well and could afford it) and must have appeared to many contemporaries to be something of a magician or a madman since he was known for making bold statements and putting on incredible displays. On top of that, his life was abound with twists of fortune. In other words, he is a perfect subject for a gripping, colourful biography. Well, you won't find it in this movie. If you want to learn something about him, you will be better off watching a Tesla documentary like the Life of Nikola Tesla or a movie called the Current War. This here is a very unfortunate attempt and the movie on some occasions completely departs from any realism of the time in order to be... artistic? Cough, cough. Tesla deserves better."}, {"id": 140, "text": "Although I admire the acting and the movie format (historical 'documentary style' movie, even a musical in the end :-), it is not accurate at all considering the real Tesla, the real Piermont Morgan (etc ...).Tesla's NYC lab was burned to the ground, and promptly after that J.P. Morgan offered him a new lab in 'isolated' Colorado Springs. Coincidence? Morgan's plan was to side track and bankrupt Tesla from the very beginning, after he and Edison lost the 'war of the currents to Tesla. And so he did.Tesla's plan to employ his 'primary' longitudinal electric waves for communication and energy distribution (conducted by the natural media, such as 'single wire', the earth mass, or the aether) was delayed for many years, until the year 1925.In 1925 Nikola Tesla got a visit from Dr. T.H. Moray's legal team in his NYC hotel room. He was shown a 'cosmic energy converter' invention by Dr. Moray of which Moray was not sure if Tesla already invented it. Moray's invention was based on a special alloy made of Germanium and other elements, in order to tune in and receive natural 'cosmic energy waves, and convert this energy into normal electricity. The invention also deployed several stages of electronic vacuum triode tubes, and it could generated 50 KWatt power. Although Tesla had not invented something similar, Moray's patent application was denied by the USA patent system anyway.This visit stimulated Tesla to initiate a second period of research, where he combined his previous inventions with 8 triode vacuum tube amplifiers. Tesla succeeded 100% to invent his own version of the natural cosmic energy converter. He demonstrated this invention to Heinrich Jebens (for instance) in the form of an electric car, powered by a cosmic wave receiver/converter in the years 1930-1932. Tesla stored all his stuf in a NYC warehouse in 1934. After his death his inventions and notes were stolen by the office of alien property custodian (part of the USA justice department).Due to big errors in the foundations of physics, Tesla's primary longitudinal electric waves (that have subluminal velocity in material media, and superluminal velocity in the aether) were actively denied and 'outlawed' by physics theory, such that we are all fossil fuel junkies until today. In our galaxy there are strong natural sources of such waves.Compared with the natural cosmic energy receivers/converters invented by Moray and Tesla, our modern technology looks pale in comparison, even smartphones. I can backup this story with many details, enough said."}, {"id": 141, "text": "I was extremely disappointed in this film. The primary fault-if one can single out a primary fault-Is the assumption of knowledge in the viewer that does not exist. Do most people know the first thing about Nikola Tesla? Is this indeed a biographical drama about the man, or an exploration of the larger issues? The conflict over adopting DC and AC (or the difference between the two)? The greater arguments about/contest between Edison and others, tte role of Gilded Age money in the outcome, of adoption of one over the other?In any event, the film fails on all accounts, and that's a crying shame. When there is widespread knowledge among the public about a subject that has been told many times, then and only then does a filmmaker have the creative freedom to leave the constrictions of the traditional linear narrative behind. Given the absence of knowledge here, the filmmakers' choice to jump between forms ad hoc deals the subject a mortal blow.I am a professional historian and *I* was often lost. I may have learned more in the two minutes of narrative at the beginning and end specific to Nikola Tesla than I learned, meaningfully, about the rest of his life and work. The filmmakers would do better to chop up portions of this film and offer it as Part of a History Channel documentary. (Seriously!! Does anyone *really care* about Sarah Bernhardt?? What does her presence in the film do to advance *any* understanding of the subject?What a cruel waste.... This does no honor to the life and achievements of Nikola Tesla."}, {"id": 142, "text": "Other than the brilliant sun you enjoyed a lighted world today I am certain. Fresh food kept so due to the miracle of ubiquitous refrigeration. Conversations and messages delivered to your personal wireless radio. And for a growing number of folks personal transportaion using electricity only. Few men's inventions have shaped our modern world like those of Nikola Tesla. The man deserves a definitive movie.Like the complex, and extremely individualistic, Tesla that definitve movie isn't this one. Nor is the multiple other documentaires...or movies. I will therefore say this particular movie captures the enigma, or cult of personality one might say, of Tesla in a unique way. It's confusing blending fiction and fact, but it dares to try to to show a side of the man which a world conspired to marginalize. As such it will undoubetedly a;so be marginalized by harsh criticism.For whatever artistic license we do get a glimpse of man consumed to a level blurring the line of singular intelligence and mental illness. That's something important.So, suffer the difficult watch of this movie. Ride it out. It gives us a special glimpse of the downward spiral of Tesla's reign Instead of criticizing Ethan Hawke's portrayal as somewhat flat, even bizarre, realize this is the film capturing more of what became the shrinking stature of the greatest inventor of the last 200-years...likely in all of recorded history. In this the movie does succeed."}, {"id": 143, "text": "Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more. Nikola Tesla Writer-director Michael Almereyda's biopic of Nikola Tesla (Ethan Hawke) is like that fusion of virtues and failings or his alternating current invention: the alternating gifts and heartbreaks are necessary for the robust life. This film attempts to show the competing forces that kept Tesla competing to change the world, and he did.As depicted here, Tesla is a quiet genius, not given to publicity or adulation but rather to the future of civilization through his AC invention and his radio coil, visions he had that came true in his lifetime spanning the 19th and 20th centuries. Besides his genius, the film depicts his ongoing competition with Thomas Edison (Kyle MacLachlan) and support from J. P. Morgan (Donnie Kreshaewarz). These challenges are the dramatic payoff for an otherwise measured exposition.The real challenge of this life was his relationship with Morgan's daughter, Anne (Eve Hewson), whose emotional support contrasts well with Tesla's introverted obsession with electricity; his romantically tentative relationship kept him from a full life, but not an unproductive one. The filmmakers balance the quiet introversion with expressionism such as process shots against outdoor scenes, and most of all Tesla's singing karaoke on roller skates.The contrast between fancy and the methodical pace of his engineering life is tough to balance out tonally, except that the singing segment does give life to an otherwise somber biopic. Introducing modern technology like the microphone and sophisticated projection serve to link the hero to his futurist dreams, which change the world forever.Nickola Tesla's influence on electricity, which my computer gobbles every hour of the day, is far grander than this biopic dares to celebrate. His influence on electric cars today, the most prominent of which bear his name, confirms the greatness this informative biopic delivers.The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine. Tesla"}, {"id": 144, "text": "I looked forward to the release of Tesla (2020), and was dismayed to see that its story wasn't going anywhere. Ethan Hawke is a terrific talent, but he was barely allowed to speak in this mess of a film.An interesting casting choice was Jim Gaffigan as George Westinghouse. His performance was surprisingly good. And Rebecca Dayan gave us a wonderful portrayal of the great Sarah Bernhardt. But the world's first international superstar performer's encounters with Mr. Tesla reveal little of Tesla's personality or his great accomplishments. His genius, his understanding of mysterious forces and his ultimate downfall are what most interest us.Tesla was a fascinating person, and was without a doubt one of the greatest minds of the Twentieth Century. Unfortunately, this film only brings us glimpses of his genius, and not just because of an inadequate budget. Throw in some cell phones as props, techno bop into the nat sound and a karaoke scene with an Eighties hit, okay? None of that helps. No amount of razzle dazzle can ever save a bad script."}, {"id": 145, "text": "What do the history books say about Nikola Tesla? I would venture a guess that most U.S. textbooks tend to sway in the direction of Thomas Edison, the father of what is now our electric system. Tesla himself an employee of Edison's revolutionized and might have ultimately changed the world with his alternating current, but due ironically, to the need for more power, his vision never came to its full potential. Director Michael Almereyda has taken his fourth-wall-breaking style and infused it with Ethan Hawkes somber performance as Tesla, in a film much like it's subject it can sometimes astound and other times perplex its viewer.The film's narrator, Anne Morgan (played by Eve Hewson) tells Teslas story in a modern format like it was being told from a college student's presentation. While alternating to the story itself, a battle between Edison and Tesla's minds as well as their monetary leverage to see which idea lasts. Kyle MacLachlan as Edison is a good balance of the innovator we've read about in books but is able to bring out the brutal capitalist side as well. It's not until Tesla is introduced to George Westinghouse (played by Jim Gaffigan) that he can understand and witness first hand the costs that come with a visionary mind. Ethan Hawke does a wonderful job toeing the line of real and surrealism, at one point singing Everybody Wants To Rule The World to another where his subtlety stands out overall.Director Micahel Almereyda is much like Tesla in his artistic choices, not cleaning up the rough parts of his film but allowing them to be as they are. You have some interesting stylistic choices that work beautifully, like using narration and fourth-wall-breaking, but then might have what could be described as lackluster green screen effects that simply look like they were outside the filmmaker's budget to have showcased. Most of the cinematography is very beautiful, his use of lighting in certain scenes involving Tesla's experiments strike like lightning. The music is also an alternating dance between contemporary to old-fashioned, which works well for the film's intention of bringing Tesla to the modern world.For myself, the issues lie in the unfinished, rough visuals of the movie. While they don't happen at an astounding rate, when they are present I was thrown out of the film and more wondering why they chose to include green screen the likes of which I've not seen since Tommy Wiseau's The Room. But like Tesla, innovation can be messy, and while this could be a standout to draw attention away from the creativity of Almereyda, I couldn't help but admire the ambitious take on America's unsung inventor.Overall I would recommend checking this out if you have a weekend free. It's not the strongest film to come out of Sundance this year, but it has the heart and performances to push it over the edge and is worth watching."}, {"id": 146, "text": "Nikola Tesla was a very unique individual, especially for his time. He was well-known by most for his revolutionary inventions and brilliance. Despite his widespread notoriety, his personal life was (and still remains) largely obscured to the public, even those closest to him. In complete contrast to his rival, Thomas Edison, Tesla didn't like the limelight. Rather, his focus was on the accomplishment itself rather than the accolades. Thereby, he chose an extremely reclusive lifestyle where he could perform experiment in solitude. Ironically, his efforts to stay out of public eye fueled public interest and earned him an enigmatic reputation.I was originally drawn to this film because I was curious which direction the film makers would go with this. Since little was known about Tesla's inner sanctum, the writers/director were, by proxy granted a fair amount of creative freedom to essentially create Tesla, even if just based on speculation.Unfortunately, the production team chose not to touch this aspect of Tesla's life. They even went as far as to actively avoid it altogether. i.e. Tesla (Hawke) never gives speaks a narrative, soliloquy, inner dialogue etc throughout the entire movie. Instead, the story is told as a biography by a peripheral character who properly functions to tell the tale but fails to entertain.The acting and production value are acceptable. The movie comes off as very slow-paced due to the matter-of-fact style employed vs a traditional narrative with a build-up, climax, and resolution.I really don't want to say that this is a 'bad' movie. It's just a shame; this had so much potential that it didn't take advantage of. IMO, this movie is best suited for those who don't know much about Tesla's professional life. While not necessarily entertaining in the traditional sense, it's hard to describe his life as anything short of interesting and worth learning."}], "reviews_amount": 147}
