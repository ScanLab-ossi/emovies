But as soon as a writer along with his physically challenged kid moves into the same house on a Halloween nite, the film became very predictable. We see the typical stuff, some same scenes over n over again, just two characters in a single location n nothing scary happens. Generous with a 4 for the effort cos this cud have been a good scary movie if they wud have added some new thing rather than the predictable stuff. U jus cant show purgatory stuff for 100 mins n expect fellas to get scared."}, {"id": 1, "text": "And I'm talking ten minutes looking at a bloody doorknob waiting for himself to open the damn door we know he's been meant to go through since the year dot. The entire script must have been made of up HOLDs. I think they thought it was arty? But any tension they managed to build up (which was very little) was lost in the hour-long breaks taken to look down a hallway or at a flippin wall. How many 'legs in the orange light under the doorway' and slack-jawed mouth-breathing darting-bug-eyed expressions can a viewer be subjected to? This question needs to be answered and communicated to the writer/director/editor/cameraman. Mind-numbingly boring and predictable."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Thin plot where nothing really happens and characters that are one dimensional. Actors are also horrible and deliver wooden performances.

Spooky, well, acted, and what a great ending! holy cow!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "'They Live Inside Us' is the debut feature from filmmaker Michael Ballif. His previous work includes the anthologies series, 'The Witching Season', which focuses on stories specific to the Halloween season. The story is dark and complex but compelling. It also has moments of reprieve with subtle comedy. Ballif painstakingly captures not only the look and spirit of Halloween so wonderfully, he uses the film to pen a love letter to the horror genre and pay tribute to many sub genres within as well. This is a strong first feature for a young filmmaker. The practical effects, stunning cinematography, and incredible set design feel much more mature than a low budget horror film. This is definitely a film to check out."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I have always loved everything that The Witching Season has produced. They're a group of extremely talented people. I am so happy to see their first feature film! I know it will be the first of many.All the actors did an incredible job! They were casted perfectly. I especially loved the little girl!

The film hits on all the right notes in all the ways horror/thriller fans will love, while maintaining a near-flawless execution of originality and tone. Ballif and Morris show all the characteristics of seasoned filmmakers here, making confident choices and trusting their material. While so many fans will speak for it, the quality of They Live Inside Us has already proven that it can speak for itself. And not to be forgotten: I laughed. A lot. It isn't a gore-y slasher film that never lets up, it's an homage and an adventure all wrapped up in one. It's easy to recommend They Live Inside Us, ESPECIALLY to fans of the genre. It's got a lot of something for everyone."}, {"id": 9, "text": "An indie horror made for Halloween lovers by Halloween lovers.

The cinematography is really amazing throughout the film, with settings that perfectly evoke that crisp fall, apples-and-pumpkins, spooky-costume excitation you had as a kid... progressing to the more adult terror of the claustrophobic caught-in-a-nightmare horror genre trope. Although the premise is novel and a bit mind bending (don't want to spoil it here), there's also a nostalgic nod to the classics - from haunted house and creepy characters, to the time-honored sheet ghost costume. The acting is really good. The clown is one of the most nightmarish I've seen. The character of the daughter is played with the spot-on preteen attitude. Although the pace does drag a bit in places, the dream-like quality definitely adds to the atmosphere and suspense. I really liked that the last scene brings the film full circle."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Wow. Once again the Witching Season team has created a wonderful cinematic story.

The fact this was based off a short segment from the Witching Season series, which I would highly implore others to check out, shows just how much of the story the filmmakers knew they could expand upon.

The acting, particularly from the main character, was so boring. Watching him try to find his words while talking to his daughter was like watching a kettle boil. The story itself had potential, but it needed a charismatic actor to carry it, and I'm sorry to say this guy just wasn't it. Not one I would grab off the shelf to watch again in a hurry."}, {"id": 19, "text": "They Live Inside Us mixes classic horror, inventive independent film-making, and Halloween asthetic into a fun, creepy film. The standard setup of a haunted house evolves into a creative plot with twists and turns that feel earned. The acting is solid throughout, and it's a showcase for young talent, especially the lead. If you like creepy movies with dark themes without the stupidity and excessive gorr common in many horror films, you will love this film."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Witching Season films always delivers when it comes to bringing Halloween to life and they do not disappoint with this film!

Various plot points are given new life and context. The narrative is fully fleshed-out, leaving room for interpretation. The visuals are a huge highlight in the film - keep a lookout for the in-universe TV programming.

You can almost feel the cool, autumn air and makes you want to go get your costume on for trick or treating. The storyline is interesting but the beginning is a bit slow.

They didn't go for cheap scares or overblown gore or pretentious cinematography. They made a straight forward indie horror that is a throwback to 80's horror (which is the best decade for horror films). The cinematography in this is great, the acting is good and the music is spectacular. The story is original and very well planned.If you are tired of the same indie horror films that have been coming out, you should definitely check out THEY LIVE INSIDE US."}, {"id": 48, "text": "I was so eager to watch this film since the original short film. Just to name A FEW of the amazing things of this film, cinematography is one that really catches my eyes. The shots are absolutely glorious, and complete Eye Candy to look at. They story is original, and makes you want more, and more. Acting from James Morris was very great, and it is not this often that you see such great acting, and production value in indie films like this- but this film really set the bar even higher. I recommend this, especially for this current Halloween season. Truly amazing."}, {"id": 49, "text": "I was so honored to get to play the role of Dani.

There are some really great creepy scenes as well as some very humorous ones. Michael Ballif's cinematography is beautiful. I really enjoyed the details and nostalgic touches throughout the film. If you like movies such as, Poltergeist (1982) and Lady in White (1988) chances are you will like this film too. I highly recommend you watch The Witching Season (2015) anthology series first if you haven't seen it already. I think the entire cast and crew did a really stellar job. This sets a high bar for Indie Horror films and is now part of my permanent collection."}, {"id": 52, "text": "Is this supposed to be a play on 1408?

With stylistic nods toward directors like James Wan and M.

I'm excited to see what they'll do next."}, {"id": 54, "text": "This movie was incredibly boring. I'm fine with movies that are slow starters to build the suspense but this movie didn't have that. The character is a writer, and if the short snippets of their stories they show are any kind of indicator, he's terrible at his job. As the movie goes on, you hope that it will get better or something.

I don't care for gore and guts, which this movie doesn't have. I like thrillers and scary stories. I like movies that have details and keep you on your toes. Endings with a twrist,but still leave you feeling like the ending makes sense. In other words, not this movie! This movie explains it's self in the end. Yet still doesn't make sense. The characters are flat ,one dimensional. Long shots of quivering lips and bug eyes. I seriously do not understand how anyone could give this movie a 10. I would have given it a 0 if possible.

The effects are authentic and unique. The story unfolds in interesting ways. The film looks amazing, and it is evident the filmmakers created their story with care and passion.I'm flabbergasted as to why so many others on IMDb have given this film such a low rating. On Amazon the reviews are much more favorable. Director Adam Robitel, of the Insidious franchise, said this about They Live Inside Us, An insidious chiller that delivers on the thrills. And Dave Parker, a director on Tales of Halloween, said, It gets under your skin, instilling a sense of fear and dread.I'm with them.

Interesting characters. Mystery. And above all, a good ghost story........that's not so.......gorey. This movie has all of that. Dripping in Halloween scenery, decor, homages and chills, They Live Inside Us is a sensory delight. It hits all of the right notes for those who love the witching season. What I love most, is that after the director passed on a very obvious moment when a predictable bone sticking through the skin shot could have been easy bait for him to take. Instead, he let the tension ride and the actors make the scene instead of relying on gore for effect. After that, I knew that I could relax and enjoy the story without fear of some overly grotesque effects filling my 80 inch screen and surround sound. I believe that a great deal of scares and story can be had without gratuitous gore. He and John Carpenter got it right, more story, more atmosphere, make for a better film. In describing this film to friends, I did use John Carpenter's Halloween as an example of the flavor of the piece. If you are looking for another seasonal classic to watch every Autumn in anticipation of our favorite holiday, THIS is for you! A really good ghost story, with great atmosphere that brings all of the tricks and treats with it. Enjoy and Happy Halloween!"}, {"id": 63, "text": "They Live Inside Us is a great little indie gem, oozing with Halloween atmosphere and terror. The scares work, the jokes work even better, and the soundtrack is phenomenal.The film's production level is definitely a cut above the average indie and it feels like the classic 80's horror films it openly pays homage to in the films anthology segments. But the story manages to remain fresh, with a few great scares and a mythology that slowly reveals itself until the last moment of the film.The movie does start fairly slow (for me the story really didn't pickup until the 17 min mark, which by all accounts is probably too long for an indie) but this is smoothed over by the fantastic cinematography and musical score. However, stick with it. From the moment the dad turns on the record player, I found myself totally pulled into the characters and the world they inhabit.It's creepy, atmospheric fun. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of Halloween, '80's horror movies, or a well told ghost story. The final twist is fantastic and haunting."}, {"id": 64, "text": "Flick from the makers of the The Witching Season web anthology takes one of those tales and expands it to feature length. The story is simple. Writer Jake (James Morris) is looking for inspiration, so he and his daughter Dani (Emily Broschinsky) stay in a haunted house on Halloween. The Booth House has a past filled with witches, madmen and murder and Jake may get more inspiration than he bargained for.They Live Inside Us is written and directed by Michael Ballif and acts as both stand alone film and an anthology film in itself, as we visualize Jake's various story ideas as he writes them. These segments are filled with Halloween imagery and many of the popular tropes, such as masked killers, living scarecrows and killer clowns (each played by lead Morris) all chasing a pretty woman (Hailey Nebeker). In between the segments, we see writer Jake slowly feeling and seeing the effects of staying in an allegedly cursed house with a terrible past. It's not quite as fun as the bits born of his writing ideas, but it certainly has it's spooky moments as the house brings Jake's tales and it's own story to life. A Halloween horror would not be complete without some spooky reveals and Baliff provides them in a chilling last act. It's moderately paced, but that suits the type of story it is. On a production level, the film looks good. Ballif has a really strong visual eye, especially for the All Hallow's Eve inspired stuff and his cinematography gives this some nice atmosphere and Halloween spirit. There is also a really cool house location and a very atmospheric score by the aptly named Randin Graves.The cast is solid. James Morris is good as Jake. He could have been livelier in a few scenes, but nails it when it counts, such as his scenes with dead wife Cynthia (Stevie Dutson). He also has fun playing all the film's Halloween creepers. Emily Broschinsky is good as Jake's precocious, paraplegic daughter Dani. The two actors have a nice chemistry together and sell being father and daughter well. Hailey Nebeker gets to show various degrees of fear as the Woman in White in Jake's stories. The actress does however, get to do a bit more once Jake's stories and the house's history collide.This movie shows a lot of love for the spooky season and of horror films in general from Michael Baliff. It's not perfect, but one can really see the labor of love put into it and Baliff's passion for all things Halloween and horror, show through. Baliff knows the tropes well and knows how to use them effectively. It's certainly worth a look and has enough spooky moments to make it a nice new flick for watching during The Witching Season. Available to rent on streaming networks such as Amazon Prime and on blu-ray."}, {"id": 65, "text": "This is a story about a writer and his physically impaired daughter who take a short stay at a house that is supposedly haunted, as the town tales go. Along the way the characters address grief and how that has affected their family situation. The film shows off a living snippet of each of the horror ideas the writer entertains (and an honest affirmation of why they just don't seem to work) while playing up the real life dread building in the house. There are some unexplained pieces to the story but that's actually a very good thing. Michael Ballif, the director and writer of this story, doesn't want to hold your hand all the way through. There are just enough questions left over to keep you talking about all of the scenarios post-film and that's the best kind of film really. As far as everything else, Ballif knows EXACTLY how to create the Halloween vibe... perfect set decoration and lighting, great score, just enough scares to keep people on the edge of their seats. Ballif was inspired by the opening credits of Halloween IV and it shows. You get numerous horror story tropes played out all within the context of the writer's work. Really this is like a smorgasbord of Halloween and Horror. If you enjoy this, I would check out The Witching Season on Blu Ray, a collection of shorts from the same Director, with the same Actor (James Morris) and a very familiar vibe. You'll even get the short film version of this feature length film and it's fun to see the genesis of these concepts.

You really feel the love for the season when watching this film. Most filmmakers don't really know how to stretch a shoe-string budget, but this guy knows how to make a film look pro. Nearly every frame could be a portrait to hang on your wall. Plus, the handful of tiny Witching Seasons easter eggs was an added fun touch if you have been following them for a while.James Morris, a Witching Seasons recurring alum, once again delivers fantastic performances. Yes, you read it right,; PERFORMANCES.. plural. Tons of them. Not only does he portray the film's troubled but ultimately very likable protagonist, he also seems to have a menacing blast taking on the role of multiple killers throughout the film. From that damn clown to Count Spookula, the guy has chops. Morris has Elijah Wood/Anton Yelchin vibes, which if you're a fan of horror, you know that's a compliment.

The movie follows a writer-suffering from writer's block-who inexplicably takes his daughter to a purportedly haunted house for inspiration. As things move on, we start to see that what he writes takes on a life of its own-in some really novel ways. The film starts with a deliberate pace but picks up a considerable amount of steam once our protagonist starts writing. Ballif envisions the author's thoughts as brief vignettes (some paying tribute to other Witching Season shorts) which break up the main action in creepy, fun, and sometimes funny ways. The real point starts to rear its head when we realize that Ballif seems to be talking about horror creators and audience goers with regards to why do we either create/connect with characters in horror films, only to have them subjected to the most awful things? There's a lot of great meta stuff going on here that left me damn impressed-especially by the film's end. Performances are strong with great work from James Morris (pulling multi-duty here, as well), Hailey Nebeker, Stevie Dust and Emily Broschinsky (who are all super-invested). Ballif isn't afraid to dig into these characters and gives them a lot of emotional space to do their thing. They Live Inside Us has to be one of the most striking horror films I've seen in a long while. It reeks of Halloween throughout, tells a twisty tale that kept me interested, features wonderful production values across the board, and gives horror fans a little bit of everything. Could we ask for more this time of year?"}, {"id": 68, "text": "I am a lifelong lover of Halloween, always looking for new Halloween media to consume. I stumbled upon Witching Season Films' Instagram account one afternoon last year, and have been obsessed ever since. The original They Live Inside Us short film became an instant favorite, and I couldn't wait to see the full length version! It most definitely did not disappoint!This movie is truly a love letter to Halloween and all that can possibly go with it. It has everything you could ask for. Oozing with atmosphere, nostalgia, and just the right amount of horror, this is a must see if you love Halloween. You can truly tell it was made by people who love the season and what they do.James Morris is truly impressive, not only in the lead role but also as the killers in each of the separate horror segments within the movie (particularly Choppy the clown!), and the iconic Count Spookula. As the lead character, Jake, he brings incredible emotion to the role, and you truly feel it when the movie reaches its conclusion.This movie deserves to be a Halloween go-to for anyone and everyone who loves the holiday. I don't want to say too much and reveal any spoilers, because I want everyone to watch this movie for themselves. But please, do yourself a favor and check this one out. It's everything a Halloween film should be!"}], "reviews_amount": 69}
