Netflix could've done their usual. Great/popular first season then cancel it immediately and create 10 low budget foreign movies and tv shows in its place.What the hell is happening in this movie? Basically the crew of an expedition to a fictional moon of Jupiter called K-23 is returning to earth and George Clooney, in the Arctic circle, is trying to warn them about the uninhabitable conditions on the surface due to some unknown apocalypse.Let me save you the immense frustration you'll inevitably feel after watching this...What happened to earth? Apocalypse...Never explained. What happened to the crew of the ship? Turned around and went back to k23...no other information. Are there survivors on earth underground? Never explained. Little girl? Doesn't exist..obvious in first 10 mins. What happened to the pilot who returned to earth to find his family? Never explained Does the crew have the resources to create a colony on k23? Never explained Why does the crew seem to have such a nonchalant attitude towards the destruction of their home and families? Never explained Why did I watch this movie? No sufficient explanation."}, {"id": 2, "text": "More focus on the arctic journey and Augustine's past &amp; relationship with Iris would have been been way more interesting than spending half the film (and I guess most of the budget) flying a spaceship through asteroid belts and hitting every possible scientific inaccuracy along the way."}, {"id": 3, "text": "It's hard to know what this movie is about or what it tried to accomplish. Most of the time you just don't have any idea of what is going on or where the story is going.After so many great movies like Interestellar, The Martian and others, it's incredible to understand why movie studios won't hire a physicist to advise them on the science portion of the movie. Very disappointing."}, {"id": 4, "text": "A struggle to sit through this tedious behemoth of a movie. Nothing really happens and you feel ripped off at the end. Visually engaging space shots. That's it."}, {"id": 5, "text": "OMG. That was so bad. Did Clooney vaguely recall stuff from Gravity and then hash it together to try make a new movie from it? The Fx were pretty good and I can see lots of money was spent but the result is unwatchable to anyone with more than primary school level of scientific knowledge (which I guess rules out the majority of the US and hence why the film make be palatable there). I mean things like a 'hidden' moon of Jupiter with a biosphere? Seriously? A radiation apocalypse that follows zero logic (even in full blown WW3 scenario radiation would not spread like shown here). Or how about smaller stuff like getting soaked in water then not freezing solid in a blizzard after. Who ever wrote this unscientific implausible sloppy lazy boring storyline should be ashamed of themselves."}, {"id": 6, "text": "So, this movie isn't perfect. Some things I liked and others bothered me. Like how the movie abruptly begins with absolutely no preamble. Normally I don't require hand-holding when movies start like this, but I seriously had to check 5 minutes in to make sure Netflix didn't start me halfway through the movie. Very annoying. Also, the fact that humans can detect planets in solar systems thousands of light years away, but we've never noticed a habitable moon around Jupiter?? Kinda dumb. I know, it's just a movie.. Also, why does the ship have rolling office chairs and IKEA shelving? Your hurtling through space a god knows how many kilometers a seconds and you can't secure things properly? The second the anti-gravity ring stops someone's getting that space helmet blown through the back of their head. And why TF did those dudes leave the ship? You family's gone, bud! By leaving your crew mates behind your decreasing their chances of survival. Just selfish. GC was good to watch, as always, and the cinematography was a treat for the eyes. This is a good movie for when your too tired to sleep and want something to enjoy a half-asleep half-awake state on the couch. Oh, and there's absolutely no rabid space monkeys in this movie, which is another good thing."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Those that say this movie didn't have a point, completely missed the point.

Enjoy it for what it is."}, {"id": 8, "text": "The movie has nice shots, but its slow pacing, nothing really happens. If you are pregnant and have to throw up many times a day does it make sense to go out for a space walk ?Big let down, 5 stars for the effort and shots."}, {"id": 9, "text": "So if you're looking for sci-fi, it's not really a sci-fi. It's a drama. A good one. I see some comments saying 'what's the point' of this story. I assure you there is a point, if you just think about it for a bit. First of all, and obviously, it's about raising awareness about ecology and future of humanity. Secondly, it's about seizing the moment, some people are right now giving away their whole lives to fight for something that other people don't even value - physicists, biologists, ecologists, etc. - people who are gaining the knowledge on how we can survive and thrive not only as individuals, but as humanity as a whole. These people who do not devote their whole life for consumption, rather devote themselves to creating and making new things, discovering new things. These are the people we should listen to and follow. While most of people rather care about hatered, looking for someone to blame for some silly material stuff that doesn't really matter. I see this movie is not really a sci-fi I was hoping to see, still it was a good watch and it provokes thoughs people need to have the sooner the better."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Words are lost for me at the moment. Midway through the movie I learned that a very close friend lost his father. The sense of loss and what might or should have been rings in my head. George Clooney encapsulated that feeling so brilliantly in this movie. I highly recommend it, but prepare yourself for that feeling of loss. It takes a special person to express it with such emotion."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Personally i read the reviews by others AFTER watching the film, and it seems like all people wanted to do was compare it to X space movie or X catastrophe movie.Sadly those people, 98% of them apparently missed the pointIts seems strange to say this, given the small amount of dialogue by him (and its not a wordy film by any means), but i probably enjoyed Clooney in this more than most of his films. He perfectly inhabits the character and his characters situation, and his pared back performance (from what you expect from yuor preconceptions of M Clooney), really is at the core of what makes the films atmosphere pervade your own senses for the entire film.I really enjoyed it...just to go against the prevailing tide, who honestly probably would have picked at anything Mr Clooney didCould there have been improvements?,maybe... but well, it's easy for armchair warriors who didnt even get it as far as it got to be critics...."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Other people have mentioned it but all of these 1 star reviews are silly. There was definitely a point and it's certainly a thoughtful movie. For those who like films that you go back and watch to pick up on things you missed the first time, I would highly recommend."}, {"id": 13, "text": "It is a movie about life and relationships set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi world. It talks about - don't waste your life; take care of the planet; love those who love you ; there's no place like home! The big question in the film is whether saving one life is worth sacrificing all. It's slow paced but it has to be to allow the viewer time to question their personal values"}, {"id": 14, "text": "First, let's start with the good things. I liked the cinematography. Some really pretty scenes. Good music, good acting, good job on the CGI.But the story?I haven't read the book, but I still found the plot way too predictable. When Augustine met Iris, I knew that she's not real. Augustine is all alone, and he needed company, in order not to lose his mind, people imagine things.The story progressed very slowly. I felt like most scenes were just fillers. 2 hours was way too long for one surprise at the end. Didn't help that Caoilinn Springall (Iris) looked so much like Felicity Jones (Sully), which already spoiled the ending for me.The usual Earth is dying plot, Maya (who never spacewalked) will die at her first walk obviously (although I expected her to fly off into the void, but a second wave of asteroids were also not too original...) Nothing really surprised me.The following movies shouldn't be compared to this one, but: 'The Martian' showed the struggle of a left alone man in a more enjoyable way, and 'Interstellar' had a much more interesting space-time story, which was not at all predictable.If you have time, watch it, but don't expect too much storywise."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Is this a slow movie? For a pop culture society immersed on watching frantic and vertiginous super hero movies, The Midnight Sky might seem slow. If you expect having fast food on a rollercoaster you will find a degustation table instead, with probably too many different flavors, most of them you will find familiar, nothing avant garde, that is true, but absolutely this is not a bad movie. Clooney is great, the spin of the story is great, special effects are great. The art and electronic devices could have had a more futuristic look, but who knows what the future will look like anyway. The only reason I'm not giving this movie a 10 is because it lacks a great soundtrack."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Has been ages since I watched a Clooney. Being a sci-fi fan, this movie ticked most my boxes. The plot, casting,everything was done right. Not as deep into the genre as I would have expected but still a wonderful film. As thought provoking as it is profound with its underlying environmental themes."}, {"id": 17, "text": "A bit slow but not that bad. Why does space exploration and apocalyptic movies have to be fast paced and action packed?Good movie."}, {"id": 18, "text": "I yearn for excellent sci-fi and am so often disappointed. Only the best creators realize the same filmmaking conventions apply with all great cinema. Here the music frequently slipped into schmaltz, as if they assumed everyone watching was on the spectrum and needed heavy emotional cues. Note to file: People on the spectrum experience intense emotions. It's expressing them that's difficult. Nice ending. Good visuals. So I guess we're repopulating the human race Kentucky style. Sorry, but I was distracted by Clooney's hair, imagining him using that Flowbee. He does play a cool old man well. But I digress. This film reminded me of Red Planet, a severe case of genre retrophase. Nice touch award: The command deck's plastic covered office chair. Clearly an homage to Destination Moon."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This is a film about humanity, hope, love and missed opportunities. Sorry no lightsabers or battles in space, no Mandalorians sorry.

The movie doesn't know what it is trying to be and therefore ends up being nothing new or interesting.I saw this in a cinema as I was hoping it would be a more immersive experience than waiting for it on Netflix.

That you are going to die is tragic, that your whole family is going to die is very tragic, but, that all life on the planet is also going to be extinguished? The characters do not demonstrate that magnitude of the drama, indeed, the characters of the spacecraft are the worst performers in this regard, too calm upon hearing the news of the extinction of life on earth, indeed, the two astronauts who returned to the planet to found a colony, without hope for the future, did not demonstrate in any moment they would leave a daughter or sons alone in a colony in space when they pass away."}, {"id": 23, "text": "As futile a tale as any you'll encounter, produced by those who clearly failed to consult Space Exploration for Dummies, sees an hallucinating arctic hobo communicating with a returning spacecraft juggernaut that can be piloted on a casual basis by whoever takes the fancy since it's composed of an impenetrable exterior surrounding zero gravitass - just like the plot of the film."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Goes on the same path as Ad Astra, Gravity : Main actor focus, bad story line. For me it was suffocating to watch. The story is just dumb.To put it in short, the whole movie can be summarised like this : One sick guy from North Pole, battling his demons, sends a message to the crew of a space ship not to come home, because the earth is dead (nuclear or some other reason).Plot holes: Why would someone want to contact a ship to tell them that the earth is destroyed...as they can clearly see this from a few million km? + no one is answering on Earth. Why would a professional astronaut (woman) get pregnant on a 2 year mission? It fails to transmit the importance of their mission.Clearly the movie gets bonus points for acting, effects, but if the story line is bad, is a no go for me...."}, {"id": 25, "text": "It's slow yes, but overall well acted and the last half is worth watching.

A perfectly good, heartfelt film, closer to Arrival (though not reaching those heights) than Star Wars or the Mandalorian.

No one punches the air or receives grateful applause at any point.

Geez, there's a few dots to connect but it hardly requires Einstein territory. Terrific cast and acting, and clearly no one minced with Clooney on the budget as it looks beautiful. Desplat does his, as usual, marvelous score. If you're looking for a 'bang 'em up' action flick this probably won't do.

Then it started to fall apart story-wise. To be clear, Clooney's performance was superb. The cinematography and editing were top notch too.But then about half-way through the story suddenly departs from Clooney's situation and moves out into space aboard the returning spaceship and doesn't even look back at Clooney for a very very long time. Was a bit jarring, almost as if a different movie had started up while you sneezed.But here's where it went especially haywire for me. Spoiler ahead.First, this movie knows *nothing* about basic science. The best sci-fi has actual sci in it. But not here. It opens with the year 2049 title card -- not only part of the name of another movie (Blade Runner), but ridiculous given it's only a little more than 25 years from now and lo-and-behold we've got space ships with people and colonies ready to settle a newly discovered moon of Jupiter that happens to be Earth-like. And mind blowing spaceships that any advanced civilization would crave. In 2049. Yeah right. Why do filmmakers do that? Treat 20 yrs into the future like we're all going to be in flying cars and on distant planets? Clearly they skipped science class in high school. And why doesn't *somebody* from the gaffer up to the numerous Executive Producers say something about that? Make them all look like fools.But then in the end, after we've seen poignantly how every crew member on the spaceship is essential to maintaining it, two of them announce they're going to get off during the slingshot around the destroyed Earth to find their dead families. Yeah, really? And take one of two space shuttles for the purpose? And leave the remaining two crew members (a third had already died) to run the ship and settle the Jupiter moon by themselves after a long return trip back? Right. And the two that stayed on the ship never once tried to argue for all to stay onboard because basically everyone's going to die if any of them leave the ship. Right. Pure nonsense. Why didn't *somebody* from the gaffer to one of the Executive Producers raise the red flag on such foolish writing?And then, stunningly, you're thrown back into flashbacks of a younger Clooney that you don't (at least I didn't) realize was a younger Clooney because they used a different actor (Spock!) that doesn't look anything like Clooney... oh my gawd, so poorly handled and only revealed in the closing credits that Spock (Ethan Peck) was playing a young Clooney character... until then I didn't even know it.And, really sadly, in the final scenes when it's obtusely and oddly revealed that the little girl Clooney's been with is really the lady on the spaceship, it's so poorly set up and explained that it becomes, in my opinion, a wasted effort altogether. What is that you say, again?! She's WHO? Uhhh... does not compute. Even if you were imagining her, it has no useful logic or ah hah moment or epiphany to it. They really blew it.So, my take is that there are two, maybe three actual movies here, rolled into one that starts well and ends in a mess. Bummer. Because I really liked where it was heading initially. And I truly enjoyed Clooney's performance despite the absurdity during the last half."}, {"id": 42, "text": "There's nothing wrong with the movie, it's pretty good.

The scenes set in space are expertly designed, and shot well by Martin Ruhe, but they feel entirely devoid of human emotion (until the final act manipulatively calls for it). There's something so sterile and antiseptic about the space half of this film that it can't maintain viewer interest or sympathy beyond a filmmaking exercise. It has no oxygen and no heartbeat. Most of the time, The Midnight Sky drifts like space debris between its three settings-shuttle, Arctic, flashbacks-instead of feeling like it's building momentum. It's like Clooney the director was so concerned about adequately conveying the details of each part of his story that he never broke down the meaning of them or the characters involved.

If you want some nice shot, it might be watchable. If you expect a plot which makes sense, avoid at all costs. Heavy (!) spoilers ahead.Just a list of inconsistencies: * Sometime around 2030(?) humans discovers an previously undiscovered (!) moon of Jupiter of a size able to hold its own atmosphere. Apparently no astronomer was involved in writing the plot. * There is an (completely unexplained) apocalypse going on on earth, which must kill people off so unexpected, that noone was able to set up a messsge to transmit until acknowledged via the Deep Space Network. This leads to the next point * Communication with space craft in 2049 is apparently via analog radio (one can hear interferences). Digital, especially text communication, which can be automated, must have been lost till then. * The space craft has extremely spacious interiors, even more than Startrek. Apparently in 2049 all problems with accelerating unecessary mass from Earth to Jupiter and back have been solved. * When about 10 days away from earth and supposedly on a trajectory to end up in an earth orbit, the space craft is still oriented with nose towards earth, engine away from earth. It appears to stay like that (as all meteors (see below) come from the front. Apparently in 2049 one no longer needs the main engine for braking. * Due to some (again unexplained) accident the space craft has to leave its current course and go into unmapped territory. Note that that is about 5 days before they reach earth. There is nothing unmapped such near to earth. * In this unmapped area there is not only one but two space opera quality meteor fields hanging around. The first one of it hits the space craft with complete surprise despite the craft featuring a radar (which the crew then sets out to repair). * Despite the crew being on a two year mission to and back from Jupiter one crew member has never trained space walking in all that time. Due they no longer do training exercises on missions? * This crew member vomits when in zero gravity while putting on the space suit. This is despite the fact that every crew member has to cross the zero gravity section of their rotating star craft (BTW missing Coriolis forces) several times a day. * Despite the vomitting, which would be highly dangerous if happening with closed helmet, the crew member goes on the space walk.Those are the ones I remember.

George Clooney plays the main character, a scientist who has devoted his life in pursuit and beleive in finding another habitable planet for human race's future survival. And along the way chose his work over his family. The story captures the character's devotion towards his field and his longing for his family, till the very end where he is terminally ill and life on earth has no hope. In an interesting and touching twist of fate, the end gives meaning to all that he has sacrificed and worked for, with his daughter taking the humanity's last hope forward. The story moves in a subtle way not being overly dramatic, however still blending amazing visuals, intensity and strong performances, specially by Clooney himself. For me somehow the subplots in space like loosing the young astronaut, space debris etc were unwanted diversions and usual tropes, which held me from getting immersed into the main characters journey, it wasn't needed.

We never find out what happened to the colony ship that was supposed to take off. We never find out if there are other people on k-23. So humanity ends with the astronauts' baby?

The acting was brilliant, especially Clooney. The story was slow, but so what. I thought it was entertaining nonetheless. I agree with another reviewer here; the Netflix generation can't handle slow burns (especially in this genre of film), it seems. If you enjoy scfi and some good acting, then this one might be worth watching."}, {"id": 145, "text": "Space exploration doesn't have to be jam packed with action.

While Clooney is excellent as an old, ill man and his interaction with the little girl is touching (also due to the acting performance of the girl), this part of the movie is, just like the part where we follow the astronauts, just not compelling enough. The movie leans too much on camerashots and atmosphere, instead of a compelling story and a good script. But on the other hand, it does manage to portray a glimpse into a not too distant future, where humanity is facing a possible extinction, due to its own faults. So... I still rate this movie a 7, because I watched it with interest and it kept me entertained throughout. And Clooney playing an old man with a beard is a pleasure to watch. He's a fantastic actor. And so is Jones and the rest of the cast.

The hot astronaut girl is not the best actress but she does look good. I watched this with some of my male friends and they think that she was hot. The story is great because you believe that this could really happen to planet earth. I know that people think that the earth is ending without people being more recycling.

As we find out in flashbacks.Meantime a spaceship is returning from a new moon of Jupiter that can support human life thus it must be new, unaware they have no home to come back to.Then the astronomer finds he has a lost child to take care of.Initially sedate rather than slow, the early scenes at the base are quite affecting, as he has to look after the child. You don't get too much of the spaceship till the final third.All characters have journeys. Some difficulties await on the way. There is a decent feeling of jeopardy as you can't be sure who will make it to the end.An eventual communication between all does all for the point of this to come through. It's all about considering your life choices and finding value, and what you could have found, when you're at the end.It does use music very well indeed to show emotion. As it should do.I did find this quite involving and affecting, and it was interesting to have a story about human drama rather than trying to stop the end of the world, which can't be changed in here.But it doesn't really end so much as stop. It did leave me wondering what happened to one character and what they would do next.So it's one of those films that has you under it's spell while it's on, but it doesn't stick for long after.Not a bad watch though.

If you have seen a lot of movies, I do understand, this movie looks more of the same. Maybe because this movie is more a kind of limping on two legs, due to the fact that it is a drama (the realtion between a father and his daughter) and added some almost unnecessary predictable (SciFi) action (where everything that could go wrong, goes wrong). That's for me do decide not to call it a great movie. But hey, I am an old dog, who has seen tons of movies. I'll guess that lack of reference, would made this movie more enjoyable!

You start the movie following solely Clooney and if you watched The American, this guy can be in a movie literally doing nothing and it hooks you.

This is an adventure film, disguised as a thoughtful affirmation that even in the face of disaster, it is the people we love who sustain us, and for whom we would make the ultimate sacrifice. Every single character in this film had family ties. Sully and Adewole who never let being in the family way prevent them from living their dream of exploring the stars (in contrast to Augustine who did not even meet or make himself known to his daughter so focused was he in his scientific work). Maya who, even in her quiet time of reading, surrounds herself with the images and sounds of her family (by blood and by heart). Contrast Augustine who seems to have cut himself off from all human relationships. Sanchez who lost a daughter and who imagined Maya and his deceased daughter growing up together as friends. He could have stayed in the ship. Yet, even he returned to earth to bring Maya home. Mitchell who seems to eat breakfast with his family during the entire two years of the mission, and for whom he willingly risked his life in the small chance they could be reunited. Contrast Augustine who was initially unwilling to take responsibility for a child and whose first action was to attempt to pass off the child to whoever is out there. When he said I'm not the right person, it's not just because he is ill and dying. He's not the right person because he has never been responsible for anybody.Looking back, we now realize that Augustine's change of heart appears to have happened after he saw the ship's manifest and recognized Sully as the daughter he never knew, and one he could potentially save. The child Iris is the image in his mind of the child as he last saw her and what kept him going to reach the weather station despite the hardship. Knowing what we know of Augustine, he probably would not have given a damn about this lone spaceship who will be returning to earth to certain death. It's not in his character to care or be heroic. He could have stayed at Barbeau and been content to wait out his final days there. But he didn't. In the end, it's his one last link to humanity, his daughter, that prompted him to act selflessly, probably for once in his life.I loved the film and its message.

Well, they threw in a few predictable tragedies on top of the main tragedy, to retain viewer interest. There could have been even more of these, but that might have sped things up too much..... Anyway, I got to the end and finally was able to put two and two together. I still feel, though, that I must have missed a lot along the way. Maybe I should try and sit through the whole thing again to better understand the first part of the movie, utilizing what I've learned from the ending.

It's a run of the mill science fiction film with a human story at the centre, with a few twists and turns.........although it does have a strange ending.Acting or story are not the main positives of this film, I would say that the directing by George Clooney is the standout part of the film. That with the great cinematography and CGI the film does look very very good. It does have a more realistic/grounded feel to it, like this could happen someday. It helps you, as an audience member, buy into the films story more and what is going on. Sometimes science fiction films like this can just now and then feel a little too far fetched, this one keeps a good balance between realism and over dramatic scenes. Thankfully the film does also have great pace to it and to be honest the 2 hours flew by for me, which was a relief due to a few reasons. So for me its more the technical side of things that are the standout in this film.Negatives. There is a weak attempt on back story for Clooney's character however none whatsoever for the space crew. I think a bit of backstory on them would have helped to gravitate towards their characters more and actually care about them. For example when one of the crew dies, I didn't care at all because I had no emotional connection to the character. Also I still don't know why the Earth was in such bad shape, I'm assuming something nuclear linked as there was a lot of radiation around. Lastly and probably the worst is The Twist which I thought was so over done and just plainly boring!!! It wasn't anything I haven't seen before and was quite obvious as the film went on. Coupled that together with the jarring ending, its as if the film just ran out of ideas and ended...........is it me or was that a really unsatisfying ending ???Overall this film is a meat and potatoes kind of science fiction film, there is nothing terrible about it but there isn't anything that good about it either. I'm being generous here I thought it was ok/average 65% out of 100. The cast is absolutely fine and does its job well, they are all good actors so I didn't expect anything else. The biggest problem for this film is there are just so many better films like this already......Interstellar, The Martian, Ad Astra etc...... I just don't see myself ever watching this again.

Why were the people leaving the Antarctic if the earth had become uninhabitable and the people elsewhere were dead and/or dying? Later in the move, more plot holes... Why did two of the crew choose to go back to an earth where virtually everyone was dead or dying and had become uninhabitable? And how on earth were the the two remaining crew members suppose to populate that new planet they were going back to? She is pregnant, yes. But even if they had more kids there would be no one for them to repopulate with outside of incest and that is, well, gross. So one day the parents will die, the kids will grow old and die and that will be that. And how are two crew members supposed to handle navigating that space ship where previously it took a crew of five? And the final straw?

Perhaps 1% of films or shows can actually claim that they succeeded at that, a captivating and good insight into human psyche. Sopranos for example.

The planet needs some fixing. But I don't like it when a filmmaker sneaks his issues in on me in the guise of a sci-fi film. You sly old devil Cloony... There's a lot of things wrong with this film and that is just the start. Haven't read the book so don't know if Cloony's vision of a movie about the effects of environment on earth mirror the author's but Cloony's name is on the film. The beginning is messy. Unclear. When a viewer spends the first half of the movie trying to figure out who's who or connected in real time vs flashback, it's a major distraction and the viewer (me at least) feels like I'm running alongside a train on the move and trying to hop on it. Well-done segues between present/past should have me on the train already. Then there's the fact that all the characters have more information than the viewer and they are being very stingy with it. In order for the viewer to become immersed in the emotional sequences we have to UNDERSTAND what's happening at least on the same level as the characters! Cloony doesn't give us enough to work with. Got to drag the info out to the very end and by then it's too late. All I see are flaws and am NOT invested in the characters. It's a very dark movie with no real hope for the people of earth. But then, that's Cloony's not so subtle message isn't it? Change our ways to protect our environment or THIS is where we're gonna end up? Got it. And did he intend for two of the important pieces of the future--two of the space crew--their return to earth knowing there is no hope to be read as a sign of our human connection to the people we love (go home and die with them) or the act of selfishness it ultimately is? Two go back to earth, one dies in space whittling a skimpy crew to start with down to 2 persons to what--start a new population on the new pseudo earth they found and return to? Two people? It would have served their ultimate sense of duty best and said more about self-sacrifice if those two who returned to earth had stayed on board and been a part of the solution and future of humanity. Are we supposed to feel sorry for Cloony's character for having misspent his life? And when he could have told his adult child he was her father, he denied her that. Oh, sure, HE got something out of knowing he was in radio communication with his daughter, but honestly he didn't deserve to have that knowledge but she did. I don't sympathize with Cloony's character. Didn't like him. The ONLY thing he apparently did right in his lifetime was find the new home for humanity but he gets no pats on the back from me. And, the baddest cliche of numerous ones (like the feel good minutes with everyone singing sweet caroline seconds before disaster and death) is Cloony's character introduced as a dying man so of course in the first minutes of the film we know he's not gonna survive. Boo hoo. There seems to be the agonizing cliche where in a book or film when a man has lost is his wife or family you can bet the bank that he's gonna give plumb his resources and find the impossible solutions then just ... die. So aside from that, the visuals were nice. Rest of the characters were nice. I'm not a techie person but that seemed like a humongous space ship for just 5 people to support. And honestly, I would have liked more information about what happened on earth to put the characters where they were in the beginning. I'm sure glad I didn't pay to rent this movie. I sure won't buy it."}, {"id": 409, "text": "The entire movie, the point of this entire depressing production, is made clear when Clooney's character speaks one line about taking care of our planet.

In the aftermath of a global catastrophe, a lone scientist in the Arctic races to contact a crew of astronauts with a warning not to return to earth.. This brief synopsis makes the movie sound like it's going to be story about a man who travels across the Arctic at the end of the world in order to warn a crew of astronauts who are returning home from a mission not to come back to earth but to instead turn back around and return to a newly discovered habitable planet in the hopes that the human race will survive through them.The movie doesn't know what it's trying to be it's basically a mash up of different genres. The first quarter of the movie is quiet and focuses on one character at the end of the world who ends up meeting a little girl who doesn't talk. Then by the half way point the movie turns into a survival thriller about a man and a little girl travelling across the Arctic fighting off wolves and surviving the cold. His trip across the Arctic takes only about twenty-five minutes making what was meant to be the whole point of the movie rushed and hardly touched upon. The third quarter of the movie takes place in space and suddenly the movie turns into Gravity by focusing on characters space walking trying to fix the spacecrafts communication array. Then in the final part of the movie it's just the characters deciding should we land on earth or go home they decide and after a very weak and pointless twist in the story the movie ends.This is meant to be a post apocalyptic movie where George Clooneys character is one of the last humans left alive on earth. The movie takes place in the Arctic and in space so we never see anywhere else on earth just snow and empty space that's it. So what ended the world you might be wondering well your guess is as good as mine because it's never explained or even touched upon once in the entire movie it's infuriating.There is very little character development throughout the entire movie by the time the credits role you know just as much about the movies characters as you did when the movie started. George Clooney is pretty much the only interesting thing about this movie he does give a great performance as a dying man at the end of the world but sadly that doesn't make the movie any better it just makes it tolerable to watch.There are some very nice looking shots of space which are again very similar to the movie Gravity but that's only for about twenty minutes of the movie the rest is just snow and cheap generic looking sets that make up the rooms in the spacecraft.I don't recommend watching this movie it's boring and uninteresting which is a shame because if it had a bigger budget and bit of script rewrite it could of been better but as is it's just enough cheap Netflix movie by a once good actor who lost his charm after Batman and Robin failed."}, {"id": 416, "text": "Omg Kill Me Already This Movie is A Complete Bore."}, {"id": 417, "text": "This movie just has too much grief; it feels like there is nothing but sadness and tragedy and for what purpose.

Stationed in the Arctic and dying of cancer, he chooses to stay behind for his last days while all others evacuate for safety during a global disaster. He is alone, except for a mute stowaway girl named Iris who becomes his charge. Meanwhile, a space mission is returning from Jupiter and all transmissions from NASA have mysteriously ceased. Augustine decides to risk his own safety and warn the astronauts not to return to Earth due to apocalyptic circumstances that have doomed their home planet. What we have here is a failure to communicate...not in the film's epic grandeur or in its ambitious vision, but in its fragmented storytelling. The two frontiers never merge seamlessly in this mediative look at life and death in our possible future, but there is still much to admire.Mr. Clooney stars and directs this saga and he does impressive work in both creative areas. Sporting a massive grey beard that David Letterman would envy, the actor gives a poignant performance as this solitary man. His story-line is by far the most compelling, but the film cross-cuts to the space mission which is rather predictable and listless in its pacing. As a director, Mr. Clooney knows how to create action and tension most effectively, and he counteracts those moments some strong poetic symbolism, aided by Alexandre Desplat's lovely melancholy score. He wisely plays down the heroics and hones in on the human drama, although his flashbacks of a younger Augustine lack credibility due to casting issues and further undercut the flow of the narrative. This is no criticism to the acting talents of Ethan Peck (grandson of Gregory)...the actor just has no physical resemblance to the easily recognizable screen persona of a younger Mr. Clooney.Mark L. Smith's screenplay tries to supply his space traveling characters with some depth, but their backstories is conventionally told and lack any element of, dare I say, gravitis. We've seen these action figures in umpteenth space odysseys battling obstacles on perilous missions. Nevertheless, the cast (Felicity Jones, David Oyelowo, Demi\u00e1n Bichir, Tiffany Boone, and Kyle Chandler) do fine work in their sketchy parts. While the outer space CGI and the absolutely stunning camerawork by Martin Ruhe, plus Jim Bissell's superb production design provide the wow factor, it's those blizzard white-outs and tundras scenes that have the emotional impact. Moviegoers get the treat of visiting these two polar opposite worlds. But though we can reach for the stars, it is the snow and ice that we prefer to endure.The Midnight Sky is an adventurous and thoughtful undertaking by Mr. Clooney and his artisans. This is a stunningly good-looking movie that would have benefited in a wide screen moviegoing experience than the smaller (and more common) streaming capabilities in this year of COVID."}, {"id": 509, "text": "It never ceases to amaze me what people will give one-star and ten-star reviews to. The Midnight Sky deserves neither.Outstanding production values boost adequate performances and a fair script featuring two distinct storylines that slowly converge, and they do so in a way that makes enough sense to be watchable. That said, odd subplots and the occasional flight of fancy lend an absurdist air to an already disturbing story.Complaints in IMDb reviews primarily target pacing and bad science. Yes, this film has a slower pace, but it's entertaining enough if your attention span can withstand more than a music video. My scientific education is in health sciences/surgery, so I'm no expert on space or the environment; however, nothing in this movie stretched me beyond my willingness to suspend disbelief.Thematically, The Midnight Sky is reflective of the dismal year that is 2020. As we suffer through quarantines, lockdowns, and legitimate worries about the viability of our immediate future, we can see ourselves easily in the characters, all of whom, at some level, experience alienation, pervasive regret, and a sense of creeping dread.As movies go, this one isn't particularly uplifting, so if a happy ending is a must for you, think about looking elsewhere. The filmmakers do offer a scintilla of hope for those who really need it to get through the night. But not really. The extinction event that determinists believe is humanity's inevitable destiny is the real ending. As the credits roll over a mundane vignette, we know our species is dead, and we're simply waiting for a few stragglers to catch up.Current events have led even the best of us to nurse the occasional defeatist sentiment, so The Midnight Sky could be a tough watch for some.

The post-apocalyptic angle interested me; there are books that have done that stupendously (e.g. A Children's Bible) but it wasn't the reason I went.Turns out the movie is about something else entirely. The post-apocalypse part is a dead loss - we have no fertile Planet B to escape to. Still, the end had me howling, for all the predictable and sometimes heavy-handed drama. At the heart of it, this story asks the question: can an absent parent be a good parent? Or even just a good-enough one? While I'm skeptical about the technological lengths Midnight Sky goes to to give its reply, I tend to agree with its conclusion. Then again, wouldn't this be exactly the type of script an absentee parent would write afterwards in self-justification, true or not? Or, for that matter, a neglected child?Our parents are who they are. We cannot change them. We can, however, try to see the good in them.

The earth is dying, due to an 'event' mostly left to the viewer's imagination, other than that Director Clooney's character, an aging astrophysicist slowly dying of cancer, hints that the 'event' is due to human fault. Maybe a nuclear war? (There is a sly reference to 1959's On the Beach in the film.) Or a global environmental catastrophe caused by societal error? While survivors are leaving Earth, Clooney stays behind to try to contact a spaceflight returning from a moon of Jupiter where astronauts have verified that life can exist, based on initial calculations made by Clooney's younger self in flashbacks from decades before (the 'young Clooney' is played by Ethan Peck, nephew of Gregory Peck--again, see On the Beach noted above.) Drama ensues as the space voyagers incur crisis on their return toward earth while 'old' Clooney (and another mysterious person) endure arctic dangers while trying to reach a transmitter powerful enough to contact the astronauts.

The world is ending... in the movie, for reasons unexplained except that they were caused by man--global warming, nuclear holocaust, or any number of cataclysms of humanity's hubris. It doesn't really matter the exact event for the purposes of the picture, with the result regardless being one of character isolation and regret. George Clooney's scientist is confined to traveling between arctic radio bases, to stay in front of the poisonous air circling the world and to communicate with astronauts secluded in outer space. A lot of quarantining inside and otherwise wearing protective equipment to avoid breathing in the dangerous outside, in other words--sounds familiar, right.Apart from that, this is another Clooney space movie, with him directing as well as starring this time, and which is unfortunately closer to the Solaris (2002) remake than it is to Gravity (2013) (I haven't seen Tomorrowland (2015) yet). It's derivatively competent, but hardly of the import that its big-budget apocalyptic and planet-hopping scenario demands. Playing with memory is promising material, and this is reflected in space by the virtual-reality programs that remind the astronauts of home and on Earth by the scientist's flashbacks. It's readily cinematic: the film-within-the-film virtual reality and the flashbacks necessitating montage. The space mission and the one on Earth further reflect each other even in the space walk and the earthbound journey through snow-swept landscapes. Remembrance and regret is also intertwined with the dying planet and, perhaps, that of the human species (at least, one presumes, without biblical levels of inbreeding). But, it's been done better before in other space-related pictures, such as, say, Arrival (2016), or the original Solaris (1972).

Our blue planet is just a brown, sulfury, smoky mess, the air is unbreathable and the cities are dead. Picture Detroit. The people are evacuating to underground shelters where they will only survive for a while. The Clooney is a enigmatic and sickly loner scientist who stays alone at an evacuated astronomical research station located somewhere (no location given) in the Arctic, Antarctica or someplace else really cold and barren. He abandoned his wife and daughter years ago to do his research. He manages to make contact with a massive space station staffed by a multicultural team of five astronauts that traveled to and found a habitable planet and is now returning to earth with no knowledge of what happened here. The new planet, named K43 or 49K or Special K or something like that, is described as just like Colorado (minus the pot shops, Mercedes G Wagons and ski resorts of course) and perfect for human life. When the astros find out about the state of earth, they have to decide on whether to keep going or book back the New Colorado. Big bearded George really says very little in this film. Most of the dialog is with the astronauts. It is a depressing film, though not quite as grim as On the Beach. There is only one really positive scene that has to do with a Neil Diamond song.

It might have a transmitter powerful enough to contact an approaching space craft returning from a distant planet that may offer hope for the survival of mankind from some sort of ghastly existential event threatening the world. The ship is manned by a crew including David Oyelowo and a pregnant Felicity Jones but their journey home is made even more perilous by being knocked off course and having to travel through uncharted space - full of dangerous meteor showers. Money has been spent; and it certainly looks good but the two stories don't really gel/relate very well; the characters are very under-developed and the plot is reminiscent of half a dozen other films of this genre where money was no object but poor writing, directing, and to be honest - acting too, wasn't part of the priority either. It's got way too many long beauty shots, spaceship shots, arctic shots - even gun shots - anything, really, to distract us from the lack of a new story.

Part science-fiction, part fever dream, this at times reminded me of Solaris, a film that told its story in much the same way.Clooney who has had an extended absence from the screen brings his trademark charisma as an aging survivor looking to desperately salvage a dire situation. Felicity Jones, Michael Oyelowo and Kyle Chandler are astronauts on the space mission that does not know what they are returning back to.

Though that doesn't make George Clooney's third film as a director any less watchable instead the only thing that's missing to make the same as Sunshine, is one; director Danny Boyle and two; well, the drama. Not that The Midnight Sky is a bad film, far from it, though it won't be to everyone's taste, it's just the film's narrative gives us quite a well structured wall, but the wall is constantly bombarded by drama that should punch you in the chops but with particularly non-descript characters, the drama fails to hit. Granted director-star Clooney does grace the film with a rather poignant performance as a terminally ill lone doctor as he advises scientists not to return to Earth in risk of death. At its best, the film is stunning to look at with its fantastic sci-fi visuals, that at a glance would be the same as Gravity (but then that film was mostly used as a stunning Earth show). But the rest of it is just slog even through the more dramatic moments which at times will have you nonchalantly shrugging off.

The physics lack accuracy (I felt the zero-gravity motion particularly sloppy). The medical issues/problems/challenges that arise throughout the film are outrageously unrealistic.

The spaceship is easily one of the best to ever make the screen.Is this sci-fi? Yes and no. It's really a human drama that uses elements of sci-fi rather than being a true sci-fi movie - although no doubt some people will find that comment unkind or inaccurate.The unfortunate aspect of the movie is the sense in which it buries the lead - this is a shame, as some real interest could have been generated (Solaris like, as someone mentioned in another review), but this tantalising aspect is under-developed and only really clarifies when it's too late to save the story. So for my money, this movie has missed out on some vital script and story development and internal critique.Maybe some key elements got left on the editing room floor, as there also appears to be a major logic flaw towards the end.

In addition, he has to find someone to care for little stowaway Iris (Caolinn Springall) because he is about ready to die from a disease and there is no place like home anymore.Director George Clooney knows his way around a camera now with impressive set pieces like a blizzard and space ship repair, his way around the story not so much. The sentimental motifs are there including loves left behind, orphaned children, and flashbacks to simpler times.Clooney as actor is commendable: he underplays a scientist who sees the end coming near and accepts his terminal fate. He quietly warms to his little ward enough to try to save her, although, because she has maybe 2 lines, it's tough for the audience to identify with her.Clooney takes another minimalist approach about our destruction of the planet with a few damning lines about what a poor job we've done taking care of it. Hysterics about the lost world are few if any-the population readily abandons Earth for a newer world.The film fumbles a plot point or two when we become slightly confused about the lineage of two players. Having little Iris absent for the last part in order to emphasize other relationships is a loss, albeit this reviewer is an admirer of the minimalist approach to storytelling.Clooney and company channel the spirit of recent Sci-Fi's like Ad Astra, Gravity, The Martian, and Interstellar.

That book, Good Morning, Midnight by Lily Brooks-Dalton shares its title with a 1939 novel by Jean Rhys and their similarities of take on the human condition should not be discounted. I strongly recommend reading the Brooks-Dalton story first because without that background much of the movie seems disjointed. In the end though, expecting little but needing some entertainment early in the morning of Dec 23rd, I attended my own private premiere of the movie on Netflix. I was pleasantly surprised, and have awarded the movie a 9 out of 10 here despite its flaws, notably in pacing and, again, that much of what is happening seems like incomprehensible vignettes unless you have more information to work with. But it is a beautiful movie with great production values, and Clooney should ultimately be commended, and recognized not only for his direction but some decent acting here too. We are in a new era of film viewership with streaming instead of sitting with a couple of hundred other people in a theatre. Movies like this one with a decent budget but more drawn out, as art house films of the 1960's and 70's were, will likely become the top tier of releases rather than the giant superhero movies we have been used to the past decade. In that way, the rise of a digital society, perhaps sequestered for periods of time during a health crisis, and often solitarily, will usher in more of these types of movies. That is not such a bad thing, and compared to the plethora of very low budget, including foreign dubbed movies to meet the demand of the burgeoning viewing platforms, an imperfect film such as Midnight Sky may even be looked back upon as this era's Citizen Kane."}, {"id": 525, "text": "Movies shouldn't leave you wondering what you watched it.

Score: 83Discussion Points: Far out this film looks and sounds gorgeous. The cinematography, sound, score, visual effects and production design are all off the charts! Clooney as a director is pretty solid here. Nothing too incompetent nor revolutionary, just solid filmmaking. His performance is gruff and rough and something I've not necessarily seen from him before. The rest of the cast does well with what their given, but that's the films biggest weakness. It's got some great themes and it really angles itself to try and ruminate on humanity, mortality and loss but it just never quite gets there. It's sadly disjointed in its narratives jumping from Clooney's bleak survival crusade to the mysterious spaceship ensembles quest through the unknown. The strongest narrative threads are the quieter moments with Clooney that are bleak and resonate but he's seemingly determined to spend more time not on himself and rather on his actors whom he elicits strong performances from. Regardless of its narrative flaws, this is still a very accessible and engaging sci-go endeavour and I frothed on it."}, {"id": 528, "text": "Production and acting are solid, that's on the plus side, on the con side: a very slow and boring story told. This of course makes the movie almost unwatchable - but if you want to dip fast into the arms of Morpheus (ancient god of sleep) The Midnight Sky might do, but in the case that you want entertainment and/or something to feed your mind, it won't work. Also the twist with the girl is obvious within a couple of minutes, you just have to use your brains. And, of course, the last survivors are a black man and a white woman (mankind will distinct anyway, how a couple should restart mankind is a mystery only the writers can answer) - in this sense I would even dare to call the movie very racist: Asian or South American people for example (like in many movies) do not play any role in this movie: a white woman and a man of African origin man must survive (like in other movies too) - why not an Asian woman and a South-American man for a change?

The earth is devastated by an extinction level event and he is one of the last remaining people on earth. His mission? To establish contact and possibly save an exploration vessel coming back to our beloved planet from a 2 year exploration trip to one of Jupiters moons.First the bad: the story isn't very spectacular. There are similar movies (like Interstellar and IO) which have the same kind of backstory cq. setting as The Midnight Sky. The end of the movie is interesting, but also not very original - it's all done before (although not in a sci-fi movie, as far as I can remember). And some of the action sequences are just nuts in terms of science.But why then, do I think it's a piece of art? Probably because it sooooo well filmed and edited! Together with the superb music and acting, the movie engulfs you in a type of tension I've not experienced in a long time. I think that is one of the main reasons why you should watch this movie.

There are two stories occurring at the same time. George Clooney and some little stowaway girl try to reach out to a space ship and warn them about Earth's mysterious apocalypse to tell them to turn around and go back to the moon of Jupiter they visited. There is also the story of that crew. Without getting into spoilers, Clooney's story line ends up being entirely pointless. Legitimately his actions cause no actual significant change in the actions of the space crew. That's cool.It's also incredibly predictable. Like I mentioned earlier, there's a spacewalk scene. You can predict how it goes just by knowing that one fact if you've ever seen any movie with a spacewalk, down to the timing of the ominous music.It also has some of the most funny cliches I've seen in some time. Two of the characters previously thought to be unrelated are actually... related??? No way. One of the characters was actually... in the imagination of another character??? Shocking.With the interesting concept, quality acting, and great effects, it could have made for a relatively compelling drama even with the predictable and cliche plot you've seen a thousand times before. My biggest issue is that certain choices made by the writers of this movie just make you go, what? why? As an example, some other reviewers mentioned that the actual cause of the apocalypse is not mentioned in the movie. Normally that would be fine, often things are scarier when left to the imagination. But it is obvious there is something released into the atmosphere that is making people sick, hell there are even shots of the Earth showing it covered in some weird yellow clouds. The issue with the exact cause not being mentioned is that you as the audience have no clue how severe it is. I thought it was literally world ending but some characters make decisions that lead me to believe it may be more of a screw with society issue than a kill everyone on earth issue. And it is so obvious the effort they put in to AVOID saying what caused it. It's not like they don't happen to mention it, it's that the screenplay does everything in its power to skirt around mentioning it.It's just things like that which make it harder for me at least to get invested in what the characters are doing and saying.

Screenwriter Mark L Smith has described his adaptation of Lily Brooks-Dalton's book, Good Morning, Midnight, as a cross between the Oscar-winning GRAVITY (2013) his own THE REVENANT (2015, nominated for 12 Oscars). It's a lofty comparison, and unfortunately, one that doesn't prove out. Two-time Oscar winner George Clooney takes on the dual role of director and lead actor, and it's his first movie role since 2016's MONEY MONSTER.Clooney plays Dr Augustine Lofthouse, a renowned scientist, and the only one staying behind as everyone else evacuates the Arctic Observatory after some unspecified event as left the earth uninhabitable. Augustine has a terminal disease (also unspecified) and evidently decides to stay behind because he likes drinking alone and self-administering blood transfusions. The drinking alone fun ends when he finds a stowaway young girl named Iris (Caiolinn Springall in her first film) and must assume the role of father-figure. To complicate matters, Iris doesn't speak.It's 2049, and the film cuts between 3 storylines. While Augustine and Iris and working on a survival plan, we get flashbacks to a time when he was a younger scientist (played by Gregory Peck grandson Ethan Peck) and sacrificing a relationship with Jean (Sophie Rundle, Peaky Blinders) to focus on his career. The third story occurs simultaneously with Augustine and Iris, and involves Aether, a manned spacecraft on a years long mission to determine if Planet K23 can be inhabited by humans. The crew is commanded by Adewole (David Oyelowo, SELMA), and includes his partner, a pregnant Sully (Felicity Jones, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING), pilot Mitchell (Kyle Chandler, Bloodline), navigator Sanchez (Demian Bichir, THE HATEFUL EIGHT), and rookie astronaut Maya (Tiffany Boone, Hunters).When Augustine learns of Aether and its route back to Earth, he takes it as his responsibility to inform them that they need a new plan. In order to do this, he and Iris must trek across the frozen Arctic tundra through a blinding snowstorm to reach the satellite equipment that will allow communication with Aether. This road trip through a whiteout allows for the best effects during the Augustine/Iris section. Aboard Aether, the crew is relatively non-descript, but there is a spacewalk segment that is quite something to watch thanks to the cinematography of Martin Ruhe. There is also a visually interesting segment featuring blood in zero gravity.So what we have is a three-piece post-apocalyptic science-fiction space survival tale with a surprise twist that won't surprise anyone. It's likely meant as a warning about how we are destroying our planet, and global catastrophe may not easily be solved through space exploration. The film presents an interesting symmetry between the vast wasteland of Arctic winter vs the vastness of space ... neither seem to have borders or boundaries, yet are fraught with dangers. If you pay much attention to the story, you'll likely be disappointed; however, if you watch for the visuals, you should be fine.

George Clooney acts and directs the movie, describing it as a mixture between The Revenant and Gravity, explaining, They're not natural fits, so it was a constant balancing act. It's based on the book Good Morning, Midnight: A Novel by Lily Brooks Dalton. The movie has nothing to do with Miley Cyrus' new song Midnight Sky.TIPS FOR PARENTS: Some profanity and an F-bomb. People in perilous situations. Kids are going to be bored. There's a scene with a lot of blood. DeathTHEMES: Terminal illness Life and death Absentee parenting Hope Family Parenting SacrificeTHINGS I LIKED: As mentioned, George Clooney directed and starred in the movie. He actually lost 30 pounds and was hospitalized for pancreatitis for this melancholy role after only filming 4 days. The talented cast also includes Felicity Jones and David Oyelowo. It's a shame that Felicity Jones and David Oyelowo didn't have that much to do considering what great actors they are. The CGI is really stunning. The cinematography is awe-inspiring and elegant. Because of the vastness of space and the scenes in the snowy landscapes, try to see it on the biggest screen you can. I thought the video game that Kyle Chandler was playing looked really fun. I've never thought he was a very compelling actor, but he actually did a great job in this film. Caoilinn Springall is adorable as Iris. The song Sweet Caroline will always add energy to a room or film. (This movie needed a dose.) The musical score created a nice background and was never overbearing, like some movies about space can be. The trailer doesn't give away any spoilers. The locations feel real and lived in. There is an interesting twist. It brings the feels in compelling ways. I read that they filmed the snowy scenes in Iceland and had to go inside every few minutes to warm up because it was soooo cold.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: The film's ideas, story, and even visuals are often borrowed from other movies and it feels like it. Because of that, the movie is a bit messy and predictable. A lot of time is spent in the beginning watching George Clooney get sick to establish his character's situation. Kids will tune out immediately. There is some jumping back and forth in time, which might confuse some viewers. As a result, the narrative feels a bit choppy. Because of the length of this movie, you feel exhausted, waiting for something to happen. If you're waiting for more information about what kick-started the apocalypse in this movie, you'll be disappointed. It's not really the point of the movie. The dialogue feels more like exposition than genuine communication. There is no bridge that transitions some scenes with other ones.

The score from Alexandre Desplat is a delight, quiet and dreamlike in the background, while Martin Ruhe's cinematography does a great job in emphasisng the isolation of Augustine in the Arctic.Coming to the performances, Clooney and his supporting cast deliver a decent standard but are let down by not much of a script to work with. It's an ambitious sci-fi film for sure but I felt it didn't quite know what it wanted to be, and it comes across that way with the performances. For a film that boasts such an impressive cast, you can't help but expect more.All in all, The Midnight Sky is a bit of a mess from George Clooney, starting quite promisingly before falling apart as a result of tonal confusion and a final act that might reach for the stars but ends up failing to launch."}, {"id": 539, "text": "Here's another space flick that George Clooney is involved with that gets all the significant technical stuff wrong. What _is_ is with actor/writer/directors that they Dunning-Kreuger their way into making crappy flicks? I don't care how much eye candy you throw at a bad script, if it's bad it's still bad.How many times must we watch flicks that have a reveal which is telegraphed from nearly the beginning of the movie? Why do we have to be dealt surprises that come out of a well-worn bag of tricks that all moviegoers have memorized? How come all flicks with paper-thin characters have the same identical feel-good sequences to fill in where real character development should be?There is a lot of good medium-specific storytelling going on in this film. I can see cinema students studying this turkey for a lot of good art and filmmaking technique. Sadly, stories are not composed of art and filmmaking.I won't bother to go into technical details nor unwrap the colossal holes in the plot. Just let's say that this attempt at setting a mood makes a futile gesture at poignancy while succeeding only in being depressing and ultimately pointless. Give it a pass."}, {"id": 540, "text": "This film has lots of potential but unfortunately the great actors and visual effects fall flat due to a terrible script/editing that feels like 2 diff stories that unfortunately do not really come together. The pseudo Revenant-like Clooney character story is all over the place and is way too long with flashback story that is full of holes and is instead of being inspiring it is rather dull and bleak. And the pseudo Gravity/ Interstellar rip off story is compelling and a vfx feast for the eyes but it feels like it's also missing lots of back story with huge holes like either the writer lost the ability to pull both stories together or it's lost in the editing room so instead it ends up feeling like small parts of 2 stories without any real appeal or cohesiveness. It should have been either one story about a mission to K23 or the other dull Clooney story which is all over the place but instead is just trite and meaningless and you truly wonder what was the real message. Clooney does a good job directing but this must have been a nightmare to edit yet kudos to his accomplishment but it's sad to see the terrible script ruin the entire experience. Spoiler - just one of many holes in the story - the mission flew all the way to K23 and back but somehow never was informed by NASA or anyone that earth is self destructing/polluted and yet the entire planet has time to prepare and go into hiding. Huh?? A 4 stars only for acting and vfx effects"}, {"id": 541, "text": "Decent story, very good acting, fantastic visuals honestly, but a number of scenes really didn't need to be so slow. We could've gotten the mood the film was going for with just 1/3 of the slow stuff, seriously.But going beyond all that, the real, deep tragedy of this film is that it highlights once again what a dead-end the American culture and imagination is at this point. All that these depressive U.S. doomers writing scripts nowadays are capable of coming up with are post-apocalyptic stories where the world keeps trying to do business (and war/politics) as usual despite all the evidence of the irreversible destruction it's causing, everything we cared about on this planet nearly or actually goes to hell, and meanwhile we're supposed to believe either in some magical technological solution popping up out of nowhere (Interstellar) or some impossible move off-planet to somehow still save our species (meaning just a few individuals with no hope of actually rebuilding the species). The only glimmer of hope in this climate comes from China - even their sci-fi is about global cooperation, not competition; collectivist thinking and efforts, not rabid capitalist individualism (see The Wandering Earth). If we're going to survive this century it will be through massively ambitious Chinese style constructive solutions. All the U.S. has for us now are visions of doom and destruction."}, {"id": 542, "text": "Most of what I will discuss here can be glanced in the trailer. The story of 'The Midnight Sky' revolves around a space exploration vessel returning to earth in the year 2049 after visiting a newly discovered 'habitable' and earth like moon of Jupiter. Scientifically speaking that is a major stretch on a number of levels, but that is only the start of the credulity stretching. But as it is a central plank of this drama, and 'The Midnight Sky' is more a space opera/ drama than a solid addition to the science fiction genre.The back drop of this mission is that the ship is returning to an Earth ravaged and doomed by an unspecified plague of some sort. Given what is happening currently in 2020 the plague is at least interesting. But that in itself is not near enough to rescue this film.For some reason the ship's crew did not expect to be able to contact earth when there were at Jupiter, which is odd as Jupiter is not that far away. So this device is used to establish the fact they are returning, rather unconcerned, blind, to a planet that is doomed. Contrivances like this in the film make it hard to watch, and statistically most of the audience are smarter than this film is.The acting is passable, but only because the script itself was fairly wooden. George Clooney is watchable as ever, I liked his performance and his dedication to sci-fi. But his talent is wasted in a project he had a large hand in brining to the screen.'The Midnight Sky' delivers a predictable ending though there is a slight twist. But this delivers a moment of 'oh' rather an a satisfying 'ah'.The sets and visual effects are excellent, which is the only reason I give it any stars at all. But I wondered why the movie surrounded its fairly accurate space physics with action the events that would look more at home in Star Wars. In this films' version of the future astronomers are obviously blind by profession, as aside from an undiscovered utopian moon around Jupiter they also missed flocks of icy asteroids in 'unexplored regions' of near Earth space. 'The Midnight Sky' may as well have went the whole hog and had sounds effects in the vacuum too.All of this might be excusable if the film delivered engaging drama, but as it does not one has to wonder why it was made at all. Science fiction requires some suspension of disbelief to work. But it cannot work as either science fiction of drama if the abandonment of common sense is also a requirement; which it is. I wanted this film to succeed, I really did, but I am sad that it failed on so many levels. With a currently captive audience, starved of new releases, 'The Midnight Sky' is a major missed opportunity."}, {"id": 543, "text": "With some movies you regret watching them. Some movies you can imagine or even you know you will watch them again some day.This is in the middle. The visuals are great, especially the space ship. Looks probably a bit to much designed then realistic but it is ok. It is not nuts.At all looks great. No fast moving cuts, nearly no confusing time jumps. It is lineair.But with that I have used all the positive things I can say about it.The story is more a concept then a story. A big reveal at then end about one of the characters is not original and I suspected it and I was correct.It just does not make a lot of sense. You are left with a lot of questions and not in a good way."}, {"id": 544, "text": "* There is no end credit scene *The director George Clooney and crew brought a bland emotionless adaptation. The story sets when a scientist races to contact a crew of astronauts to stop them from returning due to a global catastrophe on Earth. I didn't have any expectations, I really wanted to enjoy this film as it is but it lacked feeling. The main theme was to never let your goal or ambition get in the way of having a life but it was projected very weakly. The storyline was vaguely similar to Interstellar (2014) but it can never be compared to or even be on the same level, far from it because the film Interstellar is a masterpiece and The Midnight Sky was the complete opposite. I like dramas, I also like any kind of structured pace and there are a lot of great films with a slow pace but this storyline was flat. There was no suspense and I blame the music for not properly establishing it. The ending was expected due to the foreshadow which can be caught so early in the movie. The only thing I liked was the beautiful visuals so mesmerizing I was in awe but it doesn't save the film.The composer Alexandre Desplat was all over the place, the music didn't fit with this kind of movie and it was making the scenes so annoying. I think if the music was different it could have changed the perspective of the film because the music is the most important part of a movie without it there is no emotion. This composer has many great scores but sadly he failed in this one.The cast was solid every single one of them the problem was not their performance it was the direction, the script, and the music. George Clooney was not only the director he was also the main actor and he was in great space films like Solaris (2002) and Gravity (2013). Both of those movies are magnificent but The Midnight Sky was not a good film."}, {"id": 545, "text": "The movie begins well, then after, the typical scenario of cruel unpredictable events prevails, probably, in order to make the movie enjoyable to that bunch of trivial audience. In my opinion, the mistake has been to adapt the movie in survival purpose for entertaining, so the viewer is forced to assist to a sequence of unpredictable negative events programmed by the storytelling. Is it possible that from the first contact to the last one there are just oppositive facts forcing to survive? It's unreal when the ratio between cause and aftermath lacks. As example, Aliens is an action movie where every negaive event has a precise cause. This happen why. The unpredictable event has no precise cause, so when many of them happen, a story risks to be trivial. The excellent choice to make the dialogues among the characters more mature above all in scientific terms, so to give more realism to the narration, inevitably contrasts with the randomness of adverse events which happen continuously both in space and in earth scenario. The message of the movie is the value of family affections so to try to make better the world in which to live."}, {"id": 546, "text": "Once you attain a pinacle with a handful of Sci-Fi movies, like Interstellar and few others it is a serious task to match, but even more difficult to surpass. No smart dialogues No smart acting, when you think of it. Clooney is Clooney but in the end, keeping quiet (it is a lot of quietness) doesn't add up too much. No smart ideas. We're in the age of quantum computing, and I expect some basic knowledge in science should be known.... An undiscovered planet around Jupiter... really? It sounds like hey, I just noticed a second car in our garage. How come we didn't see it yet?... Heated from inside?... I can't even be sarcastic on this.... All planets over a certain mass are hot inside due to gravitational pressure and in some case due to gravitation interference, but... that seems to be a quite tiny since it was not yet discovered. I can imagine from Galileo's time till now, every time we, the earthlings, pointed a telescope in that direction, the phone rang and we always missed it... So, the final score: 1. Originality - 2 2. Acting -3 (having a beard looking at the sky is not exactly acting) 3. Effects - 7 4. Informative - 0 And finally: 5. Diversity - 10 (no comment on this)Definitely, not a movie for collection. More like, we have some time, let's kill two hours somehow."}, {"id": 547, "text": "The Midnight Sky is George Clooney's first film since Money Monster which I haven't seen yet. Clooney isn't just the star, he's also the director. The Midnight Sky was okay, I won't see it again.The film has two storylines: Clooney's character travelling through the Artic and the astronauts flying back to Earth. I can safely say everyone prefers the Artic storyline and the film should of focused more on that. The astronauts are likeable but bland, nobody is annoying.Midnight Sky is slow which is fine but the pacing is uneven. The astronaut storyline is stretched out, I can safely say everyone prefers the Artic storyline. Yes, the acting is good. The visuals are good mainly the space stuff.Overall, Midnight Sky was okay. I didn't mind seeing it but I won't see it again. If you have Netflix, you could give it a shot."}, {"id": 548, "text": "Director George Clooney mixes a lot of concepts of other movies into his film and combines them to The Midnight Sky. Well, some of that is almost insulting because the references are so obvious and even come from some of Clooney's previous films. I am not sure if that was lack fo creativity or laziness. There are at least the stories and concepts of 5 famous films involved in this one. That fact makes it really hard for me to give Clooney's newest feature a positive score even if you can see how ambitious he was with this project and you got to respect that too of course. The film ended up a bit messy and went kind of nowhere. That is sad because its own concept is actually very good and the first third of it was also very promising and had a lot of potential. Also the actors are good. George Clooney plays the lead, not being afraid to show his age, and he does it very well. Good performance for sure. I also liked Felicity Jones who yet gives another strong performance. David Oyelowo was a bit wasted but Damiea Bichir and Kyle Chandler gave good supporting performances. There is a wonderful score by Alexandre Desplat and some incredible visuals. So yes, all what is needed to have a big winner picture at hand. But Clooney lost it a bit with his direction and the screenplay also needed much more work. Too bad, wasted potential. Not a strong film at all but at least with some strong elements."}], "reviews_amount": 549}
