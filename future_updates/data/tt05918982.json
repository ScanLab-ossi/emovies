Unfortunately this is pretentious garbage, that has long since become tired.If like me, 2 hours of your life is precious, and you get little time to watch movies - don't waste your Saturday night like I did watching this crap.I would have scored it lower but some of the visuals are extremely impressive."}, {"id": 1, "text": "There aren't enough people doing this kind of stuff anymore, you know, the kind of movies David Cronenberg used to do, low budget but well crafted, high concept and not afraid to disturb, then lo and behold, looks like his son took the torch and I couldn't be happier. Possessor has some great performances and nice visual choices, the body horror bits do not disappoint as well and I thought the narrative was engaging from start to finish, found no issues with the pacing whatsoever.We need more creative works like this on horror-fantasy."}, {"id": 2, "text": "... not only in the main characters but channelling throughout this unoriginal take on nothing you haven't seen before but perhaps with a bit more gore, torment and brutality, although you're never really sure why and you'll find a point close to the middle when you won't really care - valueless with some reasonable effects."}, {"id": 3, "text": "... that's pretty much it. It just looks good. Well, the acting is alright too, i guess. The pacing is way too slow, literally 2/3 could've been cut into a 12 minutes run time. Though the concept is nice, they didn't able to make an interesting plot (if even there's any plot at all). The weird imagery and violent that sole purpose to make it edgy-artsy, didn't work. It ended up boring and dull."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Opens really well and sets the scene well. Then rapidly descends into a poor gorefest that has no actual story. The performances are good but there is no empathy felt for the main character. Visually it's ok but nothing special. Too many buts for me. Meh"}, {"id": 5, "text": "Similar in ways to existenz and videodrome themes. Really been missing David Cronenberg as he hasnt made many movies recently, so glad to see his sons taken over. His films are getting much better, this one being my favourite by miles so far. Excellent use of London set, nice camera work and its a real gorefest. It doesnt hold back in that respect, and some of the visual dream sequences were 1st class. Its not a perfect film by any means but has a number of strengths that horror film fans will appreciate."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Possessor reminds me of an ultra-violent combination of Inception and Looper.It's about an assassin who uses body-hoping technology to kill her targets before terminating the body she's co-opted.The movie does not do a lot of explaining, we open up with an assassination in a swanky hotel where one of the staff is manipulated to kill a guest before security guards gun her down.Then we see the protagonist (I use the word loosely) Taysa Vos, played by Andrea Riseborough, was controlling the body of the killer from a safe distance. Vos works for a secretive company that offers these kind of closed-loop assassinations. Side bar: Taysa Vos sounds like it could be a name from the Star Wars universe, or is it just me?The process of changing bodies seems to take away from her sense of self. She takes a test after each job where she recognizes objects from her past and identifies the one that doesn't belong. When she visits her family, she has to practice sounding like herself -- as if she's rehearsing lines.What follows is a kaleidoscope of violence and surreal, dreamy imagery filmed in a cold, deliberate style. Lots of indie movies today go for this kind of neon/midnight movie mixed with Kubrick aesthetic, but Possessor pulls it off better than most.Vos is supposed to possess the body of Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) to murder his girlfriend and her CEO father (Sean Bean) before offing himself to tie up the loose end.It goes wrong, but not in the way I expected. I'd recommend this to people who enjoy mindbenders along the lines of Primer, Triangle, or Upstream Color and can put up with a bit of seize-in-your-seat gore."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I just found the whole movie wrong from the opening scene. The look was off, the pacing was slow, the sound track was tedious and slow panning shots... I simply detest slow panning shots with ambient music. It was an extremely drawn out affair, interjected with frantic disjointed scenes of of graphic violence and sex. I feel this movie was made more for the filmaker's entertainment than the audience. It could have ended (and really should have) twenty minutes sooner. Even though it was about 90 minutes, it felt so much longer to me. The ending was a mess but at that stage I was just happy it was over."}, {"id": 8, "text": "I rarely write reviews on IMDB, but since there is so little info out there on this film, I decided to add my two cents. I feel like this film has great potential, much like an episode of Black Mirror. Unfortunately, there are far too many unanswered questions in this film.Spoilers....maybe:Why are these assassinations taking place? Who is behind them? What happens when the process goes smoothly, considering we are only shown what happens when the process goes haywire? I could go on....This movie feels unfinished (maybe it is?). The horror is there, the sci-fi is there, the creativity is there, it just needs someone to step in and tie it all together."}, {"id": 9, "text": "This movie is unsettling. To its credit, that is partially due to its commitment to the relentlessly bleak and bloody life of Tasya, a woman whose job is to use a strange machine that lets her inhabit other people's bodies to carry out violent assassinations. The film truly conveys the dread of an alternate universe where such a thing exists. The audience is in a strange position at the edge of the seat waiting to see how this woman and her overlords' missions go, yet also wondering if we should be hoping for their own demise given the immorality of their scheme. It doesn't help that Tasya herself seems perturbed about her own actions.Unfortunately, the film is also unsettling for a number of negative reasons. Firstly, it is grotesque. It features ridiculously gory violence and pornographic imagery, including a scene where a child is shot and killed and highly explicit sex scenes. These kinds of elements can be appropriate when crafting a film, but the creators of this film are highly egotistical to think that they have the skill to use these elements as anything more than shock value.Secondly, the actual writing of the film is lazy. It is premised on a fascinating science-fiction concept of using technology to control other people and have them carry out violence for you, but that is the only substance to the film. None of the people in the film seem like living humans; they are just there to either kill or be killed. There is no way to connect with or care about anyone in the film, except when you feel sorry for them being brutalized so viciously or wish they would stop committing such heinous acts. Very few things are justified in the movie. Why, in a world that mostly seems to be just like our own, do they have this incredible ability for one person to take control of another's body? Who exactly is doing this? How would this be worth it, given the monetary, legal, and ethical liabilities? Why would anyone agree to do this? Why does no one notice? Why are the victims left alone so much, without anyone there to help them? This mystifying world is actually just an empty world, like a notepad with only two pages of notes and the rest is blank.Finally, the movie veers into government-granted film student cheese. While it is stylisticly interesting in some ways, it also features a constant soundtrack of grating royalty-free creepy music and features a lot of eerie filler footage. At the supposed climax, it devolves to the point of plopping loud, scary sounds onto otherwise laughable scenes with melting masks and spooky scenes flashing by.Possessor is highly dedicated to some sort of goal to unsettle us. Unfortunately, it just isn't clear what the purpose is, and therefor it is not justified in being so grotesque and unenjoyable. It joins a growing legacy of films which collect grants from multiple countries, go to print, and then get tossed in the rubbish cause no one cares."}, {"id": 10, "text": "I think this is one of those films you will love or hate.It is quite slow moving and you do have to pay attention to get the most from it.

A few bloody murders here and there but FAR from body horror. I'm not gonna mention other movies in this review but there are MANY far better modern indie body horror movies out there if you're really looking for them.Who was the evil step son? We don't even see him in the movie except that image of him.Why did they try to pull Tasya out even though she didn't even kill the CEO?Why did Colin/Tasya visit the injured CEO afterwards in that quick scene?Why does Tasya hate her family to the point of telling Colin to kill them when at the beginning we see her loving them and wanting to spend more time with them? She loses her guilt at the end but why? Does she want to be the best possessor? If so, why?

Thus, although it's gory, it is completely unbelievable.Character development is almost completely lacking. There's a bit of information exchange when preparing to target the next victim. Apparently, although the possessor can target a victim and control them, they nevertheless have no access to their life experiences, etc. - until, contradictorily, later in the film, when they are mixed together.There's an odd scene that I still haven't figured out where the possessor, occupying the body of a victim goes to his job site. What in the world is his job? Apparently, it's identifying curtains, blinds, etc., while trying to ignore pornographic scenes.

It happened all over again with Possessor (or Possessor Uncut), which is not the alternate title to Horror Express (\u00a9Bill Van Ryn for that joke) and it's not one of the movies within a movie within Popcorn.The film starts interesting enough, as we watch a woman (Gabrielle Graham) insert a needle inside her head and attach it to a machine. She then goes to work at a party where she repeatedly stabs a man, then nearly turns a gun on herself before the police shot her. It turns out that she's controlled by a possessor named Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough), which means that she can directly implant her mind into someone else and use them to kill people.As her boss (Jennifer Jason Leigh, always a welcome actress) talks her through the end of the assignment, Tasya must identify objects from her past to prove that she is still herself. That's another lie, as she can barely speak like a normal human being when she meets her ex-husband (Rossif Sutherland) and son.But there's no time to consider that. There's another job, as they have been hired to kill the owner of a data mining company, which excites everyone because they'll be able to control the company by blackmailing the man who hired them. They use the owner's daughter Ava's boyfriend Colin (Christopher Abbott) for the hit, but for the first time, the company doesn't have all of the answers. And even after he completes half the job, killing his girlfriend - yet only wounding her father - he takes back over and causes Tasya to vomit blood.Can Tasya complete her assignment and get her mark to kill himself so she can be released? Or is this her final possession? And how does her son get involved?The main reason most have discussed this film is because it was written and directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of, well, you know. This definitely has style, the colors and camera angles are gorgeous but there's an icy edge that ill serves the movie to me. It's as if we are as much on the outside looking in as the titular possessor.

But hey - your experience may vary and you might completely adore this. Also, knowing me, once Brandon Cronenberg's second movie is hated by everyone else - see this same story played out in Under the Silver Lake and Southland Tales - I'll fall in love with one of his movies.That said - it has a psychic possession threeway, so there's that. And oh yeah - of course he points to Argento as an influence, which makes sense, as this film is awash in dream imagery and primary colors.

That was nice, I suppose."}, {"id": 82, "text": "My Synopsis-- Andrea Riseborough plays (Tasya Vos) the agent, who is employed by (Girder's) Organization played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. The Organization uses brain implants to inhabit pre-selected civilian bodies in order to control their behavior and make them commit acts of ultra-violence and assassinations. This Organization is funded by high-paying clients. This particular story focuses on (Vos) inhabiting the body of (Colin Tate) played by Christopher Abbott. (Vos) has shown she has a couple of quirks when the simulation is running. She is much more violent that what the mission entails, as well as struggles with her exit strategy of the simulations. We're only shown a single simulation prior to the film's main sequence. The mission is for (Vos) to assume the role of (Colin) and convince his girlfriend (Ava Parse) played by Tuppence Middleton, that he is a worthy boyfriend to be accepted by her Father (John Parse) played by Sean Bean. (John Parse) is the CEO of a data-mining company that someone has paid big money to (Girder's) Organization to infiltrate the ranks and takeover. During this process (Colin) slowly begins to become aware something isn't right, and struggles with visions during his possession by (Vos) and attempts to regain control, making it very difficult for (Vos) to compete the mission. Meanwhile, back at home (Vos's) husband (Michael) played by Rossif Sutherland and their son (Ira) played by Gage Graham-Arbuthnot are completely unaware of (Vos's) true occupation. It's mentioned during an interview with (Girder) that (Vos) and her Husband (Micheal) are separated, assuming that her job took a toll on the relationship. (Girder) also reveals during another interview that she was once a possessor, but age has taken it's toll on her ability to continue. (Girder) also alludes to the Organization standing to outright own the company they are attempting to infiltrate. (Vos) hides some of the affects this possession takes from her, almost like the process is starting to crumble and not take hold any longer. She never shares these instances with (Girber) leading the viewer to believe that there is a duty that (Vos) feels she has to prove to (Girber) that she's always ready for a new job. (Girber) admits at once point in an interview session that (Vos) is her star performer. There is no reference at any time of other possessor's team within the Organization other than plotters that will do research prior to a mission taking place.Actor performances- Tasya Vos - B - It seemed to me she had run too many missions Girber - A - Good pressure boss, explained things clearly Colin Tate - C - Seemed always stuck in completing his tasks Michael Vos - B - Small role, but ending made up for it Ira Vos - C - Only a single scene where he redeemed himself Ava Parse - A - Nailed the rich entitled drug-party heiress role John Parse - B - Nailed the pompous-bullish, successful CEO roleStory- I was really excited on the premise of this film. As a long standing fan of Horror and Sci-Fi, I think this film manages to pull off both to excite either viewer of their favorite genre. You're in for a treat if you like both! I've never really seen an idea for film like this before, much less pull it off completely with no plot holes. I will admit, narration through the film could have been better as to what the heck was going on at times, but I chalked that up to some of the science shown on-screen wasn't supposed to be fully understood by the viewer. I really liked that the character Vos has a darker side than she was fully willing to admit to Girber, and the ending scene there's a small difference between interview #1 and #2 that if you catch it, seals the film as a winner.Rating- This film is a strong R. It has gratuitous use of nudity, sexual scenes, illicit drug use, language and ultra-violence level gore. Not kid friendly. This would be okay for a Teen, around aged 16-17 depending on the maturity level. It left me feeling a bit unweary on the lingering effects of the ultra-violent parts. Make no mistake, I liked them, but the thoughts lingered well beyond the film cut to credits with me. I feel this was a solid 8 stars for attempting to pull off something akin to The Matrix, Inception and Jason Bourne movies all-in-one. At no time did it feel scary I think the Horror side was gore-only. Good film by Brandon Cronenberg. I wish him the best in the future, and sadly it appears this film has no mention of nominations. Which I think is a shame. It's a very tough pitch to make in general dealing with Horror movies are already at a -25 in score to critics, since most feel like they need to be scared in order for the movie to qualify for Horror. I disagree, I believe modern horror can take two forms. Scares and Gore.

Why should I care about a world without real human emotion, humor and wit? Classic Cronenberg movies somehow always managed to make the world lively and engaging no matter how disturbing the theme was. I hope Brandon Cronenbergs future projects allows for some light in the edgy dark. Don't be afraid to make things likeable and inject some humor and wit into the characters and their world.

Tasya Vos works for a secretive organization that utilizes brain-implant technology that allows her to take control of specific targeted hosts in order to carry out contract killings.

Later, we're shown she has what it seems to be cramping in her right fingers.

No matter how she puts the gun in her mouth or to the side of her head, her right fingers can't do it.Guess what?! There's something called a left hand. I'm not a film analyst but, assuming she's not afraid of going home, her left hand is more than capable of pulling the trigger. But she doesn't even make a single attempt to hold the gun with the other hand...I agree a lot with what others say: there's a lot of ideas here BUT the execution (and maybe budget) didn't make the movie into something great.

Imagine being the son of Cronenberg and having to live up to his record of films. It appears that his son Brandon is doing just that and succeeding. His latest film does just that and more, creating a science fiction premise that is frightening and fascinating at the same time.POSSESSOR takes place in the near future and opens with a brilliant yet violent segment that shows what the film is all about. A young woman named Holly (Gabrielle Graham) is seen inserting something into the top of her skull and reacting to the probe emotionally. Shortly after she is attending a party as one of the hostesses there when she takes a knife and kills a high profile attorney in one of the most brutal and bloody sequences seen. Afterward she points the gun in her mouth but doesn't pull the trigger. Instead she points it at the police who kill her.But it wasn't really Holly who was responsible for the brutal killing. In reality she was being manipulated by Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough), a professional killer who works for a company that implants her consciousness into another person using them to pull of the contract. Having done this many times this last hit proved problematic because Holly was resisting Tasya's plan to kill herself. Rather than inform her superiors Tasya keeps this to herself.Tasya takes a short time off to visit her husband Michael (Rossif Sutherland) and son Ira who she has separated with. To do so she has to prepare herself, teaching herself how to speak and interact with normal people. It seems the mechanics involved with her profession are taking their toll on her. Unable to connect as much as she'd like, she leaves early and returns for her next job.The next assignment is a top priority one. The man being targeted is the owner of a massive corporation, John Parse (Sean Bean). They've been hired by Parse's stepson Reid (Christopher Jacot) to kill both him and his daughter Ava (Tuppence Middleton) so that he can take over the company. Tasya's company wants the hit done as well so they can use the information to blackmail Reid.To put her in place Ava's boyfriend Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) is captured and linked with Tasya. She now controls his body seeing what he sees, manipulating him when called on to do so. In the meantime her body lays in stasis back at the company's facility being monitored. But things don't go as planned. It seems that Colin keeps trying to regain control of his mind as Tasya works to continue manipulating him.Simply getting through the day becomes difficult for Colin/Tasya, at one point with him blacking out. Trying to recognize people and not making him seem different in his behavior is a struggle. All of this leads to a dinner held at John Parse' home. The question now becomes whether Tasya can control Colin long enough to pull off her mission or not and if so can she return to her own body?I wasn't sure what to expect when I began watching this film. I knew it premiered at Sundance but that doesn't always mean a movie is good. Sometimes those films can be critic darlings but audience dead weight. Fortunately that wasn't the case here. While the progress of the film is steady the pacing is a bit slower than most. It doesn't hurt the storytelling going on here but some people might not be willing to go along for the ride without that breakneck speed they're used to. That would be their loss.The story is compelling on various levels. There is Tasya who you want to understand and figure out why she does what she does. There is Colin who is fighting for his life here inside of his own skull. There is Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Tasya's controller who has concerns for Tasya. There is Ava who seems the most innocent of the entire group. And there is John Parse, a jerk who at points seems worth killing. All of these characters combine to make an interesting story. And the acting on the parts of all involved make them come to life, becoming believable.I'd love to say I love the film but in all honesty I really just enjoyed it but found it not a movie I'm likely to revisit. It is worth one viewing at least and will keep you guessing. The version being released is unrated due to a combination of gore and nudity so keep that in mind. Not one for the kids.

Failing to commit suicide, she is shot dead by police just as her consciousness is extracted from her body, returning to its true home, an older white woman named Vos (Andrea Riseborough). Vos is an assassin, who when assigned a hit 'body hops' into the body of someone who can get close to her target. But when assigned to kill a wealthy businessman (Sean Bean, once again in danger of failing to make it to the end of a film), the choice of his potential son-in-law, Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott, most recently seen by British viewers in 2019's 'Catch-22' mini-series) proves to be a mistake: Colin's consciousness fights back when Vos invades his body.Riseborough is an actress who generally I can take or leave, so it is ironic that in portraying an icy-blooded hitwoman she provides her most human performance: in the climactic scene, when she and Colin tussle for control of the latter's body, she seems so reasonable that the viewer almost wants her to win. Abbott arguably has the more difficult role - having to portray both Colin and Vos-as-Colin; it is difficult to say if he is totally successful, but how do you judge success in a role like that?Writer/director Brandon Cronenberg certainly likes his weirdness (there are lots of hard-to-define images in this) and is liberal in his use of fake blood. Possibly there is slightly too much style over substance in the film, but for the most part I found it an interesting watch, and certainly it is worth repeated viewings. But I would have liked more detail on some points: for instance, Colin's day job seems to involve spying on people's soft furnishings, but surely that can not be the case?

A clandestine corporation uses this technology to assassinate wealthy and powerful people for profit. The film explores what happens when the host starts to fight to regain control from a guest who is not entirely mentally stable, to begin with.Interesting enough premise. The film is set in a very bleak version of the future where cities appear to be sparsely populated (perhaps from some event that greatly reduced the population such as plague or war; a motif borrowed from Argento's Tenebre). The film relies heavily on psychotropic imagery, and this adds to the overall frightening and confusing atmosphere since most of this imagery is nightmarish (distorted faces reminiscent of David Cronenberg's The Brood, warped colors, bursts of sound and images, blurs, rapid-fire images and strobing flashes of light). The film further relies on ultra-violence as a motif that rivals even the Italian slasher films of the late 1970s and early 80s (such as Susperia, Tenembre, Opera, etc.). Possessor contains explicit sexual motifs including full male nudity and erect penises, which reminds me very much of Antichrist (2009) or The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). These are juxtaposed with explicit imagery of knives penetrating flesh. All of this results in a nightmare landscape. The ending is purposely left confusing so that that the viewer can arrive at their own conclusions. For some viewers, this will be frustrating.All of this wraps up into a very worthwhile enough film, but for viewers with a more sophisticated palate (if you are looking for a Blumhouse type film Possessor is not what you are looking for). It is disturbing to be sure. However, it is very well made and anchored by two very outstanding performances from Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott. It also features Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sean Bean in very laudable supporting roles (whether or not Sean Bean dies I will not spoil). Possessor is a Criterion Collection caliber film that will give the viewer some satisfaction analyzing and will with you long after you see it."}, {"id": 140, "text": "This should be retitled,Too Much but also not enough. There are so many ideas pulling the movie in so many different directions. It's ideas the movie, but rarely does an idea get fully realized here. This has me torn on how I feel. On one hand, there is a unique tone to this. It's like Assassin's Creed meets inception. People possessing other people's bodies to preform hits on specific people for political or social gain is a solid premise on it's own. Throw in some great ultra violent gore effects, good performances, and some moody, atmospheric music and you get some really striking scenes. On the other hand, the movie is overly ambitious. There's so much it establishes there's no way it can accomplish it all, and it doesn't. This is exemplified in the first act which feels horribly rushed. We get less then 20 minutes establishing characters, premise, and themes. It feels like it can't wait to move through the set up and what results is a lack of investment from me. We hardly know who anyone is or why they are doing anything. The main character is having a psychological melt down as a result from over working inside this possessor machine but she only takes like a half day off to recover. Then she's right back to work. There's barely motivation for this and in her half day off all she does is sit around at home with her ex. You needed more scenes explaining to us what lead to her breaking up with him and more establishment of why she would want to go back to him. We don't know these people or their story and we leave them so quickly it's hard to care about them at all. We literally get one scene of her away from her work, and it's nothing out of the ordinary as far as normal day goes. Why is she a workaholic? Her home life seems fine to me. Why won't she tell her superiors that she's having a mental breakdown? Is it supposed to be a metaphor about her dependency on work to avoid her real life? If that's the case then why don't we get more scenes showing why she would be avoiding her life? It's a messy movie, full of vague characters and even murkier story progression. Even though the first act is rushed, at least it sets some interesting things up. The second act is where the movie really faulters though. It feels like the same scenes happening over and over again. It gets really tedious watching a character saying the possessed person is acting weird over and over. There are some cool, trippy, drug like sequences showing the main character having more internal breakdowns but I got the point after the first time. Yeah she's not stable enough to be in there and the longer she is, the worse it will get. I get it. We don't need to see it 27 times. This is weird because the first act has the exact opposite problem. Like Inception these people are trying to accomplish something by manipulating others for their gain. Unlike Inception, where the first half of the movie is establishing characters, story motivations, and potential speed bumps, Possessor only seems interested in establishing the story speed bumps. We don't get a clear sense of character motivation or why the story is happening in the first place. This possessor company wants to own this large tech company? But why? Who knows! The real story is about the Possessor and the Possessy who go to war over who should have control over the body. So why even mention that they want to absorb this tech company? Instead, say that she needs to kill these people just because they are evil or corrupt. That wouldn't change what the movie is going for and it would clean up the story a bit. The whole point is the struggle between the possessed dude and the possessor and coming to terms with the horrible things that happened. It's kinda like watching someone with split personality disorder. Which, again, is an idea that could've and should've been fleshed out. It only comes up near the end and is wrapped up so quickly I don't know why they even bothered. The first act is completely rushed, the second act is drawn out to no end, and the third act introduces more things it can't quite pull off. So...eh?*2nd viewing edition* I liked this way more on second watch. Maybe it's the uncut version or maybe I just got it this time. The biggest theme explored is the idea that sometimes it's hard to tell who we really are. Are we so inspired by others to do things that we end up losing our sense of self? You could interpret this as a meditation on mental illness but I see it as every day life. The culture is so saturated by hot takes, opinions, and people looking out for our best interest that it can truly be numbing. The disassociation we can feel could be as simple as everyday little things to life altering marriage. Who knows if we love them or if someone we love loves them for us. This is all beautifully captured and comes around full circle at the end. Again, it's possible I just didn't get it the first time around but, this uncut version somehow feels tighter. I was transfixed by it. The first act flows nicely, the second act escalates well, and the climax is thoroughly satisfying.

The special effects were awesome, truly something to marvel as everything felt pretty real and accurate when it comes to gore. It was visually striking and was shot pretty well. The acting was pretty decent as well for the most part. Christopher Abbott is a very skilled actor and is shows in this movie, I would argue he was the saving grace since the rest of the cast was nothing to write home about.The rest of the movie can only be described as murder porn mixed with actual porn lightly topped with a plot that remained largely unexplored. The sex scene make up probably about a third of this movie and is purely tasteless and leads to absolutely nothing. Usually sex scenes lead to character building or progression of the plot, which is not the case for this movie as it seems they're only present to please the director and a few creeps that watched this alone in the theatre. There are a few scenes in this movie that are just literal porn. I cannot stress this enough, its just porn.There's also a ton of unnecessary gore scenes that only serve to shock people into reaction because the writing failed to do so on its own. The main character appears to not enjoy killing people in this movie (which makes sense and can lead to a thicker and richer plot) yet for some reason always chooses the most traumatic and barbaric ways to kill people. It makes no sense and is never explained. She has PTSD and hates killing people, she also has a gun to kill people quickly... lets just have her kill him with a fireplace poker in the most gruesome Evil Dead way possible. This movie is not Evil Dead, it wants to take itself so seriously and yet it seems as though the director reached peak creative maturity in middle school and wrote the movie strictly for those who carry the same mentality. The ending was pure confusion and its clear the director had no clue how to end his own movie.This movie has great scores across the board. I truly for the life of me cannot understand why. Its clear that movies have had a strict decline in quality over the past few years, yet movies like these still get great reviews.

The next day I realized it was playing at theaters nearby and decided to head to the theater to get the full experience! And holy cowgirl am I glad I did!

The film is actually quite a heavy experience to watch - not only does it make you think, but as you start figuring out what's going on, your brain will make you feel like you don't WANT to see what's going to happen next - so it's mostly a wholly discomforting, or challenging viewing - I felt genuinely terrified more than once. It's really impressive. And everything is tied up with a really bleak, disgusting little blood-bow in the end. The vile nature of humanity on full display (if you can comprehend what you just watched - it is clear through some reviews I've read that not everyone understands it).Visually, it's very locked in. There are near-future sci-fi set pieces &amp; props, segments of hallucinogenic hacked-up surrealism, and as I mentioned, some of the most gut-wrenching violence I have seen in a movie in quite some time. It's not for the weak of heart - absolutely not.The whole cast annihilates. Sean Bean was fantastic in his role. Tuppence Middleton was perfect (what a name she has). Christopher Abbott was frighteningly discomforting. Jennifer Jason Leigh is always a pleasure.

I saw some good reviews, but didn't read them and just went to check it out with an open mind and a little hope. My hopes were unfounded as the film really is nothing to be excited about. In fact, I found the film to be profoundly boring. The story isn't bad really, it's somewhat interesting, but it's delivered in slow motion and with a lot of misplaced weirdness. This coming from a lover of weird films. Luis Bu\u00f1uel, David Lynch and Federico Fellini are among my favorite all time filmmakers for instance. I've never been a fan of weirdness just for the sake of being weird however. Weirdness needs to be interesting, compelling to at least some degree, not completely pointless. This film seems to focus too much on its weirdness and less on the interesting aspects of the story, and to me, none of the weirdness was of any interest. Brandon may indeed one day be a director worth watching, however today is not the day. To me this film was not even in the same league as Father David's first feature Shivers.

There are good ideas here, good acting, good shots, great visual. But it lacks...soul. It's sometimes too empty, has serious problems with his pace (no, I don't have a problem with slow burners, it's my fave type, in fact, but we need more tension to build that).

I get that he doesn't want to give us an easy story, wants us to feel uncomfortable, but jeez...look to movies like Burning (Chang dong-Lee), Midsommar (Ari Aster) or Uncut Gems (Safdie Brothers), and you can see that you can build that, without being bored."}, {"id": 147, "text": "This film is derivative of films like Inception, Momento, and Scanners.

I will say I enjoyed Possessor's ingredients of disturbing visuals and graphic violence. The violence is not frequent but when it happens it is bloody and may make your jaw drop a few times. It reminded my of Nicolas Refn's Drive when the killings do happen in Possessor. Some of the dream-like sequences are truly disturbing and will make you say wtf out loud. As for the story I don't want to give to much away but it takes a few interesting turns and demands your attention. If you end up enjoying Possessor then another viewing will fill in some gaps. Possessor is slow, graphic and not for everyone but I found the story/premise interesting enough to hold my attention throughout. Honestly, Possessor is messed up and I appreciate Brandon Cronenberg sticking with his vision and giving the audience a truly disturbing experience. If you can stick with Possessor you may enjoy it, even love it. Pay attention in the beginning of the film when Vos is describing how she feels about killing the butterfly when she was little.

Released at the same time as Christopher Nolan's Tenet, this is the far superior film. This is what I would call a top tier indie sci fi horror film. I don't know what the budget was but this film looks amazing. Its probably a mid to mid/low budget movie but it is also very cinematic and would be epic on the big screen. The uncut version holds lots of sexuality and many erect ding dongs. There is also some extremely explicit violence. The kills are placed perfectly through out and the pacing is phenomenal. Chris Abott truly kills it. Brandon Cronenberg takes sci fi horror by the balls as he follows in similar footsteps of his father, but clearly with a modern twist. I liked how this movie takes place in a sort of alternate reality. The director said its supposed to be an alternate 2008. There are retro cars, some retro aesthetics, but it all goes together famously. I couldn't wait to see this movie. I ordered the uncut version on blu ray, and waited for days as UPS failed to deliver the movie on time due to high package volume. Once i received it I couldn't wait to watch it. I hyped this movie up in my head but the payoff was more than satisfying. I wish i had bought the 4k version.

After seeing Possessor (2020) i can safely say that it is not a horror movie, not a conventional at least. Possessor is a very bloody, goory movie story and concept of which more then once reminded me of Inception - but only on a concept level, because later movie is a masterpiece and Possessor was just OK. I also liked that it was unpredictable later in a story. Where this movie did suffer was its storytelling i think - i did get the plot but it could have been told say much more involving.Overall, the director and writer Brandon Cronenberg clearly took some inspiration from Inception and from works of his famous father David Cronenberg (sudden and bloody violence) made a not bad movie overall. I liked of unpredictable it was and somehow bold, cold and bleak - but it a good way. Possessor is not the best movie around, but it was not bad either."}, {"id": 157, "text": "The movie is about implanting another person's consciousness into another person with the objective of killing without a trace. The main character named Tasya Vos, she's the top killer agent in her company. Not a lot went into her backstory, we do not know what was her motive or drive into doing this line of work, what we as the audience knew about Vos was that she started unraveling and became unstable at her job possibly due to many of possessing other person's body. But she hides this from her boss and continue with the next mission. This part of the movie, the introduction of our main character and the establishment of plot point was interesting. From the very opening act up until this point, the atmospheric feels is very thick, with jarring and eerie score. The cinematography and the coloring for this movie was briliantly done. The problem started with the second act, when Vos was implanted into the next target Tate. It got considerably slow and dull at times. It was so slow that it got tedious and dare I say boring. Although there is some great imaging sequence here and there, still the plot slowly advance. Also, going in from the very beginning, this movie wasnt shy about how explicit the violence could be, and yet I was caught off guard with how gory and violently violent THAT scene was. This scene was not for the faint hearted wimp like me. Until this scene then it dawned on me, this wasn't just a science fiction movie, this was a horror movie. The conclusion of the plot was... unsatisfactory? Also left me with more questions about Vos's motive, like what's her deal? WHY WAS SHE DOING THIS WORK? All in all, I hate the violent aspect of this movie, love the unsettling eerie atmosphere, love the premise, Love the first act. Especially love the performance as Tasya Vos, credit for the actress!Will I recommend this movie to other people? Probably yes depend on the person, I could see this movie will not work for the general audiences as it could looked a lot like arthouse kind of movie.

At times it's a very unpleasant, dark and gruesome watch. Especially the violence can get to stomach-turning levels.

It was really witty and it might not be for everyone. The mood is rather blunt and there isn't a lot of suspense it just happens which kinda makes things a little to gruesome. As i was watching the movie i keep thinking to myself if this is something i would watch again and if this is something i would want to purchase to show others. As for me wanting to watch it again i kinda feel like I wouldn't mind, of course a year from now or so. They had quite a few original ideas and a lot of the cinematography was very abstract art like how we would find it in the MOCA Museum though it was just a little bit more normal to the point where you can kinda connect the dots to gather what was happening. The storyline took a while to get but once you got it a third of the movie in you kinda wonder the possibilities of the movie, i would have liked a little more pazzaz, action, but it felt ok nothing amazing. As for if I would buy this and show to others, i would probably want to buy it once it becomes cheap, this does feel like the kind of movie that isn't really a big title. The company behind the movie I haven't really heard of, its a Canadian company so that probably does help. If there movies are like this i can say they surly have a different taste for what they consider scary to be. I wouldn't mind showing this to other people but it isn't on the top of the list and doesn't really show anything amazing with picture, maybe sound in some parts of the movie but again nothing really stands out. The reason why i like the movie is the ideas behind it and how the movie feels like a soft indie short film but with some good directors and again storytelling the movie i enjoyed. I'd give it an overall ranting of 7/10 i did notice 3 people of 2 groups did leave before the movie ended so i can see how some might have felt it was too boring, to gross, or not interesting enough, so your kinda split between liking it or not.

Not to minimize that, but with the kind of year we've had, it's not saying all that much... Brandon Cronenberg, bearing the name of his father, the legendary David Cronenberg, is very much set on his own path to success and creativity in horror, but the numerous similarities are there - body horror, fascination with technology and people's growingly bizarre relationship with it, futuristic ideas, down to certain kinds of atmosphere etc. Like father, like son, beautiful minds.The story of Possessor might not be the thickest of plots, but it's full of unease, exploring themes like cyber surveillance, the obsession of wanting to live a life different than one's problematic own, and the question we can never truly answer - just how much a human mind can handle without breaking. A secretive organization uses brain-implant tech that makes it possible for a person to inhabit the body of whoever they choose. They have high-paying clients ordering assassinations via this method, and Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough) is the one on the mission, hijacking the brain of a billionaire's son Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott). It's not that much the plot that engages, but rather the enjoyable and scary weirdness of what's happening to these characters. The performances of Possessor, especially those of Riseborough and Abbott - next in line Jennifer Jason-Leigh &amp; Sean Bean, - are highly commendable and is one of the strengths holding Possessor together so well. This whole goodie package is also wrapped up in an aesthetic equally as bizarre - cinematography, special FX, in-camera effects and a solid musical score by Jim Williams (Kill List, Raw), together provide a sticky and impeccable audiovisual atmosphere. By all means, Possessor is an arthouse horror. Last but not least, Possessor is a true dessert for the gore hounds, the violence is used with a sure hand and to much effectiveness, all practical and very grisly at times.Possessor didn't 'knock me off my feet' as I might have expected while hyping myself up, but it's an impressive effort, a horror film that will more likely than not gain a cult following. I hear Brandon might make a sequel set in the same universe, though personally I'd like to see yet another separate idea of his in realization.

And of course the visuals from the trailer and the presence of Andrea Riseborough convoked the visually stunning Beyond the Black Rainbow from Panos Cosmatos (because she played in his subsequent movie Mandy). And I have to say, Brandon Cronenberg did not disappoint by delivering a great mix of just that, with that unique canadian feel. I was first amazed by the set where the first scenes take place, and then completely at home with the montage, effects and concept of the story. The long dive sequence surely again make me think of an updated version of the somewhat similar nightmarish dive in BTBR. Definitely something I'll enjoy rewatching. I would have loved for the story to dive deeper in this and have a broader spectrum, move forward with what was showed in the end, and have something even more creeper to offer, because it showed and explained so much that it could have built on it even further.

The version on Amazon isn't the original and some of the nudity and the worst of the violence is removed.It's still very violent, but most of the missing graphic scenes are actually contextually important, it's not really like something like Hostel or Saw where it wouldn't really make any difference on your perception of the film or the story.I was incredibly disappointed to have seen the edited version first, and then the original, which is how the director intended for it to be seen.I can understood to a degree the nudity being removed as what's altered is some very explicit material, but I thought we were past the days of censoring violence.The difference is quite noticeable and without going into spoiler territory the original is far more effective to the narrative."}, {"id": 164, "text": "Brandon Cronenberg is certainly following in daddy's footsteps quite nicely.

The opening sequence is something that is totally unexpected and sets the tone for the type of movie that is ahead of you. It might be one of the best opening sequences of the year.For a low budget indie flick, the effects were stunning. The director, Brendan Cronenberg, son of David Cronenberg, used a lot of practical effects and the makeup team was very efficient in making believable and realistic prosthetics that never looked cheap. Cronenberg also crafts a film that is as violent as his father's films. Eastern Promises was probably the most violent Cronenberg film, and it is nice to see some of that DNA weaved into this film. It is is unflinchingly violent and very hard to watch at many times. It's slow build to these violent acts end up paying off in the end thanks to clear character motivations.My issue with the movie is that SEAN BEAN DOESN'T DIE!!! Nah just kidding.

It never felt like it amounted to anything.Full YouTube review come soon"}, {"id": 170, "text": "Brandon Cronenberg's latest motion picture had me seriously hyped up for the last few months. Its trailer really sold me Possessor. Then, after its October release, I read reviews and breakdowns of the storyline, all sorts of exciting comments caught my attention, the likes of Brandon Cronenberg is cut from the same cloth as his extremely talented father; comparisons were drawn with the likes of Looper, eXistenZ, and heck, even Inception; The visual effects department barely relies to any computer generated imagery at all; The film contains this bizarre, organic and bloody imagery that is so reminiscent of David Cronenberg's earlier films; the film intelligently explores themes that are very du jour, such as the underlying risks of constantly evolving technology, and how allowing the wrong hands to pull its strings can lead to a twisted form of puppetry that most cannot even imagine. The list goes on and on, and it sure fostered interest toward this movie as far as I was concerned.Possessor tells the story of Tasya Vos, a woman who works for a company that wealthy clients hire to commit assassinations of high-profile targets. The company uses a technology that certainly is reminiscent of iconic bizarre imagery and sci-fi elements within David Cornenberg's filmography : It allows Tasya to connect to another body into which an implant has been injected beforehand, and take control of that body, which she uses to fulfill her contract, and of which she then must dispose by making that body commit suicide. Since I do not want to give too much away, I will only say that, at some point, as Tasya is possessing another body, things take an unexpected turn.Besides the fact that there are various obvious similarities with themes that were so dear to Brandon Cronenberg's father, more importantly (I think!), there are also various reminiscent story codes at the very core of the fictional universe that is on display such as how the abuse of this organic technology ends up destroying both the minds and bodies of its users. The parallel with eXistenZ immediately comes to mind, and so is the case with The Fly, Videodrome and Scanners. Let's make it clear, though, that Possessor clearly draws us into a world that is closer to the one we know, at least in depiction, than what David Cronenberg's marquee sci-fi films have got us accustomed to.Possessor never over explains things. I think this is a bit of a double-edged sword that may please some viewers and upset others, as there are certain layers of complexity within the story that are somewhat reminiscent of Inception. But unlike Chris Nolan's film, Cronenberg does not dedicate twenty minutes or so to showing characters walking through demonstrations of the particularities of the world he's creating, or explicitly explaining how the technology that is core to the story works, or the origin and reason for every tiny related detail (artifacts, implants, etc.). Instead, it lets the viewer put all the pieces together, hopefully well enough to get the idea at a more general, big picture level. As I said, I'm fine with it, but I can understand the complaints from other viewers too, especially given how much time is spent on a few other aspects that could either have been toned down (i.e., the extended sequences of extreme violence, for instance) or simply shortened (i.e., certain scenes involving Colin's entourage that do not really contribute to character development) without compromising the quality of the film and storytelling. It doesn't feel like any of the above was done at the expense of something else in particular, though, but it could have been time spent on providing the audience a better grasp on this somewhat intangible and bizarre universe in which it is set to spend a hundred minutes, and be more immersed meanwhile.Cronenberg's direction is superb, allowing this nightmarish journey to unfold in a manner that is just as oddly beautiful as it is terrifying. I particularly enjoyed all the distorted, lurid imagery and those fascinating and psychedelic sequences when the technology operates and Tasya transitions into another human body. What makes it even more impressive is that this was apparently achieved without relying to CGI, and it shows...in a really good way. Cronenberg also plays a lot with symmetry and asymmetry in the framing of his shots, and uses some slow and hypnotic camera movements, which really help create a unique atmosphere. Needless to say, he is a talented director with great visual flair. The ambient-type soundtrack aligns perfectly with the bizarre and nightmarish situations and settings, and makes for quite an interesting sensorial experience throughout.As a fan of practical makeup and gore effects, Possessor was a ton of fun to watch, and those practical effects showing the human body seriously damaged in all sorts of imaginable ways are incredibly effective. Some of the kills on display in this film had me wincing, at times, from being so nasty. It will be off-putting to some viewers, and understandably so, but the violence is an integral part of the story, and I'm glad to see that it was not delivered through a plethora of goofy-looking CGI blood spurts and splats. Personally, I did not mind how graphic it was, although I thought it might have been overstretched in terms of screen time, in proportion with how important it is as a theme within this story, and how other much more central themes do not appear to get such a preferential treatment as far as screen time is concerned.The cast is all-around great, with Andrea Riseborough as Tasya Vos, and Christopher Abbott as both Colin Tate and Colin Tate's body possessed by Tasya. Riseborough feels truly invested in her performance, and Abbott does a really good job bringing to life two characters within the same body, literally. You can tell when he's Colin, and when he's Tasya. Jennifer Jason Leigh is also pretty damn creepy in the supporting role of an executive from the company that employs Tasya.Now, on the downside, I wish there would have been a more significant amount of character development involved, although what is actually to be found is coined beautifully. And the limited amount of character development that Possessor includes really serves the story tremendously. The ending, especially, speaks volumes on that, and is as powerfully symbolic yet subtle as the ending in A History of Violence, another film indeed directed by Cronenberg the father. Nevertheless, as a viewer, I have to admit that this deficiency prevented me from being emotionally attached to any of the characters. I do have this feeling, however, that this was exactly Brandon Cronenberg's intention.Overall, Possessor is a visually enthralling, nightmarish motion picture that tackles the fascinating and current topic of how dangerous technology could become (especially in the wrong hands), and successfully spins it to create a fine blend of sci-fi, thriller and horror. Despite a few deficiencies in the writing department, where it feels like certain propensities could be harnessed to his advantage in the future, Brandon Cronenberg truly delivered with Possessor, and proved that everyone, especially genre fans, can expect great cinema from this filmmaker."}, {"id": 171, "text": "I went totally blind into this flick only had a recommendation from an Australian girlfriend to watch this.Not knowing the director it was funny that I immediately thought of the weird horror flicks of David Cronenberg.

Possessor plays like a cross between Under The Skin and You Were Never Really Here; the protagonist may as well be an alien hit woman.Where those two films succeed are with UTS's weirdness and YWNRH's tension and mostly unseen brutality. Possessor has the downbeat atmosphere pretty much nailed on, but it struggles with ideas when it comes to depicting the weirdness of being taken over to assassinate an acquaintance and because the brutal attacks are shown in full they are really quite bland compared to YWNRH's violence which mostly takes place off screen and is stronger because of it; anyone who grew up watching Daddy Cronenberg's work won't be shocked by Possessor Uncut's gore.The acting is perfectly fine, but again, everything is very subdued tonally and for that to work there needs to be a a really strong core performance to carry it off. Possessor falls short in terms of having a memorable lead character, and it wheezes a bit in places in terms of pacing - it could easily lose 20 minutes and no one would miss them.If you're looking for a good solid B movie with a throwback style this might just scratch that itch.

Chris really starting to show how much of a titan he is in the horror/thriller world.Such a gripping experience with plenty of great blood and gore and a great cast to supplement. Great concept, executed perfectly and an ending that will leave your mouth open wider than David Cronenberg's arms to his son after seeing this.Also, great to see Yorkshire getting it's representation through the legend Sean Bean making an appearance!"}, {"id": 176, "text": "Sometimes that small thought is all it takes to lose control.Now this is something unforgettable. Since I've been waiting for this ever since Sundance. As the son of David Cronenberg, he lives up to his fathers name. Following his footsteps, this is a visual heavy film. Everything is shot beautifully, even if what's on screen is horrifying. Warm colors are brought out making a vivid picture. Then there's the added visual horror elements. There's only a couple scenes using visual effects that were most interesting to look. Not too much detail is put into it but it feels strange just looking at it. I'm not sure how to explain but it works in this situation. Everything else is done with practical effects. It gives it a more authentic and unsettling feel. The score helps set the offsetting tone as well. And since I saw Possessor Uncut, there's no holding back with the gore. I don't know any place that isn't playing this version but all audiences are warned beforehand. Some may call me a sociopath, but I'm glad they didn't hold back with this. With this story, the excessive gore made the experience so much better. Anyone who is freaked out by gore will definitely not enjoy this, especially the third act.Though Andrea Riseborough is billed as the lead, I felt most of the credit should go to Christopher Abbott. Not that she didn't do well because this is a great performance by her with the screen time she gets. But Christopher Abbott drives the whole film. He has two characters with three different personas. To break it down there is himself, Risenborogh in him, and the third act turns everything crazy. He deserves so much credit as it's his best performance to date. A good chunk of the horror doesn't come from the gore and visuals but rather the characters. Seeing them evolve into their sinister selves over the course of the film is quite interesting. You don't know who you should be siding with. All have evil roots and it's tough to connect with them. But you can't help but hope everything goes well on Risenborough's part.As Cronenberg's second feature film, he proves to be another master of horror. I have yet to see Antiviral but I've heard good things about it. And this isn't necessarily just horror. The sci-fi element bends the genre into a mind-bending film really. With every film of this type, there's always questions to be answered. Possessor does get caught up with how confusing it can get. I mainly understand most of what happened but a little more information would have been nice. Especially the beginning. There isn't much exposition on what we're getting into with this company. The film just starts and keeps going. I'm fine with this but a little more information would be nice. Overall, Possessor really did it for me. As a mind-bending, slow burn, gore-fest this won't hit well with all audience. This is for certain people and those people know who they are. I'm eager to see this again and I hope that is soon."}, {"id": 177, "text": "The Cronenberg name lives on in this uncompromising, nihilistically grisly debut flick from the son of the legend himself.A visual gourmet gore-feast, this title shows that the heir to Davids gore-tune has an idea or two about the presentation of grounded, psychological science-horror.Diving to and from stark imagery of borderline snuff-effect violence utilising restrained practical effects to more CG-oriented interpretive dreamscapes aided massively by a stellar synth score, Possessor brings to mind the psychedelic slow-downs of Panos Cosmatos as well as the gritty sudden violence of Craig Zahler. It immerses the viewer in an alt-future of bleak, often hateful existentialism, it's clever plot avoiding every possible contrivance to do exactly what it needs to, and to the most intense degree.This us all presented through the lens of a desperately unhinged protagonist, who's motives only become clear to us as they begin to for her.If a film paints itself as violent and I don't feel physically sick at least once, I feel cheated. I wasn't cheated here.9 psyche hijackings out of 10"}, {"id": 178, "text": "Brandon Cronenberg has inherited his Dad's obsession with depicting the inconsistencies and ambiguities of one's self identity in the face of social and cultural powers like media that seek to remake that identity. Of course, both Cronenbergs are masters of bloody variations, and can be seen in Brandon's recent Possessor, a horror/sci-fi buffet of blows to the mouth, neck and everywhere else with exceptional surges of the red stuff, rivalling that Shining elevator scene.Tasya (Andrea Riseborough) and Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh) control the brains of randomly selected victims through brain implants. The victims subsequently become assassins lacking free will, well mostly. Colin (Christopher Abbott), a handsome but major assassin targeted to kill his future father in law, John Parse (Sean Bean). Colin would like out, or Pull me out as the film repeats.Subsequently he and Tasya seem to change bodies or faces or both in Cronenberg's attempt to fuse Jumanji with Face/Off although the latter is a disservice to young men who love the idea of changing bodies without carnage. As Tanya begins to lose power, Colin may take over her to the extent of trapping her forever in his body. She, meanwhile marvels at the male body she inhabits. Two for one and identity become a complicated affair.Actually, while the film is partly low-rent Matrix crossed with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it does make a convincing argument supporting God's big gift to us of free will and negating the many arrows of corporate sabotage to our psyches. Cronenberg manages to make this challenging existential sci-fi romp into an enjoyable thriller. However, even those corporate bad boys are not as much in love with the representation of murder as Brandon Cronenberg.Helpfully, Colin explains some of the convoluted, inscrutable, and bloody business:Just think, one day your wife is cleaning the cat litter and she gets a worm in her, and that worm ends up in her brain. The next thing that happens is she gets an idea in there, too. And it's hard to say whether that idea is really hers or it's just the worm. And it makes her do certain things. Predator things. Eventually, you realize that she isn't the same person anymore. She's not the person that she used to be. It's gotta make you wonder, whether you're really married to her... or married to the worm.There's identity and free will-Cronenberg at least made me think about them. Now putting those thoughts together coherently, let me take another stab at it so to speak after I cool off from this chapter."}, {"id": 179, "text": "Possessor is a Canadian science-fiction thriller directed by Brandon Cronenberg and starring actresses and actors such as Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christopher Abbott. Even though the film is a slow burn, it includes quite a few graphic scenes and also features some pornographic elements. This is certainly not a movie for children or teenagers or the whole family.The story is quite intriguing and includes several twists and turns that end up being somewhat difficult to follow towards the conclusion. The film presents a secretive organization that uses brain-implant technology to temporarily inhabit bodies of other people in order to commit unsolvable crimes. Tasya Vos is shown possessing the body of a hostess who suddenly grabs a knife and murders a businessman. In order to pull out of the foreign body, Tasya Vos is supposed to make the hostess commit suicide but she hesitates and gets shot by the police instead. The demanding job has taken its toll on Tasya Vos who asks for some time off to rekindle with her estranged husband and son who know nothing of her job. She realizes that she has become hesitant, isolated and depressive but accepts the next job nevertheless. Tasya Vos takes control of a young man who dates the daughter of an ambitious businessman. She is supposed to murder the daughter and her father and make the boyfriend commit suicide. The job however becomes more difficult than anticipated when Tasya Vos discovers details about her host that she wasn't briefed about beforehand. Things quickly spiral out of control and take an unexpected personal turn.This ambitious movie convinces on numerous levels. The story is certainly intriguing and keeps you guessing how things might unfold until the very last scene. The film has a gloomy, mystyerious and numbing atmosphere from start to finish. Especially the cold sound effects and efficient lighting techniques enhance the film's dystopian vibes. The acting performances are stellar and especially Andrea Riseborough convinces as conflicted lead character whose life is spinning out of control. Despite its slow pace, the movie grabs the viewer's attention with sudden violent outbursts and pornographic elements that might however feel unnecessarily exaggerated at some points.The film's biggest downside is its own ambition. The final thirty minutes introduce a few too many twists and turns that can be understood when analyzed in hindsight but that harm the film's flow. The movie's eventful resolution doesn't blend in with the much calmer exposition, rising action, climax and even falling action. The director should have taken more time to properly tell the ending of the story instead of rushing to the conclusion.Overall, Possessor is a very atmospheric dystopian science-fiction film with an interesting story, intriguing characters and vivid outbursts of violence and some surreal pornographic elements. The movie isn't always easy to digest due to its overall slow pace contrasted by a rushed finale but there are enough creative ideas in here for the film to deserve more attention and acclaim. If you are a genre fan and like the works of Brandon's famous father David Cronenberg, then you should rent or stream this movie."}, {"id": 180, "text": "This was a movie that its trailer was being shown at the Gateway Film Center before some of the movies I was going to see there. I caught the name of it, that it starred Andrea Riseborough and was written/directed by Brandon Cronenberg. I've seen a couple of his films, enjoyed what he's been doing and Riseborough has been in quite a few genre films lately as well. Aside from that, I came in pretty blind to be honest. The synopsis here is we follow an agent who works for a secretive organization that uses brain-implant technology to inhabit other people's bodies - ultimately driving them to commit assassinations for high-paying clients.We start this off with Holly (Gabrielle Graham) sticking something in the top of her head. It is connected to what looks like an older looking dial and whatever it is, it is hurting her. She then goes off to what I'm assuming is work. She focuses in on a water fountain, but the water is moving backwards. I'll get into the significance of this shortly. Katherine (Hanneke Talbot) then calls out to her to see what is taking her so long. She then goes into work and heads directly for Elio (Matthew Garlick). She doesn't waste any time stabbing him in the neck and then repeatedly until he dies. A pistol is taken from her purse and there is hesitation to kill herself, where a policeman shoots her as well.It then takes us to Tasya Vos (Riseborough). She is answering questions about items being taken from a box by Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh). This really seems to be cognitive test. Tasya does raise some concerns, but everything from the tests seems to be checking out. They are working as a group of assassins. As the synopsis states, this seems a lot like Assassin's Creed. Instead of sending them into the past though, they're taking over other bodies, controlling them and killing assets. Tasya is the best in the business currently, but her concerns make Girder question her. They have their biggest job coming up and they're needed.Tasya then has an interesting scene where she is practicing what she will say. We see the reason is that she is a bit estranged from her husband, Michael (Rossif Sutherland), and her son of Ira (Gage Graham-Arbuthnot). This is brought up during her tests where it was thought they are no longer together, but it appears they are working things out. It seems that Tasya left, probably due to the nature of her work, where Michael wants her to move back in. She is breaking down mentally and this seems to be part of the reason she's staying away.Despite what she is going through mentally, she decides to tell Girder she is in for this next job. It seems that Reid (Christopher Jacot) wants to take over his father's business. In order to do so, John Parse (Sean Bean) needs to be eliminated along with his daughter Ava (Tuppence Middleton). Her boyfriend, Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott), is the person they're looking to take over. They want it to seem like he's acting different and be made the scapegoat. If they pull this off, they will control the business.Things become problematic. Colin is breaking the control that Tasya has over him. She thinks it will be fine, but when it comes time to act, the worst thing possible happens and it is a battle to gain control so she can make a clean break mentally or their minds could completely melt causing disastrous things for both parties and their lives.That's where I'm going to leave the recap as that gets you up to speed without really getting too much into the spoiler section. Where I want to start for my analysis is that it is fitting that Brandon Cronenberg did this movie. While I'm watching it, I got vibes of him meshing a couple of his father's movies together with Scanners and Videodrome.To break that down a bit farther, I'll start with the first part of the statement. Much like Scanners we are dealing with espionage. If memory serves me there, that is part of what they were planning to use those with this psychic ability. Here we are getting something similar, but in the sense that they're controlling the body of someone with a machine. I don't want to spoil the older movie, there is a bit with melding of minds as well and 'sucking of brains'. We see that Tasya's losing grip with reality and that allows Colin to fight back. It isn't done cheesy either which works.Then to the other part of it with the Videodrome reference. This company is going for a new world order which draws parallels there. We also get some body horror in this movie. I was expecting with some of Cronenberg's previous films and heck, his father is a master of this subgenre which is partly why I'm comparing to take elements from two of his films.I should probably shift really quickly to cover this aspect of the movie with the body horror. It was interesting, because I debate whether to call this a body horror film or not. The movie has a few different places where we get really graphic elements, but it doesn't feel like that type of movie overall. There is a scene where someone is attacked and their face is mangled. That looked real. Any of the other attacks fall into this as well. There is this interesting flesh melding scene and having Colin wearing Tasya's face like a mask. It all makes sense to the story while making it that much creepier. I do have to give credit to the cinematography here as well. They have blurry images and making it feel like we're experiencing when these people are confused as to what is going on. This was a strong part of the film for sure.To just back a bit to the story elements here, I really like this idea of assassins using people's bodies. I've already given some examples of different things that are using similar premises here so I'll shift over to the element of the brain's melting together. Tasya is great at what she does. She notices different things that should stop her from doing what she does, but ignores it. That is my take on the things defying the laws of physics like gravity. Colin seems to be pretty strong willed as well. I think that it makes for an interesting climax that went places I wasn't expecting it to. It is a bit long though. I did find myself waning in interest a bit in the middle until it pulled me back into everything in the end.I think that I should take this to the acting of the movie. Riseborough is an actress that I didn't know about until recently and she really just impresses me with the roles she's taking on. I don't want to come off as mean, but I don't find her attractive. She plays well though this disheveled look of someone who has gone through a lot. She also plays well here of being just worn out. Leigh is solid in her smaller role. Abbott is really good as well. I've seen him before and the other movie he did a good job there with his performance. Middleton and Bean were both really good as well. The later really being a jerk and he plays it so well. There is this weird dynamic of how the rich live, which makes sense why Tasya feels so out of place and Kaniehtiio Horn, Deragh Campbell and Dorren Lee help to build this gap. Sutherland and Graham-Arbuthnot are also both solid in their roles.That is really all that I wanted to go over for this movie. If you couldn't tell, I really enjoyed the concept and the story that they were building. The acting was good in carrying what they were going for and the realistic effects give it a body horror feel. I think the cinematography was also really good for helping it. The soundtrack fit for what was needed. I didn't have any issues there. If I did, it does run a bit long and I did lose interest just a bit for a stretch. It does pull you back in. This will be a movie that I will need to revisit though as there are some things I need to rewatch now knowing what happens to ensure I didn't miss anything. I would rate this as a good movie though. Not one I could recommend to anyone, as there are some vicious scenes. If you get past that, it looks at some interesting ideas for sure."}], "reviews_amount": 181}
