I applaud the courage, the genius, and the love and compassion that went into the making of this important film."}, {"id": 2, "text": "A clean, wonderfully informative production. I was aware of some of the notions put forward in this film but by no means whatsoever was I ready to be immersed with just so much factually unequivocal depth! Truly eye-opening and fantastic to see such a diverse array of characters, each with their own insights and anecdotes. A straightforward and rather in-your-face approach to demolishing the left's insistence on minority control. Superb production, cast and motive. Regardless of your political leaning, this no holds barred piece definitely gets the mind racing and questioning all that we are inundated with in the media."}, {"id": 3, "text": "This movie is incredible. I just wish it was available for the masses. I completely understand you don't want to give away everyone's hard work for free, but I wish there were a way to raise money so the title can be put on a streaming popular platform ASAP."}, {"id": 4, "text": "I cried a few times, so sad on some parts. Uplifting in others.Grab a notepad and do some research while watching. There is so much more information that can branch out of this film."}, {"id": 5, "text": "An absolute 'must watch'. By far, one of the most important documentaries of our time. Well done and thank you, Mr. Elder."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Thank you for giving us the opportunity to watch a wonderful film that rejects the victim narrative that the democrats try and push on the black community. This film is so powerful and deserves so much positive recognition. I had high expectations for this film, and it EXCEEDED my expectations!!"}, {"id": 7, "text": "A MASSIVE EYE OPENER! I'm a documentary junkie and this is one of the greatest I've seen. Extremely well put together, talking to some truly inspirational, intelligent, and motivated individuals who in my opinion holds the key to elevate Americans to the next level, regardless of race. Will be watching again."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This documentary will likely not win an academy award or even be nominated because of the Liberal propaganda of Hollywood and the media. 'Uncle Tom' should be nominated, and in my opinion, it should win. Great documentary, and one of the best I have ever seen! This is a must watch for EVERYONE around the country. It's the true history and perspectives we are not taught in the classrooms. To know this history, you have either had to live through it and/or educate yourself with books and information not accessible in American classrooms. Those that want the true history of America's political parties, and their agendas in minority communities, this documentary is for you."}, {"id": 9, "text": "This is one of, if not the most important film of the 21st century.I do not say that lightly.Everyone has to see this. It's truly life changing.It's a film full of heart, victory, unity, truth, and true patriotism - You'll never be so proud to be an American.Don't pass on it."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Have been listening to Larry for years and the timing of this movie could not be better"}, {"id": 11, "text": "This documentary could not be anymore timely. I was hesitant at first glance, but it turned out to be the best watch of the summer so far. If you want to learn about the real history of the country that no one talks about, this is the movie for you. After watching Uncle Tom it truly helped me better understand the black community and gave me a much deeper respect and love for the United States."}, {"id": 12, "text": "It's pretty powerful and chock full of facts. Larry Elder is brilliant and takes it to the Democratic party. I would be worried if I were them. He just delivered a tour de force against liberalism. As is forevermore my Indy struggle, there are bits with which I disagree, but there's no denying he knocks it out of the park...with one damning fact after another."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Made me proud, made me cry, made me ashamed that I haven't worked harder in my life. So full of facts and so full of the truth, and they are not the same thing. Only thing that would have made it better would be if it were twice as long. So thankful this film was created."}, {"id": 14, "text": "This documentary is incredibly important because it shines a light on the global manipulation from the left wing government and media into brainwashing the black community. The issue with the left is that they scream and shout whilst the right are silent. We can no longer be silent on these issues and need to spread this message of truth. The next step is to get this viral - it should be shown in all schools and be on Netflix for everyone to see. If you care about black lives you should care about this documentary."}, {"id": 15, "text": "What an amazing documentary film , it's really eye opening for many people out there."}, {"id": 16, "text": "This is a great documentary about the black conservative in America today.

Larry elder is a great person and it really shows he cares about the black community, no matter what names are thrown at him."}, {"id": 17, "text": "America faces a threat today unlike we have ever faced. This documentary should serve as an eye opener for all Americans and Republicans especially. Recommend anyone watch this film; liberal, conservative, libertarian, anyone that still logically looks at facts vice Raw emotion.The game has changed and we can not just quietly sit on the sidelines and expecting the best outcome for Liberty and Freedom. The men and women in this film know that and provide the road map to get there.Very powerful film. Well done and edited."}, {"id": 18, "text": "This movie was beyond excellent.

A lot of information that is filled with facts and an eye opener for sure! I highly recommend!"}, {"id": 21, "text": "A powerful Documentary that's shows the growing trend of black conservatism and the pitfalls of African Americans who are conservative. Larry Elder is an icon."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Fantastic and emotional journey, full of uplifting words and true encouragement!"}, {"id": 23, "text": "I am not black but this is an AMAZING film that will effect everyone!!! The red pill never tasted so good. It's time for America to wake up! Especially black America! Larry provides the viewer with all the information needed to see the truth. As a republican, this film makes me very proud. Additionally, even if you are certain of your political affiliation you should still watch. Regardless of switching parties or thinking you know it all, this will open your eyes and provide insight and a new perspective to our country's current state. I encourage everyone to watch and realize that this is a phenomenal buy. I plan on red pilling any liberal I can with this film lol! GO LARRY!"}, {"id": 24, "text": "It is sad to know how many people will have heard the facts brought up in this film for the first time in their lives. On the contrary, this film is emblematic of a growing movement of people thinking independently and not just believing the lies told to them in public schools or by the media. That gives me hope!"}, {"id": 25, "text": "The was absolutely amazing!! Informative, inspiring and a completely new veiw that everyone should take a look at!!"}, {"id": 26, "text": "I went into this film with an open mind. I found that not only does it provide a voice for a group of amazing people, it provides quite a history lesson as well. Now if you will excuse me, I've got some history to go read up on!"}, {"id": 27, "text": "I have been listening to Larry Elder for 5 years now and I can't believe more people don't know about this man. He has made a movie that is the perfect argument against the Democrat party as well as gives some tough love to the Republicans. Not only is it full of information but it is compelling, beautiful and makes me proud to be an American. This is what America is about. If the Hollywood left weren't afraid of views that aren't their own this movie would be a shoe in for an Academy award nomination. I used to watch all the nominated documentaries and in the past 10 years they have been awarding some unwatchable movies. I'm not saying this because I'm conservative. I have enjoyed many documentaries I disagreed with politically. They are now just nominating movies because of politics not quality. It's a shame. Please give this a shot. Movies like this need to be supported."}, {"id": 28, "text": "This film can start a revolution within the black community, which is why it must be spread as far as it can go! Congratulations and thank you to the films creators and cast because this I believe will create real change in the minds of our African American brothers and sisters, which is why the media will most likely try to suppress it, but we must not let that happen!"}, {"id": 29, "text": "If you believe in the American dream, this is the movie for you to see. If you don't believe in the American dream, you should watch this movie anyway because you will likely be inspired by it. This is a gem and I really hope that this is made available for the public to watch for free because it needs to be seen by anyone that actually wants a better United States of America."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I just watched this movie and it could not be more relevant for the times! This movie clears up so much... It is hard for me to put into words how much what you see here can change your mind. Watch it, just watch it, buy it and watch it. You will be glad you did."}, {"id": 31, "text": "Although not American, but have lived there on many various occasions, I am heavily invested in American way of life etc. This movie is an absolute must watch as there are always two sides to every story. For me Uncle Tom gives you a a clear and clean lens to look through history of America never been told and to see for yourself the plagues of corrupt people and parties disguised as one would refer to as wolves in sheep's clothing preying on any of the vulnerable and weakUncle Tom was a great history lesson I knew little of, and makes me proud to know that there are just and honest people who are not afraid to stand up for the truth. A great example to the rest of us across the globe.A Kiwi from NZ"}, {"id": 32, "text": "This is a must see for all Americans. Quite simply the best 105 minute education I have ever received. I admire the courage, the intellect, and the character of those that participated in this masterpiece. I am in awe, and I am inspired. Thank you."}, {"id": 33, "text": "If this is completely accurate, then this is huge. Was hyped since I saw the trailers. Was not disappointed! I would love it if the documentary was even longer. I want a squeal. I really am liking Larry Elder's views as well as several other's views in this documentary. I think it is reasonable to say that every American should watch this, and that's coming from a Canadian. Eh."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Everyone should watch this film! It makes so much sense of what we currently see in culture and government. Like connecting the dots. It is sad that so many people are falling for the main stream narratives. It is to the detriment of the country as a whole. If what is presented in this film is true, what are you going to do with that information? We are under attack from within. Its time to wake up and put a stop to those wanting to destroy this country. So thankful this film is bold in challenging the staus quo. Vote accordingly my friends."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Fabulous movie.....finally someone telling truth after truth!"}, {"id": 36, "text": "This documentary is thoughtful, kind and empowering in its delivery. i wish somehow this were required watching in our schools!"}, {"id": 37, "text": "Simply put, this should become required viewing for all Americans...black, white, Hispanic, Asian, other! This film is about taking responsibility for self and not allowing ANYONE to define you based on your skin color or ethnicity. It's about how America is the greatest country ever to exist in history in spite of how the left has tried to smear it and re-write its history. If you focus on the guiding principles set forth by our founding fathers you can accomplish anything you set your mind to and be anything you want to be even in the face of ignorance of a select few. If you don't succeed in the USA, you have no one to blame but yourself! Kudos to Larry Elder and the rest of the cast and crew in developing this extremely well done masterpiece on the REAL history of and current condition of America."}, {"id": 38, "text": "This documentary is timeless and will be on my top list for all time!"}, {"id": 39, "text": "An ACTUAL documentary that examines what plagues the black community and how we ALL need to think for ourselves and not get caught up following others. Well done, Mr. Elder! Bravo!"}, {"id": 40, "text": "All of my favorites in one informative, amazing film. I've watched it 5 times and it just keeps getting better. A true representation of our history you just won't see in schools anymore, sadly. Made me cry, think, and laugh! Well done! \ud83d\udc99"}, {"id": 41, "text": "This film needs to be made readily available to the masses! Everyone should watch and take a long look at themselves, their core value and belief system, and recognize the love the people featured here and so many more have for the black community!"}, {"id": 42, "text": "I'm not american, never been to the US, I live in an Eastern European country and I loved the movie and don't regret purchasing it. The message of self reliance is universal, the message of hard work is universal. I often watch videos of black convservatives to lift my spirits and give me a kick on days when I feel like slacking off. People like Larry Elder, Candace Owens, Kingface and Brandon Tatum have powerful carisma, sense of humor and magnetic personalities and I enjoy their message because it's universal."}, {"id": 43, "text": "The amount of history laced throughout this exceptional documentary is astounding. Everyone should watch this. It's incredibly important. Facts are facts. We currently live in a society where no one wants to know/seek the actual truth. They insist on being spoon-fed and trust those giving them the poison without question. Thank you for this!"}, {"id": 44, "text": "A real eye-opener, thanks for standing up to free speech. And enlightening the importance of a free mind in this increasingly hostile world we find ourselves in."}, {"id": 45, "text": "Great documentary on the history of the political system in America and how it affected minorities since Lincolns abolishing of slavery. The way the world is today you have to educate yourself so please take the time!"}, {"id": 46, "text": "This documentary was unreal. I could watch this 100 times. We truly live in the greatest country on earth. With hard work and the right attitude, anyone can be a success!"}, {"id": 47, "text": "This documentary is necessary in a time where interest in politics have reached fever pitch while the masses are driven by emotion. It focuses on the strength of the black community - it's resilience, tenacity and it's ability to overcome in spite of tremendous obstacles. Black history is an integral part of American history and Uncle Tom presents this fact beautifully."}, {"id": 48, "text": "What a phenomenal, informational documentary! I have sent it to other Latin-Americans in my community because this isn't just about black America or white America, it's about America - our history, our culture, the origin of some embedded misinformation, and our current ideologies. It's time for all of us but especially the minorities in this country to wake up!"}, {"id": 49, "text": "What an amazingly well put together movie. This documentary made great points about the Democratic and the Republican parties. I applaud the courage from everyone involved to put the truth out there. The long form interviews were all so interesting to hear. The score was beautiful and emotional. Altogether excellent."}, {"id": 50, "text": "This film took my breath away. I am an avid reader and thought I knew about the past and how we got to the present but was I wrong.This film spoke to me because I grew up poor with a mentally ill mother. I got in trouble all the time, no father figure for guidance, gotnin trouble and raomed the streets doing what I wanted too. But I turned it around by working hard and educating myself. I believe so many people will identify with this film like I have and hope as many people will watch it as possible. It will educate and also enlighten you!"}, {"id": 51, "text": "Very educational documentary, every American should watch this!"}, {"id": 52, "text": "A wonderfully gentle and informative documentary.My title gives what I think are the main messages of the movie, and I think we can all benefit from the advice!The movie gives a lot of viewpoints and historical information, but doesn't hit you over the head with them - which I loved. Of course, many of the people unapologetically share their conservative/Republican viewpoint, but that's why they made the movie!"}, {"id": 53, "text": "This is one of the best films I have seen! This film should be seen by everyone ESPECIALLY our younger generation who is blindly buying into the radical left narrative. So we'll done. I will be showing this to my son and sharing the trailer widely to spread the word!"}, {"id": 54, "text": "Really well done documentary with compelling and powerful information. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to hear the other side of the current political narrative."}, {"id": 55, "text": "The true history of the Democratic Party is not pleasant or popular. The Party's failure for Black Americans is obvious. The Black Conservatives profiled in the film are, of course, attacked by the mainstream media. Their courage and strength to speak out in the face of constant ridicule is inspiring!"}, {"id": 56, "text": "As an Asian American I can relate to this documentary whole heartily. It was so informative and a glimmer of sanity at this point in our nations chaos. This film needs to be seen by everyone."}, {"id": 57, "text": "My only criticism of the movie was it lacked closed captioning. We watched the dvd with my hearing impaired Mother-in-law and it was very hard for her to understand. It would be great if you could add closed captioning to the dvd; unfortunately though that's too late for me in that I already purchased my copy."}, {"id": 58, "text": "You won't be disappointed. Black history like you've never seen before. Must watch!"}, {"id": 59, "text": "This by far is best woke documentary I've ever seen! I have friends of all races watching and they are blown away by how much they have been deceived over the past 30 plus years! Some are even considering removing their children from public school system and two of my daughters friends have decided on a different college choice because don't want to be influenced by left wing liberal professors!!!"}, {"id": 60, "text": "This film was masterfully done. I went through a range of emotions while watching - pride, sadness, joy, hope. I feel that this film will lift people, of all walks, up and out of the pool of despair that we find ourselves in. Please watch this film. Even if you feel you will not agree with the message. Watch it. It could bring so many People together. Well done!"}, {"id": 61, "text": "I created an IMDB account for the first time just so I could rate this doc. This film is not only educational about the history of the Republican Party but truly inspiring and reinforces the American ideals of hard work and perseverance. I had been feeling down with all the things happening in our country and this film gave me the renewed energy and fortitude I needed. My only regret is not taking advantage of the deal to purchase both the on demand version and DVD so I could watch it over and over again. Thank you to all who created this documentary!"}, {"id": 62, "text": "Everyone in America needs to know the true history and tactics of the democrat party, not the ridiculous version written by progressive historians. I expected nothing less from Larry Elder. He is more truthful than anyone in the media. Dems don't like him because they're embarrassed by their own legacy, as they should be. I would give it a 100 if I could. A must see for everyone everywhere. Red pills are usually hard to swallow but completely necessary."}, {"id": 63, "text": "Whether you agree with everything in it or not, that it promotes self responsibility and condemns self victimization is enough for me to give it a 10. As a Nigerian that grew up in the UK i was told to vote the Labor party (equivalent to US Democrats) and supported US democrats up to 2016. I was disappointed Trump one but since then my eyes have opened. The constant attack on him and liberal MSM constantly pushing race really turned me off liberals. Add to that the wacko SJWs and the cultural appropriation army getting mad at non-black people braiding their hair was the final straw. Racism exists in USA like every country out there, but it is no excuse for the anybody's shortcomings TODAY. I should know, I live and work in Germany and before that the UK."}, {"id": 64, "text": "Thank you for sharing the truth and giving the perspective that so many try to bury. So refreshing to see you all cone out of the shadows, UNAFRAID!"}, {"id": 65, "text": "This is the true black history of our people. I assumed that I wouldn't be interested in this documentary but to my surprised I had to watch this several times because I love it so much. And every time I view it I learn something new.Share this with friends and family, especially with your children."}, {"id": 66, "text": "I was really upset at the number of children aborted by planned parenthood. This is eugenics to the worst degree. The film is amazing and I hope everyone gets to see it, but unfortunately it's hard to un-indoctrinate the left. Conservatism is the future of a prosperous America for all of it's people."}, {"id": 67, "text": "I highly recommend this movie! Your fans demand a sequel! Uncle Tom is an extraordinary documentary that should be mandatory in our schools. I am a social worker and therapist who works in the black community and I will buy this film for many of my clients. All I can say to Larry Elder and everyone involved in this production is, Nail Hit On Head! Finally the truth is told in a concise, relatable and even entertaining way. It keeps you focused intensely while being impeccably produced which makes it wonderful to watch. The content is shocking of what blacks had to endure with the many lies of democrats and their all too willing media accomplices. Thank you Mr. Elder and all the voices who need to be heard."}, {"id": 68, "text": "Very informative and different perspective than what is highlighted generally as the black point of view of and in America, especially today. Mentioned some policies that have been bad such as welfare and paying more when the male is out of the home. Would have been great to highlight policies that have been positive changes under Republican platforms or policies that would be better to facilitate the changes to be made or...I missed it and the focus is self-sufficiency and individualism; keep government out of the way and don't look there for solutions.I wish there would have been names of people speaking and shown at the bottom of the screen because I am not familiar with everyone.It was released on Juneteenth. Glad to have watched it before the 4th of July.I wish it was more readily available. I really wanted to watch it with my 16 year old on the television. We have an xbox and started the process but too much to type in to set up the account in that manner, no link to paypal for easy payment. Logged in on my computer the next day and ordered download and DVD. A few days later finally got her to agree to watch it with me and struggled to log in on the browser through the xbox. Playback kept freezing. Tried an alternate browser on smart tv and similar problem. Wish it would be more readily available through alternate streaming platforms like Amazon or Youtube.I would appreciate Candace Owens and some of the others participating in a panel with BLM members, T.I., Jay Z, Marc Lamont Hill, Charlamagne Tha God, maybe a teen who had been on locked up or scared strait after they have watched the movie for a discussion about the historical facts presented.This movie seems like a really great piece to refocus energy towards personal success."}, {"id": 69, "text": "At the time of writing this there are 22 users who have rated this as 1 star.

It exposes clearly the charletans that have manipulated the black vote for their own ends for decades."}, {"id": 70, "text": "Thank you so much for this documentary! It is wonderful to listen to everyone's story, truly moving and inspiring. It is a shining light in a time where we are indoctrinated with hysteria, hate, crime and drama by the media. It is a breath of fresh air to see intelligent individuals being inquisitive, looking for answers and sharing the facts and their story to help others. Everyone needs to see this. We are all in this thing together."}, {"id": 71, "text": "I was blown away by this well done and informative film. After I watched it, I had my older teens watch it and my husband. I'm telling everyone I know to watch it. Right now in the US, everyone is talking about how it's important to listen to our fellow black Americans to understand racism in America. I'm SO glad I started following Larry Elder and other conservative black Americans to understand their perspective. I love the history and statistics that were provided in the film to equip people with these important, but often not talked about facts."}, {"id": 72, "text": "A great documentary. Educational.

Amazing job to the entire crew that managed to produce this documentary."}, {"id": 75, "text": "This should be required viewing in schools. Better than any similar documentary PBS ever made (sorry, PBS), Uncle Tom traces the history of black Americans in relation to political trends over the years.

It took so long for me to open my eyes. This film was the straw that broke the camel's back. I was told by 2 high school history teachers that democrats and republicans literally shook hands and changed ideologies. Thomas Sowell, Larry Elder, Candace Owens, Tim Scott, Herman Caine are my political heroes. Thank you for the history lesson you can't find anywhere else. God bless America!"}, {"id": 77, "text": "As a Mexican American, I can tell you that when it comes to politics, we as a community or group of people share the same challenges when it comes to supporting the Republican Party. I don't get engaged in conversation, I get attacked by my own people and called racist names for simply daring to think differently. As within the black community, some within the hispanic community will try to guilt you into submission if they cannot change your mind with ideas. I recommend everyone watch this movie to not only better understand what many in the black community go through but the challenges many in all minority communities face when it comes to being an independent thinker."}, {"id": 78, "text": "This is a beautiful made. This is the history of America that is not taught and will NEVER be taught.Make sure your friends and families watch.Dr Thomas Sowell and Dr Walter Williams or Dr Carol Swain will never be recognized by the leftist and biased education institutions or the leftist main stream media.To Larry Elder - excellent work, truly amazing!

How I have been misinformed my whole life! This documentary was inspiring and so well done!"}, {"id": 81, "text": "This is something you will never see in the mainstream media. It is an honest account of what it is to be a true American regardless of color. It's a stark contrast between 1960 and 2020. Democratic policies refuse to allow America to move forward as illustrated here."}, {"id": 82, "text": "Many of the folks on the left will call it hateful and will not give this film a chance. Even if they do watch, most will not watch with open hearts and minds when actually this is an uplifting and hopeful film. Larry Elder and all the people involved in the making of and appearing in this film should be commended for their courage. Thank God there are people like that are willing to risk much by being truth tellers, I believe they do so out of love for their fellow man and I love them for it. This film should be required viewing for all students in America so that they might get some small measure of a balanced view of the civil rights movement, the origins and ambitions of the democrat party, the history of the war on poverty and the welfare state, and other vitally important subjects. I hope and pray, and do believe, that this film will change hearts and minds and lives for the betterment of all. God Bless!!"}, {"id": 83, "text": "An absolutely amazing documentary.

Democrats will replace the Black vote with the Latino vote, she is right. With our communities drawing parallels in the effects of father absence, abortion, welfare, education, and other factors. Democrats drive this narrative that our community is only composed of immigrants and laborers. Furthermore along with immigration, they push the same agenda they have pushed for the Black community.

As a white man who is not racist I refuse to allow others make me feel as a racist. Since the George Floyd murder i have learned alot about the history of our country, slavery and black leaders I have never heard of. I use to think Booker T Washington was a great high school football team in FL. Why did i never learn about Mr. Washington growing up? Frederick Douglass I never knew about him and what he did for his race. Please watch this and investigate what the leaders say about the history of our country.

This movie is both informative and up-lifting. There are many black heroes in America's history, and the present, that need to be brought to light and this movie does just that. The facts stated in this film will explain a lot about how victimhood and political agendas are ruining racial relations. There are plenty of examples of those who have left the Democratic party after realizing these historical events that led us to today. I encourage everyone from both sides of the isle to watch this movie. There is plenty that we can all agree on. And also, thank you for explaining the myth of political party switching.

I first discovered Larry Elder shortly after the George Floyd incident. I found a video of him and Dave Rubin. I was stunned to hear the data Mr. Elder shared which contradicted the widely accepted narrative that black people are being killed by cops at a disproportionate rate compared to any other race. So I was very excited when I saw this documentary was about to be released. In fact, I watched it the minute it became available at midnight on Juneteenth (1 am my time). I was floored and couldn't get to sleep afterwards because my mind was racing.I used to consider myself a Centrist with Conservative leanings, mostly because of the abortion issue. But after watching this documentary, I am staunchly opposed to the Left. This documentary is an eye opener to say the least.

This documentary exposes the lies the black community has been force fed for so many years, making Larry and his team the number one enemy to the Democratic Party. This is probably why no one in Hollywood or in the news media outlets have said a word about the documentary (how ironic, I thought they always claimed to be progressive).If you're ready to hear the truth, want to critically think on your own, and are ready to have your mind blown so many times that you lose count, please buy this documentary.

To be sure, these types are included in this film, but much of the time is focused on the mindset of your average-Joe and average-Jane citizens, who studied history for themselves and chose the conservative paradigm and pathway. You will be surprised by some of the individuals profiled, and regardless of whether you agree or disagree with their conclusions, they will surely make you think.

Immediately after I saw Brandon's interview with Justin Malone and they explained more about it &amp; the reasoning behind it I bought the movie and was in awe. It's so well done. It's was very moving listening to all their stories and sad to hear the difficult stories. Carol Swain's story is important and we have work to do there. The most important part for me, besides the history lesson, was when they were talking about messaging. I don't want to add spoilers so I will just say, this is a movie everyone needs to watch. Parts of it are hard to watch but we must. We are in a time of good vs evil and we all need to come together, no matter our shade, and support one another.

Between him and Dennis Prager, the veil was lifted from my eyes and I learned the truth that I really was a conservative after all. And now, finally, Larry and company have made this outstanding film that hopefully will reach more and more people than even his radio show and TV appearances have. I cannot believe that most people, no matter their color, subscribe to the radical agenda that the Left/Democrats/Media constantly pushes on us as if no other way of thinking is valid.This film is fearless and encourages anyone who watches it that you are not alone, and you can be fearless too."}, {"id": 355, "text": "Wow. As someone who lives in Southern California it is always told to me just how malevolent and unfair America is. This film throws away the smoke and mirrors and just tells it like it is.

Your reaction directly correlates to your education of history, and reveals why we are having so many of the problems we do today.This film is 10/10 and is highly recommended to anyone who wants to be successful and find out the path to a happy, free life.

It made me sad that I as a conservative white 60yo woman hear so few white voices in our culture that equal what these black voices are saying with such wisdom. The white people in power are falling all over one another making fools of themselves while theses black men and women are pointing to the true path forward for all of us. And they do so without threats or hostility. I give thanks to God that he has placed all of you (and so many others) in America at this time in our history. We need you!

Even if you come away not agreeing with everything you see and hear, you will not see the world in the same way afterwards. The speakers are all black men and women, but that should not be taken as this being a black only documentary. Everyone should see it and think about the implications raised."}, {"id": 552, "text": "I have so much respect for everyone who participated in the making of this documentary. It was so informative and really eye-opening. Every person needs to see this."}, {"id": 553, "text": "This has to be probably my favorite documentary I've ever watched honestly... It is so thought provoking and all the individuals involved were so articulate. This film helped educate me on history, black culture, and politics. I have such high respect for the people in this video like Larry Elder, Candace Owen's, Brandon Tatum, Kingface and Chad Jackson for standing up for what they believe even if they get insulted/chastised. Thank you so much for preaching the truth and facts, you all are admirable people. This documentary has educated me on politics and why I cannot trust the left wing media or Democratic politicians without verifying the facts. I see why I align with conservative views because it makes rational sense and conservatives know what they are talking about. Facts matter and all the individuals in this documentary were such a privilege to listen to. God bless you all and I hope people wake up to the false narratives in our country!"}, {"id": 554, "text": "Finally, a documentary about conservatism that really says it all! I've always been forced to send my leftist friends a mix of YouTube videos explaining why conservative principles and the Republican party ultimately provide the most equality and opportunity to all Americans, especially black Americans. Now I can just link to Uncle Tom, and it's so much better when it all comes from black conservatives in one cohesive narrative. So powerful, so thought-provoking. Even I learned a lot, and I listen to these folks all the time. I was truly inspired most by Chad Jackson - just an average person like me, not famous, but trying to make his life and the world just a bit better by running his own business and with God as his guide. Larry Elder, bravo and well done!"}, {"id": 555, "text": "Educate yourself and watch this documentary. Everybody should see this movie. Many of the people in this movie have become heroes of mine."}, {"id": 556, "text": "This movie really opened my eyes to the way the mainstream media fails to cover the black community's real crises. This is a compelling documentary well worth watching!"}, {"id": 557, "text": "To find the truth you must actively pursue it. The Americans profiled in this documentary all have that in common. They sought out the truth and found it. I am lucky to have found this documentary and was inspired by the men and women in it; their open-minds and free-thinking are emblematic of everything America can be for those who wish to pursue their happiness. Truly inspiring. Thank you."}, {"id": 558, "text": "Good Information. Would like to see more like this."}, {"id": 559, "text": "Thank you for making this movie! I loved it. It is just what our country needs right now."}, {"id": 560, "text": "Larry Elder is the ultimate truth-teller and this documentary will blow you away. I thought I knew about the Democrat party but this documentary brought to light the insidious way that this party has destroyed black families in America. I gained such an appreciation for how far black families had come before Democrat parties took away the family unit, made African Americans dependent on welfare, took away hope and destroyed cities for generations. As one of the subjects in the documentary stated, Democrats had their hand in every policy that hurt African Americans going back to slavery. Shameful. I'm so glad I saw this film and I recommend it highly."}, {"id": 561, "text": "It's very encouraging to see others that look at facts and dispute the myths. While it is odd that the film was in black and white I find it interesting given the subject of the documentary. I'm also proud of those who spoke up in this documentary and shared their views although they will receive backlash from their peers and fellow African Americans."}, {"id": 562, "text": "What an inspiring documentary. If you have a thirst for diversity of thought, and don't mind challenging yourself to entertain the thoughts and viewpoints of the honest minority in America (black conservatives) this is the documentary for you. Full of rich, little known, historical facts, Uncle Tom takes today's most pronounced narrative of systemic racism and the plight of Americans, who happen to be black, from the civil rights movement to today, and turns it on it's head. This film is for free thinkers only. To those who have been taught what to think instead of how to think, consider this a trigger warning. To those who can think for yourselves, this is a must see. Thank you to everyone involved in the making of this film, sincerely."}, {"id": 563, "text": "This has to be the most ignorant documentary I've ever seen. It was absolutely cringeworthy. The way they spin facts to fit a narrative is awful. I am fairly educated (Masters degree) and I cannot stress enough how uneducated these people sound. I thought I was going to see a movie on how Black Conservatives rationale their beliefs. Instead, it turned out to be a bunch of hollow arguments about why Democrats are bad. It gave me a headache."}, {"id": 564, "text": "This documentary is so well laid out. I was pleasantly surprised to see how much this movie syncs with Up from Slavery, the autobiography of Booker T. Washington.This movie should be shared with as many people as soon as possible."}, {"id": 565, "text": "Being a white female, but also being the minority growing up in my neighborhood, different colors is all I knew. But somehow I didn't hear any of this history. I have always heard that the parties switched and that republicans were the bad guys. I am so thankful for seeing such necessary historical information and it completely reshaped how I viewed American history in the 20th century. Thank you to the bold filmmakers and those featured in the film. You really opened my eyes to a much better racial America that I never knew!"}, {"id": 566, "text": "I thought this documentary showed that not everyone thinks the same. It showed that the narrative that is sold as the only way to think is false, it showed that people of every race have the right to think for themselves"}, {"id": 567, "text": "First, I did not catch all the dialogue because the music/noise was so loud it drowned out some of the words. I hate having to back up to try to relisten in hopes of catching the words, so I don't. And my high tech TV emphasizes the voices and I still couldn't catch everything. Next, just who are these people! They must be identified when they first appear and a couple times more along the way. Waiting until the end was not useful. Turn down, or off, the music/noise. Next, tell us who is speaking. These should be givens in any docu or movie or TV show, etc. I did give it a high rating anyway. I love the subject and it's a critical piece of work for the ages to educate. What I now appreciate is that two of Black men have since passed away and Larry has preserved them in this docu. They both deserve to be studied for generations. There are a couple other aged geniuses who will now live forever and be studied as well they should. Since I follow this issue, and follow Larry and others of his stature, I already know much of this. Still, it was great to watch them in this format and this docu will join my library of great film education."}, {"id": 568, "text": "It saddens me that so many Americans, especially Black Americans, are woefully misinformed about history and politics in America. Our education system is broken with leftist ideology being taught to students. History is being rewritten and/or misinterpreted and then taught to students as factual, when it is merely personal opinion/interpretation of the teachers. Students are rarely exposed to the views of brilliant Black Americans like Larry Elder, Thomas Sowell, Dr. Carol Swain, Candace Owens etc. Politicians, public school teachers, media and social media platforms have united in indoctrinating Americans and preventing opposing views from reaching the masses. The strategic takeover of America is the same strategy used by Communist &amp; Socialist dictators - Control education and all forms of media and infiltrate the government with your operatives. The Democrat Party uses the guise of social justice to implement their policies when, if fact, their policies keep Black Americans and all minorities dependent on government."}, {"id": 569, "text": "A beautiful film. It is essentially people telling their stories. Some of them have had turning points, others more or less carried on where their parents left off. All of them are inspiring - they seem to hold the key to their own lives. They come across as thoughtful, effective individuals with a great strength of integrity. And some of them are very funny as well!"}, {"id": 570, "text": "My only complaint is that the creators didn't include ALL of the material they gathered. I could listen to these fabulous interviewees all day. Could they just have a live-stream TV show literally traveling all around the nation, to each town, where we just get to know all the amazing patriots who are getting it done day in and day out? A thousand thumbs up. Unending hugs and kisses to all my hard-working, freedom loving brothers and sisters around the world."}, {"id": 571, "text": "I bought the CD so I can donate it to the Library.A must see."}, {"id": 572, "text": "Eye opening look into the experience of black conservatives.

I have my pen and paper and noted brilliant and true statements that I will refer to when speaking to some people who don't get the Distorted narrative that is being programmed into so many. Thank you Mr Elder. You deserve an award for sure. I wish everyone especially high school and college students would watch this."}, {"id": 575, "text": "I had the pleasure of watching this eye-opening documentary movie earlier this year with my mom during quarantine. We didn't know much what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised by the quality and depth of it. My mom and I both really enjoyed it, and it definitely opened our eyes a bit more. I highly recommend it!"}, {"id": 576, "text": "I learned about Larry Elder by chance and was hooked by his ability to deflate conventional wisdom on many topics, like race relations, police brutality, and root causes of inequality. He's certainly helped me change my mind on a few topics. This movie was a made well and is a way for all to learn about other black, conservative thought leaders of the past and present. Highly recommend this to anyone, regardless of your political views."}, {"id": 577, "text": "Food for me mind and heart. Thank all the protagonists."}, {"id": 578, "text": "This was a wonderful documentary. My girls(age 46] had made me aware of some of this information but I had no idea how extensive this indoctrination was."}, {"id": 579, "text": "I've never understood why people wanted less information when making an educated decision. . For those people don't watch this film. It shines a light on so many things purposely left out of black America. Kinda makes you wonder why people would leave such important details out of history..unless it didn't go alone with their idea of what people should be or vote for. Then again, in slave days black people weren't allowed to read or write as a way to keep them dumb and easier to control. The issue discussed in this film showcase SOME of whats been left out of black history and it's another form of controlling a community. Such as 70% of black boys in CA can't pass basic reading exams yet people keep voting the same way expecting to be liberated by the people who have enslaved them. This film starts to break some of those misconceptions of who's actually fighting for you."}, {"id": 580, "text": "I'm glad I watched this. Very eye opening to see this perspective!"}, {"id": 581, "text": "I knew about Larry Elder beforehand, but I was unprepared for the power of his new documentary, Uncle Tom. Watching it occasionally brought tears to my eyes, but also anger in that the true story of black America is not being widely told. Everyone ought to see it. Bravo!"}, {"id": 582, "text": "It was informative to see the facts about how the Democrat Party has attempted to make black Americans the perpetual victims in the way they see themselves in America and how they continue to try to politically exploit them based on this mentality. Uncle Tom is a documentary that needs to be watched by all."}, {"id": 583, "text": "In my humble opinion, if politicians and media took time to learn and understand the facts and insights unearthed in this movie, the black community would be far better served by them"}, {"id": 584, "text": "If you want to see an issue from all sides instead of just one this is the movie for you. Well written, informative and provides new insights never discussed in the media. Shows the untold racism that exists in American culture today. This should be included in every class or degree that purports to be about Black America."}, {"id": 585, "text": "This is an outstanding documentary that I recommend people on all sides of the political spectrum to watch. If you would like to hear from and understand the perspective of some of the most highly respected black leaders in America, this is your movie!I am a amateur American history buff so this was right up my alley! There are so many documentaries that seek to deep dive into all that divides us in America, to the point where they end up further sowing the seeds of dissention. This video is the anathema to those others where those casted lay a roadmap for improving race relations. And finally, it is not a white person trying to speak for the black community. It is some of the most amazing and accomplished black leaders simply talking about how they have traveled the difficult road that is life."}, {"id": 586, "text": "Definitely recommend watching this film. Honest views from our fellow Black Americans about what is needed to help make them and this country successful. Proves that putting people in categorical boxes hurts all of us. The GOP would be very wise to continue its inclusive growth and to focus on economic success for all Americans."}, {"id": 587, "text": "Larry Elder, along with the other celebrities of this film, have become an inspiration to me and I hope many more. There should be no currency in victimhood because most people in life are victims of some sort. No abled person could afford to become enslaved by welfare. All participants in this film epitomise people who are truely free and I admire their dedication to also share that phylosophy with every person around them despite many obstacles including media ridicule."}, {"id": 588, "text": "Excellent production. More people should be exposed to this history!"}, {"id": 589, "text": "The content in this film was astounding. With liberal agendas, lies, and twisted narratives being pushed in the mainstream media, education, and entertainment so long I literally thirst after the truth. Thank you for the truth, Uncle Tom."}, {"id": 590, "text": "This is a movie every american should watch. As we move closer each day to socialism, movies like this will be banned. Unfortunately we are repeating history from the 1930's in Europe. When the left finally takes over we will have our scarlet letter that we will have to wear. Conservatism is viewed as a disease by the left, although no one can point to a case where socialism was ever successful. It always ends in tears. The brave people that made this film have my utmost respect for standing up for what they believe is right. When will you stand up? You must defend your freedom because as god is my witness, they are coming for all of us. Thank you Larry Elder, Candace Owens, and all who contributed to this magnificent film. God bless America."}, {"id": 591, "text": "This film is a an excellent view from real down to earth Black Americans that want their voice to be heard. They show what true American grit looks likes. With this country being split by division under every issue possible, this is the unifying message we need to hear. God Bless everyone involved with this project."}, {"id": 592, "text": "Uncle Tom gives voice to black conservative Americans, a voice almost entirely drowned out in mainstream media. Listen for yourself to why these men and women became conservative."}, {"id": 593, "text": "We were so encouraged by the wonderful testimonies given by various African Americans in this documentary. How they became conservatives after so many years of being TOLD they had to always vote Democrat. True freedom!! This is a must watch for all black households as well as whites - everyone needs to be educated NOT indoctrinated!"}, {"id": 594, "text": "I have no idea why it took so long for the truth to be compiled about what has been happening in Black America for so long, but at last it's here. This film should be seen by every single person in the country, and especially younger people. I would have hoped that it would have been demonetized and released for general audiences. PBS, NPR (radio version), and BET would have been wonderful outlets, although the odds of any of them showing it would be abysmal. Hopefully this movie will open doors for likewise future productions to gain better exposure in the mainstream markets. The truth about why and how Black America got to its current state must be exposed for all to see, for the betterment of all of us."}, {"id": 595, "text": "The genius of this film includes the cross-section of participants to whom Mr. Elder gave voice in this concise and inspiring documentary. As a rancher and horsewoman in Wyoming, I was awed by his insight to include the woman homesteader who beautifully articulated the spirit that motivates us.

There were a couple I didn't know! And I was so sad to hear that Herman Cain died, I guess not too long after you made it! He was a fine man! As were all the people in it, except Candace who is a fine WOman!"}, {"id": 603, "text": "What a great documentary. If only this could have been more publicized so to be viewed by more people. I so love the black conservative."}, {"id": 604, "text": "It's the woke folk who have in reality fallen asleep. They have slept through the history of the last 60 years in America, losing the essence of what life in these United States truly offers.For those who have eyes to see, Uncle Tom reveals this to be a land not of systemic racism, but of systemic opportunity. Guarantees of success? Decidedly not. Rewards for perseverance? Decidedly so. A level playing field in most situations? Absolutely, but that won't ensure equal outcomes -- never has, never will.For those who'd choose hard work and a potential face-plant to a guaranteed income and a nanny state that swaddles, the America of today beats the woke vision hands-down. And, if you choose to play, you'll be judged far less on the color of your skin than on the content of your character!"}, {"id": 605, "text": "Well done.

It's filled with common sense which isn't very common..."}, {"id": 607, "text": "Many of the people featured in this film I am already familiar with or follow and I enjoyed meeting others like Allen West and Jesse Lee Peterson. I absolutely loved Herman Cain's segment. The whole film was powerfully constructed and it's so disappointing to me that when I ask blacks I know if they are familiar with many of these people, the answer is often no. While standing in line to vote, the young woman (white) in front of me was reading Candace Owens' book Blackout so I engaged her about it and recommended this film to her. She said I was the second person to recommend it. I plan to show it to my retired neighbor when she is comfortable enough to leave her coronavirus induced panic isolation. We all need to do our part to make this film known."}, {"id": 608, "text": "I don't want to be a spoiler, but this is an outstanding documentary that gives many insights into our society. The Democrats have used Blacks in America, over and over, and they're doing it today. This film exposes the many policies and practices that have ruined the lives of numerous people.

It accurately depicted the black conservative experience and the journey many took to shed the shackles of the plantation group think and see the left's deceit and manipulation. Larry Elder uses facts and statistics to refute the left's narrative. Black conservatives are independent and courageous in the face of condescension and hate from the left and blacks who expect conformity. I have recommended this movie to others and have shared it with friends."}, {"id": 614, "text": "Very helpful perspective on 2020 events especially race relations in the USA.

This solidified and provided even more proof of how since the 60's the, when the trend of black America was moving out of the poverty line and 75% were in two parent homes, the policies of the left have kept them down and in poverty, at best slowed the upward trend, replaced hard work with this victim hood oppression, wether on purpose or ignorantly, and this an awaking.

It was also powerful when Ben Carson was being attacked for saying blacks were like immigrants and then you hear and see Obama say the exact same thing - yet the leftist media never said a negative thing when Barrack said it. You also have the beautiful and intelligent Carol Swain - what a great lady. Then of course you have Candace Owens. What a Rock Star she is. Young, smart, beautiful, fearless, and articulate.

I was very moved by the accounts of the young conservatives featured in this movie-especially when they tell of their awakening. I was saddened to learn that until now the real success stories of black Americans have been either suppressed or denigrated by the term sell out.

I am 79 years old and I remember what it was like back when. The blacks today don't have a clue what it was like back in the 50's &amp; 60's. Things were improving well until Lyndon B. Johnson created his War on Poverty to lure the blacks onto his plantation of Dependency. I witnessed with my own eyes in 1969-70 what was happening to Black families. Women came to the Legal Aid Society where I was interning while attending law school to get a free divorce so they could get on Welfare. Marriages were destroyed by the Democrats and then Planned Parenthood reared it's ugly face to abort mostly black babies. Again, by the Democrats. So, Uncle Tom exposes all of this very well.

As far as politics goes in the hood, almost every black American I met was a democrat, where as most of my immigrant friends were neutral or more conservative.

People like Elder, Owens, Sowell, Tatum, Hodge x 2, and ABL (to name a few), risk everything to tell the truth. These people are heroes in my eyes. I probably won't see the whole movement, but at least I've seen the beginning.I've seen the deleted clips and I really am upset the Biden-Segregationists connection parts were left out.

But this documentary was part of my questioning of that tradition - I may well not do so this time around, in part thanks to this film. Certainly when it comes to the question of racism in our country, I have become aware, as this movie illustrates, that the Democrats have spouted too much political correctness, which does not serve our fellow Americans well.This documentary does a great job explaining why.For a start, as the film shows so powerfully, the Democratic Party starts out as the party of slavery (why would any people vote for any party with that history now matter how much they claim to have reformed since?), then the party of Jim Crow. Contrary to my own assumptions, most of the House representatives voting for the late 50s to mid 60s civil rights bills were not Democrats (since there was still a large contingent of Southern Democrats) but Republicans. Thus, Republicans have done more for the African-American community than either of the two parties, by a mile, as the documentary powerfully shows.The movie also explains well the Democratic Party-supported War on Poverty, which was disastrous for our African-American brothers and sisters - leading to mass dependence on government handouts at the very moment when they had just won their freedom from Jim Crow and were ready to stand on their own two feet and enjoy their newfound freedoms. Of course, most did just that, especially those who left the South for the Northern small towns and suburbs, so the War on Poverty mostly negatively affected those in the big Democratic-run cities, peoples who probably yes were struggling financially, but who with the support of their family and with hard work and perseverance may have succeeded in the manner of the Jews, and of other minorities, even if their circumstances as a people were different than were the descendants of the planet's last slaves. Instead, what we now call the inner city was in many ways carved out by those Democratic policies - which also broke up the families, led to fatherless homes, and the rise of the African-American juvenile delinquent, with the resulting gangs, drug culture, anti-establishment sub-culture that has continued to this day via gangsta rap, and the tragic violence we hear of too many times in daily news.This great movie is about the conservative blacks who queried the official Democratic line - that these conditions were caused by racism (we still hear that today in Black Lives Matter and in the Democratic Party), or that we should therefore as a result offer even more social services that will lead to more dependence, or affirmative action policies aimed to redress prior grievances - all of which send young people completely the wrong message, which is that hard work and perseverance through school and jobs will eventually reap rewards.Uncle Tom of course refers to the slave who speaks in glowing terms of his master, and many of these black conservatives view the black Democrats in such a fashion, kowtowing to an ideology that has not served them well - dependence instead of freedom, grievance redressing, affirmative action, and trying to correct perceived (or real) racism in ways that make people feel weak rather than strong (especially when research shows that real racialists are more likely to soften or eliminate their extremist views when they meet real minorities, through human encounters, and not when minorities are being protected by equally thuggish Anti-Fa types (as though minorities cannot think for themselves and need white thugs to protect them) or via attempts by whites to redress disparities on behalf of a victim, which itself leads to endless victimization psychology at a time, half a century after civil rights, when they need to move beyond that thinking to succeed in their lives.Thus, I applaud the makers of this film for painting such a powerful picture of these brave black free thinkers who stand apart from the crowd, most of which they find is made up of Democrats, and who attempt to show their fellows that the Democrats have not served them as a people well at all. This was not something I was aware of to that extent, and so this movie did a great job of opening my own eyes too."}, {"id": 841, "text": "First off THANK YOU MR. ELDER!

I was denying agency and responsibility to black individuals for their current choices regardless of our history. POC folk you can make it in America; many do.

Sadly, the curriculum in our education system is just as biased as the leftist media. And this is what our children are learning. The Democrats have a built in recruitment tool in the education system. I've learned it'a incumbent upon me as a parent to provide my children an opportunity to see both sides and then they can make an educated decision about what they want to believe.

There is clearly so much material to cover it's impossible to fit it all in and I'm sure plenty got left on the cutting room floor.

The Americans profiled are heroes -- not because they're right, which I strongly believe they are, but because they have the courage to speak up despite all the risks of doing so. Many who claim America is inherently and systemically racist say we need to have a national conversation about race. However, they not only want the entirety of what they're saying to be accepted without question, but they also claim, in true totalitarian fashion, that anyone who doesn't speak up in agreement is part of the problem. I agree we need that national conversation; in that regard, everyone should both get to speak and be willing to listen with an effort to understand. The common goal should be to get a clearer picture of what's actually at issue and why, so we can all move together towards a better place. To that end, great Americans like those featured in Uncle Tom need to have a seat at the table and be heard. To that end, given how they have been treated to date, we should all work to amplify their voices."}, {"id": 1037, "text": "This movie is definitely an eye opener for anyone looking for a truthful view.

This movie glosses over JFK and his efforts for Civil Rights with MLK to quickly move to LBJ and his welfare program, which has helped millions get out of poverty, but does have many issues with it mention in this movie.

Racism, or let's say hate, won't be cured by any government or political movement. Also because these movements are not what they seem to be at first sight. We all need to start seeing our world more clearly and take a good look at everything, most importantly ourselves. And we do need to see that division and blind accusations will not better any situations. I'm glad to be realizing this at twenty-one years of age. Our schools don't teach us how to think for ourselves, so we got to do that on our own, since most parents are not exactly up to speed either. So, if you see how the theme of race, inequality, etc. could be different than presented to us all the time, watch Uncle Tom. It could be a film to wake quite a few people up.

If you perceive the world as oppressor and oppressed , then you will actually get what you expect. All those perceptions are invisible and not real - they are only real if you spend your time looking for them and then use them as excuses for your failures and shortcomings. Once you take ownership of your life and accept the challenges, you will make progress. You may fail but you are in charge, you will get up and try harder.

Let's talk about the REAL reason this is a Red-Pill Moment. It's because black conservatives are rarely represented positively in film and media. THAT'S why this is 10 STAR. Fact is, this SAME film can be made Pro-Liberal and has been. Some statements in the film were just flat out right wrong. One example: 1st: Ben Carson saying, There were other immigrants brought over in the bottom of slave ships that worked even longer and ever harder for less... Uhhhh, who were these other immigrants? Brought over on slave ships? 100% FALSE. 2nd: Film states Barrack Obama said the EXACT SAME thing. 100% FALSE. Barrack Obama said, It wasn't always easy for new immigrants. It certainly wasn't easy for those of African heritage who had not come here voluntarily, and yet, in there own way were immigrants themselves. If you can't see the difference in those quotes, you shouldn't be watching ANY documentaries. This film is teaching that minorities and women have been treated without bias in the modern era when statistics and social experiments has proven this is 100% FALSE. This film is taking a minute part of the black population that has been successful and pitching it as The Red-Pill to erase white guilt and place the 100% blame on black people victimizing themselves.

Uncle Tom explores and breaks down this stereotype. Whether you are Republican or Democrat, it should be appalling to see Black Americans who are debating serious ideas in the public forum called such horrible names. We need to enter a stage in our country when we can have a vigorous debate on public policy while respecting one another. This documentary systematically and brilliantly outlines the well-reasoned political ideas of several Black Republicans while also highlighting the very real persecution they face from Democrats who, while claiming to be inclusive and diverse, oppose them with insults that would make David Duke feel ashamed. No narration-just interviews, news clips, archival footage, and ideas. If you can't stand the idea that a Black person would support the Republican Party, do not watch this documentary. It is too well done. You will be angry and frustrated. If you are interested in learning about a diversity of perspectives, participating in sincere debate, and removing personal and societal stereotypes, you will thoroughly enjoy this film."}, {"id": 1352, "text": "Most of the negative reviews I read were either from the perspective that is was propaganda or not well made. It's certainly less propaganda than anything Michael Moore has done, and it really isn't poorly made.All that aside, I love watching documentaries from every perspective, even when I disagree, because I like to know how people think and how they came to the conclusion they did, and for that, the documentary gives excellent context for where the people interviewed are. (agree or not, you can clearly see why they think the way they do.)The biggest criticism is that it glosses over JFK. I don't think it was done to minimize the efforts by the democrat party's leader, but rather the fact is he just didn't do very much in terms of social justice. I think explaining the complexity of the Democrat party at the time and how Kennedy was an outlier who supported civil rights but didn't actually do anything is a narrative people don't want to believe. The truth is, when people talk about the southern strategy by Nixon it can easily be debunked by simply looking at the states Kennedy and Nixon carried through their primaries and campaigns and it becomes obvious why the Democratic VP had to be a war mongering Klansman from South. But this is such a misunderstood era, so much so that if you ask people who initiated the Vietnam war and who ended it, they'd say Nixon then Kennedy instead of the other way around. (I tested this theory and I haven't met anyone yet who answered correctly.) So I think, instead of complicating things, they just left it out.Overall, I don't know if it will sway anyone's political beliefs. Feature length's movies are generally only watched by people who want to invest the time, and if you already disagree politically, you won't invest the time. But as a narrative, storytelling (or more like a collection of stories and examination) it's pretty well put together. There's more emotion than you'd think and if you're on the fence or just curious about black people in America, it's a great movie."}, {"id": 1353, "text": "I thought this was a good documentary about a subject that that rarely gets any spotlight: the black American conservative.This documentary looks good and has a great score (so happy there were no ambient hip hop beats that are usually used in documentaries about anything related to black America!). I thought the interviews were well shot and well edited and I really liked the fact that It was shot in black and white. I definitely thought that the latter half was the stronger half, the information really started to get interesting and I felt like I was exposed to some new ideas that gave me food for thought.The first half was a bit of repetitive and (this is just my opinion) I would have liked to have seen some more Jesse lee Peterson! I also think that it might have made it more interesting if there had been some interviews from people who challenge the narrative to add an extra dimension and give the whole thing a little more energy.Overall though, I thought this was a good watch!

The movie is factually packed, and left me astounded at figuring out how much I was never taught in high school, and I'm only in my mid 20s, so it was not that long ago.Uncle Tom evoked so many positive tears and emotions, and it personally helped dig me out of a dark place as it dislodged the racial wedge that so many seek to hammer into our country. It helped me realize that I need to stop allowing others to lambaste and berate me for my white skin, and that this racial division that the left pushes is beyond nonsensical. It helped me reaffirm that we're all Americans, and that skin color is meaningless. It helped me feel proud to be an American again.The movie is a must watch for people, so much so that it leaves me conflicted given the fact that it costs 20 dollars and can only be found on the website, rather than youtube or netflix. Then again I do understand that it's not as easy as making it free and just putting it on these big platforms. However the movie's powerful, positive, and hopeful message, as well as factual foundation is arguably too important to put behind a 20 dollar fee.

That's the power of the mind. If you believe you can, you can. If you don't, you really won't. Older generations grew up with this.

There are so many people that are waking up it may have been easy to find someone. The so-called lead had already been through the transformation so it wasn't that much of a revelation. Also, they needed to go into the background and the history of the word Uncle Tom. I still don't know all the details of what it is bad, where it came from etc. I agree with some of the others that there needed to be more graphics and I think they could have done some more footage in color like the current story of the main guy.Other than that, I highly recommend this to everyone and I wish it would be shown more widely like on netflix."}, {"id": 1358, "text": "Ever heard of Dr. Thomas Sowell? Dr. Walter E. Williams? Dr. Carol Swain? Black Wall Street? Probably not. And why is that? Because history is written by historians and the rich and vibrant history of black Americans was not written by them, but FOR them. Every year, when black history month approaches, you hear the same names and stories. Academia and the media are decidedly Left, and any black conservative who has a story to tell is not celebrated as an equal, but diminished, denunciated, and silenced. A successful black conservative, instead of being called a hero, is called an Uncle Tom. This film offers a cursory review the history of black America - one that you've probably never heard - but largely focuses on the postbellum attempt by Democrats to return black Americans to the plantation. A place where they can live in subpar housing, receive subpar healthcare, receive basic food and provisions, but MUST behave exactly as they are told. The film focuses on the lives of black Americans who have removed the blinders placed on them by the Left and have decided to make up their own minds and lead their own lives. It reveals the nasty vitriol they have had to endure as they have spoken truth to power. It explores the fruits of American capitalism and its transformative power to propel anyone - black or white - into the life he or she desires to live. It defines true freedom as the ability to be an individual and not behave as prescribed by any sort of agenda-driven political group. This is a fascinating, uplifting, poignant documentary. A challenge to do more to reveal America's history through the prism of the black community. A call to action to remove the true obstacles to African American success, complete with common sense solutions. The timing of this documentary's release could not have been more apropos. America needs more documentaries like this - the sooner the better."}, {"id": 1359, "text": "This is a film that has an honest message, and definitely paints a picture of the hypocrisy of modern media and politicians today.I write this review (as many of you who are also writing or reading) as a large group of people are challenging the idea of America with the false narrative of a country that thrives and functions on hatred, slavery and oppression. As someone who worked in a poor black community of a democratic city during Obama's presidency, I came back ten years later to find that not much had changed. In many ways, things had fallen even more apart.The outcry and anger that has been raised by intersectional intellectuals and cultural marxists within the Democratic Party immediately rang as false to me. In many ways I see the very things they are asking for already in place for many years. They just want more of it.Their claims are contrary to the lives of young people I had gotten to know. I had observed many young people who had no parents. The community itself felt hopeless. The despair in these communities had an effect on teachers, police and students. Going to work was a constant upward struggle in trying to prepare yourself for the next heartbreak you would have to hear.All of this helped to spun people into not having a very high opinion of themselves and not much hope in their own capabilities. Violence and horrific schools contributed to what appeared to me to be an endless cycle of heartbreak.As George Floyd's murder broadened into a bigger discussion on equality and civil rights in this country, I found myself ( like many of us) unable to sleep. I wanted to know what happened. Why have these communities not shown any signs of changed lives? This film does a thorough job of explaining what has happened to black Americans over the last 100 years. The claims and research resonated because I have seen them firsthand countless amounts of times working for a non profit. And it breaks my heart.I write his now, almost dreading the Fourth of July. I found out that all of my black coworkers refuse to celebrate this holiday, even when the basic principles of our constitution gave Frederick Douglass the ammunition and the evidence to show congress their hypocrisy in his speech, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?For every young man that throws his life away by pulling the trigger. For every person who lost their life on the opposite end of their gun, I see my students. As an educator, you can't help but see your students as your own.As the most evil of evils ( a white christian man), I want to see young black men and women in this country have hope in their eyes. I want to see young women have families with their husbands. I want to see those children have an actual home to grow up in. I want to see them live in communities in which they don't have to dread going outside past 7. I want to see them thrive.So thank you Larry. This film gave a lot of concrete information.

The Great Society programs, for example, have greatly injured the black family.Today, many black Americans have been red-pilled, aroused from slumber, awakened from the status quo which only served to prolong their plight as a victim class. Blacks were a convenient group to champion (read exploit) via liberal policies which kept them on a modern plantation of government dependency.This is the very model of the Democrat party. Democrats grow their rolls by finding a victim class to exploit, stripping them of their individualism, and placing them neatly into a box called a voting bloc.If you dare think for yourself, if you break out of the box, the voting bloc, then you are called names, consistent with the title of this documentary. Suddenly, it's okay to hurl racial epithets at the black independent thinker. And who are the racists?The momentum is growing. More black Americans are waking up and leaving. Witness the Walk Away and Blexit movements. Regardless of their pigmentation, many Americans are seeing the lies and exploitation for what they are. And they are leaving.May this documentary reach deep into the hearts and minds of many Americans and lead them to the real America, not a land so much as an idea, an idea called Liberty.

The film adds a diverse flavor by featuring not only well-know black politicians, media figures, and authors, but also contains in-depth interviews with everyday black Americans ranging from small business owners to farmers. This is especially powerful in educating the audience as to how wide-spread the scorn for black conservatives remains.The documentary is well-paced and devotes just the right amount of time to the different facets of being a black conservative. Most importantly, it explores the reasons why those being interviewed have embraced a conservative world-view... and this is where the documentary really shines. The various members of the cast give facts and solid arguments that are hard to dispute. There is never a denial of the existence of racist individuals, but instead they dispel the notion that Black America is being systematically oppressed by institutional racism. Little knows facts about the astounding progress that blacks made after the Civil War come to the surface and make it hard for modern naysayers to explain why blacks cannot succeed in a society where black Americans face less discrimination than ever.This is a must-see film for those who want to see a side of black history that isn't taught in schools today.

Hearing the other black men talk about their fathers, and how they appreciated them, made me realize how lucky I was, to at least have my father at home.I didn't really think about it, but I never had the desire to participate in bad behavior as a youth or other forms of debauchery.

Admit it or not, ideas of this man were imported here after the war and the Democratic party continues its legacy. By promoting human weakness and dependence on the state they have stripped away what dignity remains. No longer are the values of what can you do for your country important but rather what can the state provide is lauded and championed.In this movie, we see AMERICANS realize the potential of what our founding fathers envisioned.

Uncle Tom exposes the incredible mean-spirited tactics of traditional black liberals in their treatment of black conservatives. 3. Uncle Tom educates us on the truth of the cohesiveness of the black family unit before it was blown up by Democrat policies in the 1960's.One final takeaway: Uncle Tom should scare the Bejusus out of all those Al Sharptons, Jesse Jacksons, Trevor Noahs, Don Lemons, Cornell Wests, and others in the political/entertainment/news/academic arenas, because they're time is short. BLM, seen in this light, is nothing but the last cry of despair of a dying ideology. All of these black conservatives are as much trailblazers as Frederick Douglass and MLK were. They're my heroes. May God prosper them, direct them, and give them success."}, {"id": 1369, "text": "This is not only a great history lesson for America but is also a great documentary. It speaks the truth, not only for any black American who is a conservative, but also for any American about what is means to be a conservative. As a Hispanic minority (and proud American citizen) I believe the bravest people in this country are black conservatives who face deep hatred and scrutiny from their own race for thinking for themselves and for not pulling that Democratic lever each time. It's not about black or white, it's about being able to think on your own and make your own choices in life and not being brainwashed by those who exploit you. This is the perfect film that symbolizes the quote from Malcom X that the white liberal is the worst enemy to America, and the worst enemy to the black man.This great film should be seen by every American and especially by those who need to be educated so they can see the truth. Unfortunately the ones who need to see it the most will probably never see it and toss it away as being right wing propaganda. I believe I heard Mr. Elder say that he has been interviewed by several foreign critics but not by one single critic in the United States. That should tell you all you need to know... they can't handle the truth. Kudos to Justin Malone's excellent filmmaking and to Mr. Elder.

We will have to actively seek the Truth for ourselves and understand that it will be counter cultural and may even ostracize us. It will also hurt at times as well. It may even turn our entire worlds upside down. But Christ urges us to press on for it. Our Creator hardwired in our souls a desire to obtain the Truth and to know Him and thus fall in love with Him. Why, because only then can we live free and unrestrained, truly liberated from sin and evil and thus truly posses love and passion in our thoughts, motives and our actions. This documentary will help explain why the left would seek to rob us of our religion, freedom, dignity and independence. It has become abundantly clear which side is evil and which side is good.

Uncle Tom must be seen by every American, regardless of race or any other slice of life. For too long, the Democratic Party has strived to fence off black people in America in one way or another. From slavery, to Reconstruction, to Jim Crow and segregation, to the current state of dependency on government. Each of these steps in the historical experience of black people in America was engineered by the Democratic Party as a way to control black people.Uncle Tom exposes this by illustrating those largely unheard black voices swimming against the current and the challenges they face just being heard. This documentary exposes the atrocious manipulation of blacks in America by the Democratic Party, where blacks themselves impose a fascistic uniformity of thought and opinion on each other. What this documentary proves is that the label of Uncle Tom really belongs on those doing the bidding of the Democratic Party's effort to control black people to limit the robust debate within the community for nothing more than partisan political advantage.People MUST see this video, to educate themselves to the fact that there is NOT uniform and monolithic black political opinion.

No. But are the ideals still worth defending and striving for?

As the narration began I felt that I was in much of the same position as those being interviewed. I was for Obama in 2008 so I watched thoroughly all the way through. One thing I couldn't help but notice is this theme in which the narrator did the most to try and remove the wool from over the eyes of black people in America and why they think the way they think. That wool specifically being the democratic party and their ties to racism. Ironically instead of doing so it seems to be more of a desperate attempt to pull the wool over their eyes and accuse the democratic party today as still the democratic party of racism. It rejects the notion that there was anything good done for black people by the democratic party and notes that when there was a great event in the history of black people, e.g. the civil rights act, that it was the Republican senate that pushed that law into being. It leaves no ground left for any credit for the Democrats that were in power and continues the narrative that it is the Republican party that has stepped out of the way of black people and allowed them the initiatives and resources to compete in America as they should be able to today.The problem that I see is that much of what is stated is anecdotal through out the documentary. They speak of events, but they never really give you any substance to track yourself and do your own research. It relies on the interviewees to fulfill the theme that black people are used in politics today, but the problem is all of the interviewees are well known right wing pundits, personalities, and/or voices. There are no independent voices, no democratic voices to help corroborate the ideas of this substance. In fact the entirety of the end of the movie pulls together the net that reveals itself as cast to pull you away from your ideals that the Democrats could ever have your best interests in mind. It does nothing more than speak about President Trump in a way that highlights how he has been the best president for conservatives in history, and tries to further this idea by applying it specifically to the black population. What Uncle Tom succeeds in doing is bulldozing over any possibilities that the rivals of the Republican party are of any use to black people. It uses inflammatory terms to rile up the audience by asserting that legislation by the democrats has been a sort of slavery 2.0, and then paints a picture that black people who are called uncle toms, have seen the light, and would like to welcome these lost, ignorant, and too dumb for their good black people out of their sleep and into the Republican party where they have belonged all along.The problem with this documentary is that it's a bait and switch. Its incomplete in its efforts to contrast because it relies solely on the voices of people who are all adversaries of the party to which they are accusing. It in itself becomes a trial by those in the Republican party to prosecute the Democrats instead of painting a full picture that would, at the minimum include Democrats and Independents, and at maximum have documents or evidence that would clearly show that what they are spreading is sound truth. It's a documentary with little documentation to be reviewed which is a shame because considering the name and the impact to which the original book it was derived from(Uncle Tom's Cabin) I was really hoping there was going to be much more than the emptiness I felt afterwards and have ultimately come to characterize this documentary as being."}, {"id": 1381, "text": "Conservatives are really bad at marketing good ideas...

Black and White vs Color. I know there was a reason for the black and white. but I would have preferred color... why? cause it sticks out. when they were going back and forth in history. it would have really highlighted the black and white scenes for us to listen to.2. Graphics. Like many of the documentaries that are projecting the left agenda I wish there were fun graphics that we could screen shot and show. I know this is preference. But when I see a documentary like 13. It's those graphics that really speak louder than words.3. Explanations Like I shared in the beginning. I think the speakers did a good job explaining. But I cannot remember some of the points they made. I would need to go back and listen carefully. I would have enjoyed it if they had a fun enthusiastic person share a voice over while showing graphics.4. Who was the audience? I share my points and reviews because I think this film does bring alot of very important points and questions. However I felt that this documentary was catered to and made for the conservative/black/republican/christian/libertarian group. Which in that case they succeeded. But then I can see the other side being bored and disconnected.5. Resource Acknowledgments of materials, places, and resources to help others do their own research. Everyone mentioned resources but was not very clear. Wished towards the end there was something saying if you have been questioning and need a safe place to talk, because it is a very divisive convo, it would have been cool if this film shared some of those places.If I was a foreigner and I watched 13 vs Uncle Tom...

Facts, figures and history glossed over and ignored by most media outlets further buttresses a hypocrisy practiced by Democrats before the Civil War until now.Other than its completely over the top music score, Uncle Tom's greatest drawback is that it threatens to become an add for the Republican Party while it backs up Dem double dealing as the party of the KKK and points to its attempts to derail 60s Civil Rights legislation. This bias aside Uncle Tom is a devastating expose that probably should be shown in all American classrooms to bring some balance to this conversation that is plaguing America.

Unfortunately, a lot of Americans bought into the lie and this movie clearly breaks the lies down so perfectly.I loved the movie / documentary and hope the rest of America can see it soon."}, {"id": 1396, "text": "Ok, so I purchased this movie to both support Larry Elder and because I knew I would enjoy it. I just didn't know how much.First off, my white husband and my white self have followed Larry Elder, Thomas Sowell, Brandon Tatum, Candace Owens, and several others LONG before this movie was made. Also, I have been asking some questions like why do black communities feel oppressed? for years. I've dared to ask this question to many of our friends who might be able to shed some light on the subject and edjucate us.This documentary answered questions I didn't even know I had. I thought that I would watch it once and enjoy it, but that would be all. I was wrong. There is so much information in this documentary that I had NO IDEA had happened! Some of these things were never mentioned in our history books (I did not go to a white school, there were all races there).Since watching, I have ordered several books to help me understand things like, how did we go from emancipation and Booker T. Washington (and others like him) to our current world circumstances, or to the need for the Civil Rights movement in the 60's? I am buying several copies to send out to friends who may really want/need to hear this. I feel like there is so much more information out there and Uncle Tom just barely scratched the surface!This is so good, take a moment and watch!! You won't be sorry, but you may want to start doing some research of your own!"}, {"id": 1397, "text": "I respect Larry Elder and looked forward to viewing Uncle Tom, but I wasn't prepared for how powerful it is.I'm older, so I can say it knocked my socks off. I watched it with my son, who didn't mention his socks, but did say it blew him away. His positive take was a big deal, because he has spent the past 4 years freeing himself from the group think of his liberal friends.I had helped my son's journey back to the light by showing him videos of bright minds like Larry's, who he had come to like. He was excited to see the full movie, and as usual. Larry work stoked good discussion afterwards.I honestly don't know if my son is far enough back to vote for Trump this election. Maybe. Maybe not. But he's on a course to be a thoughtful, RATIONAL citizen. Whether he makes it into the R world this time around is almost immaterial, because he has come so far from the dark dogma of the liberals. and Uncle Tom has played a part.Thank you to Larry and team for superbly illuminating the world of thoughtful, pragmatic conservatives, and most importantly, of showing it attracts and welcomes people of every color."}, {"id": 1398, "text": "My oldest grandson is as black as Obama - what we call hapain Hawaii ; I.e., a white mom, a black dad &amp; incidentally, a Filipino step-dad, with a mix of grandparents that Includes African, Hawaiian, Chinese, Filipino, and northern European ethnicity. Racial identity politics don't go far in this family. I loved the stories told in Uncle Tom - stories of people who decided to think for themselves, pursue goals that entailed obstacles, and willingly changed their thinking in order to accept responsibility and accountability for themselves - for better or worse. The men and women in this film are the kind of role models I desire for my black grandson &amp; for all my grandchildren. Hawai'i is not discrimination free - isn't perfect - yet cultural and ethnic diversity is the norm here. Those who seek to manipulate, victimize or radicalize people based on the color of one's skin are equally to blame for the contentious state in which America now finds itself. The movie Uncle Tom provides a message of courage, hope and integrity that everyone needs to hear. God created a single race with individuals uniquely designed for God given purposes. The individuals in this film demonstrate how to go about discovering and pursuing such purposes."}, {"id": 1399, "text": "Being raised Christian, I was always taught to never think that any person was better than another person off the simple basis of skin color. To say that America functions under a totalitarian system comprised of racial discrimination is the furthest thing from the truth imaginable. For the Democratic party being the supposed party of fighting for the rights of all colors, I have never seen so much hatred and hypocrisy. I remember when the term Uncle Tom started making its way around the world, oozing out of the MSM and the lies it promotes, and being utterly disgusted when I found out what it meant. This movie has taken what little I knew about that disgusting term, and has shown me the struggles a black person will go through should they have any other belief outside of the sphere created by Democrats. I wish this movie could be shown in schools so that ALL people - regardless of color - could get some different points of view. Sadly, this movie goes against the narrative of keeping blacks and other minorities slaves to the Democrat party. For those that are curious what it's like on the other side of the fence, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. I recommend following Larry Elder on social media. See what he's about for yourself, and, if you hunger for more, get this movie."}, {"id": 1400, "text": "I was very intrigued by the trailer. I was not very familiar with many Black conservative figures in our country but this summer I became acquainted with several scholars and authors, notably Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele and Jason Riley, among others who are more centrist or left-leaning. This film introduced me to several well-known and many private individuals who are on the right and, apparently, get called 'Uncle Toms,' as if they were simply sellouts. I really admired everyone profiled for their patriotism, courage, optimism, warmth, work ethic and self-motivation. I felt very emotional thinking about how messed up our political culture has become such that everything becomes political and polarized, and people are demonized and lumped in with the extremes of their 'side.' To think that the talented, honest, and civic-minded individuals profiled in this documentary get dismissed and called hateful slurs simply for having different beliefs or values that are still aligned with our shared (or once shared!) founding liberal principles is really sad to me and a bad look for the left, which claims to be so tolerant of 'diversity.' I haven't felt politically homeless ever in my lifetime, but in 2020 it's where I find myself. My people are on both the right and the left, care about truth, integrity, and personal responsibility. They know America isn't perfect, but it's a great country that holds promise for even greater accomplishments. We need to do the hard work to progress, not get complacent and certainly not abandon the ideals and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. I hope more people will see this film, and whether they are or are not on the right, will see how much they have in common with their fellow citizens. The race of the individual is irrelevant. The person's humanity and values are what count. Perhaps we can in the midst of this ugly political landscape, start to reenvision ourselves as Americans, first and foremost."}, {"id": 1401, "text": "With the release of this documentary so close to the events sweeping over the Nation in the wake of George Floyd's death, I was curious to hear a different perspective. Candace Owens (featured in the documentary) went on record on June 3, 2020 to say she would not support George Floyd and the media's depiction as a martyr for the black community. This statement caused me to want to know more so I looked into Candace Owens a bit deeper and found the Uncle Tom Documentary.Ladies and Gentlemen, Fellow Americans of all Race - this Documentary is Eye Opening and Truth Revealing. We think we learn what we need to in our public education system, but it is truly blind to the truth. This documentary goes deep into the FACTS and not the twisted perspectives that the media uses to miseducate and mislead the masses - especially the black community. This documentary is filled with successful Americans, who happen to be Black, that should truly be looked to as examples to emulate!My favorite story was shared by Herman Cain (Rest In Peace) when he recounted being promoted later than a specific white co-worker several times in the 1970s. He approached his supervisor and inquired why he as passed over, despite having the same level of performance and results. His supervisor shared with him that his counterpart had a Master's Degree and that's the only reason why he was promoted before Herman. In that part of the documentary, the smile and gleam in Herman Cain's eye meant everything. He realized the color of his skin had nothing to do with it and he refused to have a victim mindset. He went out and obtained a Master's Degree. The next time a promotion came about - Herman was selected because there was no longer a degree separating the two individuals.Please - regardless of your beliefs or experiences - watch this documentary. Educate your mind with a different narrative - a true narrative - with no hidden agenda but to help all Americans from living life with a victim mindset."}, {"id": 1402, "text": "So...my title needs some explanation. When I was a freshman in high school, our school took a trip to Washington, D.C. It was very educational, &amp; life-changing. I went to a small, church-run school, &amp; the trip was considered an outreach trip. We helped soup kitchens, did some work on a housing project, &amp; took the Word into the inner-city.I grew up in Oregon &amp; had lots of family in Montana, so I've seen my fair share of Indian reservations. The conditions in some of them are atrocious &amp; heart wrenching. I was reminded of them when I was in DC. One housing project we went to stands out even now, 30-odd years later. The paint was drab, every window &amp; door had bars, the grass around the building was completely dead &amp; there were needles &amp; trash strewn about...&amp; the grass...sparkled. I looked closer, &amp; realized it was ALL broken glass. Kids couldn't have played on this lawn if they wanted to!It was then that this young skull full of mush realized that while the reservations were 30,000 acres, the reservation I was looking at was crammed into a city block, &amp; hoisted 30 stories up. Those are just arbitrary numbers, but still...As a grown man, I have learned far more about the Democratic Party's true history. I have watched them take advantage of my fellow black citizens, while also taking them for granted. They treat all minorities the same. They take advantage of them, &amp; try to completely control them...to keep them on the reservation...My fellow citizens, my brothers &amp; sisters in Christ, REJECT THE RESERVATION!!

However, that documentary provides little to no evidence or statistics to prove their point, and fails to answer the most obvious question: As humans, are we not responsible for our own actions?Uncle Tom absolutely destroys 13th in every way. If you watch these two movies back to back, you will see the difference of victim culture vs facts and statistics. Who do you believe makes the better argument? To me, it's blatantly obvious.Every American, black, white, brown, and green has the same rights and abilities to achieve the American Dream, and you will see that time and time again in this film.

If they act, think and feel like a winner, they will be a winner. Therefore, we must look at the oppression that has taken place in the past. We are told that slave owners were oppressors and they were, 100%. But the democrat party has a long history of using the black people as pawns. CNN and MSNBC seem to leave this out. Uncle Tom reveals the truth and it is eye opening. As a white male, I am amazed that black leaders continue to tow the democrat party line. They have been lied to for decades. Their neighborhoods ravished by democrat policies. Don't blame me for the fact that over 70% of babies are born without a dad in the home. But past democrat policies can be shown top be the cause. Everyone should see this movie if you want the real truth of what happened to the black family.

Despite being somewhat of a 'student' of race relations and associated politics, there was a lot of content in Uncle Tom that has furthered my education. The history of America, like any country, includes good and evil. This film highlights both aspects. The intent of the 60s legislation was clearly to do good. However, Uncle Tom highlights how those policies have failed black America for decades. Uncle Tom refutes the claim that the parties 'switched' following the 60s legislation. The ladies and gentlemen starring in this film should be commended, as they are very brave and courageous people. They are true leaders. They all question the false narratives about black America sold by liberal American politicians, the mainstream media, academia, Hollywood, pop culture and athletes. While parts of Uncle Tom may bring tears to your eyes, it left me with a feeling of hope. I now have hope that America, not just black America, can maybe have a productive dialogue about race relations and put the sins of prior generations behind us all, once and for all. Everyone should watch Uncle Tom, regardless of your race, political party, age, etc., and watch it with an open mind. Doing so would be a good start to a positive discussion on how to move forward together, as one America.

When watching the film you see how sharp and intelligent these great patriots are due to the fact it is nearly impossible for African American conservatives to live in a bubble as they are consistently forced to challenge their own views and face strong pushback and slander for the views they hold. I have always said the nightmare scenario for the left would be for blacks and whites to be United behind common values of strong family unit, patriotism,individualism, and conservatism.

And that is the best way I can sum up this wonderful documentary... it was inspirational. Produced by the estimable libertarian author, radio talk-show host and political commentator Larry Elder, Uncle Tom, is a movie whose title refers to the disparaging remarks and invectives hurled at blacks who have the audacity to question Democrat pedagogy. The backbone of this documentary is a series of insightful and personal interviews conducted with prominent African-Americans such as Allen West, Candace Owens, Larry Elder, Herman Cain and many others who have embraced conservative principles.In spite of the title, these interviews did not dwell on the aspect of being a minority within the black community or on the injustice of being called disparaging remarks. Instead, the participants demonstrate a strength of character and a fighting spirit that allow no room for self-pity or defeatism. They all have come to terms with the consistent personal attacks and have embraced them as a badge of honor. This documentary is shot in black and white, a creative masterstroke by Director Justin Malone that adds immeasurably to the impact of the interviews. With no distractions from colors or backgrounds, the emphasis is solely in what is being revealed through the interviews and through the narration. It is so much easier to concentrate on the faces of these great Americans and make an emotional connection with them, to not only understand what they are saying, but to feel what they are saying. A perfect illustration of this emotional connection is an interview with former presidential candidate and talk show host Herman Cain in which he talks about seeking advancement in his early career. When he speaks of an exit interview he once had, in which his white supervisor tells him, You've taught me something... I've never worked with a black man before and you taught me not to judge someone by the color of his skin, Cain pauses and purses his lips, the emotion of the memory is so very clear and so very powerful that you can't help but be moved by it.It's just a beautiful, beautiful piece of documentary film-making. And since the history and evolution of this country is of utmost importance to the content of the interviews, the black and white imagery also lends an important historical gravitas to Uncle Tom. Historical footage of the antebellum South, through the Jim Crow Era, continuing through the 50's and 60's mesh beautifully with the richness of the black and white interview footage, accurately portraying the true history of the Republican and Democrat parties. So many of the younger participants in these interviews, such as Candace Owens, Chad O. Jackson, Damani Felder and several others express a sentiment bordering on betrayal to describe their reaction to never having been taught the Democrat Party's participation in Jim Crow Laws and the KKK, as well as their opposition to civil rights legislation and public school integration. These revelations served as the epiphany that led them to question their allegiance to the Democrat Party and eventually leave it.Another common thread that ran throughout all of these interviews that truly inspired me was the pride that was demonstrated by all... a pride in themselves, a pride in standing up for what they believed, a pride in what the black community has done to build this country and a pride in living in the United States of America. In one poignant interview, Ltc. Allen West speaks of his distinguished military service to this country and what it means to him, We don't take an oath to a color, to a party, to a person. You take an oath to the thing that binds us all together and that's our Constitution, that's our rule of law. Very powerful stuff! As I've stated in other pieces that I've written, African-American have been the most faithful Americans in the history of this country and through these intimate interviews, Uncle Tom so perfectly illustrates the strength, resilience and loyalty that has characterized African-Americans for hundreds of years.I truly believe that this documentary conveys a message so powerful that it it could be the vehicle that helps moves traditional black voting patterns away from Democrats and towards conservative political ideals in a very big way. But, as stated several times in the movie, much of this depends on the willingness of Republicans and Conservatives to stop their petulant sulking over lack of historic African-American support and to actively seek to become the highest bidder for the black vote in this country. . Uncle Tom proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that African-Americans in this country are not monolithic and are open to conservative ideals when they are presented in a thought-provoking manner. Republicans would be wise to invest in getting this documentary out into the black community as quickly as possible and on as massive a scale as they can. Hold viewing parties, send DVD's to churches, rent out movie theatres, do whatever needs to be done to get Uncle Tom seen by as many people as possible. It is that powerful!"}, {"id": 1422, "text": "I purchased this movie after navigating a set of not very user friendly websites. I managed to watch it on my TV using its in-built browser. It would have been nice to have it available in popular streaming platforms.As for the movie, it is hard to find words encomiastic enough. I am a white person who's interested in the theme of the advancement of people in general, and of black people in particular. I was deeply touched. Visually the film is beautiful in its black and white photography, the close plans of real people and the rhythm stemming from the various settings, including old footage, interviews and a few staged scenes.The contents is incredibly rich. Through the various testimonies and sequences we see the power of American black intellectuals, the rationality and honesty of their positions and proposals. At the same time we also realize how well-meaning public policies sometimes fail to achieve their aims spectacularly. One aspect that I found particularly interesting was the analysis of the destruction of the black American traditional family.My only slight complaint is the briefness of the appearance of my intellectual hero Thomas Sowell. And Herman Cain passed away a few days after the film's release.Overall I highly recommend this documentary."}, {"id": 1423, "text": "My main objective to watch the movie was to get educated about the term Uncle Tom. I knew it was related to African Americans, but wanted to understand it better.The movie didn't disappoint me. It explained very well the origin and it is applied.Lots of opinions and explanations provided by people that have been submitted to this special treatment were shared.I might not agree with everything I heard and saw, but I found it important to make their point and present their vision, based on the facts and numbers the sustained such views.I am seeing a lot of people saying the movie was their Red-Pill, maybe because it brought to their attention those facts and numbers supporting the divergent views.I prefer to continue reading and studying more about these facts and numbers in order to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations of such points.I applaud the produces for such a high quality movie, with very good material and hope a space for sincere and respectful dialogue is opened."}, {"id": 1424, "text": "I thought this was an excellent film overall, though I would urge you to read howkijan's 6-star review, which summarizes some of the film's weaknesses.My personal thought is that the people who would benefit most from seeing this film--people who rely on social media or liberal academia for information about black history in America over the past 60 or so years--would probably have a hard time understanding the film's message.I say this because Uncle Tom assumes that the viewer is able to take all of the disparate scenes/interviews presented and distill them into a fundamental message. I'm not sure the critical thinking skills required to do this are present in many folks under age 40 today.Therefore, IMO, the film needed to do a better job spelling out (i.e., dumbing down) its message for those folks who literally need to have it spelled out.Moreover, I'm not even 100 percent sure what the message is.--Is it that black Americans need to wake up and realize their communities have been, and continue to be, damaged by poor political policies and programs, a significant number of which were/are championed and put into play by Democrats?--Or is it simply that it's okay to be a conservative black American, and there is a lot of historical precedent for being so?Or is the message something else?At the end of the day, I have a feeling Uncle Tom will only appeal to those who already recognize and agree with its message (whatever you perceive that to be).Young folks hooked on social media may struggle to understand what the film is saying. And even if they understand, they may still dismiss the film as propaganda that is at odds with the truth being touted by the liberal press/social media and educational institutions."}, {"id": 1425, "text": "Many of the issues explored in this film were not new for me. I supported Herman Cain in 2012 and even met him at a campaign event. I was exposed to Thomas Sowell through watching Milton Friedman and I now own almost 20 of his books. As a white, conservative, millennial I have always had a massive amount of respect for black conservatives who have historically been swept under the rug or vilified by the Democrats. Uncle Tom felt like a unified attempt to fight back. The real history of southern Democrats from The Civil War to The Civil Rights Act is something that needs to be told to everyone who is Democrat by default or believes that the parties switched. This year we've had Created Equal which is about Clarence Thomas, Uncle Tom which is about black conservatives and black American history, and soon a film about Thomas Sowell. These to me signal an awakening that is long overdue and Uncle Tom is the jolt that people need. I hope that the people involved expand on these issues in future films because there is so much more to cover and a film in this style is maybe the most effective way to disseminate this information. I've watched Uncle Tom twice now and want to show it to a few people who don't know any of the things talked about in this film. It is rare to find a documentary that is both informative and entertaining enough to watch multiple times and Uncle Tom is both."}, {"id": 1426, "text": "Uncle Tom is a fascinating watch. I have been paying more attention to American politics since President Trumps election just prior to 2017, although I am a black British UK resident.This documentary solidified what I knew deep down intuitively that black folks have been sold a pack of lies of victimhood. This is very much also the case in the UK.It was so uplifting to see so many independent, free thinking black folk who are awake or had woken up to the lies of the left. Unfortunately the battle is still ongoing but we are confident of winning the war and exposing the false notions of critical Race theory.I salute Larry Elder for this documentary masterpiece and I also salute role models such as Candace Owen, Officer Tatum, Thomas Sowell, Dr Ben Carson and many more too numerous to mention.God bless the United States of America. \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8"}, {"id": 1427, "text": "It could have been shortened just a bit to make the highlights really stick out but I enjoyed watching this. The problem with longer films like this, it's harder to get the people who don't like to learn about this side of the Black American experience to sit and watch it.I felt like I was supporting the future of America by purchasing this and taking in this information. I personally feel my journey is quite unique but it seems like that moment where you feel like you've been lied to your whole life is common in the awakening process.Makes me think about other creative films that could be done to show this side of AMERICA. That could be powerful and aide in the healing of this land.We must take pride in our land and everything that comes with being who WE truly are"}, {"id": 1428, "text": "I already knew that this would have a conservative bias which there is nothing wrong with. There is nothing wrong with being black and conservative in America. The problem is the hypocrisy of tearing down other black Americans that disagree with you by questioning their blackness (Colin Kaepernick) or judging them for their checkered past that they overcame (Jay-Z). Another issue is the cherry-picking of historical facts to try and pretend that all racism and racial violence against black Americans historically stem specifically and only from the Democratic Party which anyone with an education knows is patently false and neither major political party is the same today as it was in 1950, let alone 1850. Add statistical cherry-picking that doesn't address the entirety of racial inequality studies and inconsistencies that creates a fallacious basis for many of the post-racial America points of view is more propaganda than fact. It's also interesting that it tends to celebrate education as long as it's conservative and agreeable. This is the hypocrisy again of seeming intent on creating more division in tearing down other black folks who disagree rather than trying to actually teach and uplift. Some very good individual success stories but very little relatability for many black Americans with very different backgrounds and experiences."}, {"id": 1429, "text": "We purchased this movie based on pre-release information and dramatically underestimated what we were going to learn. Larry Elder's team did a masterful job of putting the script together and filling the roles with so many thought leaders from the black conservative movement.When we've talked about things we learned in the documentary with friends, they've asked for more info. The result being that we've now watched the film 4 or 5 times with friends. The reaction has been the same over and over: wow! (for those who are a bit older, they'll often say I remember living through those times, but I wasn't aware of all of this stuff).And each time we've watched it, we've picked up on another idea to research further, or books to read, etc.One of the most important films of the year, in my opinion."}, {"id": 1430, "text": "OMGosh!... I just concluded watching Uncle Tom, and I, figuratively, had to pick myself up off the floor---it was THAT sensational.Relevant; articule; revealing; inspiring. It was a tour de force of political revelation that is RARELY, if ever, HEARD down the mainstreets of America! The fact the movie is being suppressed attests to the fact of a hidden agenda that this movie pulls the curtain back from!I was IN AWE several times..!I watch Larry Elder on YouTube, which is how I heard about the Uncle Tom movie.I simply had to write to say thank you for the scholarship, and the excellence of those not only involved with the project, but for its' highest ideals, which are clearly capturing attentions and igniting imaginations of those wise or curious-enough to view it.My only trepidation, now, is in figuring out how I'm going to give copies of Uncle Tom to all my fellow Democrat friends.(Yes, I'm a registered Democrat. But, hey... the truth is the truth!)I'll close by quoting Ronald Reagan: When people have asked why I left the Democratic Party, I tell them, 'I didn't leave the Democratic Party; the Democratic Party left me'."}], "reviews_amount": 1431}
