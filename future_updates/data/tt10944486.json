Do the companies actually make money off this garbage?Maybe if they didn't give the cop friend so much screen time with her extremely unfunny personality, it would be better."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This comedy is perfect for 15 year old edgy girls? I apologize, I have no idea who would enjoy this. There are many things that are bad. Cinematography, camera work, acting, dialog, script, editing, fighting choreography, sound design, but what ruins bad comedies, is the comedy. Although I am not sure if it just a typo, because nothing is funny.The female black cop who is sassy, steals drugs and helps an illegal organisation is not funny. A caricature of a gay couple is not funny. Also Alec Baldwin? How does he still find work? He is unfunny, untalented and just god awful.Man I was disappointed by this movie. I was genuinely exited for it. I hoped it would be a commentary about our society and how woman are treated and/or seen. Bad or Good. Something that would subvert our expectations about the capabilities of women. Anything good really.But instead it is about money?! This club is supposed to be a save place for women, but instead it is just B*tch Fight. This save space thing would be good, but they ruin it with every single character being an absolute a**hole. Some forced BS cliches: 1. her mother was the leader of the club 2. Love interest 3. Training without any physical transformation while she still punches like a girl 4. Not a single woman looks like they ever fought and they always look absolute perfect.The only good thing is, take a drink every time they do a slow-motion."}, {"id": 3, "text": "She can't even be a good Thot on only fans. Lol worst and most pathetic acting from her. While everyone else was half way decent"}, {"id": 4, "text": "In Come Back To Me director Paul Leyden's Chick Fight, dames put up their dukes and puke up their blood at a female only underground boxing arena like their male counterparts in the Brad Pitt film Fight Club (1999). Comparably, this estrogen-driven, LGBTQ-friendly romantic comedy glamorizes stereotypes of sweaty, hard-bodied babes sparring in sexist tropes scavenged from landmark male boxing epics. Not surprisingly, this feel-good but featherweight female empowerment opus qualifies as neither the first nor the last movie about lady palookas. Indeed, several robust chick fighting films proceeded and undoubtedly influenced it. First, Frank Clarke's Blonde Fist (1991) charted a woman's rise to prominence as a professional boxer. Second, Under Siege darling Erika Eleniak came out punching in director Eugene Jarecki's The Opponent (2000). Third, Karyn Kusama's Girl Fight (2000) offered Fast and Furious star Michelle Rodriguez hammering blows home. Fourth, in Million Dollar Baby (2004), Clint Eastwood showed Hilary Swank how to stay off the ropes. Fifth, we have Jonathan Dillon's Fight Night (2008), featuring Rebecca Neuenswander. Indian director Omung Kumar's film Mary Kom (2014) is sixth, while Miguel Angel Ferrer's Female Fight Club (2016) with Amy Johnston is seventh. Finally, H\u00fcseyin Tabak's Gipsy Queen (2019) depicted a single mom who fed her family by climbing into the ring. Nothing about Chick Fight is remotely original, but freshman scenarist Joseph Downey and Leyden put their charismatic cast through their paces with such giddy glee that you cannot help but enjoy this slick but shallow saga. Twenty years ago, the R-rated Chick Fight might have hoisted eyebrows with its profane dialogue, sexual innuendos, bloody fisticuffs, and fleeting drug use, but content like this now generates marginal shock value.When we meet beautiful, blond, but woebegone Anna Wyncomb (Malin Akerman of Rampage), she is having a bad day. First, she finds herself out of toilet paper. Second, she watches helplessly as her Prius is repossessed. Third, not only are customers in her coffee shop growing scarce, but Anna also is still sinking in a sea of red ink. Fourth, imagine Anna's surprise when her recently widowed, blue-collar father, Ed (Kevin Nash of John Wick), a brawny Paul Bunyan type of a bruiser at 6' 11\u00be, comes out of the closet! Anna is still reeling in shock when he introduces her to Chuck, (Alec Mapa of Hard Pill), his sniggering, pint-sized, bespectacled, Asian boyfriend. Ed explains his wife's death and his subsequent loneliness has opened him up to a new kind of relationship. The sight of Chuck clinging happily to Ed spins Anna's head. This topsy-turvy day is just warming up when Anna's African American, XXX-sized, trash-talking, lesbian BFF barges through the door. As it turns out, Charleen (Dulc\u00e9 Sloan of Baby Mama's Club) is also a pistol-packing, uniformed patrolwoman who loves to play with her handcuffs. She persuades Anna to smoke pot as well as gargle moonshine, courtesy of the police evidence locker, to sooth her soul. It doesn't help matters Anna hasn't recovered from the recent death of her mom. Absent-mindedly, she knocks the joint into a puddle of illegal moonshine that Charleen had splashed on the floor. Later, an inferno engulfs Anna's coffee shop. Naturally, our heroine had no insurance. If things couldn't possibly get worse, not only does Charleen order Anna to put a pillow case over her head, but she also escorts her into an illegal underground fight club for women! According to Charleen, Anna must confront her fears before she can achieve her dreams.Anna finds herself in an auditorium with a boxing ring in a giant cage where women dodge haymakers. The catch is Anna must challenge an opponent before she can exit the club or she must battle the burly owner, Bear (Fortune Feimster of Friendsgiving), who won't let her out without a scrap. Reluctantly, our heroine squares off against a mousy librarian. Ms. Bookworm decks Anna with a sucker punch. Tradition dictates each victor must pin a dollar bill to a wall of fame papered with Washington's portraits. The major revelation of the evening for Anna is the news her dearly departed mom launched the shelter as a safe haven for women! Bear plays a video of Anna's mom before she succumbed to cancer. Just as everything appears to be returning to normal, Anna encounters an upstart contender, Olivia (Bella Thorne of Infamous), about half her age who vows to annihilate her. Not only does pugnacious Olivia want to take over the club, but she also aims to steer in fresher blood and oust the old dames! Predictably, Olivia flattens three adversaries at once in short order, and this feat petrifies poor Anna. Charleen introduces Anna to an unorthodox trainer, Murphy (Alec Baldwin of Heaven's Prisoners), a pot-bellied drunkard who can't carry a tune in a bucket at a karaoke bar. Miraculously, no matter where he lands after he falls, Murphy never spills a drop! After he takes Anna on as a client, Murphy puts her through a rigorous boot camp reminiscent of Sylvester Stallone's training in Rocky (1976). Murphy toughens Anna up. First, she must burst a watermelon open with her fists while dancing barefoot on a sizzling hot Florida beach. Eventually, after slugging half the day away, she manages to pulverize the elusive, thick-skinned fruit! Second, Murphy teaches her to crave pain. Anna spars with a partner, but she must take the blows rather than parry them!Director Paul Leyden keeps the action fast and frivolous, and Chick Fight taps out at a tolerable 97-minutes. Malin Akerman qualifies as a sympathetic underdog heroine who constantly finds herself stumbling over one predicament after another. Bella Thorne makes such an obnoxious but gorgeous villain you want to poke her in the face. Alec Baldwyn behaves like he had a blast as Anna's boozy trainer. Chick Fight ascends to hilarious heights every time comedian Dulc\u00e9 Sloan steals the limelight to indulge in her brassy antics. Although it often pulls its punches, Chick Fight manages to go the distance."}, {"id": 5, "text": "One of those comedies that offering a few laughs with a don't take it seriously message...

They do not ALL have to be in one film though. At it's core, I feel that this had a decent story to tell and from a unique perspective. It all was cluttered in too much WOKEfulness though and not in a subtle or thought-provoking way.

She is what drew me to this movie otherwise I wouldn't care for it. She played her character really nice, someone I wouldn't personally want to mess with.

Throw it all together and hopefully things will work out."}, {"id": 33, "text": "There is a lot wrong with this film that could have been easily fixed... The fight choreography was amateur level, it would have been better to give the girls mouth-guards and just let them slug it out naturally. Alec Baldwin's talent was under-utilized, he should have had a larger role in Anna's (Malin Akerman) life akin to Mr. Miyagi as was even joked about. This would have allowed for better arcs for the main characters. Some more of the limited budget should have been spent on more experienced comedic writing... So many missed opportunities. Just too much effort spent trying to include everyone in the playground, that leaves the whole story looking disjointed, like a Victoria's Secret sponsored Pride event that degenerated into a bar brawl. It's a good premise that had potential, it was well shot, and most of the cast makes an effort. There are even a few slap-stick moments that might elicit a chuckle but in the end a different movie would have been a better movie. Save this one for when you run out of good ones."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Movies like this is why the world keeps getting dumber.

You can tell they actually spent time with the fight choreography. The fights are pretty well done,. You can also see that they cast and used real female athletes. Bella Thorne even looked good in her fights (or her stunt double). Some folks may hate this film simply for Bella Thorne, I like her, can't knock her for playing the system. Everything else is just below average."}, {"id": 38, "text": "I'm not sure if this was a real movie of just a spoof. It was a disaster either way."}, {"id": 39, "text": "I'm not entirely sure how this movie got made. I don't know how they got these actors to sign on. They must've been severely overpaid. The script is full and unfunny. The lowest common denominator humor imaginable. May have been written by AI. Sets back women's fighting a decade."}, {"id": 40, "text": "It's just predictable all the way thru to the point it is boring. I kind of figured the protagonist would win-I get that, but the dialogue was mundane too. It feels like they wrote nothing of substance for some of the main characters and expected them to riff great lines. It just didn't happen here. Baldwin may be the biggest disappointment. I'd expect more from a drunk coach in the perfect opportunity for one-line zingers. He had nothing."}, {"id": 41, "text": "This is so bad on so many levels, that they actually invented new levels to stink up.If you aren't going to watch just one movie this year, this is the one to skip.Movies like this are hurting America (and the rest of the world). The big picture here is that violence in the answer, although to what isn't clear at all. The biggest sin is that this just isn't funny, not at all. They obviously wrote this using the new MS screenwriting program which allows you to choose clich\u00e9s from a drop-down window1- Sassy, Black, grammatically-challenged woman who is morbidly obese but strong and violent.2- Gay couple. This is an absolute must-have for any movie these days.3- Vulgarity used as if it were a synonym of humor.4- Someone has to have an English or Australian accent. It's a new rule.Seriously, I want to know how such a complete piece of garbage was rolled out of a real studio. Did someone get paid to write this? They should try paying someone instead of just asking for volunteer writers or unpaid interns."}, {"id": 42, "text": "One time watch at best. Production quality is good. Fight scenes are BAD, you have people waiting to be hit like they use to do in 80's &amp; 90's movies. This is magnified when they use slowmo, you have a fighter standing there with their arms down just waiting to be hit.This feels like a feminism overcorrection movie with a side of racial overcorrection. This seems to be all the rage at the moment in hollywood, people feeling guilted into choosing these loosely entertaining ideas and hiring people based purely on the colour of their skin, gender or sexual orientation rather than the merits of their hard work or suitability for the job.I feel as though the budget and talent in this film could have been used in a better way to make a movie that wouldn't collect such review as Don't even bother watching. Bad stuff aside, movies as entertainment, it was reasonably entertaining but the lack of original thought left me thinking it could have been more."}, {"id": 43, "text": "So I watched this turd, thinking some hot chicks fighting. It maybe so good it's bad.....NOPE!It was bad from the beginning to the end. The jokes were not funny. Usually in terrible comedies, you can laugh at 1 maybe 2 jokes, but in this movie I did not laugh or smile once.It's about a female fight club. I figured it was going to be an anti-man movie, it wasn't even that. In fact I am not sure why they fight other than work is hard.This was an awful movie, lacking sex appeal. Despite having some gorgeous women and a few beasts of a women. Nothing was eye candy nor entertaining. No great romance or even point to the story. It's an aimless piece of horse manure.I give this a generous 2 out of 10."}, {"id": 44, "text": "I'm gonna be totally honest in this review. I had fun with the movie, i did. I think both the lead actress (Malin Akerman) and Bella Thorne did a great job in their role. I don't think either of them are martial artist yet the fights did look convincing and were fun to watch. Part of the comedy is good, and some of the message is also nice, but the problem is this movie try to litteraly go for a tsunami of Social Justice.First of all the sidekick character, the cop, she is SO annoying. I really couldn't stand her at times. And honestly, no way a person this obese could be a cop. Secondly, the dad played by Kevin Nash. I like Kevin Nash, both from my childhood in Wrestling and even as an actor in small roles here and there. But here his character serve no purpose at all in the movie beside an sjw message and some terrible attempt at comedy.But despite those flaws, like i said i had fun with the movie. I just wish they didn't tried to cram so much social justice in it, because it does hurt the movie."}, {"id": 45, "text": "Here's the first fail of this movie. It's R-Rated and never once, delivered on it's R-Rated promise. I would think a comedy based around the notion of an all female fight club and starring the comedic talents of Dulce Sloan and Fortune Fiemster, two very well known and talented comediennes would be an over the top, rollercoaster ride of ridiculousness. Instead Chick Fight feels like it's afraid to throw that knockout punch needed to make a movie such as this one memorable. If there is anything worth praising here, is the fight scenes. While way too short, they were well choreographed and I appreciated that. I did laugh a few times as well. Seeing one of my favorite old school wrestlers turned actor, Kevin Nash play way against type was not only fun, but surprisingly well executed. Bella Thorne has proven to me there isn't much she can't handle and as a young actress, I see big things in her future. Sadly Malin Akerman is overshadowed by almost everyone else in this movie and I think she was terribly miscast as the lead. I hate having to go all negative on a movie like this one. We need more female positive movies out there, that show women are capable of so much more than just finding a man (sadly they do stick that in here as well) and with a stronger lead actress, better comedy and slicker editing, this could've been Hangover meets Fight Club for the female demographic. I don't even need the ten count, Chick Fight hits the mat and never gets up again."}], "reviews_amount": 46}
