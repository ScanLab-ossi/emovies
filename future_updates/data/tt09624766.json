The camerawork, it's awful, then there is shaky cam (a lot of it), then they glued the camera to the guns, then unnecessary closeups, it's terrible."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I saw a short clip of this movie a few weeks back and it looked great, so I was really looking forward to it.Note: they scripted the lead actor to have memory loss to hide the lack of acting talent. He did great at nailing the confused dumb look though. The only one who could act was cage, and the plot and script sucked big time. The fight scenes felt like watching the power ranger series. Major let down"}, {"id": 2, "text": "Someone did it, they made a movie actually worse than the new mutants. You figured that someone who makes a movie about a fighting style will make it youknow action, Japanese, etc idk instead some big brain at holy wood made this a uh predator movie ripoff i think? It makes no sense, I read the plot this morning on imdb but when I actually watched the movie itself, I still didn't even get the whole plot of this movie. The effects are laughably bad, they even copied Ang Lee's Hulk out of all things and used the comic transitions (at least Hulk was a comic book character so I could see what they were doing but they added it here FOR NO REASON AT ALL). The camera work for the action is AWFUL, it even spins completely and reminds you the time when you were a kid and you were spinning the thingy at the playground super fast then you layed on it. I remember one time it was even first person out of nowhere! That predator creature is literally the predator who has healing powers but looks more like Yoshimitsu from Tekken 7 who comes out every 6 years (why its 6 years i guess doesn't matter, maybe he gets a 6 year break) and we don't even know his motivations or his endgame at all. The final fight of the movie even reminds me of mortal kombat Annihilation (which is funny because an actor in this movie was a stunt double for liu kang in MKA) and it's ridiculous, you're telling me that no one EVER tried destroying the portal or guarding it or blocking it or sending the predator ripoff back into the portal? The acting is also terrible and Nicholas Cage shows up like 40 minutes in the movie then gets killed off after knowing the creature for years and doing nothing. Conveniently, a drink that literally mutes pain is just in time so this love interest (the way she was introduced literally shows her popping out of nowhere) doesn't die but oh no like any of the other characters needed that. The new mutants (while very bad, don't even deny it) at least had a tone which was horror or teen drama in a way, fit the characters that were in the movie but this movie shows in characters that for the most part don't even fit. I'm surprised this was even made, i wonder what the budget was. It says a lot when your movie is lower than Batman &amp; Robin on IMDB"}, {"id": 3, "text": "The effects are ridiculous, the story disjointed and making no sense, the acting is horrible. I mean, I would love to be able to say except Nicholas Cage, but he is also really bad. And the cast is filled with actors you've seen before and respected for their work: Cage, Rick Yune, Tony Jaa, Frank Grillo, Juju Chan. I mean, they were never Shakespearean thespians, but they did action well. Guess what: the fight scenes are bad! I mean, this is like someone made efforts to mess this movie up! The only way one can enjoy this is being drunk out of their minds and laughing all the time."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Writer's inspiration was Alien, Ninja Turtles, Mortal Kombat, Guyver. However, for some twisted reason, he decide to put all that into one movie. There is no story line, no motivation for main characters' actions, no cinematography. The only beautiful shot was when two of the characters were walking across a field, shot from above. No acting, despite Cage's honorable attempts.I would forgive all of the above, if, atleast there was real Jiu Jitsu. As the name states, this movei is about the martial art. However, most of the fighting was the regular, Holywood style, flashy fighting. Here and there there were some Jiu Jitsu specific moves and that it.Please avoid wasting your time."}, {"id": 5, "text": "..

It is weird but almost to the point where there was no though behind it at all. Aliens? Video Game? Comic-book heroes? I'm not sure, but the result is laughable. Nothing here for martial arts fans, nothing for sci-fi lovers absolute facepalm this one. It's cringe from start titles to end credits. Bad acting, fights choreography is horrid, story? non-existent.

This movie also reminded me of another awful movie Beyond Skyline which I also wanted to watch because Iko Uwais\u00b4martial arts talents but these two movies have the same bad script, bad acting (Frank Grillo in both,btw),bad cinematography,bad sound, etc. You better stick to Tony Jaa\u00b4s and Iko Uwais\u00b4 previous movies (The Raid 1 &amp;2) which are awesomely choreographed."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Watch this ONLY if you like martial arts films!

The film becomes a double jackpot when Nic Cage is beaten or tortured (Wicker Man). So viewers shud be careful before watching Nic Cage's films. My earlier review which got more than 50 likes got deleted without it containing any spoiler, abusive or irrelevant stuff. This shows that there r many Nic Cage haters. Its agreeable if people hate Mel Gibson for his racist comments but leave the poor Cage alone man.Coming back to the film, the acting is atrocious.

I can say, without a doubt, that this one has the worst goons I've ever seen. I don't exagerate, there's a scene where some unarmed dudes fight a dozen armed soldiers in an open field. I'm not kidding, the soldiers run towards the dudes, as if their machine-guns were freaking swords.

When bothering to act he reverts to the manic face he has used so many times before. From the premise - aliens come to our world to fight the best fighter and if the best fighter looses we all loose -- to the lack of even basic acting capabilities of the fighters (including the lead) this is a very bad production. It is rare in movies of this kind that the fight scenes are poor -- in this case you can see the planned missed hits and the faked reaction of those supposedly hit. Yes money was spent on special effects - but these do not matter if the plt is weak and the acting appalling. However, I agree with other reviewers the DP and his crew did a poor job -- making the whole thing very far from believable. For the bulk of his career Alain Moussi has been a stunt guy -- perhaps we would all have been better served if he had stayed in that role.

I truly believe that from the heart and I'm not a shill trust me on this!That being said this , although a lil' off, and not much, it is way fun to watch, the beginning is cool, has a cool video -game feel to it that explains a lot of the fighting with guns being blasted at the protagonist from every angle and yet coming out of it unscathed! Very imo very very cool directing as well! Cause the fight sequences were spread out enough in specific takes to make you see just how cool all the punches and kicking and stabbing unfolded before your eyes! I loved it!Like I said , perhaps if they could of explained a lil' bit of how the first team with Jake and Nick Cage were going to take on Brax without any hint of understanding how to destroy an immortal alien would of been pretty nice because they seemed to know a lot about the infernal space monster so , that being said once Jake (the Protagonist) procured the information on how to eliminate Brax on the Quest, he never really passed down this very crucial sensitive intelligence to any of his team-mates, and watching his not yet non-descript father Nick Cage die a miserable death while Jake and his pretty Asian cutie watch cruelly and weirdly off to the side, that was strange! lol.But that being said, I absolutely loved it, it was a marvel to watch and I highly recommend it for someone who is looking for something fun to watch, I would of saved the pretty white girl from departing before her character could redeem herself but those are just lil' subjective particulars, anyway, trust me, put it on and enjoy it, it is very cool, everyone involved in the thing should be very very proud of themselves, fine fine job! cool! imo!"}, {"id": 132, "text": "I watched all of it so that says a lot.

However, it does not deliver on what Blake Snyder would have called the promise of the premise. It feels more like a cinematic version of a video game than a martial arts film. No novice acquires skills under the tutelage of a martial arts master, as in films ranging from The Karate Kid to Kill Bill. The protagonist doesn't really use jiu jitsu to defeat the villain. Many confrontations are not one-on-one or hand-to-hand. There is no real discussion of the philosophical or spiritual aspects. Nobody spends much time training. None of the characters seem to grow. The romantic B-story is flimsy and unconvincing.Instead, we are given a team of elite martial arts experts, each of whom uses a different weapon: tonfa, sword, nunchaku, shuriken, staff, throwing knives, et cetera, except for the protagonist, who occasionally uses an opponent's firearm or other weapon, but quickly discards it.The movie has aliens, space portals, a CIA plot, radiation levels, and an alien with some sort of Predator-like cloaking. However, the plot is somewhere between incoherent and nonexistent. Production values are more than adequate. The actors do as well as can be expected with the roles and dialogue they're given.

It completely rips off the plot of Predator and tries to be clever by adding a time portal subplot. The point of view shots of the Alien stalking these people in the woods clearly steals from Predator too (there is nothing original in this garbage)When I watched the trailer I was hoping for a Mortal Kombat/Street Fighter style film, but it takes itself too seriously. The sound effects are loud and over the top and the music score is repetitive rubbish that belongs in a Sharknado film. The 'acting' is awful from everyone but it's no surprise as most of these people are clearly fighters of some kind. Frank Grillo and Tony Jaa have had acting experience in previous movies but they were completely wasted here. I DO NOT know why Nicholas Cage was in this... He's in it for 30 minutes and his action scenes were clearly performed by stunt doubles. This man just says yes to anything these days, I suppose a man's gotta eat though.It's not a long film, it's just over 90 minutes but I had to pause it for 30 minutes and take a nap because it literally bored me. I don't usually take naps and I've sat through much longer films. It didn't engage me much at all. The only redeeming thing in this film is one or two fight scenes at the start which had good choreography (particularly from Tony Jaa) It didn't feel like a film though, it felt like a showcase for stuntmen to show off their skills.All in all it has a boring plot. Forgettable repetitive action scenes which were clearly stagged. Terrible camera work. Uneven tone. Sloppy pace. Rubbish CGI blood splatters. Lightning that makes the whole film look dull.

For starters, the screenplay was atrocious. It's not like this is Logothetis' first rodeo, but a 5th grader could've written a better screenplay. It was convoluted with plot and technical issues, dragged out scenes, and choppy editing. The 102 min runtime felt like 3 plus hours with terrible pacing and too much filler for the little substance this film had. These errors could've so easily been rectified if Logothetis had consulted with a seasoned writer - or at least watched the entire film with a few friends before releasing it to see how terribly it was put together.What I did like, was the score, which was surprisingly fitting and not loud and obnoxious like most B films. The cinematography was great as was the S/VFX. Some of the choreography for the fight and action scenes were awesome, especially in the beginning with the POV shots. Casting was good with mostly decent performances, especially from Nicolas Cage, who was his usually awesome crazy self that stole the show. It was great to see Tony Jaa, Frank Grillo, and Eddie Steeples, who was a hoot.If you enjoy non stop fights and action scenes with excellent visuals, but without a great store, you'll enjoy this one.

In fact, Jiu Jitsu was fully and completely devoid of anything even resembling a storyline. It was just people running around fighting, dodging bullets and shooting at one another. And get this, because it gets better. The martial arts and action sequences were so poorly choreographed and executed that it made the early 1980s ninja movies look good.Jiu Jitsu is a blemish on Tony Jaa's otherwise fairly good track record of proper action and martial arts movies. But it was, as expected, just another mass-produced run-of-the-mill movie for Nicolas Cage.The special effects in Jiu Jitsu were, actually, not all that bad, though having special effects of that kind hardly mattered in the movie, because of the horrible action sequences and the total lack of storyline. The movie was just a sinking pile.My rating of Jiu Jitsu lands on a more than generous three out of ten stars. This movie is one that you shouldn't really bother with, don't waste your time, money and effort on this one. Some of us did, so you don't have to."}, {"id": 148, "text": "From fake fighting scenes to visible padding of stunt men to fake uniforms to nonsense let's use fists instead of guns to bad camerawork. The script is 1/10. If they adjusted the script to make it more realistic, it would've propelled the movie to a better review and a better script just needed some common sense in some areas, like the beginning of the movie as an example. (no spoiler) translator scene didn't make any sense. A US army base of all white men with no translators yet when it came to fighting, they were all Asian men... Where's common sense? Why was it so hard to adjust the story just a tiny bit?! Then the horrible shaky camerawork in most fighting scenes. You know, my 4 year old camera can do much better. Ever heard of steadycam? Nobody like a shaky camera during intense scenes, gee, after a minute, you just want to vomit of all the motion sickness. 1/10 for directing!!I had low exceptions and just wanted some Mortal combat fights and little story, but the movie just failed it. Even the fighting was so fake, I was literally laughing during a number of scenes. If you like WWE WWF fake wrestling fighting, you may like this movie.It almost looks like a few people got together, put some money in and decided to make a movie to see where it bring them, All money went to set and stunts and little to everything else. The editing of the movie is actually not bad. Bad CGI would've been ok if the script was at least somewhat decent."}, {"id": 149, "text": "Seriously, never in my life I've started watching a movie and not finish it, I've always endured through pain in some movies to go all the way till the end, but this movie made it impossible!The total wrongness begins with the title! Nowhere in this movie (or in the 20 mins I saw) is the combat form of jiu-jitsu seen! We see kung-fu and other martial arts that include the use of swords, but never the traditional grasping of jiu-jitsu!I'm not sure what's worst, if the acting, the special effects, the sound mix or the video editing, but all together make up the worst movie I've ever tried to see, and the only one in my 42 years of existence that I did not see, nor want to see, the ending!If you value your brain, please skip this movie, you will thank me, but if you are keen to let your brain die a little, go ahead, and unfortunately I'll have to say I told you so!"}, {"id": 150, "text": "Nicolas Cage isn't a bad actor, he played in some really good movies but he also has the gift to play in real stinkers. You wonder if he even reads the scripts, or does he just takes whatever pays him? In this case he did it again, another stinker on his wide palmares. There is absolutely nothing good about Jiu Jitsu. With a title like that you obviously think about a movie with a lot fight scenes, and that's basically all there is but they're so bad it just become painful to watch. It's so obvious they hold back in every fight scene you wonder if those are real actors and not just some local martial art practisers they found at the fight club next door. It's all very badly choreographed. It's also one of those movies where everybody waits for his turn to get beaten instead of jumping the bad guy all at once and secure an easy victory. I hate this kind of dumb action. But it's not only that that is wrong with this piece of garbage. Highly trained military people that can't hit a target whilst shooting from one meter distance, you think it couldn't get more ridiculous. The CGI's are also painful to watch as they look to be made by a six year old computer geek in his basement, just awful. And then you have the story, or more the lacking of a story, with so many plotholes you wonder if they even had that script proofread by someone else before they started shooting this movie. Everything is a total mess in Jiu Jitsu. You can only feel sorry for Nicolas Cage, again he managed to be in a movie not worth being called a movie. I hope he gets paid really well for that as by now his name is just better known for playing in very bad movies than for his actual acting talent. Do something about that Nicolas before you lose all credibility!"}, {"id": 151, "text": "It was one thing to find out that Nicolas Cage was in a movie called Jiu Jitsu, that was enough for me to buy the movie on Amazon Prime. It sounds just bonkers enough to be up my alley. Then I discover that Tony Jaa's also in this movie. I could not wait!!Unfortunately Cage and Jaa are supporting actors in a movie designed to show what a guy named Alain Moussi can do. I don't know if he's doing Jiujitsu on camera but he does have a pretty awesome flip kick. He's no Scott Adkins but we possibly caught this guy at he beginning of his b-marshal arts action movie career, but what what a way to start.Ii is kind of string (and a little racist) that Jaa is not just staring in the movie. They asked Jaa to toned down his cinematic greatest to a 10 rather than the usual 11 so that they could add a bunch of cool camera angles, special effects and slow-motion to Americanize it. Yet still watching Tony Jaa fight is amazing.Not much of a story but more like a series of really great action sequences that feel greatly influenced by video games more than marshal arts movies of the past (the filmmaker also seems to enjoy comics as I gathered from the all the comic book art being used to transition form scene to scene). The story has something to do with a group of warriors who must defend the planet from alien invaders but one of the warriors (played by Moussi) forgets who he is endangering the mission. The fact that this invasion happens every six years kind of reminds me of Mortal Kombat, but the game these filmmakers are trying to make seems to be a 1st person open world thing.There are other cool people in the cast. Frank Grillo who played Crossbones in Captain America the winter soldier. I just binged watched his show Kingdom which is good. Rick Yune, who is yet another victim of Hollywood's tendency to favor White Boys with marshal arts skills. Check out his film the 5h Commandment for proof of that. The film also stars Marrese Crump, a more handsome version of Billy Banks (the Tae Bo guy) who has faced Tony Jaa in a film with Jaa at 11 (The Protector 2). Watch that movie and tell me Hollywood has not slept on this dude's skills.Despite its lame story the movie is perfect. it just keeps going with so much kinetic energy that it does not stop long enough for you to complain about how weak the plot is. Worth checking out."}, {"id": 152, "text": "One of the affiliated companies for the movie that is presented before the film starts was called Loredo Investments Limited. As I think this movie is a bad investment of time, I do not envy anyone who made the decision to invest money into it. Though the plot seems like it could be kind of neat, it is just executed so terribly... It literally looks like it was made as a SyFy original movie in like 2002.The special effects are pretty much what killed it for me. I couldn't make it past 30 minutes, to be quite honest. There was an action fighting scene at that point if you wanna call it that in which when someone got punched or kicked, there was like a poof of dust or something where they were struck. For no reason what so ever, sparks even flew out of the one dude where he was kicked. Mind you, these are just dudes in military uniforms. No armor to speak of. It baffles me that this thing even earned an R rating. I mean, it looks like you're watching a T rated fighting game with the blood option turned off...Yeah, I don't know. If you like the SyFy channel's old B movies, you might enjoy it for some nostalgia or something. At the end of the day though, this is my spin on it. New video games that come out using the old retro style graphics from the 90's are usually pretty fun. New movies that come out using special effects CGI editing from the 90's however are not as well received, and for good reason."}, {"id": 153, "text": "I knew it was going to be bad, but I made a decision and have no regrets, but if you still fight doubts, I can confirm this for You - it is indeed an all-around mess of a movie. It might have B budget and the fight scenes might be (are) their main selling point, but as a movie, usually an imaginative, artful construct, right, it's some real D grade stuff. Thankfully, Nicolas Cage does not belong to any of the guilty parties, he did what he does well as good as he could've with this paper thin and muddled script - he had a bit of fun. To make a note, I like Nicolas Cage a lot, both when he's serious and high-tier, and also when he's just him. Doesn't matter the movie, Cage has never disappointed me enough. Fun fact: this is Nic's lowest rated movie to date.So, Jiu Jitsu absolute worst flaw is most definitely the story. Is there even one? Till the last act, it continuously segues from one action scene into another, as the unimpressive group of warriors fight that one Jiu Jitsu Alien Futuristic Demonic Superhero Uninspired Shiny Ninja Guy. The last act pours some belated exposition and random previously unconnected/unexistent details in our eyes, and it feels as if the viewers are seen by the writers of Jiu Jitsu as dumb and naive. Like, for real. It's nearly impossible to care for most of what goes on in this unreasonably shaky, unreasonably long and unreasonably empty of any emotion piece of art. After understanding that, all that's left is to try and feast on the endless action scenes and those couple funny Nic Cage moments. Of course, the man arrives to stay only like half-way through the film. Action scenes are good, some of them really are, well choreographed and special effects do not always get on the nose. However, it all gets old pretty fast because the fighting styles don't really get shuffled or updated throughout and the situations (fight scenes) are technically not that different from each other. Acting's accordingly void of anything truly charming, cinematography's kind of okay, too shaky, original score's whack, what else... Just the fact that this should've been a 15-minute short film.I in good conscience cannot recommend this film to the people seeking a quality evening with a cool martial arts fantasy adventure, only to those who feel like they eventually have to see every Nicolas Cage movie in existence. My rating: 3/10."}, {"id": 154, "text": "Anybody who saw the trailer to this expecting a new Predator/The Raid, or a quality movie, must have been willfully ignorant.That's not to excuse this movies shortcomings, of which there hell of a lot, but it feels like a lot of people are missing the point of how its camped up and cheesy for camp and cheese sake.The CGI is mostly horrible bad except for a few composite environmental shots that look okay. The acting goes from bad to really bad and Cage sadly never goes the full distance.There are a couple of lines/moments that made me chuckle, fight scenes sadly had a lot of I'm gonna stand here and wait for my turn to be punched, a couple of cool looking moves in there, but nothing that makes one really go Wow, I have never seen something like that!.It tries to do some interesting things like First Person camera action ala Hardcore or continuous shot action scenes ala Daredevil Hallway fight scene, it generally borrows a lot from other movies like that, but that never gets even close to the execution of what it borrows from.The people who made this seem to have had a lot of fun doing it and it shows in places.Overall it's still entertaining enough to kill some time if you know what you are getting into and don't expect some kind of groundbreaking master piece with an elaborate/realistic story and setting."}, {"id": 155, "text": "Calling this film the funniest film of the year is not a positive review. Do not be fooled by the 7/10 star rating above, this a 6.5/10 at best. Why the high rating you ask? Because its an artful film that isn't too original but its got Nicolas Cage and Eddie Steeples (My Name is Earl, Hey Crabman).The film, at first, is hard to follow and the camera shooting is terrible. At times it is shot in first person (for no apparent reason) and other times it is third person. It is like watching someone play a first person version of Street Fighter, which changes to a samurai based graphic novel with little or no warning at all. What makes the film good is its ability to tell a story without much dialogue, it is like watching a graphic novel come to life. Most importantly, Nicolas Cage has a fair amount of screen time for being a supporting actor. But it is well worth the wait to see him his whole ten minute part is the best part of the film.This is very much a film that would be on Mystery Science Theater 3000, but hey its got Nicolas Cage! The riffing would enhance the movie a lot. The writing of the film most likely started out as a synopsis like: Nicolas Cage fights an Alien Invasion using Martial Arts -sounds like a good pitch, right?"}, {"id": 156, "text": "Jiu Jitsu is a straight to direct television sci fi martial arts film.It is basically a Predator rip off with a dose of Terminator and plenty of martial arts.Every six years a comet passes over Earth.

He has been severely injured and has amnesia until his friends find him.Nicolas Cage plays a paper hat wearing mentor of Jake.The film is pure hokum. You can tell in the opening minutes with the terrible interpreter who is meant to be comic relief but it verges on racism.There is a lot of martial arts but it is rather routine. It lacks style and excitement.There are several familiar faces even though people might only recognise them as the villain from a Bond movie or a Marvel movie.Then there is Cage.

Let me badxplain it to you... easy with a comparison: take A wrinkle in time, an Oprah vanity project infused with mountains of Disney cash, horrible acting paired with pretentious nonsense script and a woke director that is in way over her head. Journalists and sites artificially maintaining the vote high because of spineless conformism. THAT is a 3 or 4 out of 10, only because the technical departments did their job. The viewers pay full price and believe the hype and ultimately are the victim.Now, only now, let's have a look at JIU JITSU, the cash is bare minimum, camera is terrible, sound is barely decent, the acting is either desperate attempt to save face or straight horrible: the production is cutting so many corners that they end up with a sphere, the perfect solid. It's sooooo bad that it goes straight to the other side. This film is a monster, in the latin original sense: monstrum, itself derived from the verb moneo (to remind, warn, instruct, or foretell), and denotes anything strange or singular, contrary to the usual course of nature. A marvel of nature, you cannot plan for this stuff: is the collective result of C-List actors desperate for cash and an improvised crew, improbable production standards and a weird 3rd rewrite of the script for a grand total of 7 (!) bucks ticket. That would be enough for a 6,5/7 but... it's got (Oscar winner) Nicolas Cage, the myth. It's a straight 8!!! (and if you stiff upper lips fake connoisseurs don't get it, rewatch some of your beloved pretentious crap and stick to that).PS It's not perfect because nobody died during production as far as we know."}], "reviews_amount": 158}
