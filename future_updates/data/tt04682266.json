Acting was Ok but the script really didn't give much for the actors to play with. The only mutant to shine was Anya Taylor-Joy's. As for a power being able to become a dog, or part dog for most of the film, well, good luck with that one."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I was excited for a year to finally watch this movie. Avid comic collector and certified geek in attendance. First off, why not go into the backstories of all the mutants in detail? Why not make the story more compelling? This movie felt like it was made for tv. Future x-men in attendance here! Act accordingly. Horror? Nope. Didn't even care about that. Just wanted the mutants stories and it fell so short. While writing this I was reminded of how this movie made me feel so I'm dropping my rating from 6 to 5."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The New Mutants is a movie about 5 teenagers, all of them a stereotype seen in hundreds of movies (the shy girl, the outcast, the rebel, the sexy and the traumatized), that try to survive an evil experiment of a big corporation.

The visual effects, the script holes the bad connecting and the forced romance made me cringe af.

The plot holes you can drive truck through"}, {"id": 20, "text": "SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!Why do I hate this? Let me count the ways:1) The plot is old hat. It's basically a haunted house movie set in MA.2) There is zero characterization. The crew members are virtually interchangable. How can you care about somebody getting killed when you don't know who they are?3) Getting a bunch of talented actors and giving them nothing to work with.4) Overdone set design. Yes, it's impressive but it overwhelms what little plot there is. Nice set design does not make a movie.5) People stumble around in dark corridors and dark rooms looking for a cat. Not once but TWICE! And this is after they know there's a killer alien on board!6) What the hell is a cat doing in a hospital?7) The characters act incredibly stupid.8) The Smiley guy looks dumb--it's just a guy in a slightly modified alligator suit. Cool set of double teeth though.9) What does the Smiley guy do with its victims? Two of them just disappear.10) Why is the Smiley guy killing them? What reason? We're never given one. Oh wait--because it's in the script. That's why!11) Maisie Williams strips to down to her underwear for no reason whatsoever at the end.12) IT'S DULL!!!!!!!!"}, {"id": 21, "text": "Finally after 3 years I saw it, and I must say I really enjoyed it. The movie starts off quite well, however it definitely falls flat a bit at the end, but it's entertaining and worth watching. It has a decent length and it's well made and it has a good plot. As for the concept of horror ... MEH ... it's not really horror, it has a little bit of horror but nothing spectacular, and I wouldn't put it under the category of horror. I loved all the characters, especially the character of Magik (Anya Taylor-Joy), it's a shame that we won't see these characters and their stories anymore since it is the closing chapter of the X-Men saga with FOX. Probably all the delays that occurred with this movie affected it in one way or another, especially because most of the people will expect too much and be disappointed, but give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is. At least it's WAY better than X-men Dark Phoenix."}, {"id": 22, "text": "The star wars prequels are better than this cringe piece of TRASH"}, {"id": 23, "text": "Don't know why this is getting sick bad reviews. It's not top notch Marvel but it's entertaining enough. A solid three star out of 5.It's basically one flew over the breakfast club with added superpowers. The characters are likeable, and at an hour and a half it neither outstays it's welcome nor eats into post cinema drinking time.I doubt the box office will justify a sequel, which is a shame as I'd like to see what happened next."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I honestly think people are being harsher on this movie then they should be, sure, this movie could have been better story and acting wise. But with the amount of delays and reshoots it had you gotta give it its credit. It tried to tackle something new which I think landed. The way they tackled the horror theme, to me was perfect. People were expecting a full out conjuring horror with an endgame level ending which is obviously not what this movie was going for so for anyone expecting either of those your of course gonna get disappointed. It does start out a little slow but once the horror and trauma aspects of the characters start the movie is easier to get into. My family and I went into this movie barley seeing the trailers and not really knowing what to expect and we came out feeling like we got our moneys worth. If you're questioning what to do because of the reviews I advice you go and make your own opinion."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Personally, I feel that that essence of what it is to be a mutant has been lost"}, {"id": 26, "text": "FOX have taken arguably 2 of their best franchises and took a dump.

The idea of a crossover of these 2 behemoths appealed to me and still does under the right circumstances"}, {"id": 27, "text": "I love B movies, but I like to be aware from the beginning that I'm watching one. I can't believe someone could mess up a movie about the new mutants so bad.The New Mutants are AWESOME. This movie made a big joke out of them. The creators didn't take this movie seriously at all. I am throughly disappointed in how Josh Boone handled this film. He made a mockery of amazing characters. It's like he was trying to be serious in the beginning, then their writers got high and gave up. Almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were awful and were NOT The New Mutants. I am so ridiculously sad that no one takes The New Mutants seriously anymore. These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films. They should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves"}, {"id": 28, "text": "First of all, this is not okay LOL. this movie is actually garbage like it's so bad, I would rather watch celebi and exaks adventures over this."}, {"id": 29, "text": "I thought waiting so long to see this movie would be worth it, but no, it turned out to be a total disaster.

It wasn't very scary but I also didn't want it to be. The demon bear by far is the scariest thing in it. I'm not gonna lie, it made me jump a few times. It's a smaller environment that truly gave the characters time to shine. My favorite was Magik of course. But I loved the love story between Wolfsbane and Mirage. They did with just a beauty and finesse that it made me tear up a few times. Truly beautifully done. The film doesn't really try to hard to be too different which is where a small fault lies. It surprisingly has its fare share of twists, nothing too groundbreaking tho. The New Mutants can be a fun time if you don't expect a masterpiece.Ps. If you're a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer you won't want to miss this movie!Oh and no post credit scenes."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Adleast if this was R rated the romance seense between Maisy Wiliams and anya would have been more interesting this movie lacks story, depths, emotional connection, any logic, its very soft horror the main evil charechter isnt evem so bad and her acting is so bad...there is potential there becaouse the charechters have cool powers ...in the whole 1 scene in 2 houres that they use it....but 1 scene doesnt make a movie good...i mean seriusly the only thing kept me going was that romance between maisy and ania...but that also wad ruined by the pg13 of the moviereally its not the best movie to watch"}, {"id": 33, "text": "First, stop with the teenage lesbians. It's wrong on so many levels. The relationship wasn't the least bit realistic and just seemed rushed and forced. Sort of like the second half of the movie. Honestly, this picture had a lot of potential and they should have let it be a full-on horror movie like it was planned. The ending is destroyed by basically telling the BBEG to STOP. Our hero gets a pet and tell it to sit and stay. I thought I was watching a made for TV movie. This is, by far, the worst movie under the x-man banner."}, {"id": 34, "text": "This movie is not worth watching. Its story has no twist and turns but that's not the worst part, the worst part is the acting. There are no actors that match their characters. except for Adam.

It introduces the stereotypical teenage characters with issues. It goes on for more than half of the movie. Then it comes to the climax where the new kid loses control over her powers. And then the movie ends. I felt empty afterwards. I waited for years due to the delays...to watch this movie. Anyways, I gave this movie 3/10 because I like Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams as actresses. And I like the Buffy the Vampire Slayer's cameo of sorts. Oh wait, Marilyn Manson is credited in this movie. Going down to 2/10."}, {"id": 36, "text": "I don't think she ever could. Her GoT poor acting got a pass as she was in a popular series and was given a cool story line. In this movie and the others this year shows just how bad she actually is. Without any good actors to support her she reveals that she's just as bland as any other average teen actor.This has it all; bad acting, poor dialogue and 90's CGI to go along with a predictable plot. The entire movie takes place in an old school house so I guess they used up all their budget on the effects. Nothing good here."}, {"id": 37, "text": "Hard to believe this was shot and finished in 2017 and just now got released. Production hell made it feel like it would never be out. Now that it's finally here I can say from my Personal exp, it's Honestly way more surprising than what I expected and does justice to source material. It has some stranger things influence and some cliches around it but overall is a nice blending of bizarre horror tinged aspects from the comics with great character arcs. Solid action and comedy relief that doesn't feel forced.

But with all the communication around the movie we do not know if we saw the original movie or an edited version. But whatever. I had a good time. On the good side, the actors, the respect in some aspects of the original book and the FX are ok. On the down side, we do not really know the direction of the movie. Is it horror? Is it a teen movie? Is it a superhero movie? Definitely not the latest. But here again. Whatever. The job is done. We spend a good time. And due to the chaotic journey of this movie to reach our movie theaters, that's all we wanted."}, {"id": 43, "text": "I enjoyed the New Mutant comics growing up, &amp; was so looking forward to seeing the characters I loved make it to the Big Screen. When they said it would be filmed as a horror, I didn't think I'd be able to watch it, as horror movies freak me out. I needn't have worried, because while there are some creepy characters/ creatures, it did not have that horror atmosphere, &amp; I wasn't scared at all.PROS: -The young cast, especially Dani &amp; Illyana. Dodgy accents aside, they all did a good job of conveying teen angst &amp; having to cope with their powers in an unfamiliar/ possibly enemy setting. I thought the idea of having them in an institution, &amp; being in the dark about who put them there, &amp; Reyes true motives, was good &amp; was a good foil for the manifestation of Dani's power.The effects were pretty good.Dani &amp; Illyana's powers were pretty awesome.CONS: Why was there only one Doctor/ supervisor in the whole place, considering these kids have potentially dangerous &amp; uncontrollable powers? There's not even any tech support, with all the monitors etc...Rahne's character is deeply religious in the comic, &amp; constantly conflicted about her power. It doesn't gel for me that she would embark on a lesbian relationship, or if she did, that she wouldn't be apprehensive or have guilt about it.-The kids (in the comics, from what I remember) are supposed to be not long out of puberty, when their powers are manifesting, &amp; they (with the exception of Rahne) all looked about 17-18. Sam, I thought, looked older than that. Why didn't Rahne turn full wolf in the action scenes? In fact she was hardly a wolf at all. I wanted to see more of all their powers.Overall, flaws aside, I enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the comics, I'd probably have enjoyed it more. Apparently they aren't making any more movies about the New Mutants, which is a shame, because there's potential there. I'd love to see more of Illyana's backstory."}, {"id": 44, "text": "This movie is actually pretty cringe bro like really cringe"}, {"id": 45, "text": "I was looking forward to this movie for some time given the on again off again release of its journey to the big screen and I felt that the premise of a horror / mutant mash up was an interesting idea. However the execution was very disappointing. I was never emotionally invested in any of the characters which should have been a slam dunk given the premise but the direction was standard at best.The set was unconvincing and lent little to the tone and atmosphere which I am sure the creatives involved were desperately hoping for. The jump scares were as predictable as paying taxes.Some of the visual effects and action sequences were decent but couldn't save this film from a dull review."}, {"id": 46, "text": "This movie has taken X-Men concept to another low with disappointing so much expectation.

The concept behind the movie, its clearly rushed and half-assed production, and cast of mostly unlikable characters are a concoction for disaster. Somehow, it looks worse than the previous two movies, and its kills are fairly average with a few exceptions. A lot of people like Anna Taylor's acting in this one, but I think she's just alright. The movie's depiction of Mutants as Uncle Dad, and with their poor face and bulking physique are all unbecoming of the Hero that the original did so well. The film has very few redeeming qualities. It's kind of hard to believe that a film series that arguably should never have spawned from the 2000 original sank this low."}, {"id": 50, "text": "* I couldn't recognise any similarities between X-MEN &amp; this movie (as it suppose to be a re-opener for X-MEN chronicle. It is simply a teen thriller, about come-of-age, with a twist, i mean mutations. Recently, I've seen many like this movie, more original ideas, better effect &amp; acting, (Remember Us?), the funny thing is the announcement of one of the executives in the FOX 20th century, saying that this film will be lucky if it gives what it take, not to forget the multiple releasing delays, and now... it's VOD, Just like any B movie, and eventually it is worse than all, but with higher budget), I just can't find the right words, but it is awful, in all aspect, no exception.

Incredibly interesting characters, but no time for any really substance for any of them. The accents were choppy as well."}, {"id": 54, "text": "Ive spent much of today after watching the film just last night, trying to come up with positives to this film, unfortunately there is none I can think of, the movie has a number of big issues, firstly the constant delays to the film where I had heard reshoots were meant to be taking place. This was not the case. Then you have the actors issue, the actors consistently change accents, or their appearance change much like the blonde character one moment having hair buns then the very next seen it changed... the editing is completely off, and at best feels like a mismatch of scenes put together with no flow. When the characters start to go on about strange things happening and they all somehow know what each person is talking about makes no sense as at that point two of the characters had a single moment something happened... no character development really, plots just randomly thrown in and never revisited. Then there's the very very misleading trailer that paints a completely different film, I have no idea if the footage in the trailer was part of the very original cut or one the later cuts, I believe one the main reasons the film is such a mess is partly down to the constant push backs, that and the terrible mess of a plot (If it can be called a plot). The issues I mentioned early with the accents was a big part of the film, as the characters begin a dialog but it's very noticeable the accent is dropped or forgotten completely. What makes that worse is it's not just one character, it's basically all of them. In addition the CG work and other effects are just down right poor, the bear at the end is constantly changing size and shape, one angle the bear appears huge on the face angle but then shifting further away at a side angle somehow has become so much smaller than when it was attacking the building where it clearly towering 2 or so floors... I wish I could find some redeeming quality to this film, the New Mutants end result was such a mess you could hardly call it a film, there was no horror aspect like seen in the trailer, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, it's a skip, 5.5 is far too generous.

The girl who played Dani was mediocre, Charlie Heaton's accent was forced to say the least, and Anya-Taylor Joy's accent veered from Russian-ish to South American/Hispanic. The makeup and visual effects were on a Halloween store and PlayStation 3 level, leaving a lot to be desired. I found it hard to be captivated at times because of how jarring some of it looked.

No. It has its moments of the expected superhero team-up cliches, unnecessary teen drama, and the occasional clunky editing, but what it lacks for in technical prowess, it makes up for in pure energy.

Not cursed in the sense that people died while it was being filmed, but rather that the release date just seems to get pushed further and further back. Well, it's been released, but not to critical acclaim, one of the reasons being that we are in the middle of a global pandemic, and it seems that people, well, just don't want to go to the cinemas anymore (or at least that is what seems to be the case of late).The other issue is that this seems to have been redone by Disney, after they purchased Fox because, well, they don't do horror films. That was the thing with this film, and that it was supposed to have a lot more horror elements to it, and yeah, it sort of did, but in my mind it really didn't work. It fact, well, I sort of found it rather boring, but I guess that probably has something to do with the X-men franchise really starting to get quite long in the tooth.Yeah, the film is about this girl who has developed mutant powers, and because of it her entire reservation is wiped out. She then wakes up in a hospital where she is with four other teenagers and they are being taught to use their powers properly. However, there seems to be a lot more going on with this. It does sort of eventually come out, but the reality is that the film is more about them trying to escape - sort of.I guess the thing is that they are trying to learn their mutant powers, and much of the film is trying to guess what they are. They aren't being all that open with this, but things do start becoming more noticeable as the film progresses. In fact, it has a lot to do with trying to work out what Dani's power's are, and then with her trying to bring them under control.Honestly, I really didn't think much of this film. I guess in part because the trailer showed that it was going to be one thing, but many of the really horrific parts seemed to have been removed from it, which was a real shame. Honestly, I do have to admit that I was quite disappointed, but yeah, all I have to say is that there is really nothing new with this film, and it is likely to pass into obscurity."}, {"id": 96, "text": "No tonal consistency, no real plot.

While this movie wasn't horrible like some reviews say it is, it definitely wasn't a great movie. Let's start with the trailer for the movie, I assumed it was going to be a movie with horror, or at least some amount of suspense which is what the trailer had shown. Yet the movie is completely different from what I thought it was going to be. Also another problem I had with the trailer was the fact they literally spoiled what was going to happen, for example the russian girl says that it is a prison. So before I even watched the movie I knew Dr. Reyes was going to be evil. Now on to the actual movie, for a movie that was marketed as being scary there was little to none for horror. The only part where I was scared was the opening where they are running away with all the chaos and when Sam was having the mining vision. I suppose the love children of microwaved slender man and venom were a bit scary. The main character seemed very dull compared to the rest of the cast, her only personality being that she misses her dad and is native. You don't really know much about her. Everyone's powers were alright, I didn't have any gripes with them apart from Illyana, her powers left me very confused. They brushed over what her powers were so quickly that I never understood what they were. Apparently it's sorcery. Now onto the convoluted plot, I am so bamboozled on the lack of security that the hospital has, they had one mutant looking over a bunch of likely rebellious children that have been brought here against their will. Yes even if Dr. Reyes had shield powers they could so easily take her out. Illyana during the whole movie expresses how it's a prison, if she doesn't like it so much why does she stay? Rahne just scratches the crap out of Dr. Reyes and she's done for, but you might be saying  But how would she know she would be able to get out if she took out Dr. Reyes?  Well when Illyana and Danny get into a fight she stops Illyana from attacking with her shield powers. If Illyana had more than three brain cells she would of put two and two together, realizing that the shields looked the same. Any of them could of took her out! The only security there is Dr. Reyes and the cameras. The CGI, to be honest it wasn't that bad but it definitely was not blockbuster material, it was more like CGI I would see in a high production show. The bear CGI threw me out of the movie and when I saw Dr. Reyes get thrown around like a rag doll I wanted to laugh. The end, the ending bear fight was very boring to me, it came out of no where and the mediocre CGI didn't help. I thought the bear being tamed was fine but left some questions about Danny's powers and what happened. Did her fear just go away or is she able to control it now? The ending was left open so I can assume a sequel might be planned, but since this movie was supposed to come out a couple years ago and has pretty low ratings, so it's not likely. Overall the New Mutants is a mediocre movie with a plot that hangs by threads. 4/10 it can pass the time but has little rewatch value."}, {"id": 157, "text": "Wow, i have never felt so much hatred in my life.

The finale itself was a little better as more characters were using their powers, Magik was probably my favourite, but there still seemed to be something missing.

Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor-Joy are good actors but the material doesn't have enough in it to put their capabilities to the best use. Blu Hunt, I felt, couldn't carry the film on her shoulders all the way (her performance needed some refinement!).

After the absolutely stellar first trailer released in pre-COVID 2018, the movie got stuck in development hell for two years. With rumors of reshoots and re-edits plaguing the Internet, and especially with Disney acquired 21st Century Fox, most were convinced that The New Mutants would never see the light of day. Enter 2020: The New Mutants was finally given its well-deserved theatrical release in August of this year, three years after filming wrapped in 2017. And after years of pushbacks and delays, the one question on everyone's mind is: Is the movie any good? In my opinion, the answer is a resounding yes.I absolutely adored this movie. Granted, I do have an affinity for Breakfast Club style films, and as this movie has been described as a haunted-house movie with a bunch of hormonal teenagers, what you expect is pretty much what you get. And for me, that was a good thing. There has never been a superhero movie quite like this before; in fact, I'd even hesitate to describe The New Mutants as a superhero film. Gone are the bombastic and high-stakes end of the world battles. Instead, the movie takes a refreshingly small-scale approach, taking place virtually in one entire location and foregoing all preconceived notions that the audience may expect while watching an X-Men film.While there are stakes, the stakes are more personal, and thus, more emotionally resonant. Because the film intimately follows the five main characters, by the time the action starts you already feel connected with them and know why they're fighting and who they're fighting for. And the action itself is thrilling. While this isn't necessarily an action movie, when there is combat it is slick and well-filmed, and surprisingly, bloody. The New Mutants is pretty intense for a PG-13 film. Complete with people's faces getting ripped to shreds and terrifying imagery that depicts the PTSD of childhood abuse, this movie goes to great lengths to differentiate itself from other genre films.Let's talk horror: While the movie has been marketed as a horror film, the horror elements are more implicit than they are explicit. And here, it worked. When the horror hits, it hits hard. There is disturbing imagery and disgusting elements that are teased, proving once again that some things are more frightening in imagination than they would have been if they were fully explained. I would of course have liked to see more horror sequences, but the ones we got were creepy enough to satisfy me, as a horror fan. But then again, a major element that helped these sequences work was the characters.I loved every character in this film. While I do think this movie could have, and should have, been longer to deepen the characterization, what we do get of these characters leaves you wanting much more after the end credits roll, which is a good sign in my book. The cast does a phenomenal job with what they have. Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton, and Maisie Williams stand out to me as the highlights of this movie; they were truly incredible and I was riveted every time they were on screen, which is thankfully, a lot of the time. Also, Maisie's romance that is built up with Blu Hunt's character is extremely sweet and does not at all feel like pandering or checking a diversity box. But like I said, this movie is so short that it really feels like a lot of character development scenes were left on the cutting room floor. I wanted much more of Charlie Heaton's character, who just oozed pain and personality throughout. Similarly, I wished that Maisie and Blu's romance was built up just a little bit more; I think this would've done wonders in helping the audience become even more emotionally invested.Josh Boone did a fantastic job with his direction. The romance is filmed beautifully, the action clearly, the horror frighteningly, and just in general, this is a gorgeous movie to look at. You can tell he has a passion for this material, and that passion definitely carried over to the cast because, like I said, everyone was doing a fantastic job. Now, this movie isn't perfect. There are some cringy lines of dialogue, some wonky edits, and, while I understood what they were going for in the last act, I really wish it would have continued the small-scale story that the first two acts were building. Regardless, none of that took away my enjoyment of this movie as a whole. The New Mutants was such a fun time at the movies, and I can't wait to watch it again."}, {"id": 246, "text": ":: Quick note for comic fans. What I will be reviewing is the New Mutants film itself not the comics nor it's inaccuracies from the demon bear Saga of New Mutants.::The New Mutants for me was a breath of fresh air from what can only be described as a bombardment of the same story in super hero films. Whether to save money or just trying something new the film sets it focus on six characters unraveling each of their dysfunctions slowly. It Centers on Dani Moonstar being put into a kind of Institution after her father and her whole tribe is wiped out by some unseen force. In the institution she's put with mutants like herself who have all suffered because of their new mutant abilities. Teenage Drama ensues as Dani finds a love interest in Rayne Sinclair (Maisie Williams) another patient/prisoner with the ability to become a wolf. Then everything is turned on its ear when the Institutions only doctor tries to murder Moonstar and the whole Hospital suddenly becomes Hill house complete with Smiling men, blood ash raining from the ceiling and a Demon Bears. It turns out Dani was born with the mutant ability to manifest everyones deepest fear. Giving it hands and legs so I can hurt them. The Demon bear feed by all of Dani's adolescent insecurities and fears destroyed her tribe and killed her father. After ripping the whole institution apart and almost killing her new friends Dani confronts her fear sending it away.

The acting by 4 of the 5 mutants was good and the girl who played Magik absolutely killed it. I thought the action was good and it did have a tense feeling throughout the whole movie. I think it did a good job of setting up everyones fears before the final battle. And it was so good to finally see these characters come to life. Lets get to the bad. It had some writing problems and the acting from the girl who played Dani needed some work. The trailer def did ruin the scares and I feel that the trailers kindve mismarketed it too much as a horror movie as it was more of a sci fi thriller.

I actually felt bad for the actors involved because i know at least half of them have done great work in the past and there is no way this was worthy of their talents.The story is nonexistent. There is no character development to speak of and you are given no chance to have any emotional connection to anyone involved.I hope Maisie Williams gets a chance soon to redeem herself in another movie because this was a horrible example of her talent.

There was good character development, good action sequences, with comedy bits and touching moments so overall good film. I also liked how they made references to the Fox X-Men Universe, which to me, is important in a film series. However, I do wish it had more jump scares and creepy moments which is why I deducted a point. Who knows? Maybe they had to cut lots of it out due to it being given a PG 13 film rating.

About several teenagers who are in a asylum hospital being studied by Alice Bragas character. If her character is a good guy or bad. She is trying to help the teens take control of there abilities. Only except the teens face is there worst fears in the hospital.The film starts out with an intense bang with Dani and her father trying to escape from some kind of menacing beast. Until she wakes up in a hospital with others. The plot is an interesting spin on the mutants in the x men universe. It does have a let down climax and ending.The direction does build a little suspense with Anya Taylor facing against long faceless beings in the hospital. Which comes out like a horror movie. With the characters trying to escape. It does have a slow second act in the middle with Alice Braga interviewing each character.The cast ensemble was good. The script struggled near the end when the characters were facing against the villain. Which they could not have come up with a better idea.

The horror elements could have been more in my opinion but I knew they had been cut down during the long long production/post production process. But I liked what they had in there. I thought the actors did a good job and the accents weren't nearly as bad as some had said. For the most part they pulled it off. So in closing, if you like the characters and you like X-men movies you will like this movie. If you want something different in your super hero movies, you will like this move.

I heard many things about why this film didn't get released sooner to creative differences to it being made more horror like.

Each of them have past traumas which are linked to their super powers they may or may not know about. That's the films plot which is in the sense of the word thin.I found the film to be ok, but was expecting more, a lot more given it's released date &amp; development hell it languished in for the past 2 years. I seen some visuals &amp; thought they would be in this film, sadly they weren't, while some which I had seen prior to this film were in &amp; were pretty good &amp; scary, there was a lot that didn't make it into the final cut which was a shame.The film seemed flat, dull &amp; pretty droning for the first hour or so. The setting was bland &amp; there was no music in the film, which I weirdly I didn't notice. The film also felt isolated given there was a cast of only 6 people. I also could smell some Left Wing Woke Agendas being inserted here &amp; there... not to mention a few toxic digs as well... makes me wonder if that was one of the reasons for re-shoots, re-writing, red-editing etc. Who knows.Anyway the film did have some impressive visuals &amp; was actually alright, the ending was a bit so &amp; so for me but alright. The pacing &amp; run time a 1 hour &amp; 27 minutes wasn't too bad either to be fair, though I felt the film could've been beefed up more with scary visuals &amp; scenarios.Overall it's alright, but I was expecting much more from this given how long we had to wait. 5/10"}, {"id": 279, "text": "My God what a terrible end to a franchise, Maisie Williams plays one of her worst roles ever here as Rahne Sinclair and her two sidekicks Same and Dani (Charlie Heaton + Blu Hunt) are so cringe-inducing and boring I wanted to cry.

Blu Hunt, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton, Henry Zaga, and Alice Braga are great, and Anya Taylor-Joy is fantastic. Magik is by far the most interesting character, and Taylor-Joy does a solid Russian accent, at least to my barely-trained ears. Also, Charlie Heaton does a very good Kentucky accent.

Read the comics most of my life starting in the 80's and they have always been my favorite comic book characters. That said, I don't have blinders on where the movies are concerned. Some have been great (X-Men 2, X-Men Days of Future Past, Logan, Deadpool...) some have been ok and some downright disappointing (X-Men 3, X-Men Apocalypse...).The New Mutants falls somewhere in the middle area for me. There are a lot of things I really liked about it but a few things holding it back from being great.Overall I enjoyed it. Most of my few complaints didn't ruin the movie and in the long run feel inconsequential (since this is the last of the Fox X-Men films before Disney wipes the slate clean and does their own spin on the Marvel mutants).The cast is great. The characters felt like they we're given time to develop and feel realized (at least as much as you can do in an hour and half or so)... the final battle has some really cool moments. Magik in particular has some kick ass scenes.Spoiler below... The biggest shame to me, besides the fact we won't see this iteration of these characters on screen again, is that the Essex plot will go unresolved. The X-Men films have been teasing and laying the groundwork for Essex to be a main villain for some time now. This film probably did the most to prepare us for a confrontation with Mr. Sinister. It is a shame that never came to fruition.Anyway, I liked this movie. I am excited to see what Disney does with the mutants. But I am also a bit sad this is the end of the Fox era.

Maybe it's taking so much heat because with so many delays people had built it up to be something it's not. It doesn't fit perfectly in any genre box, it melds a bunch together.

I expected so much more..."}, {"id": 372, "text": "This film makes me feel conflicted. I went to see it on Sunday 30th August, and I had not seen a single piece of advertising for it before hand, so I assumed it was the first film from an unknown company. So, I was very surprised to see the 'In Association With Marvel' logo! However, this was just the start of the conflicted feelings.The fact that the introduction started with an infamous cliche surprised me, especially with it being associated with Marvel. The cliche of the two wolves fighting inside you was used, but instead of it being wolves, it was bears. This cliche was used to give backstory to the main character - Danielle Moonstone - and although it was effective in doing that, I couldn't help but giggle a bit at the obvious cliche nature of it.However, once the cliche monologue was out of the way, we were thrown into a sequence in which her father and fellow village-members die, giving her a backstory. Admittedly, this sequence, while not flawless, was rather good. I was glad to see that they built immersion quickly.The main character Danielle is a very interesting character to me. She is presented as someone you would understand. Her reactions to the bizarreness of her situation are fairly realistic. The fact that she is a Person Of Colour, female and LGBT+ is a rarity in film, and I'm absolutely thrilled to have her as the main character. The fact that the writers didn't shy away from her heritage, femininity or sexuality was very satisfying to see, and something that I greatly appreciated.Dani's power is linked to the fears of those around her. Whatever they fear, she exposes them too. I enjoy the power dynamic that this power brings to the group. She is undoubtedly powerful, she is probably the most significant character out of her group, but she doesn't completely outshine the others. However, her power leaves me conflicted at the same time. The fight sequence with the bear at the end of the film felt, for lack of better words, odd. I feel like the fact that isn't wasn't Dani fighting for the majority of it made me feel like the final fight was unfinished and incorrect. The way that she killed him to sleep instead of actually killing it really frustrated me and made me feel like I did at the beginning, irritated over a cliche. If the writers redid that scene, it could've been better. For example: If the demon bear wasn't so comically huge and overpowered, it would've improved the immersion of the scene AND If the fight was left to Dani to do, rather than her friends being left to fight until the end I appreciate that the ending was probably written that way to make the characters seem like they had bonded, but I think that a solo ending would've worked better in this case.The other main characters are a bit of a mixed bag. Illyana Rasputin probably irked me the most. She had so much potential, but they should've worked harder on giving her a real personality, rather than trying to shove her into being the quirky edgy girl cliche. She has such a lot of potential and I'm honestly sad to see her not fully utilised. Her traumatic past, whilst interesting, was never fully explored and was only used for a cheap fight scene. She boasts about killing loads of people, but that fact is never clearly explained. She had the potential to be a fun anti-hero. Her power stemming from her toy dragon, a symbol of her childhood trauma was particularly good, I very much enjoyed that idea! It's moments like that that I realise that this film has its brilliant moments. The visual of her sword and her metal plated arm was stunning. It reminded me of a graphic novel, it was just the right balance of flashy colours and shapes like a drawing. I enjoyed her whole attack visual very, very much and I would love to see more of her in battle. With some tweaking, I would love to see a stand alone film of her. If her edgyness was toned down, her trauma and fears better developed and her name adjusted, I could honestly see myself enjoying her a lot more.In the beginning she's nasty in a way to Dani that honestly made me uncomfortable. The racist bullying dialogue she says was unnecessary to me. Yes, racism happens. But to hear someone call an indigenous person Pocahontas in a film made in 2020 was not what I wanted to hear in an otherwise very accepting film. Also, her surname Rasputin irritates me beyond belief! I'm not sure what ethnicity Illyana is supposed to be, and I don't like to make assumptions, but I'm going to assume for the purposes of explanation that she was supposed to be Russian. So, having her surname as Rasputin was a bit like have an English person's surname be Crumpets and Tea. It was silly, unnecessary, immersion breaking and quite jarring.The issue with the racial stereotype continues with Roberto De Costa, who is presented to be from Brazil. I don't think they could've come up with a more stereotypical name if they'd tried! Honestly, I wish that they had rethought the names. I'm not sure if that was the original names that they had in the comics, but even if they were the original names, they could've adjusted them to be more fitting for a modern audience. Roberto was the cliche girl hungry boy, who had little personality other than being good looking. But, I enjoyed the trauma related to his power, especially the visuals that I brought to the screen, it had a very specific comic book charm to it.Sam Guthrie is alright. The visuals of his power were very entertaining! He seemed like a decent enough character, but to be honest, he's not stuck in my mind very much.Finally, we come to Rahne Sinclair. I have to be honest, I love her to bits!I love her power. It's very rare to see a female werewolf, so it was fun to see her in that position! Her power is simple enough to follow, but it also brings a lot of fun visuals and interesting power dynamics, such as when she protects Dani from the doctor, who I unfortunately cannot remember the name of! Her power is violent, which brought forward some very good fights.I love how human she is (despite the obvious fact she's a werewolf). The way that she dresses gives her the sense that she's down to earth, the fact that her design isn't too flashy like Illyana's also gives her the sense of the underdog.Her trauma is very well done. The priest branding her as a witch was an interesting route to take. The way that she has her triggers (churches, her scar etc) make her trauma feel realistic. Speaking of which, I enjoy how she addresses her trauma with Dani. When Dani exposes her to her fear due to her power, she says that she understands that it's out of her control and that they will work through the issue together. I was so happy to see that! Dani and Rahne have a very well communicated relationship. As a teen myself, it makes me happy to see people present teens like people, rather than annoying messes. Dani and Rahne are a great example of a kind, understanding and communicative couple in fiction, and seeing them work through things together was very satisfying to see.Speaking of their relationship, I love that too! From the very first scene they had together, I felt like they had good chemistry. They were very sweet together! The fact that they actually got together was a lovely surprise, the fact that they allowed their first kiss to be on screen was very cute. Although their relationship was rather rushed, I can forgive that as everything that happens in this film happens fast. Rahne and Dani were a joy to see on screen together. They compliment each other so much. Overall, Rahne is probably my favourite. She was realistic enough for me to root for her, interesting enough to be a good hero, and sweet enough to be a likeable individual.In regards to the plot, it was a bit odd. The cliche of the corrupt doctor was obviously predictable, but if you were able to get past that, it was a reasonable premise. I enjoyed seeing the trauma of each character play a part. The 'horror' elements, especially Illyana's, whilst not being very scary were quite fun. Many people have said that the film felt a little disjointed, which I can agree with. But, if you go into the cinema expecting an LGBT romance, coming of age or a goofy comic spin off, you'll have a good time. However, if you go in expecting flawless, breakthrough writing and horror, you'll be disappointed.Overall, New Mutants was good fun!

No plot, no interest, no logic. the weakest movie in the franchise. there will be no continuation, I hope."}, {"id": 380, "text": "From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed they released an R-rated X-men movie not so long ago. It was well received by any means.Not exactly sure where to go next, seeing as they thought Mangold was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci-fi gem, Fox turned to it's small, but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers.These monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks, but had seen Burton's Planet of the Apes remake and House of the Dead.Their first task: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen TV actors shortly after.Now, the script. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. Leaving out important aspects of the franchise was the easy part. Thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. They butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award-winning screenplay equipped with clich\u00e9 characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes.Fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film - the mutants. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great CGI used in the otherwise terrible Dark Phoenix and go with the real mutants seen in the old films. The actors playing the mutants had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the Smileys, the monkeys decided one smiley was enough this time around (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of mutants that seemingly come out of nowhere.But what about the effects, you ask? Come on now, people. They may be monkeys but they clearly knew CGI would play a key role in the film. Without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. Putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent Smiley visions.The setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. If this was to be on Earth, in Massachusetts of all places, they needed to make it realistic. This was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. See, the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot people like to see the mutants instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, rookie mistake.The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie PG13-rated. That was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the viewers got the mutants they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving those mutants.Some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. Why does a blue liquid the Smiley has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? Why is an ex-convict driving around in a police car the entire movie? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the Mutants? Why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece.Fox was thrilled with their work. So thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on Christmas Day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises.But some ask, what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? They put it towards their next film: The New Mutants 2. They knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement:To the people- do not worry about our upcoming film. It will be rated R and will have violence.And everyone lived happily ever after. The end."}, {"id": 381, "text": "I had really been looking forward to this movie. Once it started getting delayed, I figured that wasn't going to be good news. There was a lot of potential that was never fully reached. The story itself wasn't that great and it probably wasn't the best to introduce these characters, but it could have been done much better. I recall this being marketed as a horror movie in teaser trailers years ago, but there wasn't much horror here at all. I'm not sure if this had to do with the director or with the studios. I think bumping up the horror aspects could have improved the movie significantly. The setting of the movie certainly allowed for it, so I don't know why they wouldn't have exploited that more. The pace also needed work. By the end of the movie, I felt like had watched a two hour movie even though it was barely an hour and a half.I was quite impressed with the cast for the most part. I wasn't familiar with too much of their work, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I think both Alice Braga and Blu Hunt's performances were mediocre, though Hunt's scenes with Masie Williams were her best. Alice Braga was just quite awful. Anya really turned out to be star of the movie. The only criticism that I have of her is her accent. It was quite inconsistent through and she could've definitely worked on it more. She was also the only one that really got to show off her powers, which was a little disappointing. Henry and Charlie were great. I wish both of them had gotten a lot more screen time and also gotten the chance to show off their powers for more than just a few seconds.There was definitely a lot more that could have been done with this movie and the characters. There were a few scenes that were in the teasers and trailers that didn't make it in the movie and some of the deleted scenes could have made it better.

Come on we know how titanic's going to end its predictable but we LOVED it!! Its in my top 5 if all time, it's a wonderful life, Christmas Carol, predictable yet amazing!! Anyway... new mutants is an excellent action super heroe movie it's a decent story with great special effects and great character development it was only 90 minutes so they accomplished a lot in a short time, ignore the pompous snooty reviews and watch this so we get a sequel which this movie needs, oh and all the actors did a great job!!! And people lighten up we have a virus killing our nation, we NEED escapes like this movie!!!!!"}, {"id": 387, "text": "I can see where they went with this. Filmmakers like Simon Kinberg intentionally shot out the X-Men series only to end on an awful note with Dark Phoenix last year. Now we have 5 new Heroes who come together and prevent an inevitable death scheme hatched by some doctor.

It wasn't a full blown, dark, twisted horror movie like many were expecting but it felt like they did a fairly well enough job incorporating the horror aspects they were working with into the plot and setting. It might not be worth the Blu-Ray or multiple viewings but it was definitely enjoyable as a change of pace during this quarantine.Those who are calling this movie boring have been over stimulated by the copy and paste, non-stop action superhero movies that have polluted the genre for years and can't sit through a superhero movie without constant explosions. Especially looking at that ending, slendermen and a colossal sized demon bear fighting a witch with her pet dragon is considered boring nowadays?We should be encouraging movies like this attempting to push the superhero genre out of it's tropes and cliches we've been desensitized to over the years.

This movie is exactly what I wanted from a superhero horror movie. Don't go in to this movie expecting a typical superhero movie. This is a horror movie with superheros. I think the two main reasons this movie kept getting pushed back is because it is very gay and very scary. In my opinion, those are good things. We need more gay horror superhero movies! This is not the mainstem superhero movie that Disney wants it to be. I think this is true to the director's vision. My biggest issue with the film is that it isn't subtle with its imagery, but most superhero movies aren't. I think that this movie will probably be compared to Glass. This movie is better than Glass, which I did like. New Mutants has an exciting third act. Some people might criticize it for falling into the superhero movie trap, but I think it's done well here. If you are looking for a horror movie with superhero elements, I would reccomend this movie."}, {"id": 391, "text": "I took the red one. It wasn't as much horror as a thriller. I'm easy to please.

The story managed to surprise me a few times and I can't wait to see what they can do with a serial if they get a little more budget to work with. The LGBT romance plot is well done, doesn't feel forced and doesn't contain many of the stereotypes we usually see in films.

Illyana isn't very likeable until the end of the film. Not terrible I just wouldn't watch if again. Action scenes kind of hook you in but not really.

This film exceeded my expectations by not being overly silly and comic book-y, and having obvious horror feel with a small cast in a claustrophobic setting. There are only minor references to the X-Universe, and then Essex, but that's really it. The characters have their own story and are allowed to show who they are and why they are there; not just existing to move the story to a bigger narrative or introduce other characters.

They are mutants who have caused chaos in the outside world, being unable to control their powers. They find themselves prisoners in a special lab and make plans to break free, little realising the new girl among them may be a danger to everyone on earth.The acting is fairly decent, the effects and make-up are good if a little flashy and overdone the lesbian love interest is never overly showy or explicit, and I liked Magik(Joy) the most for her skills with a sword, thought the teradactyl a nice touch.

Way better than X-Men:TLS, Origins, Apocalypse, and Dark Phoenix. But it stands on it's own. It works as a original horror film, but even better as a story about mutants in prison who believe they are in a hospital. A lot of surprises in this film and quite a bit of fan service for what it was. Good Acting, Good Action, Good Horror, Great FX, and good Cinematography. The theme feels creepy throughout and has just enough jokes and chemistry between characters to give it heart and soul. Definitely should have been released two years ago, we could have got a sequel.

Alice plays a doctor that runs a hospital that is supposed to teach the youngsters how to use their new mutant powers and eventually graduate into the X_Men club, hopefully. Blu plays Danielle Moonstar/Mirage, the newest addition to the hospital. She meets Maisie/Rahne Sinclair/Wolfsbane and Anya/Illyana Rasputin/Magik, as well as Sunspot and Cannonball. Oh yeah, Lockheed shows up, too. Each of the teens had bad experiences with their powers when they first developed and they are wishing for the control that was promised them but soon learn that Alice and her boss may have more sinister plans for them. A hint for the comic book fans out there, the company Alice works for is called Essex and her boss' name is Nathaniel Essex-but he is never actually shown. I did read that they are planning on making this part one of a trilogy so they have room to develop the storyline a little more. Overall, this is a superhero/horror movie that drags a little at the beginning but finishes like a superhero movie should; with a big powers flashing fight fest.

With Josh Boone as director, all the characters' background and personality were defined pretty well (albeit some cliches) and relationships were defined naturally. Along with the actors, visually it is appealing on all levels, and the story is crafted so it is an isolated story and smoothly told.

Most of the time I felt that the plot jumps from one story to another without taking the time to tell any of them properly. Characters are a bunch of cliches and present nothing of themselves. They almost had a good moment making the viewer guess who was in the pool with Sunspot but then instantly reveal what it is. There's simply no catch, no mystery - everything is obvious, everything is what you think it is. The main villain is... a bear. Yes, you read right. I expected the evil doctor to be killed by her own worst fear but she was just eaten by a bear. Then they had to fight the bear so he doesn't eat everyone else.

And this movie just lost this advantage."}, {"id": 596, "text": "The New Mutants has the obvious hallmarks of a pilot. It could be sequels, a TV series, or even both. The time it took for this movie to get distributed was something like two and a half years and so people craving for a continuation may have a long wait. In fact, there may be many. Compared with the general audience, people who had been enjoying the original comic will get a lot more out of this pilot. Not being one of those, I found myself wanting considerably more than what this movie offers. The background stories of the 5 protagonist are touched on, to various degrees of detail. But in general, a lot is missing. Maybe the relatively short duration (about 90 minutes) is to blame. Or maybe this is intentional, to work as teasers. If that is the case, it is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, I am sufficiently interested to want to see the follow-up. On the other hand, the background is still so scanty, after the 90 minutes that I have invested, that I may not even bother.Before I go any further, let me state that any deficiency I see in this movie may in fact reflect my own unfamiliarity with the original comic.While there are 5 new mutants, centre stage unquestionably belongs to Danielle (Dani) Moonstar/Moonstruck (Blu Hunt who somehow reminds me of adolescent Emma Watson as Hermione). The movie is bookended by her VOs which are wisely not overused during the course of the movie. The opening scene sees a mysterious catastrophic event (explained away as a natural hurricane) that wipes out her reserve, killing the entire population there, including her father. She later wakes up in a desolate correctional institution handcuffed to a bed. This venue is where the rest of the movie takes place.The first person she meets is Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga, Queen of the South and movies aplenty) who, as sort of an asylum-cum-prison warden-in-charge, comes across as far less menacing than most of the others stereotyped in movies you might have seen before. At times, you can almost believe that she is genuinely altruistic. While she does not have any mutant power herself, she is in full control because of the cutting-edge technology design for the compound. Her voice, and her voice alone, activates anything and everything. She answers to her boss who you are led to believe to be someone like Professor Xavier in X-Men, at least initially. There is no crafted, convoluted narrative. The 4 other fellow-mutants appear at the same time, in a talk therapy session Dani is introduced to. There are two other girls, personifying badie and goodie. Illyana (Anya Taylor-Joy, from Split) takes a lot of pleasure in hurling racist insults at Dani as well as calling the other girl dog repeatedly. The other girl is Rahne (Maisie Williams, Game of Thrones), the goodie whose alter ego is not a dog but rather a wolf. Completing the group are two guys from opposite ends of the social scale: Sam (Charlie Heaton, Stranger Things) a poor miner's son and Roberto (Henry Zaga), a Brazilian lad born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Without getting into details, let me just say that the respective superpowers that are supposed to distinguish these 5 individual are somewhat blurred. Ditto the states of reality, hallucination, psychological complexes, induced fear, alternate reality etc etc. As for all pilots, the 5 protagonist ended up bonding and setting out on the quest to search for their individual and collective destiny. We are supposed to get all the answers in the sequel. But, judging from the reception of this pilot by the general audience, a fate of a sequel is rather doubtful. A TV series, perhaps."}, {"id": 597, "text": "The movie begins rather mysteriously with the unknown origin of Dandy's power. But within moments we figure it out.

Instead of having sequels, they would have origin stories based on individual characters. I believe that they originally planed to have an X-Men Origins: Magneto film as well. However, these plans were soon dropped, for reasons we'll soon get into.Let's start with the story. We have a rushed beginning that messily sets up the plot. The relationship of Wolverine and Sabertooth are given only a couple of scenes before they become enemies. There's a decent heist action sequence at first. Ryan Reynolds does a good job as Deadpool in the first scene he's in. But it quickly becomes bad after that.Wolverine decides to retire, get married, and live an idle life. Then his wife gets killed by his brother (Sabertooth). This feels rushed as well, because we're only given one scene with them together, and so it's hard to feel that emotional. The rest of the movie is Wolverine being hunted down and him trying to get revenge.I won't get into the entire plot since it's way to complicated. Wolverine jumps from one location to another, making the story feel all over the place and unfocused. Gambit appears in the film as well, only to leave after five minutes. The CGI is especially terrible. As anyone would have told you back then, it looked bad in 2009, and it's gone worse with time.When you stop to think about it, you realize this movie was kind of pointless. We already know Wolverine's backstory, and nothing else of importance is achieved. None of new characters in this film return later, and Wolverine himself forgets everything at the end. It feels like pointless filler. Really bad filler.The movie was so poorly received that the studio decided to scrap their plans for the 'New Mutants' series, even though it made a decent amount of money at the box office. But it's quite a useless movie in the long run. If you're going to watch the entire X-Men franchise, it'll probably be best to leave this one out."}, {"id": 606, "text": "For just so long.

Now the accent from the actress that plays her is not so great, neither is smug look she tried to wear constantly. Sam's accent isn't that great either, but you can't help but like him a bit.It's not Avengers, it's not xmen, it's more of a teens end up in this place because their powers are dangerous and things may not be what they seem with the doctor and the company behind her. Let any expectations go, it's not a horror movie, it's not a scary movie, but as my 10 year old said that movie makes me anxious, but it is still a mutant, coming of age, superhero genre film.

There is so much more to this than what I'm sure I can even imagine and I'm gathering that by the small amount of deleted material we were given with the Blu-ray/Digital. Also adding the fact that this was delayed a lot (I'm surprised we even got this version tbh). There has to be a lot on the cutting room floor. While the whole movie is an edited mess I still enjoyed the characters, the little bit of story we were given, and the actual look of the demon Bear along with some of the characters. Anya as Magik was a fantastic casting choice and would be such a waste to not have her continue to play the role in future marvel films. Honestly I liked the entire cast which I didn't expect. I know that this is supposed to be the last Fox X-Men Movie but it doesn't have to be. The cut they released has almost no connection to that fox universe. It could easily be included in the marvel cinematic universe. I would really hate to see this cast thrown out because of the label put on it. I went into this movie with no expectations because of the all the reviews. I sat back, shut my mind off, and let myself enjoy what I was given. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. Again it's not a cinematic masterpiece. I'm sure I'm in the minority here but I believe this should be given a sequel because let's be honest a lot of sequels succeed their predecessors (X2, Raimi's SM-2, Aliens, etc.). Another thing I would like to add is that I liked the feel of the movie so I wish there were more of that haunted house aspect we were advertised the movie would have in the beginning. It's just another example of all the potential this movie and a potential (although unlikely) sequel could have.

The films in the series have delivered on the promise to make solid films with strong connections to the comics they were based on. This was the problem that the DC films suffered from, producers and writers who thought they needed to steer clear of the source material as much as possible. But DC wasn't the only one.The earliest incarnations of Marvel films in recent history did the same somewhere. In 2000 the first major film came out, THE X-MEN and in 2002 SPIDER-MAN hit the screens. Both used the basics from the comics but twisted them a bit in costumes, stories and tone. But fans wanted to see these movies and more followed. Neither series at the time were made by Marvel, with X-MEN coming from Fox and SPIDER-MAN Sony. Successful as they were it would take Marvel getting back the rights to most of their material for the better films to be made.That being said Fox still retained the rights to the X-Men franchise and that included the New Mutants. Created in 1982 the comic was an offshoot of the original group that had grown up. This new team consisted of younger members and the movie follows that much of the comics as well as most of the original team. But like its predecessors it deviates and goes for a horror styled theme instead of what the comics created.The film opens with Danielle Dani Moonstar's (Blu Hunt) being awakened by her father as their reservation is hit by a tornado. Knocked unconscious she wakes in a hospital run by Dr. Cecelia Reyes (Alice Braga). Reyes informs her that her that everyone else was killed and she survived because she is a mutant with powers. This facility was created to protect mutants and to help youngsters come to grips with their powers.She is introduced to the rest of the teens in the facility: Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams), Illyana Rasputin (Anna Taylor-Joy), Roberto de Costa (Henry Zaga) and Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton). Each has their own power as well as their own difficulties in getting along with other people. Sam tends to be shy, Roberto acts like a flirt, Illyana a snarky teen and Rahne the quiet and thoughtful one. Illyana is so nasty that she tricks Dani into making a run to escape the facility only to run into a force field that surrounds it.As the story progresses we learn about the powers of each of these teens as well as their attempts to harness those powers. We also get the feeling things are not on the up and up here as Dr. Reyes watches all of them via closed circuit camera. In addition to these she gets readings on each of the teens showing their life signs and psionic abilities.After her run in with Illyana Dani becomes closer to Rahne. Eventually the two begin a romantic relationship. This builds a tie between them that comes into play later in the film when the climactic battle (face it all of these movies have one). But it will take time before that happens and just what it transpiring is finally revealed.So is the movie any good? I'd heard the film was troubled being pushed back 2 years from its initial release date. The first trailer I saw gave me on desire to see the film since it seemed to deviate so far from the source material. So I went in wary. If you push all of that aside, watch the movie on its own merits without tying it into the Marvel Universe it is surprisingly decent. The acting is well done, the story isn't bad and the directing is solid.But at the same time it doesn't feel like it adds anything new. We've seen the CGI creatures and powers done to death in recent years. And the choice to face off against a huge creature/bad guy at the end of the film has become all too common. This was one of the worst problems with the GREEN LANTERN film. So why make the same mistake here?All in all the movie is entertaining enough and those who aren't familiar with the comics will most likely enjoy it more than those who are. And some fans of the comics will accept this movie for what it is and be glad to at least glimpse those heroes they grew up with and loved hit the screen. While I enjoyed the movie well enough I'm not likely to buy a copy and add it to my collection. I doubt I'll watch it again. It was worth seeing at least once though."}, {"id": 667, "text": "I thought this movie was great. After reading all the terrible reviews, I still wanted to see it for 2 reasons. 1.

It was filmed in 2017, due for release the following year, but Disney acquiring 20th Century Fox, and the COVID-19 outbreak, caused the film to be delayed for a long time, directed by Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars). Basically, during a tornado, Cheyenne Native American teenager Danielle Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt), escapes the destruction of her reservation. Dani's father William (Adam Beach) is killed by unseen entity, while she is knocked unconscious. Dani awakens in a hospital run by Dr. Cecilia Reyes (Alice Braga), who tells her that she is the only survivor of the disaster. Reyes comforts Dani, telling her she is a mutant, and advises her to remain in the hospital until she finds out what her abilities are and how control them. Dani is introduced to four other teenager mutants: Samuel Sam Guthrie (Stranger Things' Charlie Heaton), Illyana Rasputin (The Witch's Anya Taylor-Joy), Roberto Bobby da Costa (Henry Zaga) and Rahne Sinclair (Game of Thrones' Maisie Williams). All of them have suffered tragedy; Sam brought down a whole mine on his father (Thomas Kee) and co-workers, Roberto burned his girlfriend to death, Rahne escaped her strictly religious village after being branded as a witch, and Illyana is haunted by memories of her childhood involving slavery, which manifests as otherworldly beings called the Smile Men. All of them are manifesting mutant abilities; Roberto can manipulate solar energy, Sam can fly at jet speed, Illyana has inter-dimensional sorcery powers, and Rahne can turn into a werewolf. Reyes is a powerful mutant herself and keeps her patients from leaving the facility by surrounding it with an unbreakable invisible force field. The five of them believe that they are being trained to join the X-Men, hence the strict supervision, and Reyes reminds them that they are considered dangerous and should not leave until they have mastered their powers. Dani immediately befriends Rahne, eventually forming a romantic relationship, while Illyana, whose only friend is a purple dragon hand puppet she calls Lockheed, continuously antagonises Dani. Soon, the group all begin to have horrifying visions of their past tragedies, one of which results in Rahne getting branded on the neck. Illyana deduces that this is the result of Dani's powers manifesting; she has the ability to create illusions based on a person's visions. Reyes consults her employers, the Essex Corporation, who instruct her to collect Dani's DNA and have her exterminated. As Dani is taken away by Reyes, Rahne suspects that something is wrong. Illyana and Sam are attacked by the Smile Men while Roberto tries to break through the barrier, which has shrunken down. Dani uses her telepathic powers to learn of Reyes's true intentions before Rahne arrives in half-wolf form and attacks Reyes, forcing her to flee. The five regroup and realise that the only way to escape is to kill Reyes, eliminating the force fields' power source. Reyes traps them after they find her and reveals that they were being trained to be killers for Essex. Before she can crush Dani to death, Demon Bear, the entity that followed Dani and destroyed her reservation, arrives, and kills Reyes. Illyana uses her powers to create a real-life version of Lockheed to take on Demon Bear. Eventually, Sam and Roberto join the fight, overcoming their insecurities in the process. Rahne tries to wake the unconscious Dani, in limbo, until she is forced to fight the Demon Bear alone. Dani is visited by her father's spirit, who encourages her to face her fear. Dani wakes and confronts Demon Bear, calming it down and putting it to rest. As the sun rises, the group, now calling themselves the New Mutants, learn that the force field is down and head out together to face the unknown. Also starring Colbi Gannett as Young Illyana, Happy Anderson as Reverend Craig, Dustin Ceithamer as Smiling Man, and Marilyn Manson as the voice of Smiling Man. Rising star Taylor-Joy is good being nasty, Williams does well with her Scottish accent, Hunt is a reasonable leading character, and Braga is a good calm but secretly sinister villain. We have seen a movies like this before, characters trapped in a secret facility with others that fear what they are capable of, the story itself plods along slowly a lot of the time, but the special effects and tense moments get your attention, an average superhero horror.

The story gives an interesting insight into how dangerous mutants can truly be without developed powers or the aid of Professor X. I also really liked the movie's message about overcoming trauma. The characters are all interesting, with tragic backstories which make them more layered. Unfortunately, while the characters are written well, the acting is very wooden. Charlie Heaton, despite having one of the most interesting characters in the bunch, is terrible. He doesn't have a single convincing delivery in the whole movie. Anya Taylor-Joy also massively overacts as Illyana Rasputin, to the point that the character becomes quite annoying. However, the two leads (Blu Hunt and Maisie Williams) deliver a pair of pretty good performances, which carry the film, as do their characters, who are well fleshed out and sympathetic. A huge problem with the movie is that it's marketed as a horror movie but, aside from the odd CGI monster, plays out far more like a thriller. The story also suffers from being incredibly predictable. I knew exactly what was happening as soon the climax started. Also the villain is really bad. She started off interesting but slowly progressed into a boring one dimensional character as the film went on. Honestly, I'm upset that this film won't get a sequel because I feel like these characters have potential to be further explored.

The only character I thought should've been replaced was Moonstar..I just found her to be very boring and to have sub par acting. The rest of the cast was amazing and I thought meshed well together.

This film feels a bit too short and although the plot is very intriguing, we needed a bit longer to get more emotionally connected to the characters ; and for the most part most of the 'shocking' elements of the film is very predictable. 6/10"}, {"id": 724, "text": "With all the reshoots, delays, and creative difference surrounding this movie, I had very low expectations. It was supposed to be a quiet exit for the FOX-owned mutant stories.However, this movie wasn't exactly quiet. Most of the characters were compelling enough for me to be excited for the next part of their story. Ilyanna (Magik) seemed problematic and violent but turned out vulnerable. Sam (Cannonball) was obviously traumatized and created a sympathetic figure (even though Charlie's exaggerated drawl was hard to listen to at times). Rahne (Wolfsbane) had an interesting storyline with her religious background. 'Berto (Sunspot) had maybe the most interesting power, but probably the least development of his past.Where the problem arises for me was the portrayal of Dani (Mirage). The character could have been compelling as the reluctant antagonist that can't control herself. Blu's portrayal along with a dreadful script make Dani more of a cheeseball, cringe worthy outsider. The emotions only occasionally feel real, and even then they're accompanied by lines like You don't know me, everything's gonna be okay, and I feel like I made you up. Among the star studded young cast, Dani feels like a displaced Disney Channel character that does everything out of the good of her heart. The romance with Rahne is a bright spot, giving her a true motivation for the second half.Overall, I wanted to like this movie, and can only say I kind of did. A much better ending to the (FO)X-men than Dark Phoenix was. The inclusion of Essex Corp was the remainder of a script that led to greater impact throughout the universe, that we will likely never see.TL; DR: Wanted to like it, main character flaws, not bad at all"}, {"id": 725, "text": "Was so happy to finally see this movie we've all been anticipating for 3 years. However, I left the theater feeling somewhat empty.The movie began with a thunderous punch, which I had seen already when it was released on YouTube. That energy was quickly stifled with a slow crawl of story progression for the next two acts. What kept me involved was the charming performance of Maisie Williams.I could see what Boone was going for conceptually and within the story, but it all fell flat. Every reveal about the characters felt shoehorned in. The situational tension felt manufactured and unnatural, only serving the purpose of revealing specific Elements. Given the pace of the movie, more creative things could have been done to progress the stories naturally; but, scenes and shots were Continuously recycled.Anya Taylor Joy is always a delight to watch, the camera loves her. Her character had so much potential but she ended up feeling generic, despite a few moments of levity and one sentimental scene. We had already seen everything about her in the trailers, unfortunately. She went from badass to a crybaby too often. Wish her arc would have lead to more of an emotional and energetic reveal, but she kept being used to spice up the movie intermittently. Her action scene at the end felt flat and anticlimactic because of this.Blu Hunt held the lead role well, but didn't have much emotional range. There should have been more of her dealing with the knowledge that she killed her father and entire village. That's all swept away by the dues ex machina of her father just coming in a dream to say she's strong. It was cheap and undeserved and almost unexpected. There was nothing throughout the movie to make us feel like it was necessary or what she needed. Just a lazy Trope to lead to the anti climactic ending. I enjoyed the mysticism behind her story. But in the end, her power only works when she sleeps?The third act action scene was a mess. It goes form cannonball getting involved in the fight but we don't really see him do anything, then it jump cuts to the bear attacking the other two girls. What happened to cannonball and Majik??!! And the other characters don't do much to stop the attack either, but it doesn't ever show them all working together. They just power up, try to fight for a second, then get their asses handed to them. Who's idea was this to neuter everyone?!!!I really wanted to love this movie, and there are moments I enjoyed, and I did enjoy what the actors brought to the characters. But it took a concept with plenty of mystery behind it, and characters with so much potential for incredible arcs and growth, and instead just relied to heavily on tropes and forced situations to move the story forward unnaturally. And then just butchering the end action sequence by revealing too much of their powers Early without showing us their struggles, promising that when we see them that it will be awesome, then barely giving us anything from them at the end other than getting their asses beat. Did M knight Shamalan have a say In this.I recommend The New Mutants cuz it's a new movie and dear God it's been so long since we've been to a theater. It has its entertainment value and charm, but it falls flat and is forgettable. It's also sad to know there's no tie in with anything else marvel; and therefore this will be all we get from theses characters. It'd be nice to see Majik somewhere down the road. Maybe knowing that this was our only chance to get to explore these characters, and seeing it done so generically, that ultimately leads to my overall take on this film."}, {"id": 726, "text": "I was nervous going into this film since it had such a rocky release, but it turned out that it was worth the wait...

As X-Men films go, its definately not as good as Days of Future Past or First Class but is certainly better than Apocalypse, Dark Pheonix or X 3. Worth a watch in theaters."}, {"id": 733, "text": "The New Mutants has had one of the most famously tumultuous productions in recent movie history. It had multiple delays, rumors of reshoots, and a few times was suspended indefinitely because of corporate mergers, and our past selves to wonder if we would ever see it. Well, now we have. So was it worth the trouble? Sort of. Let's start off with the elements that the movie got right. The best part of this movie is the characters. They all have interesting backstories that show how they got to where they are, without overexplaining every little detail. Every character has their own method of approaching things and they all think differently about problems, which helps to unite them under their common goal of freedom. They also all behave in a way that seems totally in character for themselves in that situation. (Spoilers) Specifically, at the end of the film when the Demon Bear starts to attack them, Magik goes to fight the bear, looking to take it down, while Rahne tries to wake Dani up and get her to fix it, which makes sense for their characters. Magik, or, Illyana Rasputin, made the movie so much more enjoyable for me. She was my personal favorite character and she is played very well by Anya Taylor-Joy (except for maybe the accent, but we'll get to that later). She was my favorite because she had gone through so much pain and you understand why she lashes out at people, like she did to Dani, it's because she feels better about herself when she makes other people feel worse; she feels more in control. This film also benefits from a new perspective on the now concluded(?) world of mutants and X-Men. It shows what else is happening in the universe, and shows that not all mutant powers are fun to have. Now having said that, there are quite a few issues I had with The New Mutants. Now let me preface this with something. I think this movie would have been pretty great in 2018 or so when it's first release date was scheduled, however, today it's not so much. One of the biggest problems is how this was sold to the audience. It was presented as a horror movie, and (in my opinion) this is not a horror movie at all. Maybe this classifies as suspense, but it is NOT a horror movie. The trailers make it seem as if it is a terrifying story about fear and how it manifests, yet the actual movie is more about Dani trying to fit in with the other mutants and figuring out what powers they have. It was also not very scary at the moment at all, there was about one time I remember being scared, and it was the first time those weird smiley face Slenderman looking guys were shown attacking Illyana as a child, because of pure shock value. A lot of the film is creepy, but it is not at all as scary or weird as I thought it would be (and wanted it to be). The film itself is built as a horror movie, with not a lot of action and it's more mystery focused, but the problem is it's not scary enough or even mysterious enough that it fits the horror movie template that was set up. There is not a real mystery in this movie that I wasn't able to predict, except Magik's backstory, which wasn't even answered by the movie itself. The Slenderman guys were also very underutilized they seemed like a big deal in the trailers and then in the movie they just are kind of zombies that show up and follow the main characters around until they are easily killed about seven minutes later. Another problem is its lack of tonal consistency. There is a scene in the movie that is very The Breakfast Club-esque which comes out of nowhere right after a quite serious scene. The whole movie, in fact, feels more like The Breakfast Club then the horror movie premise it was sold on, that is, until the end where it just becomes a generic superhero movie, albeit with a cool fight with Magik and the Demon Bear. Another setback the movie had was the brightness. I went into this thinking it was going to be tonally dark, but that is NOT the kind of dark I got. You can barely see people and objects in a lot of scenes in this movie, especially the opening scene that there are many flashbacks to. the Demon Bear especially is hard to make out in the outside portions. Now the brightness is not a massive deal it's just a tiny bit distracting, and it is not as bad as, say Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 3. The aspect I wish they had done more for out of everything, would be the backstory of Magik. Now I previously said that the backstories of all the characters were very good because they aren't overexplained, HOWEVER, Illyana's is so confusing and convoluted that I just needed more to even understand what was happening in her flashbacks. Like what are those things? Where did they come from? Why do they have her? What are they doing to her? How did they get her? Why do they want her? You don't even understand her powers completely because it's not explained enough. I appreciate that this movie doesn't overexplain things for the most part, such as the Demon Bear, but specifically for Magik it just needs answering. Another problem this film has is that people who watch this movie, who know nothing about the characters and Marvel itself, will have NO IDEA what is happening. But on the flip side of that, anyone who knows anything about the characters and what their powers are will already know a good chunk of the reveals and surprises. There is a whole mini sub-plot that is resolved about halfway through the movie about the mystery of what Marcus' powers are, but everyone who knows anything about the comics, (or even watched Days of Future Past) already knows he is Sunspot. The same goes for Dani, or Mirage. It's no mystery to Marvel fans that she is the one making all the fears come to life so it just takes away from the movie. It makes you wonder who this movie is for, the Marvel fans, or the people who just thought it looked cool or just watch the movies. A small issue I have is that the three most interesting characters to me were Cannonball, Magik, and Sunspot, and instead of focusing on them, a lot more of the movie than is necessary is focused on Dani and Rahne. Rahne was my least favorite character out of the five main mutants, she was just so boring and I got her backstory within about two minutes and I didn't really care about her and Dani's relationship as much as I probably should have. Another issue that is connected to that is that it seems like every time someone was about to get in a fight in this movie, it cuts away to Rahne or like Marcus on the ground doing something else, which is incredibly frustrating when it looks like something interesting is about to happen. But possibly the most bizzare choice of this entire strange creation is the accents. EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. HAS. AN. ACCENT. The accents are also wildly inconsistent, such as Charlie Heaton's Southern accent which is just not good. It is incredibly strong at one time and then at others, it's almost completely gone. Maisie Williams' strange Scottish(?) accent is awful and is at points incoherent. Anya Taylor-Joy's accent is the one I bought the most but it still sounded a little strange at times and took a while to get used to. Another minor problem that was not really the fault of the writers or actors was the CGI. Some of the stuff looks pretty good, such as the Demon Bear, especially for a movie with an $80 million budget, but some stuff looks not great, like Sunspot. My penultimate negative point is that this movie already came out in January. It was called Glass and it is incredibly similar to this movie not just in plot but in actors. The plotlines of people finding out their powers and being trapped in a hospital/prison that claims to help them has already been done in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. as well. Now, this is no fault of the movie but The New Mutants coming out after Glass has already done the superhumans in a facility being tested and then they realize they have to join forces and escape thing just makes it feel less special, which is why I said this movie would have been much better in 2018. I do believe, however, that this movie is a better version of Glass and a better all-around movie. The acting isn't phenomenal even though some actors are doing very well with their roles. One more quick thing I have to talk about is Alice Braga's character. I think Sarah Paulson's character in Glass was just played and written much more effectively, although they are not one to one comparisons as characters. Long story endless, the film itself is built as a horror movie, with not a lot of action and it's more mystery focused, but the problem is it's not scary enough or even mysterious enough that it fits the horror movie template that was set up. There is not a real mystery in this movie that I wasn't able to predict, except Magik's backstory, which wasn't even answered by the movie itself, and it was mostly a lot of build-up for a movie that couldn't possibly live up to the hype. I give it a 5 out of 10 rating."}, {"id": 734, "text": "I have been waiting for this to come out since I heard about it in 2015.

Now that it has been released though, I can say I'm satisfied. I don't think it's the garbage that all these other reviews have said about the film. Could it have been better? Sure. With it originally being promoted as a horror movie I wish it was a bit scarier. It's still a dark and gritty, yet fun teen movie though.

Why? Because this movie was so forgettable (almost like dark phoenix) I feel bad for watching it before they closed all cinemas (I wish I saw another movie altogether.. Something fun.) The plot is kinda dumb and there are plot holes everywhere. I don't get why they had to cut out basically half the movie, there just wasn't any time getting to know the characters or properly submerging into the story. It should have gotten a higher rating and shown us the good stuff (like Deadpool). The characters are stereotypical and boring, and the star of the movie? Blu Hunt? Jesus, she couldn't act to save her life! I've heard she's kind of a big deal in the US, but honestly, I just saw another Bella Swan. She couldn't display one believable emotion through the whole movie. It could have been bad writing, I wouldn't know, but she annoyed me so much I had to roll my eyes every time she was on screen. The relationship in the movie (between Dani and Rahne, you know, wolf-girl) was Twilight-like: rushed, unexplained and completely unnecessary. I mean, they spent together one day and fell in love like that. No. Just... No. They didn't even KNOW each other at all. The big.. Bear.. Thingy.. Was the cherry on top, especially when Dani just walked up to the thing and petted it into submission. Seriously. On the top side: Anya Taylor-Joy was the only enjoyable thing in the whole movie. I liked her character and she's a fine actress. I would watch a movie based on her story alone (without I-don't-have-emotions-but-you-have-to-like-me Dani)."}, {"id": 757, "text": "I was hesitant to watch this movie because of the poor reviews. I went into it with little to no expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the experience I had. I found myself really connecting to the characters, gripped by the story, chuckling at the X-Men references, and completely enthralled by the wlw love story subplot. All in all, I'd say it was worth the wait. I'm going to assume the reason this is rated lower than Dark Phoenix is because it has significantly fewer reviews. But that might just be wishful thinking. Either way, it's nice to sit in the small circle of people who find enjoyment in something it appears many do not and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Some movies without great special effects can still be more entertaining to watch than movies that have those things, but does hollywood really know what we want to see, and what keeps us in our seats?

The New Mutants was supposed to come out over two years ago, ended up being delayed four times, went through extensive reshoots, and then was finally released in the middle of a pandemic. Unfortunately, some of those production issues are both very present, and very noticeable in this film. The basic plot of this film is that it takes place in the X-Men universe, and is about all of these teenagers who have just discovered that they have powers, and they are put in a facility where they are meant to learn to control their newfound abilities. However, something more sinister is afoot at the facility, and it is up to them to figure it out before it is too late. The one thing that I will say that this film does is that it introduces a fantastic concept. The whole idea for this film is so interesting, and isn't something that we have ever really seen before in the superhero genre. Unfortunately, that is where the production issues come in, because after this interesting idea is introduced, the film turns into a very generic run of the mill action/horror movie, that chooses to make most of its cast unlikeable, and ultimately chooses to have nothing happen until the last half hour of the film. The actors themselves do a good enough job, but their characters are all given these attitudes that make them so unlikeable up until they team up towards the end of the film. The CGI in this movie is also very spotty at times, and the viewer can totally tell which scenes had to go through reshoots, and given how expensive those reshoots were, the final product should have been much better. Also, as I mentioned earlier, there is not much that happens throughout a good portion of the film, the first forty five minutes to an hour are spent having most of the cast arguing and just doing random activities throughout the facility. One other thing that is worth pointing out is the director of this film, Josh Boone. He has only directed two other films, and they were both teen romances, Stuck In Love, and The Fault In Our Stars. The audience can actually see elements of those in this film because a big part of the plot is a love story between two of the characters who meet in the facility. That aspect of the film was particularly well done, however I don't know if it really needed to be included in a superhero horror/action film. From superhero movie standards, this is not a good movie. It was heavily advertised as a horror movie, despite there being almost no scares, and the action doesn't really come until the end of the film, so the audience is ultimately left watching nothing happen for about seventy five percent of the film. While the acting is good, the characters are made extremely unlikeable, and the special effects are really awful at times. The last half hour of the film does make up for some of the many issues that this film has in the first hour, but it is definitely far from a perfect film. Despite the many flaws this movie has, it still has many enjoyable moments, and I would be really interested to see the route they would take if they ever did make a sequel to it."}, {"id": 803, "text": "The movie is flawed but not as bad as some of these alts claim, i wouldn't call this the worst movie everthe person behind this review bombing is Celebi VEVO and his girlfriend Exaktly productions, you're welcome."}, {"id": 804, "text": "The film centers on mutant Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) who doesn't know her powers yet.

New mutants for me was frustratingly average, it had it's enjoyable moments and heaps of potential but never really lived up to it's interesting premise. Let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the movie did have an interesting concept, fascinating cinematography, good use of powers and character background. The whole concept of fresh coming of age teenagers causing them to have mutants powers and the whole facility idea was interesting to me and felt like a fresh spin on an x men movie, which I appreciated and largely delivered something different in terms of what you would expect from an x men movie. I also thought the films cinematography was very good, there was some beautiful and interesting shots and use of colour in this film that stood out from other superhero movies and made the film feel different which was great. I also thought the movies use of powers for the characters was great. Every single character had completely different and interesting characters that was explored well and each character got to show them off a fair amount, so the movie definitely delivered in this aspect. The movie also had good character background for all the characters, the movie did a good job at spending an equal amount of time with the background of each character, this was good because it developed the plot well, made you understand and connect with the characters a lot more and was definitely one of the better aspects of the movie.My first few negatives would be the rushed beginning, how generic it was, and the bad script. I thought that the movie at the beginning did not have enough background or explanation into the plot before just going straight into the facility, this felt sloppy and poorly edited to me and limited the plot. The movie was also fairly generic, all of the characters powers and backgrounds have been seen before in previous superhero movies and the movie didn't try to be anything different which was such a shame. The script was also very poor, the dialogue between all the characters was very corny and generic. And it just felt like multiple different drafts moulded into one making the movie feel very messy.My next few positives would be the likeable characters, chemistry between them and the performances. I thought all the characters here were incredibly likeable in their own ways, they all had their own distinct and unique personalities that shone throughout the movie, and they were all very fun to watch whenever they were on screen. I also thought the chemistry between the characters was great, I loved a lot of the relationships and friendships in the movie and they gave them enough screen time during the movie for them to feel well earnt and enjoyable. The performances here were also pretty good, everybody did a good job here, but my key standouts would be Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor Joy. Both had such a likeable charm and were a joy to watch, they popped the most and were the most fun to watch on screen, Especially Anya who fitted this type of sassy character very well.My final two positives would be the horror elements and the final act. When the movie actually did go into the horror genre ( more on that later) it was pretty good. I thought some of the creature designs and horror imagery were actually pretty scary and well done, making the film more edgy and made me on edge when they were actually on screen, I wish the horror elements were used more but for the most part when they were shown it was done well. The final act was also one of the best parts of the movie, they finally merged the action and horror elements of the movie pretty well for a fun and entertaining final act that redeems the movie slightly.My final negatives that really bought the movie down for me would be how predictable it was, the dull plot and the tonal imbalances of the movie. New mutants was painfully predictable which was such a shame. The characters and their actions were predictable. And the supposed big plot twist with the main character I figured out way before it was revealed, and it was so obvious when the characters acted shocked when it came to light I felt like shouting at the movie. I also felt like a large portion of the plot was fairly dull, it was just a mixture of the limited setting, repetitive plot points and the fact there just wasn't really a lot going on in the movie, but I Often sadly found myself getting bored or losing interest. My final negative with the movie and my biggest issue with New mutants has to be it's tonal imbalances. It didn't have enough horror elements to be considered a horror, and not enough action to be considered an action movie. So New mutants found itself stuck in the middle and playing it safe, not actually having enough of anything to please either of these two genre fans.Overall, despite a promising idea, great characters and being aesthetically pleasing. New mutants is very sadly a generic, corny and messy movie, that doesn't commit to either one of it's intended genres making itself stuck in a rut that it cant get out of."}, {"id": 806, "text": "This movie was so boring.

Along with four other patients/inmates she slowly comes to realise that this is more of a prison than an hospital and the initially suspicious and antagonistic group start to bond. Maybe what makes this stand out is the fact that a Marvel adventure openly, and rather understatedly, depicts a same sex attraction between the heroine and Maisie Williams Rahne (pronounced rain) but otherwise it's a pretty lacklustre, character free 90 minutes with great special effects but little, if any, menace after an extraordinarily long build up.

As the months turned into years and the release date kept being pushed back, I all but gave up of it ever coming out.Shocked to find out a few days ago that it had actually been released,I rushed to the cinema to discover what had been sitting on the shelf.View on the film:One of the last Fox productions and the final film to list Stan Lee as a executive producer (!), co-writer/(with Knate Lee) director Josh Boone &amp; David Lynch's regular cinematographer Peter Deming claw open the original Horror intentions of this first in what was a planned (now canned) trilogy, via a long upwards tracking crane shot bringing Dani's nightmare towards her, breaking in a match-cut awakening in a hospital.Whilst the CGI has clearly been left far from finished since Fox was sold to Disney, the decision to film in the real former psychiatric hospital Medfield State Hospital still allows for some Horror sparks to fly, in long, clinical corridor shots where the bright powers of the mutants are dimmed by the grey hospital they are locked in.Misspelling New Mutants co-creator Bob McLeod's name in the credits, the screenplay by Lee &amp; Boone is the subject left with the most wounds from the studio changes, from sub-plots going into the origins of each mutant appearing to have lost the establishing sequences,to a hilariously awkward final narration,where a ending setting up the second film should/had been in place.Similar to the visual aspect, the writers thankfully included eerie elements which have survived, a highlight being the passive aggression of Dr. Reyes and Sinclair facing the sins of her greatest fear.

The Dark Phoenix was such an iconic story line which has been completely destroyed twice now on the big screen. So it was with some trepidation I approached this movie, which seems to have spent an eternity in production, and has clearly been edited and re-shot several times. Most of the acting is pretty reasonable, with the exception of Illyana, who's accent grated and the character was 1 dimensional but this is probably more down to the writing than the actress. I know this was a the first movie and they needed to set characters etc, but it did seem to take a long time to get going. Most of the characters were pretty close to the originals, apart from Sam Guthrie, who in the comics was a lean, blond jock.

The film is the utter definition of cliche and shows every weakness of both genres, taking the I can't control my powers story and mixing it with it takes the form of your greatest fear story. The movie isn't scary because the scares it uses are ones I have already seen. The monsters and horror scenes are extremely inspired. Everything happens way too fast and nothing is fully developed or expanded upon. The villain is bland and unintimidating I was thinking of better uses of the scary scene setups throughout the movie. The actors try to be good, and mostly are, but the characters have boring superpowers you have seen a million times, and ones that have new powers have really weird and unexplained ones, excepting the main character.

As a dark and edgy movie, this is a little too Marvel. I'm a Marvel fan and a horror fan, and I felt a bit caught betwixt the faltering attempts at broody supernatural horror and the angsty teen drama of a blackballed Spider-Man coming of age script.Marvel wants to make horror? I'm in. Marvel wants to make a (another) dark X-men story? I'm in. With this cast? Yes, please.So why does this movie not impress me?It didn't go far enough in any direction to merit greatness.Warning: Spoilers ahead.A girl in an ominous (superhuman?) experience wakes up in a psych-ward with high tech locks and gadgetry inexplicably welded into a broken down hospital set where a mysterious organization is funding treatment for young mutants. The kids are led to believe professor X is the anonymous puppet master, but the plot keeps signaling that no, that's not the case. Maybe signaling a little too loudly. The sole care provider, Dr. Reyes, seems well-meaning, but completely cardboard as a character for the majority of the movie, functioning as a boarding school mom slash psychiatrist who apparently knows next to nothing about communicating with teens, but has somehow earned the position of headmaster in her private ward.Why is she the ONLY caretaker her for five students with high level powers? Why are they in a dilapidated crazy farm? How can she (as we learn later) generate a forcefield around this whole facility 24-7, even while sleeping, or knocked unconscious? Why in God's name would the organization depend entirely on her power as the primary security measure and just assume she would never get incapacitated by these dangerous youngings she meticulously spies on?Throughout the movie, the kids are constantly able to evade her, lie to her and even drug her to have a party. Where is the parent organization?All of these sins could be forgiven if the movie would just be something special, and here's where my opinion as a long time horror fan will tilt in a direction the average marvel fan might not agree with, because, if you watch much horror at all, this movie is derivative. It uses horror tropes, but clumsily, taking me to the edge of being uncomfortable or frightened, but never really shoving me over. It feels like a horror done by an action/adventure writer and director. It was like someone said let's make this dark, then they remembered this is a Marvel movie, and toned it way down.I would rather have had either ( Thing 1) a truly horrific story, a la AHS or the descent, or (Thing 2) a fun movie for x-men teens, like Homecoming.Because it was not thing 1, there was nothing at stake. No one important was going to die. It was a typical superhero movie where we know the main characters will make it to the credits, despite the close calls. Nothing was truly at stake here, which sucks some of the horror potential from the plot.Because it was not thing 2, it's not that great of a story. Almost no humor, very little fun (other than that one fling night) and an oppressively cynical tone that gives way to a happy ending where there is very little happiness, but characters who hated each other quite recently are suddenly ready to road trip.As the credits rolled, I was left feeling cheated. Everyone lived. Everyone is friends. But the movie didn't earn that ending. It was trying to be dark, depressing and scary, all the while reassuring us that things will turn out ok.That gnawing in my gut at the end was asking: Why do they think Danni saved them? She severely wounded all of them and almost killed them. Why was Illy torn up over Lockheed (or Lucky?) during the battle? Did he die? Did she overreact and he's fine now? Did we actually lose ANY characters we cared about? Why were these good actors so subdued? Why were these fake accents necessary?The New Mutants wasn't a great horror movie, it wasn't a great Marvel movie, it was just a movie that wasn't a throwback movie, and post-pandemic, that was its saving grace."}, {"id": 824, "text": "Striped of all the big large scale set pieces of modern superhero films this film feels restrained.

So when I'm talking about the logic and plot holes, it's from stuff that is unexplained in the movie since this movie gave me little care to find the whole story of The New Mutants. I'm not against the Lesbian stuff shown at all but it does feel rushed and would have been better kept in the sequel. Oh well, it's just another movie that introduces new characters to replace the old ones since these new characters fit the agenda by Hollywood (Like the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy and Terminator Dark Fate as examples) today except there are no MaREY sues or Gary Stues thankfully.Update: As of december 2020, i've seen all x-men films.

It doesn't put you in the mood, despite the horror vibe of the piece. I never felt anxious, or worried for any of the characters.Even if the tone is a bit of a miss for me, it is a smartly constructed story. I felt I got the characters. I understood their fears, their traumas, and why they were the way we found them on an intellectual level but I hardly felt for them. I can't say that the actors didn't pull their weight, even though they are no oscar worthy performances, but giving that the atmosphere wasn't really there nothing elevated the work they put in.The action scenes and visual effects were great for what they were going for, but in comparison to the sets looked like an expensive new car in a junk yard. The facility they were in is so rundown and cheap looking that I couldn't believe that it had voice activated locks. It would have been easier to believe that the doors opened and closed because of a Mutant's power.The New Mutants felt like a great idea that wasn't totally followed through. There is a gun-shy feeling to it. They didn't go all the way or didn't strike the right tone. The first half of Josh Trank's Fant4stic Four felt more ominous than this entire movie. Unless they going for an intellectual horror superhero movie - if that's a thing - it worked! Because I understood what I was suppose to feel but never experienced any of the emotions."}, {"id": 832, "text": "Fimed way back in the bygone time of 2017, The New Mutants - the newest entry into the now-scrapped X-Men Cinematic Universe - has had its fair share of trouble getting to theaters. Originally set for release in April 2018, the movie has had a record of seven date changes, making it a running joke that it would never see the light of day. Defying the naysayers, The New Mutants has finally hit theaters right in the middle of a pandemic.Set in a remote research facility, The New Mutants follows five teenagers as they discover their newfound powers. The stern Dr. Reyes looks after the young mutants and tries to help them control their raw powers. We follow the newest member of the group, Danielle Moonstar, who was placed there after a mysterious natural disaster wiped out her entire reservation. After some time, the five realize that there's more behind this facility than meets the eye. To save themselves and right the wrongs of the past, the group must work together to harness their powers and become something bigger than themselves.The New Mutants is directed by Josh Boone, who last made a critical and commercial splash with his adaptation of The Fault in Our Stars.Billed as an action/horror/drama, The New Mutants fails on all three of those genre levels. Thanks to Boone's inability to grasp onto his material, the various tones of the movie go together like oil &amp; water rather than peanut butter &amp; jelly.The action is sparse throughout the first 80 minutes, only showing us glimpses of each person's unique power. The final 15 minutes end on an action set piece that unleashes all that the movie has been building up, which isn't much. The intentionally dark and snowy setting acts as a smokescreen to cover up the poor digital effects and blocking.Fairing even worse than the action is the horror element. It's been reported that the studio demanded reshoots to add more horror after the mega-success of IT. Neutered by a PG-13 rating, the scares in this movie are comparable to the ones found in a January dumpster movie aimed solely at young teenagers. For nearly the entire runtime, we're subjected to a rinse repeat cycle of jump scares and sound blasts that only mildly startle us, but never come close to scaring. Even the main villains - gangly creatures dressed in tuxedos that look almost too similar to Slenderman - come across more laughable than creepy.But even the failings in the action and horror department don't come close to the movie's biggest crime, which is how boring it is. For being set in a superhero universe, very little of this movie is connected to the larger world. Except for a few name drops and the fact that our main characters are called mutants, this could have been set in any other YA universe and it wouldn't have made a difference.The uninteresting plot offers few biting questions to chew on. If you have even an inkling of knowledge about the X-Men Universe, then these questions will be a breeze to answer. But, immediately knowing these answers is a double-edged sword as you now have to impatiently wait an hour for the movie to reveal them in the dullest way possible.Maybe the only person who can come out of this mess with some credibility is Blu Hunt and her performance as our lead character, Danielle. Hunt does fall into the teenage actor trap of overdoing it, but overall she does a commendable job of being the audience's viewpoint into this story.Three of our five main characters have accents and each of them vies for the award of least convincing. The winner of that goes to American-born Anya Taylor-Joy in her attempt at portraying a Russian. Charlie Heaton's Kentucky drawl comes in at a close second place, while the British Maisie Williams of Game of Thrones fame does alright with her Scottish accent.As an action movie, The New Mutants is a failure. As a horror movie, it's a failure. Even as a piece of entertainment, it's a failure. This is nothing more than a cheap cash grab whose only purpose is to make a quick buck off brand recognition alone.The only time I'll ever think about this movie again is when I have to decide where to place it on my worst-of-the-year list."}, {"id": 833, "text": "If someone would have told me that this film is a low budget student film, I would have been really happy. The acting is mediocre, especially from the main character, but not bad. The story is generic, but many have used it to hone their film making skills: do it justice and at least it's entertaining. The special effects are cheap, but hey, it's students, right? They have time to get it right when someone gives them a budget.But this film is not a student film, but instead a 70 million dollars production from Disney-Fox. The connection with the extended X-Men lore is tenuous at best, the horror element is very generic, copied from so many other C movies that it has become comical and the thing that they never seem to get right is characterization. Watch Maisie Williams in the first seasons of GoT, Anya Taylor-Joy in Queen's Gambit, Charlie Heaton in Stranger Things, even Alice Braga in one of the Spanish films and you will see quality of acting, relatable characters. None in this film. Movies like The New Mutants is where actors go to die.So it's a waste of time. Mutant X was better than this."}, {"id": 834, "text": "New Mutants is the film God forbade. Its theatrical release postponed again and again since 2017, the latest instance having to do with the Coronavirus outbreak, New Mutants is almost as cursed as Gilliam's The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, albeit with the worst stuff seemingly taking place after its completion - or initial completion.Yet again, I can't very well tell you where in the X-Men semi-canon this film fits. I'm going to assume it takes place after Logan and thus in the Altered Timeline, even if this weakens the perfect closure that Logan was. I don't think it takes place in the past, i.e. in the X-Men Apocalypse era, but it does follow up on that film's post-credit stinger, which teased the experiments of the grim mutant Mister Sinister. Much like Logan, however, The New Mutants ultimately neglects the final major X-Men villain to not have been in the movies (apparently reshoots are to blame for this, and the delayed release, which is never a good sign).I know these things don't matter, especially not with The New Mutants, the first film in the X-Men franchise to fall under horror. Ergo, much like the tongue-in-cheek Deadpool, it doesn't necessarily need to fit; 'tis of a different genre altogether. But again, reshoots and various extra delays were unkind to this one and I'd have just shelved it if I were Josh Boone.The movie stars Blu Hunt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton, and Harry Zaga as a group of angsty tween mutants who believe they've been assembled to join the X-Men, but soon learn something sinister (tee-hee) about their caretaker (Alica Braga). These superpowered kids are fairly diverse, but indecisive on which accents to use. We also get some goofy-looking additional creatures and a cameo from Marylin Manson, just so you know this is edgier than usual.One must wonder, were there still devotees who sincerely looked forward to this mess? I know DC fanboys will stop at nothing to convince themselves even the most fundamentally inept piece of cinema is superior to Avengers: Endgame, and I do recall people who insisted that Dark Phoenix, despite how obvious its sloppiness was even at a glance, was the adults' option to the Avengers finale last spring (maybe throw in an ebarassingly blatant Christian symbol and I'll be convinced of its depth).As for New Mutants, however, things seemed pretty clear from the get-go. This was pretty dang bad, and although we shouldn't treat the Rotten Tomatoes number like the final word, audiences as well as critics seemed to loathe this movie.It doesn't really work as an angsty romance, misses the mark as a horror movie and never for a minute feels like a superhero flick, said one Rotten Tomatoes blurb. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where Josh Boone goes wrong, because there are just so many options to choose from, reads another.This isn't much but it's what you'll have to go on right now. As it turns out, several publications have apparently refused to review this film, due to Disney's inability to realize the benefits of streaming over theatre-going, especially during a global pandemic that makes critics' screenings (or any sort of screening) a really bad idea. I suppose we shouldn't worry too much about what critics and audiences have to say about this particular movie. Let the fact that fate itself hates this film be enough."}, {"id": 835, "text": "This movie was supposed to come out in 2017, so was it worth the wait? No, not really.

However, when it comes down to it, the movie was just boring and clich\u00e9. Most of the characters were forgettable besides their horribly inconsistent accents, which becomes almost hard not to laugh at.

As such, I went in with low expectations. And although there is nothing remotely novel about the movie, I didn't think it was too bad at all.The plot: So, my review title suggests that the plot is very closely aligned to M Night Shymalan's Glass - his Split sequel from last year. A Victorian-style hospital-cum-prison similarly forms the claustrophobic setting for the majority of the movie. This is where the troubled teen Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) is taken after being suddenly orphaned in dramatic and mysterious circumstances. The only doctor present, Dr Reyes (Alice Braga), says she is being held there for her own - and society's safety - while her puberty-driven mutant tendencies emerge.Locked away with her is Rahne (Maisie Williams), Charlie (Sam Guthrie), 'hot' Brazilian hunk Roberto (Henry Zaga) and the gloriously named Illyana Rasputin (Anya-Taylor Joy). Danni's arrival sparks a serious of escalating events that literally lead to all hell breaking loose.Blu is the warmest colour: What made this Marvel movie stand-out for me, from the normal glass-shattering standard, is that it is predominantly a character-led piece. We spend quite a bit of time (for a Marvel movie) in building relationships between the teens, including a sweet lesbian-coming-out 'will they/won't they' tension between Rahne and Danni.I was also very much attracted to the performance of Blu Hunt. I admit that this might not just be due to her interesting performance (the indigenous / LBGT angle is intriguing) but because she reminded me strongly of a girl at school who I had a mad crush on and completely failed to get off with! Blu is actually native American (from the Lakota tribe). Given she is the lead and has to carry the movie, it's a surprise that she is only about 5th in the billing: I'd have been upset with the director (Josh A Fault in our Stars Boone) about that.Maisie Williams is also effective in this, and gets top billing, although arguably Anya-Taylor-Joy has emerged - with her wonderful Emma - as the bigger star since filming.But it's Taylor-Joy's Rasputin that really stands out as the most interesting of the characters on show. There's a scene where she goes into action - eyes blazing and 'daemon' hovering - that would make a splendid PC screensaver! Stuff the Black Widow standalone movie: I'd go watch Illyana Rasputin kicking ass in her own follow-up movie! (Of course, Anya Taylor-Joy was also prominent in Glass, which unfortunately cements the similarities between the films.)The movie has had a long and tortuous path to its final release, being made waaaaaayyyyy back in 2017. As an X-Men movie, it's appeared after the X-Men universe finally imploded (with the disappointing whimper of Dark Phoenix). So in that sense it's a bit of a ghost of a flick.Overall, it's a mixed bag. There's a sense of great familiarity with the contents - particularly with the strong echoes of Glass, actually filmed after this one (but with 'inversion', who knows anymore?). Even the Indian legend that runs through the movie swaps a bear for a wolf but ends with a familiar, rather groan-inducing, motto. (It was used in Tomorrowland I think?)But the young cast are attractive and entertained me for the (pleasantly short) running time. It's not going to win any prizes for originality, or indeed anything else. But it really wasn't the X-Men bust I expected it to be.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

The rest of the cast, with a couple of exception, is also excellent in their roles.I also love the pacing. There is no Wham! Slam! Kaboom! every 5 seconds as is the norm with most superhero movies.

And testing going with an evil doctor is so cliche that its basically a bore. Especially since the doctor lady is also the weakest actor of the movie. The movie is also very short. Feels like they should have made the story last a lot longer. And my final small complaint is that the CGi is not always on point. Sure the computer graphics are a million times better than anything the DC gang spits out, but for Marvel and superhero movies not so great.Overall though this is a good movie and I enjoyed it a lot. I give it a 7/10, a strong 7. Magic is the star and a great character, but I hope we see a lot more of these folk in the future. Definitely a lot that can done with this team.

But I have to say new mutants was a pleasant surprise of a movie, no it isn't perfect or like the best movie I have seen out of this year but this movie I did enjoy for what it was. There is a lot to like about the new mutants aka the cast, the cast here was pretty good and each member gave a pretty good performances but the 2 standouts had to Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor Joy who steal the show each time they were on screen and both gave the best performances of the whole movie. The story is also very interesting and the concept was done pretty decent. The characters are also for the most part good but the 2 stands were Rahne(maisie Williams) and Illayna (Anya Taylor Joy) who easily kept this movie going each time their characters were on screen. The action and fight scenes were also fantastic and well shot this is a super hero movie so expect some well shot fights. Also the romance in this movie even though it was very clutches I thought it did the job for what the movie was aiming for. The second and third acts also saved this movie from being a flop and being an disaster. Where the movie starts to fail is with the pacing, the pacing in the first act is extremely messing and the first 30 minutes of this movie felt extremely rushed. Also there is barley any character development for some of the characters in this movie which sucks because we got these great characters but we don't get to really know about their backstories or their pasts we just get little hints about it. But where the movie does fail was it was always marketed as a horror movie yes there is horror elements and those elements were done very well but they never committed to this being a full blown horror movie and maybe because it was PG-13 and I think that rating did make it suffer if it was R I'm sure it would of been a lot better. Overall, the new mutants is a pretty fun movie that I enjoy quite a bit, yes it's not perfect and after all the delays it had I don't think it did any help to this movie but if you have the chance to see this movie I would say give it a watch because I enjoyed it quite a bit."}, {"id": 841, "text": "I just got back from this movie and suffice to say it was bad.

It is a pity that The New Mutants have had to dance with the ugliest, and not only share a release date with Christopher Nolan's Tenet, but because almost no fan is unaware of the long and tortuous path of this superhero film with the soul of a horror movie. Unsuccessful trial runs, reshoots and, to top it off, a pandemic. In the end, what counts is that here we have it, with its attractive cast and daring proposal. But this eagerness to satisfy both audiences at any price has left her halfway to nowhere.Dani Moonstar is taken from the Cheyenne reserve where she lived with her father after the devastating attack of a gigantic supernatural beast. When she wakes up, she finds herself confined in a containment center for teenage mutants who still do not control their powers and, according to her only supervisor, Dr. Reyes, are a potential danger to society. Although Dani is not yet aware of her abilities, there she will meet and collide with four young mutants, discovering a world full of possibilities, but also of terror, because after their arrival, the fears of those who reside there begin to come alive.The film is vaguely inspired by the celebrated Mystic Bear Saga (The Demon Bear), published in the 80's from issue 18 of the original collection of The New Mutants, the first spin-off from X-Men (The X-Patrol in Spain) before becoming that best-selling phenomenon that ended up multiplying its satellite collections like Gremlins. Bill Sienkiewicz's innovative illustrations and the effective scripts of the mutant patriarch, Chris Claremont, who raised to the altars the original formula conceived by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby two decades earlier, is honored in its adaptation by Josh Boone and Knate Lee, authors of the script, which pays tribute to the healthy diversity of the original comics, and which is one of the film's successes, although with little space, given its meager 90 minutes of footage, excluding final credits, some of which, by the way, reproduce some of Sienkiewicz's unforgettable art.It is clear that its director, Josh Boone, was signed up for the project thanks to the teenage angst he portrayed in Under the Same Star. One that here is made more credible by the two actresses with the most mileage: Maisie Williams, in the skin of Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane), and Anya Taylor-Joy, none other than Illyana Rasputin (Magik). Not in vain they are the two most developed characters and best transferred from the cartoon to the frame. However, once again the usual chronological chaos of Fox's mutant universe is imposed (a reason for mockery even for Deadpool in one of the most applauded jokes of his first installment), and Illyana's roots are overlooked, as happy as that would have made so many fans, as well as her pointed plot connection with Logan, who insists again on the figure and influence of a villain that neither Logan nor The New Mutants end up presenting.That tortuous path to the halls seems to have left The New Mutants reduced to its minimum expression. An almost naked frame, an involuntary Glass teen transcript that at least manages to hold a cast that will be very attractive to its audience, with an Anya Taylor-Joy who will stir up passions with her Magik, which is all that is dangerous and sexy that the character and his fans demand. And that is already much more than what Sophie Turner achieved last summer in X-Men: Dark Phoenix"}, {"id": 843, "text": "WHAAACKK!There's a reason Stan Lee didn't make a cameo and it's not because he's passed!Majik- the only saving grace of the movie; hopefully we'll see more of this character in future films Sunspot- bootleg Johnny Storm Wolfsbayne- a poor man's Wolverine Cannonball- who's only power is to fly; yet he takes flight like a drunken kamikaze who inspires to be on Jackass Moonstar- who's power is later revealed in the movie so I won't spoil that.

Hopefully this can be the start of something but I can't say this is a franchise I'd care to invest much else in. This might've been better as a TV show or even a stageplay.If filming/production occurred in the midst of the Rona Outbreak I might be a lil more leniant of the final product but this was a film that added lil to no value to the franchise; it's on par w/ the last F4 movieWAKANDA FOREVER RIP Chadwick Boseman"}, {"id": 844, "text": "I was really let down by this immature and naive film which has a one-dimensional plot.

I did not find anything entertaining or imaginative or attractive about the character's demonstrated mutant powers to identify with that I was looking forward to. I kept waiting for the plot to develop into the next phase of the story, but it was not there...you could have summarized the plot with three sentences.From an objective viewpoint of not reading the comics and not knowing the story line, the poor editing of the film made it difficult to grasp what was happening for the last 3rd of the film.Being an optimistic person and looking for progressive and positive change in the World, I was disgusted by the amount of nastiness and hate Magik hurled onto Mirage for no apparent reason other than to define her character. Do we really need to see this amount of hatred modeled for young people to see in this day and age?Furthermore, do we really need to see the possibility of suicide as an option demonstrated to solve one's problem presented to impressionable young people?My point is, as a filmmaker it is important to take some responsibility for what you present to your audiences as an positive influence to the audience...not just hold true to a required plot line.Not one person in the 30 person audience I was in laughed once the entire movie. Such a depressing dark movie that accomplished its mission to bring a comic book to the sliver screen. No reward for the viewer except to be informed by actors acting with a modicum of depth.As a parent, I see no value for teenagers to see this movie.

Neither did I!Frankly speaking, A horror treatment for a superhero/comicbook film, the conception itself has gone over my head. While I revere innovative ideas in this field, this time it seemed rather puerile. First two acts are inattentive, uneventful. Although by the commencement of the final act; things have improved quite a bit. Only if they maintained a similar momentum all over, the aftermath would have been drastically differential.Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton; some seasoned performers on paper yet their acts lacked the usual potency we all bargain on.

The horror aspect was minimal and the plot- which wasn't very fluent- abandoned itself at times and came back later. There was no suspense and came across more as a series of teenage drama clich\u00e9s. Even the mutant powers were only used on occasion. It also has an issue staying within X-Men film canon. My movie goer partner and I were debating where the film fit in with the other ones. Eventually we came to the conclusion that it was after Logan (2017) but an alternate timeline created by the ending of Deadpool 2 (2018). That being said, either one of those films would be a much better use of one's time. The New Mutants was a disappointing hot mess that was boring and slow, but also felt very cut and pasted. Maybe if the film had remained an R-rated film, as it was originally intended/filmed as, the film would be a better experience. What is left over from editing and sold as the final product is a disappointing hotness and should be skipped. At least Cats (2019) had a memorable soundtrack and Taylor Swift.

Its kind of more of the same, mutants being persecuted for being mutants. Yawn. Oh, but they're teens instead of adults, so thats a thing... I guess?Writing was kinda poor. The CGI was fine, but nowadays its more when the CGI IS NOT fine (batman v superman) is when its noteworthy.

Movies, such as Tarantino flicks, which use racial slurs are doing so for actual reasons.

Josh Boone. Taking as a common thread the Cherokee legend of the two internal wolves (in this case, bears) that represent the conflict of antagonistic internal forces in each individual, 'The New Mutants', takes us into the fierce inner battles that five cloistered youths wage in a kind of psychiatric hospital trying to make their dark side visible and face it to find a balance between who they are and the individual powers that segregate them and make them different from others. I understand that negative comments are emerging around the new Marvel proposal: The New Mutants is completely different from the tone that has characterized that universe and that of the X-Men in particular. From the fusion of action and thriller that predominated in the two previous stages of the mutants, we have a new beginning that bets on psychological terror. A walk through the dark corners of the psyche. The five are in charge of a doctor who, in addition to the daily group sessions, monitors them day and night, in an obsessive exercise of auscultation, completely denying them any vestige of privacy. Located in the middle of nowhere and with an insurmountable energy field surrounding the facilities, they are totally isolated. They only have themselves. Marvel enthusiasts will be somewhat baffled by a new narrative treatment that bets on examining the deep fears of these new mutants, leaving behind the eye-catching of long action sequences and special effects, focusing on the psychological cages that keep them as social outcasts by not knowing how to handle with care their personality and the powers that they involuntarily possess. Personally, I like the 180 \u00b0 turn in the narrative nuances with a gloomy and claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the interaction of the mutants and leads you to sympathize with them because of the oppression they suffer. The characters, in general, are well chiseled leaving unknowns that, I suppose, will be cleared up in future installments. Now I understand why there were reshoots and several postponements of its premiere. Marvel being now owned by Disney, it is a film at times, too dark that bursts into narrative territories and tonal scales that Disney is not used to traveling."}, {"id": 849, "text": "The history behind The New Mutants making it to the big screen is far more interesting than the lifeless product we are left with at an end result of five delayed release dates that culminated in this unloved X-Men spinoff finally making it to the big screen in the midst of Covid-19 this year.Initially penciled in for a release date in late 2018, this Josh Boone directed outing which was supposedly aiming for a more horror orientated vibe than its more action orientated mutant counterparts and was subject to multiple reshoots and re-edits before it saw the light of day, is one of the biggest misfires yet in the up and down history of X-Men films and their spin-offs and while you can glimpse the film that just might've been with the right caressing and refinement, this version of Marvel's teenage anti-heroes isn't the version you'll want to endure.Wasting a talented cast that includes recognizable faces such as The Queen's Gambit/The Witch star Anya Taylor-Joy, Game of Thrones Maisie Williams and Stranger Things actor Charlie Heaton, Boone is unable to get much out of his performers who struggle to make his and Knate Lee's dull script come to life, while the stagnate setting of the facility these mutant teenagers find themselves in under the supervision of Alice Braga's Dr. Reyes (honestly why does she run such a facility by herself?) makes for a boorish set up as we and the films central characters get bored with what is laid out before them.There are glimmers of the horror aspects that may've at times been more prevalent in a film that more than likely was muddled with by studio executives before it finally saw itself unleashed on the public and these tiny elements of the film create some of the best moments in a mostly dreary and unenthusiastic affair, creepy Slender Man like figures and roaming priests such aspects but the rest of the films dramatic moments and character driven pieces all fall flat around a narrative that never lets its ensemble shine nor one that lets its audience find a reason to care about what is going on around them.Final Say -A blatantly pointless addition to the X-Men cinematic universe that may've become something worthwhile had it been allowed to follow up its horror angles, this sorry excuse for a film is a mostly dire effort despite some brief glimpses of what could have been.1 lonely facility employee out of 5"}, {"id": 850, "text": "The New Mutants is a new horror action movie in the X-Men movie series.

She is stuck here with a group of young mutants, who are being investigated what their powers are and how they can keep them under control. When the mutants discover why they are really stuck in the hospital, they must learn to work together and trust each other to escape the hospital.This movie was originally scheduled to hit theaters on April 13, 2018, but this has been delayed to work on improvements.

It lacks potential in spots, but for the most part, it is a rather exciting and interesting endeavour that I wouldn't' mind catching again sometime. The feel of the film, with its setting and plot ideals, gives me much of a similar feel held by the 80's horror flick- A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Warriors. However, the result doesn't seem as flimsy in its execution, nor as thin, and I found myself surprised at how appreciative I felt for this film when I left the theater. I expected it to be much worse than it was, but honestly speaking, it has much to offer for the franchise, and more Marvel has ever been willing to dare to go within the lengths of characters and situations that have unfolded- especially with Disney's prized Cinematic Universe. I won't spoil the lengths it goes to, but I enjoyed the things they did, represented, and callbacks to previous X-men flicks.

That general concept has been done so many times in different variations that it just seems stale at this point. With that said, I have to admit that it was also this film's strongest point. The premise itself was intriguing and I enjoyed the first act of this movie quite a bit, but the rest of the film was a complete mess to me.The New Mutants' greatest downfall is the fact that it's very uneventful, given the story at hand. The majority of this film is a series of scenes with characters either being overly confident in order to cover up their past or just downright miserable and depressed, making for many long and slow conversations. Not to say long conversations hurt a film by any means, but it felt like each character sort of learned the same lesson on different occasions, making the film feel long and repetitive, even at 90 minutes. It really isn't until the final 20 minutes when any real action starts, and even the climax felt tame to me. Things sort of simmer down on their own before the credits rolled and I just didn't feel invested by that point.On top of the very glaring issues this film suffers from, I feel that the biggest culprit lies in the characterizations of each and every one of them. From Anya Taylor-Joy to Charlie Heaton, The New Mutants is loaded with a talented young cast, but they aren't given anything stellar to do, which will leave audiences believing these young stars didn't try hard enough. There are some truly cringe-worthy lines of dialogue here and while they were clearly intentional, this screenplay was just a mess. Right down to their backstories, I never once felt connected to any of them. They were all fairly typical stories of loss and grief. Nothing set these characters apart from one another.Overall, The New Mutants has a nice little concept that it does absolutely nothing with. The cast is very talented, but they all come off as bad here, due to what they're working with. Director Josh Boon directed the very well-made romance adaptation The Fault in Our Stars, which was a very quiet film and I believe those quiet sensibilities transferred over to this film and made it feel slower than it should've felt. For a film revolving around teenagers having superpowers and being billed as a horror, it should've been far more entertaining. It's not the worst film I've seen that's based on a comic book, but it not a good one either. Sadly, this movie went through a lot of struggle, which built more hype around it as a whole, which I feel gave people some false hope. I can't get myself to recommend this one."}, {"id": 861, "text": "After all the bad reviews here i thought why not lets give it a go and you know what i really enjoyed it.It just seems people these days just want complain about anything they can and literally everything they complained about i thought was good.Production values where top notch, and special effects i loved.

I literally cant find anything to complain about and while it may not be the 10 i gave it, it was definitley a solid 7.5.Watch and make your own mind up"}, {"id": 862, "text": "I confess I'm not familiar with this branch of the comics, but that doesn't stop me.The movie was a very competently made, well structured, sufficiently acted mytery-drama, with certain horror elements and atmosphere. Like, as the basic direction of horror is to hide your monsters, this movie hides the abilities of the mutants, instead flashing them in your face like the X-men movies. And mentioned abilities are not that overpower as those of the X-men either. These young adults are people with certain talents, not Gods Amongst Men like the X-Men. And because they are more like a traditional superhero (eg. Captain America), they have the potential to be introduced to the MCU.The movie isn't much about flashing the characters in yo face, like some stupid Thor, or Ruffalo-Hulk. Nah, it's more clever than that toy-selling stuff. This instead makes you question who are these people? Why are they in an asylum? What is their backstory, or more like: trauma? And how they connect to their mutant abilities? This is not a clich\u00e9 horror-movie where you worry about which character will be eaten next. This is a good movie instead, which makes you question, is there a monster at all, and what is its nature? During that you should worry about the characters because a) they are humans b) they are practicaly still kids c) they are unfortunate, tortured souls. And you should feel for them in the end, as they become what they become against all the odds.I honestly loved this movie. Despite all the delays, and recuts (in the end I even think those made it a better movie, but who knows of course), and Disney. I say this film made things a little better in the world."}, {"id": 863, "text": "In short summary I feel like I saw everything I need to know in the trailer. I would give this a lower rating if it wasn't for the strong performance of these young actors. However, the script, setting, plot, and story are all just cut from a well-worn raggedy cloth.Based on the preview we already know that nightmares are coming to life. The first time we see their hospital campus we already know it is sinister - there is an angel of death out front just in case you didn't get the right feel from the dark hallways and cell-like dorm rooms and locks everywhere. Also she's handcuffed to the bed from the start. So what do we need to wait (a short) 90 minutes for? For a team of misfits to put their differences aside and the new girl can put on her big boy pants and overcome her (Spoilers)? The whole premise is like someone took a 4 year old's childrens book about dog training and tried to turn it into a horror story, throw in some same sex attraction for good measure, and try to appeal to the college crowd; but forgot to upgrade the story development and climatic ending. There is no way to sugar coat it - the ending is just laughable and downright stupid.So the story is not great. The setting of the hospital is suitably eerie, though predictable. Also they never leave the campus, so there is no change of scenery other than going to the different rooms - the attic, or swim house, or chapel, or solitary confinement, etc. They venture outside a few times, but can't get far.The script is pretty predictable and the characters fall into cliches.The music is done well and fits the scenes and mood and does not distract.In the end the only redeeming quality is the acting of the characters, though they have little script to work with and a tight setting and a predicable story arc after a million superhero movies out there (there is nothing new here). Even the coming of age and together as a team falls flat. But yet I believed in their characters. I didn't see them as actors delivering lines. They really came to life and pulled you into the setting, the challenges they faced, their history and past, their weaknesses and strengths. They made you forget about all the downsides of the movie and pulled you right in. You feel the characters are real, believable, and alive. There are even some quite authentic sounding accents going on that stay fairly consistent.So if you are a fan of some of these actors - I would go to see them perform and cheer them on. If you want to know what the movie is about, just watch the trailer and you've seen all you need to know."}, {"id": 864, "text": "Of all the super-heroes zagas around; I always preferred X-MEN because it really had deeper themes on top of the sci-fi / entertainment aspect. Sadly DARK PHOENIX was such a disaster that I consider another lose under Disney reign.So with low expectations (and mostly attracted to the horror aspect) I came to see this YA version and to much surprise it was far better than expected. The movie works a little on young adults conflicts; but mostly to stretch character development and in different levels it works. The acting is outstanding compared to most of these movies; from Alicia Braga as the bad girl in a very controlled mode (like Oscar winner Louise Fletcher in One Flew over the Cuckoo nest), Anya Taylor-Joy and bully recluse, Maisie Williams as the repressed girl, Charlie Heaton, Henry Zaga and Blu Hunt. Considering that most of the movie is only the 6 characters in one location, still the movie manages to keep entertaining until the very destructive ending. The only issue for many could be that it switches between horror movie, romantic (LGBTQ) or Breakfast Club mode too much; but aside from being mutants and a few dialogs; nothing here is like others X-MEN movies. Perhaps is time to be original. In brief; it deserves to succeed and resuscitate the X-MEN franchise"}, {"id": 865, "text": "I saw it's first trailer back in 2017, and it said coming soon. After that, there was no any new information about the movie. Finally, it was released a day ago and gave me a heart attack.Having seen the movie, I am wondering if the reason why they kept postponing the release date of the movie was when they were in the post-production, they found how ridiculous the movie is and tried to save it but to no avail, and had prepared to take the backlash from the audience.First of all, what kind of 20 century Fox + Marvel movie only features six people in a movie? Only six people in a institution? That is definitely a hint that this movie will be unsatisfying when we all know it's from Marvel. The story is overly easy and lacks any respect for the Marvel fans.Second of all, this movie concept is for horror movie instead of for superhero, which makes it so weird to watch and cringeworthy. I wouldn't tell you why, but I can tell you that the similar element is also in The nightmare on elm street.Lastly, the CGI is the worst. How much did they even put aside for making this movie? Those visual effects and some characters look like something low budget movie. I am surprised.This movie is way worse than Dark Phoenix.

So I finally rented it for a buck or two from Redbox and my gosh its not even worth a damn dollar. This is one of those examples where a newish director has had some minor success and is thrown a bone by a major studio and given a chance to develop a major name for themselves. This sometimes works out, but more often than not, the final product is trash. Take Corin Hardy's The Nun for example...it SUCKED. Corin Hardy had some indie success with The Hallow and went on to direct the substantially bigger budgeted The Nun but it was a single location flop. The New Mutants is no better. It is shot in one boring as hell location with stupid actors with corny style and has awful CGI. They should have used practical effects for a more real life feel or at least got the CGI right. The movie also feels very dated. As I said, the clothing styles of all the characters is terrible. There is no one for the viewer to truly relate to as we have the trendy jock who straddles the line between preppy and casual sporty trend setter, the lesbian girl who has awful hair and is, im sorry, very ugly. You have Ana Taylor Joy(who is probably the best character in the film) who is dressed in cheap goth wal mart type clothing. And u even have the weird loner who wears what some would call  cool. Loose jeans, bent brimmed trucker hat, and a too big plaid shirt..

The film never for once creates any sort of intrigue, follows the events in the blandest possible manner, and the moviemaking on display is downright inept.The setting had potential but it isn't taken advantage of, dialogues are dull &amp; eye-rolling, horror attempts lack build-up &amp; are poorly executed, action segments are laughable, narrative flow is inconsistent, and characters remain distant so there is no investment in them. Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy &amp; the rest of the cast are completely wasted in their roles, and their performances are forgettable at best.Overall, The New Mutants is a grossly incompetent example of its genre that does nothing right from start to finish and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Not a single aspect works in its favour, every creative choice Boone makes only derails it further, and the film as a whole feels like a neutered orphan in the X-Men saga.

I admit that I was not going to watch this picture, well, not a bit, but the opening of cinemas made me change my mind and go to the hall, where many of the same color but cozy chairs are waiting for you, which missed the viewer. After all, in the end, after all, no one has yet canceled the romance of the cinema, and then the question arose - what to go for, because the choice was frankly small. I went to this particular picture, waited for the average dullness of fantasy in a familiar universe with good special effects - and saw a fig teen movie with obvious thoughts and a bunch of nonsense, seasoned with good graphics. In short, I was disappointed. And here's my brief opinion - Children in a cage. But before we turn to the shortcomings of this picture, consider its few advantages, which your humble servant highlighted. So, the advantages: 1. Maisie Williams - our famous Arya Stark from the famous TV series plays one of the main roles here, and plays really well. Macy is not Sophie Turner, who walks around with Sansa Stark in any picture. Here Macy's heroine is different from her famous image. Of course, she does not always show emotions, but the heroine makes a good impression and she would be the best if it were not for one thing that ruined the whole picture and the heroine of Macy. But, if you close your eyes to it (don't try, fail), then you can live with it, but I won't accept it. I did not expect this from her heroine. It was like a knife to the heart, because Macy here was almost the only bright moment that they decided to spoil, at least a little. 2. Music - good music sounds in the picture, with motives of American Indians, which is very logical, and it was pleasant to listen to it, the only pity is that it is rather small, and it is not perceived separately from the picture. This is where the praise ends, and the spread begins. So the disadvantages: 1. The script - you know, but it had good potential. Think about it: a group of adolescent adolescents with supernormal abilities are in some kind of institution where they are looked after and taught to control their strength, and here a new one arrives to them, who joins this team and gradually they all begin to understand that something is wrong, maybe are they being deceived? Why does it work like this? Is there no other reason here? Instead of realizing its potential, even taking into account a rather cheerful start, the picture does not go further than revealing the usual problems of teenagers of raging puberty, revealing obvious thoughts, and of the final fight that ends like a child, despite the rating of 16+. To say that it disappointed me is to say nothing! 2. What's going on here? - believe me, you will ask yourself this question constantly while watching, because nothing is ever clear. I do not understand why the creators could not clearly describe the universe, the principle of operation of this institution in an hour and a half picture. Instead, the viewer is fed the everyday life of teenagers who do not like it here, because they want freedom. 3. Logical holes - oh, damn it, there are so many of them that I have a great desire to make a review on this picture with a complete blowing of all its contents, but it will take so much time, the lion's share of which will be spent on reading comics, and I hate reading comics, and I consider it fun for children and nothing else, and that's the only reason I won't do it, because the psyche is still useful to me. Therefore, while watching, I had to mentally beat my head against the wall from the stupidity and delirium of what was happening, because if I did something like that right in the hall, I would simply be taken out of it, and then they would cause a fool, and I would did not write my review now. Just get ready for an overwhelming amount of gibberish. Just think, the writers managed to make logical mistakes in the picture, where all the action takes place in one building! One building Karl! 4. Lesbians - well, since we have no gays, there will be lesbians. I was sincerely surprised that there is not a single black man in the picture, but there are lesbians, and this is disgusting. And worst of all, one of them was Macy. Well, why? It's disgusting, ugly, disgusting. It was physically painful to watch these scenes and I had to cover my face with my hand from the abomination of what was happening. And why did they write horrors in the genre of this picture, because there is not a single scary moment. Yes, and this picture can not be called a thriller, because the atmosphere here is clearly not worn out. A little about the main characters: 1. Daniella Moonstar performed by Blue Hunt - a girl from an Indian reservation with an unknown superpower, who got into this institution, where she has to figure out herself and find friends. I didn't expect any particularly outstanding acting from Blue - and it did. As the saying goes - it will do for rural areas. 2. Rain Sinclair performed by Maisie Williams is a religious girl, capable of, well, you will see for yourself. Behaves like a real friend to Danielle. If it were not for the propaganda of the LGBT heroine, Macy would have been the best hero of the picture. 3. Ulyana Rasputin performed by Ani Taylor-Joy - mmm, Russian flavor in American cinema, and even without cranberries, I don't believe, pinch me. Hey! And it's true. And although the girl behaves like an average , she still arouses interest, and the actress matches the heroine, you can't argue with that. I sincerely wish this picture a box office failure, because from a fairly large budget (sixty-seven million), at the moment the picture managed to collect a little more than thirteen. In any century, I at least somewhat agree with the critics who smashed this picture, because under the guise of an interesting idea with good potential, we got an average lousy picture with an obvious and easily guessed scenario, a bunch of logical holes and LGBT propaganda. Cash failure and oblivion! This time, even theatrical romance did not save the day. As a result, we have bad fiction about teenagers with abilities in the known universe, with a bad and boring script, an obvious thought, a children's final fight and a bunch of logical delirium, even spoiled the heroine of Maisie Williams.

Robbie K back again to give you insight into the latest film as he reviews:Movie:New Mutants (2020)Director: Josh Boone Writers: Josh Boone, Knate Lee Stars: Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie HeatonLIKES:Good Graphics Haunting graphics brought to life with decent animation and styleA great setting that feels haunted, enclosing, and very much forebodingMutant powers that have the comic and movie atmosphere that comes through at the end of the film and reminds me of X-men series I loveSome Decent Acting From Young Actors Talented cast brings out the teenage angsts of a hot headed mutant academy groupGood spectrum when they are directed too with Maisie Willaims and Blu Hunt who have the highest spectrumGreat chemistry together that many times feels very much like a group forced together into odd situationsSome Deep Meaning Without ruining the plot, plenty of character development to address relevant topicsSome are done fantastically to really integrate with the story and will be the shining moments of the movieDecent Run Time About 90 minutes, hard to beat that for a movie like this.Some Great Horror Delivery at times The setting is truly haunting, with creepy shadows, feelings of being alone, and the chilling psychological torment of the colors of the wallSome chilling things that go bump in the night and may induce nightmares to young audience members (be warned)Some back stories are certainly deeply disturbing, a darker comic book splendor that may resonate deeply and certainly chill you at points.Rahne and Dani Best part of the movie, as the two have great chemistry, the most character development, major growth, and a dynamic that works well.Great acting as I said.Okay climax: Displays of Power come outA nice suspense of the movie, that is okay to say the leastSome of the funniest lines to date at this time.DISLIKES: Predictable Even without reading the comics can see so many things a mile awayMakes the movie boring at times knowing where it is going and took away the edge of the horror pointsSlow at times Takes a little while to get off the ground, the first act in particular a long drawn out introSecond part feels very uneven, exciting at times only to drop to low, drawn out displays of quickly portrayed character developmentThe third act gets much better to offset, but again very quick, needed more action and conflict to offset the slow pace.A Little too progressive at times Takes some political components into the mix and sort of makes it the focus, contributing to the slow paceThere will be some character moments that are a bit too millennial and drama oriented that some will not enjoy, can't say much without ruining things.Leads to some overacted moments.A bit too forceful in acting The characters are a bit too overdone at times, the progressive themes forcing them to act a bit too clich\u00e9 in drama momentsIllyana was the one whose tough attitude got a bit in the way, though several others have flaws greatly over exaggeratedPowers Come a Bit too late Again I like my movies about mutants to have some better displays of power used in the super power way-This way was more drama focused and horror than the usual superhero part. Unique yes, but the slow none the same and a bit too bland.Addressing the deep roots a bit too easy and rushed The strong character moments get rushed for most to overcome their weakness, randomly finding strength to defat their demonsOutside of one girl's struggles, the others surprisingly are less impressive and more shoved to the background, the constant struggle of multiple charactersNeeded to keep to the horror elements at the end to really bring the character out instead of jumping into the overdramatic action part.Illyana a bit too much for me Understand she is supposed to be the overzealous one, but still a bit too much for meThe in your face, rogue element has its place, but often forces too much for my like that it gets in the way of progressing the characterHas the coolest looking power, but at the end drowned out by jokes and drama to really get the full effect.SUMMARY:After two long years I had my doubts about the movie having any sort of quality. However, the movie had some enjoyable components and was more put together in terms of the themes it was trying to deliver. Like Teen Wolf meets the Breakfast Club, the rogue like drama of this film manages to keep much of its characters interacting to make a heck of a drama. Some elements of the horror really are executed well and had they focused more on this element, we could have gotten one heck of a thrill ride. Sadly for me, the drama elements get in the way with a rushed plot, leading to overdone, in your face moments, rapid development for many of the characters, and some pacing issues that I hope to have settled in my comic movies. Still if you like drama/horror movies with a bit of a super hero flair, then check this one out, otherwise hold out for the bigger releases coming in a few weeks.My scores are:Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.5"}, {"id": 879, "text": "Well, I kinda grew up with those kids and their big brothers X-Men between other characters. So I was expecting the movie for a long time.Let's say it could have been far better. And yet far worse. The biggest problem to me is the lack of supporting characters, even,say, guards and nurses in the facility who would have helped giving it a more realistic view. The place feels hollow, and that makes it all looks cheap. And as written by someone else, this movie needs a rock n' roll soundtrack. Using a legend for children (heard so many times) in the beginning makes it sounds cheesy, and the horror vibe felt in the trailer never really happens.Yet... The characters are promising. If only they're given the opportunity to be seen again. Illyana/Magik is the most interesting as already noted. Roberto/Sunspot is a funny and friendly one, and Sam/Cannonball gives the right human touch. Rahne/Wolfsbane can be improved, as she's originally much more incapacitated by her religious bigotry. Danielle/Moonstar, well... She lacks substance. If only there was a sequel to perfect those points, and give the New Mutants a real chance... the potential is there, the characters created by Chris Claremont have a lot to give to the movies. Last but not least, even with all its imperfections, I still had a good time."}, {"id": 880, "text": "The New Mutants wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't great either.Going into the film, I knew it would not be the caliber of any MCU movies given the movie was originally made by 20th Century. So I expected quality to the extent of the X-Men films. Plus, with all the changes made throughout the production of this movie I had an idea that it could seem as if it was missing bits and pieces. I don't feel like there was anything that was noticeably removed that would help make parts of the movie make sense outside of a little more backstory for the New Mutants. They did get a little explanation of backstory but I feel like I needed just a little more.The showcase of their individual powers was done well given these are New Mutants who are still learning how to use their powers properly. A little awkward at times and confused was the reaction to their powers.The demon bear we saw in the trailers was really well done. A strange foe to tackle for mutants getting a grip of their powers but still done in a fashion to make it believable that they were going with whatever happened and making the best of it.Of course, you had the predictability in some scenes. The teenage romance/drama was there but outside of a scene or two I don't feel like it was in your face as much as it was natural progression.As a standalone movie outside of the X-Men films and MCU, it was a decent movie. I think a sequel would be beneficial to help shape the team of mutants we saw from the film but if we don't get that I won't be upset."}, {"id": 881, "text": "Delayed so many times over the last three years that it seemed more likely that hell would freeze over before I saw this film, The New Mutants has become a hotly-anticipated and mysterious prospect. After all that waiting, though, I can't say that the movie lives up to its potential.A messy and unfortunately drab watch, the film struggles to inspire the imagination with its spin-off of the X-Men stories. Lacking atmosphere, tension and character depth, it's a pretty mediocre movie that, while not a total disaster, clearly isn't able to use its brightest ideas to the full.And that's where I want to start, because although The New Mutants is hardly a masterpiece, the effects of its many reshoots and production issues is wholly apparent throughout. As a result, its faults can't be entirely attributed to director Josh Boone, because there's a definite clash between a darker, more cerebral story from Boone and something a little more generic from the film's new owners, Disney.These sorts of issues are inevitable under such circumstances, and it really bears out as the film briefly introduces really interesting ideas surrounding the history of the facility the story takes place in, but then just drops them in favour of a generic action finale - reminiscent of the struggles of the infamous Fant4stic.Saying that, however, there are major problems with this movie all the way through. Above all, it's a really drab, dull watch that does little to use the potential of its setting to tell a unique superhero story.With a small cast in a contained setting, The New Mutants has all the potential to work as a hybrid haunted house/comic book movie, yet it lacks any sort of fear factor, tension or atmosphere to really put that into effect. Meanwhile, the film is frustratingly content with using an overtly grey colour palette to make things look moody, yet without really doing enough to bring a genuine sense of eeriness or claustrophobia into play.Failing that, The New Mutants also had the potential to work as a coming-of-age take on the superhero genre. Following young mutants discovering their powers and how to control them, the film's central themes fit perfectly with the genre, but the screenplay is nowhere near layered enough to make that drama at all interesting.All of the characters are painfully one-dimensional; each a stereotype among the wider group in a vain attempt to play off the legacy of The Breakfast Club. As a result, there's little reason to actually invest emotion into connecting with the characters, because there isn't much to uncover beneath the surface.And because of that, the film's story, action and main villain are all far less effective than could have otherwise been the case. Linking into each of the characters' back stories and deepest fears, there should have been far more focus placed on the emotions of the main characters.But with no way to form a genuine connection with anyone on screen, The New Mutants falls flat throughout, and the final act in particular lacks any genuine intensity or excitement, unfolding as a painfully drab and generic action climax with nothing to really grab your attention.Overall, I was disappointed by The New Mutants. Though it isn't a total disaster, it has all the hallmarks of a film that has been wrangled back and forth between different owners with different sets of ideas. It's messy, dull and unfortunately drab throughout, missing the opportunity to develop its best ideas as it plumps for a more generic, one-dimensional action story."}, {"id": 882, "text": "This is not your average superhero movie. Its not about saving the city or saving the world or bunch of people from huge monsters or killer robots. Its just about saving yourself and the few kids around you by finding who you really are and what your powers are.The New Mutants is first and foremost a drama. Secondly, it has some horror elements, but only so, that it wont make you loose sleep. Thirdly, there is some action and nice special effects.The cast was mostly great: the whole movie has less actors in it than Castaway, but they are well - casted. Blu Hunt is perfect Dani Moonstar, Anya Taylor-Joy is perfect Illyana and Maisie Williams fits perfectly as Rahne Sinclair. The guys, however, are little too old and manly to play teenagers.I've read New Mutants in the nineties (like the Asgard Saga), and although Josh Boone's vision has little resemblance with the epic adventures this little group has in the comics, there were a lot of nice details here and there. Most of them were related to Illyana/Magik, her lovely pet dragon and beautiful shiny sword :)The movie might have benefited from couple of extra scenes to flesh out some aspects, but this way it was ok enough.I'm saddened by the fact that after postponing this so much, they finally publish it at the same time as Christopher Nolan movie. Oh well. Go see it, if you know the source material."}, {"id": 883, "text": "What to say about The New Mutants that might change your mind, looking at all the mediocre or even bad reviews of the movie?How about that: I looked up the fictional biographies of the characters from the source material and, compared to what was displayed in the movie, they appeared random and meaningless to me. I'm sure I might anger some hardcore comic fans with this statement. But its originality is this movie's biggest strength: The New Mutants finally covers a topic about the X-Men franchise that was only scratched the surface of in the first movie: the body horror of young mutants discovering their frightening powers for the first time. The choice to elaborate on this topic using the horror genre as a vehicle is both genius and somewhat neccessary when you come to think about it. And it works extremely well: the movie has one of the griddiest anthmospheres in all of the movies and is genuinely scary at times (special nod to the genius design of the Smiley Men). The great CGI does it's part, as well as the score. All in all it's a technically well-made experience with a clear and distinct style overall.Another selling point is the character-driven plot, with every single one of the mutants being extremely likable, well-written and cast with talented actors. The makers of the movie decided to change major parts of the characters' biographies significantly, and it provides them with much more depth than was the case in the comics (again, I only read about their bios on the internet, I'm sorry if I might misrepresent the quality of the comics here).Of course, the movie also has its issues, with some major questions remaining unanswered and some plot holes kept empty - I could imagine one reason for this was the movie's difficult production process. But hey - I can confidently say it's way more well-rounded than Dark Phoenix!"}, {"id": 884, "text": "The New Mutants: Darkest of the X-Men films, straying into horror territory. Five teens are confined to an institute run by Dr Reyes (Alice Braga), they all have Mutant powers, some haven't manifested yet. Ostensibly Reyes is going to help them identify their powers and control them; the teen Mutants believe that they will then move on to Professor Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters. But it is soon clear that Reyes and her Superior have other plans for them, they are under surveillance at all times even when they think they are in camera free zones and the institution is surrounded by a force-field.The teens are impressive: Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) arrives after her Reservation is wiped out by a tornado and she is chased by an elemental entity; Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton) can fly at jet speed; Bobby da Costa (Henry Zaga) is literally a human torch; Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams) is a shape-shifter; Illyana Rasputin (Anya Taylor-Joy) has sorcery powers. They are united by the fact that they all have survived tragedies. Things turn dark when the new mutants suffer nightmares which have real world consequences. Masked monsters (voiced by Marilyn Manson) who are eyeless and grinning when unmasked torment Illyana; Rahne is attacked by a crazed priest who brands her.This is a grim film, even the institution which has cells and seems to have been a psychiatric hospital in the past. There are open fields but this freedom is curtailed by the force-field. It is a prison, not a school. The conflicts between the teens are lightened somewhat by the growing romantic relationship between Rahne and Dani but there are true scenes of horror if not downright terrors the mutants fight for survival.Release of The New Mutants has been much delayed and it has been through re-shoots and new cuts but I think this version works well. Many X-Men fans will probably not be please by it though and that might explain it's IMDb rating.Director/Co-Writer Josh Boone has delivered a fitting conclusion (?) to the X-Men series in this thirteenth film. 8/10."}, {"id": 885, "text": "Looking at the trailers, it is marketed as a horror as its main appeal, but just seems like they gave up fixing the script and ran with whatever they had. All the notes are there to weave it into a better action horror story, but pacing is awful.There are moments where it doesn't even allow the viewer to appreciate what is going on in the scene, instead trying to advance the plot points faster. Then moments where it was too much with making sure the audience knew the subplot.There are no trials and tribulations. There was no time to build up of tension. Instead just little post-it notes of what they thought was cool to see in the film. Little quips where the characters makes in-jokes of their superhero names for fans.All this together just made the whole final scene feel empty. Where the audience is suppose to feel elated, that the character overcame their fears. Cheering on and enjoying a spectacle. Instead it just falls flat as they are trying to imagine why are they even invested in these characters in the first place."}, {"id": 886, "text": "I just watched this and my overwhelmingly initial reaction was how the hell did this cost $80 million?Everything - from the quality of the acting, to the way it's shot and the CGI - looks like a TV pilot.I mean 80% of the movie takes place in rooms and corridors. The acting is mostly god-awful, like stilted South American soap opera style in the case of the main character.She is unspeakably awful, how she got the starring role in a major blockbuster.....The guy from Stranger Things is the only actor that put in a decent turn.Anna Taylor Joy alternates between sounding like Stalin and a high-school cheerleader depending on how bothered she seems to be in any particular scene.Maisie Williams looks like she dressed up as Deirdre Barlow for Halloween.I cannot understand how they spent so much money, or on what exactly.

It really was all teenage angst and CGI, give this a skip it was a turkey!"}, {"id": 888, "text": "This film was meant to hit cinemas in 2017 but delay after delay has meant that this film has finally hit the cinema in 2020, when apart from Tenet there is nothing else out so I guess people might actually watch it. I have now watched it and here is my review for The New Mutants. The premise of the film sees a group of young mutants in a hospital, when they realise something is something sinister is going on.Main Character Blu Hunt plays Danielle Moonstar and she is set up as the main character here. I thought she was fine, she does the best she can with the character, despite the fact that the writing isn't that great. She has good chemistry with the others in the film but there is just nothing particularly remarkable about her and the film doesn't give you a great reason to get invested in her story here.Supporting Characters The main supporting characters are played by Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor-Joy and I thought they both did good jobs here, they are good actresses and they show it off here, especially Taylor-Joy who is the best character here for me. The rest of the mutants are fine too and the doctor played by Alice Braga does a fine job even if you know where the story is going with her. The issue is that there are some interesting things to do with the characters but the film doesn't take the time or effort to really explain these things and again it makes it hard for you to care because the film just gives you no reason to with it's lacklustre writing.Story The idea of a group of mutants being stuck in a hospital is interesting, especially when it comes to their power sets and the way they are presented. It is at its best when it looks at how their powers affect them on an emotional level and how it led them to be in the hospital. The issue is that it doesn't give you enough time with the characters and really the characters have really similar backstories that it makes you think that they couldn't be bothered to come up with more then one backstory. Also the ending of the film is really abrupt, it's like the last action scene takes place and then the film ends, leaving you let down.Script The script here has some moments, I mean especially with the horrors that the characters face. I mean Taylor-Joy's character has some really interesting moments here that you just want to know more about and don't. The intrigue is there and the film does a decent job of ramping the tension, but this film suffers from the obviously generic way the script is presented. You know how this film is going to go from the beginning to end and that makes it feel like a let down, with some pretty lacklustre dialogue.Style The style of the film as mentioned above does a good job in ramping up tension and intrigue. I am not usually a horror film fan, but this film actually uses its horror elements well and makes it quite scary. It also doesn't rely on jump scares which is usually the reason I hate horror films so it deserves credit for that. But this film's first real 30 mins is dull and slow, which makes it a bit boring and a slog, which for a film that is 90 mins long that is quite a long time. Also there is a bit of a clash between the horror and superhero elements of the film and this does make for a clash of styles at time.Overall Overall, this is an average film that will probably be forgotten about in the memory very quickly. This film had so much potential but fell short and isn't worth the time really."}, {"id": 889, "text": "The New Mutants was meant to be released in 2017. It was held up for reshoots and re editing which implies that there were problems with the movie.It was 20th Century Fox that revitalised Marvel characters with the first X Men film. It mixed action featuring characters with mutant powers and grounded them with real life events.It began with a young Erik Lensherr being taken to a concentration camp as he is separated from his parents he makes the metal gates bend.The New Mutants is a quasi spin off from The X Men. It is The Breakfast Club with tenagers with mutant powers locked up in a shadowy hospital run by a mutant Dr Cecilia Reyes (Alice Braga) who takes orders from someone unseen.The new girl is Dani Moonstar who arrives after a supernatural storm that wipes out her family on their reservation. She wakes up handcuffed to her bed. However Dr Reyes has no idea what Dani's particular powers are as Dani is also unaware of them.Dani is introduced to four other young teenagers. Sam Guthrie, Illyana Rasputin, Bobby da Costa and Rahne Sinclair. All have suffered a past trauma relating to the manifestations of their mutant powers.Illyana seems to have the strongest powers and the most abrasive relationship with Dani. Whereas Rahne and Dani are the ones that bond easily.Like Fox's reboot of The Fantastic Four film in 2015. This was a misguidedly drab film which is low on action and humour. It wants to ramp up some horror, the realisation of the Smiley Men comes across like an episode of Steven Moffat era Doctor Who.It is the Young Adult version of a Superhero movie with sullen teenagers and only perks up when some action sequences arrive at the climax."}, {"id": 890, "text": "This movie has been through probably one of the most difficult journeys to get to it's release. No it's not perfect but it for sure worth my time to finally see it! As a major x-men fan, I didn't know a whole lot about the new mutants roster &amp; story so I tried to go in not knowing exactly what would happen. The major name/character drops &amp; teases were awesome and I'm sad they won't get to further explore those!The actors did great with their accents &amp; portrayals of the new mutants! Braga played Dr. Reyes in a way that made you question whether her every motive but also wonder if she was good or not. Zaga, Peters, Taylor-Joy, &amp; Heaton were great in their scenes, Hunt as Danielle wasn't the greatest actor at times, but definitely fit the role in my eyes.Considering the direction the series was going to go, they did good with it. You could tell a few things were shoe-horned in for the sake of this being the only film to be completed. The New Mutants story was on the shorter side, but also felt satisfactory considering they wanted to tell an effective storyline that wouldn't also bring in the other major players in the X-Men.They definitely could have pushed the thriller/dark aspect of the film much more. Considering it was marketed as that, it didn't really have much eerie-feel.

My assumption was always that this movie was going to suck the way they kept pushing it back, but as it turns out it was not that bad.Very enjoyable if you are a fan of the comic as it attempts to be true to the source material rather than convey to the recent popularity of over the top superhero movies. I respect that because it gives the genre of comic book movies more diversity.The tone of the film is like a horror movie. I remember getting the feel from the trailer and it stays true for the entire feature. I will say that the tone is darker than the comic. As if becoming a teenager is not hard enough with suddenly having powers you can't control, the movie decides to turn these mutants original origins into a much more grim situation. I did not think it was needed but it does not hurt the film.I though all the actors were excellent in their parts, they truly pulled from the comic book and as a fan I loved that. Even the fair skinned kid playing Sunspot (who was a dark skin Brazilian in the comic) was cast perfectly for his role as a rich snob with everything who can't control his body.It's one of those teen movies that's dark and moody that works perfectly in the horror genre. That's something to remember because its nothing like it's X-Men counter part.

Things start to seem strange when everyone in the facility seem to be reliving their deepest fears.REVIEW: I mean, I can't really be upset that this film wasn't the best. After multiple pushbacks and a very lackluster trailer, I knew what I was in for. With that being said, I didn't hate the film. It definitely wasn't good, but I could see potential in it. Some of the scenes near the end were entertaining and a couple of the scenes where we see the characters fear were good, but not too much aside from that had much value. The only acting performance that I would say has any sort of impact on me was Charlie Heston as Sam. Aside from those things, there were a few issues. E didn't get much backstory from the character and a couple of the characters had no flashback of their tragedy which removed what connection you could've had from their character. The acting as a whole was pretty mediocre and you can tell that there wasn't fully thought out idea for the story. It seemed like they wanted to make some quick cash from the X-Men world without truly putting much thought into a reason for having this film. My biggest issue with the film was probably not having a clear villain. You can say that each of their fear was the true villain of the story, but that feels very corny and easy. The villain I think they were going for is Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga), but there wasn't any part of this film that I felt she held much of any threat. She seemed sincere the film and even with an act she's attempting to do at the end of the film didn't appear to be out of any hate and I almost couldn't argue with what she had to do. I would go more in depth with that, but it would reveal spoilers.In the end, I was disappointed with the performances since I do like Anya Taylor Joy and I felt this was her worst and it's just a bit disappointing knowing this film had potential, but couldn't find a clear path. I didn't hate watching it, but I wouldn't recommend it. 5.0/10."}, {"id": 893, "text": "Yeah, film was shot and set to be released back in 2017 and there's basically zero chance there ever will be any continuation 'cause it's flopped hardalas, it's a heartful, atmospheric, weird flick which will stay with me for a number of reasons: a) bizarrely synergetic with 2020 corona-haunted year being a movie about a ragtag band of teens confined together due to reasons out of their control; b) captures the intangible teen spirit which far better-crafted cinematic gems at times cannot; c) profoundly heartwarming easter eggs - some of them speak to 80s genre flicks aficionados; some to 90s pop-culture adepts; plus one Logan in-universe connection (not baddies' name) which 95% of people will miss; d) I just like these characters and find main romantic storyline extremely touching, shoot me.to cap this one - it's NOT necessarily a 'good' cinema in a conventional sense.

Surprising, considering all the negative reviews.The CGI set-pieces which reveal our characters' respective mutant powers are as frequent as larger budget X-men movies. Whilst not as elaborate, they are imaginative.Some inspirations are obvious - The Breakfast Club, Show Me Love perhaps, and the Anime action/fantasy genre. The director lists some influences in a promotional video - Nightmare on Elm Street 3, Psycho, &amp; One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest which I can see in hindsight.All performances are earnest and that goes a long way to make the film gel.It doesn't seek to reinvent the wheel but it does gently and carefully nudge the mutants down a different, spookier path.The horror is pure visual creepiness, like Pan's Labyrinth, and not so much jump scares. The fantasy elements use splashes of rich colour, which is nice to see these days, and moments of epic scale.I'm a child of the 80's and didn't connect with the original Breakfast Club as much as I did with this mutant version. I think that's due to the added horror/fantasy elements.This film works VERY well within its limits and is worthy of a spot on any cinema's COVID reopening program."}, {"id": 895, "text": "I did not go Into this film thinking it was going to be the best film ever, and if my assumption about super heroes movies is correct, most fans are used to the over the top action of films like the avengers and doubling down on the stakes, and that somehow equals a better movie. So In that regard, I did not contain the same sentiment. The formula for superhero movies gets stale and I love seeing new takes on the concept, a more grounded psychological horror twist is what we get here with a smaller cast and smaller set. This sets it up to give the movie some breathing room, Often in movies there are so many time skips, and changing of locations that you can't fully be immersed. By having the movie Nearly entirely take place at a creepy hospital it get the set some character and makes you feel like you're a resident. I love the looks of the characters, I like the real world tie ins to comic book references like the Lockheed puppet. They could have just shoehorned him in, but I was surprised that they gave his presence a purpose and a backstory that ties in well with Magiks character, whose actor actually looks like the comic book character. The Actors all did a good job in their roles, they are all young, with some slight wobbles, but I think they made for a great looking cast. The story helps create empathy and interest in the main characters, but the movies pace is never slowed by introducing the characters pasts, the movie is all purposely edited, and I don't think too many scenes lagged on. The Music was great. Not a bad first film to come back to from lockdown, maybe you will be able to relate to it as well."}, {"id": 896, "text": "I had real hopes for this film, it was supposed to come out 3yrs ago, but of course it was delayed due to Fox' Acquisition, it was also supposed to be R rated, and a much darker film. I wouldn't classify this as being any darker than X2, which was a pretty dark film, and certainly not anywhere near as dark as Logan, which also was a somewhat disappointing film, but probably accomplished closer to what New Mutants wanted to. The most unfortunate aspect to this film is that there is very little character development or camaraderie built between our mutant captives.The movie is poorly lit, it is excessively dark, which, for a big-budget movie is ridiculous. Even if the lighting was poor during the shoot, this could have been fixed in post production. This story has been told so many times, and while there were seeds of a good story here, they were literally buried under a disjointed story they simply jumps from one even to the next without a coherent narrative, which is a problem. This is not a David Lynch film, it is not surrealistic art, it needs a coherent narrative, and this is far and away the weakest aspect of the film.There will be people are going to highly review this simply because it has a lesbian love story, even if you think that is great, it doesn't make a movie great in and of itself. Thankfully, this portion of the story is handled quite tastefully, but at the same time, it was wholly unnecessary to the story, in fact, no love story was necessary and it really feels tacked on, this script is so aimless and without any real point other than, I supposed to tick off boxes of what is popular right now. Strong female protagonist: check, Weak male characters: check, LGBTQ representation: check, negative depictions of religion: check, southern stereotypes: check. This story for feels more like a checklist of woke feminism then it does a real story.The acting well-done, for the most part, and this keeps the film from becoming a truly awful film, I would say that this film is almost good, it has some moments of brilliance, with some of the darker elements, but never carried them to their conclusion to the point where it can justify it's largely jumbled and incoherent narrative. Although it is certainly better than The Dark Phoenix, that film also bought into woke femenism, but it is so so spectacularly bad, it actually became so bad it's good. I wish I could say the same for New Mutants, but the story never finds it's way, and never delivers on it's premise, it just sort of fizzles out.God Bless ~Amy"}, {"id": 897, "text": "As both a horror and X-men fan, I was looking forward to this mashup since the first trailer dropped. Even recently with mostly bad reviews and press, I wanted to see it for myself.And ... it pretty much sucked. That doesn't bode well for future work from Josh The Fault in my Stars Boone (e.g. The Stand mini-series.We pretty much know the gist from the trailers. Young mutants are haunted/harassed by something in a mental hospital.The best parts are pulled from the X-men series in which mutants first find out their powers, typically represented effectively on screen. Most times these scenes are fun, but the special effects are a mixed bag, jumping back and forth from decent to cheesy.Most of the ensemble cast are relatively new up-and-coming stars such as Maise Williams (Game of Thrones), Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch/Queen's Gambit), and Charlie Heaton (Stranger Things) but the acting is mediocre, and worst of all, they butcher whatever accent they are supposed to have (Irish, Russian[?], and U.S. southern respectively).And the story -- disappointing to say the least.If you drop your expectations to a bad 90 minute Buffy the Vampire episode, then maybe you'll find something to like."}, {"id": 898, "text": "I was really looking forward to this, despite the skeptical trailer. This was one of my favorite comics as a kid, and I was willing to accept them going the horror route, despite this never being a horror comic book. My guess was they would do the Demon Bear storyline, given the elements in the trailer, and I was correct. My question is, why would they do a superhero movie with clearly so small a budget? What's the point? It's quickly clear by the lack of special effects, and what few they have, the mediocre to poor quality of FX, using the same locations, that this is on a Blumhouse style budget.The casting is pretty good, other than Daniel Moonstar, who is absolutely nothing like her character. She doesn't look or act like her, her powers are not correct, and she doesn't even look Native American. And her acting is pretty weak, especially compared to playing next to 3 seasoned actors, and Roberto, who was actually pretty good, and spot on to his character. Even though the writers took a lot of liberties with Illyana's character, Anya Taylor-Joy looks a lot like her, and has the swagger to pull her off. Given Illyana was one of my favorite characters, it was fun to watch her play her. And though Sam Guthrie doesn't look quite like Sam, the Stranger Things actor really pulled it off. Maisie Williams, also great casting and acting, despite her lame werewolf effects.This is the second time New Mutants has been made, the first time, an even worse TV pilot that also had no budget. Hopefully they'll bring Illyana on to the X-Men, as, I believe that was how she was originally introduced. She is by far one of the most complex and interesting characters in the Marvel universe, but, doubtful they will get it right, and it's abundantly clear that the studios don't really care about female superheroes.This isn't the worst superhero movie made, but considering the majority are made with a budget over 100 million and are exceedingly average, it puts New Mutants in a slightly better light. Even with the terrible budget, they still could have written a better story. Unbreakable had very few effects and was a great film. Still, probably a much bigger budget than this one.I'm glad they made a movie, I just wish it was better."}, {"id": 899, "text": "This is a film that did not need to be made.It does not work as a superhero film, nor as a coming-of-age angst fest, and certainly not as a horror movie.

It was far too dark in a lot of scenes, and I could feel myself mentally checking out at many points throughout.It does get slightly more exciting towards the end, and I liked the arc of Anya Taylor-Joys character, Illyana. The editing is also quite strong, and I could tell that Josh Boone was trying to craft a more intimate and personal story which I appreciated.It was a good premise, but it just didn't land for me in the execution and I couldn't wait for it to be over. Thankfully, it's quite a short film, but I was still bored throughout the first and second act.It's the third act that stops this film from being completely terrible, but the main problem is that I didn't care about most of the characters and the story was extremely dull.

This one is a mix of coming-of-age superheroes with horror. Directed and written by Josh Boone, this sci-fi thriller features young stars: Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton. Josh Boone is a big-time X-Men fan who owns a lot of their comics.It was going to be released way back in 2018, but due to re-shoots, corporate shuffling, and the pandemic, it finally hit streaming and some theaters this week. Inspired by the successes of recent horror films like It (2017) and Get Out (2017), the studio reworked the movie to make it scarier. The intention is that this will be the first in a horror trilogy.TIPS FOR PARENTS: Lesbians kiss several times Profanity Some scary moments and creatures that could frighten young children, although older teens don't think it's scary enough to be categorized in the horror genre. Some violence Bullying THEMES: Confronting your personal fears Teamwork Finding your inner strength Courage Friendship Control We've heard that story about the good/evil bear before in a movie, but it was a wolf in the other version. It's a good lesson to remember.THINGS I LIKED: I'm impressed with Anya Taylor-Joy who is such a versatile actress. I loved her in the newest version of Emma. (2020). Because the movie is such a slow burn, you get to know the characters fairly well. It definitely feels different than all other superhero movies. Audiences aren't certain if that's good or bad. Some of the CGI is pretty good, although it's also noticeable bad at times. A couple of lines made me laugh out loud. They were meant to be funny, but this is definitely not a light-hearted Marvel movie like Thor: Ragnarok or Guardians of the GalaxyTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: The first scene starts with a bang but happens at night and is so dark that it will be extremely difficult to see what's happening when you watch it on a small device on streaming. Some of the characters' accents faded in and out. You learn about the cliched characters but you don't really like them or care much about them. So much brooding teenage drama and angst. It's very slow-moving. Some call that boring. The big battle doesn't happen until the very end of the film. The dragon creature was awesome. What a shame we didn't get to see it in action until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The screaming just sounded like actors screaming. There was something really inauthentic about it. Pretty predictable.

Trapped in a creepy facility run by Dr. Reyes(Alice Braga), Rahne, Illyana, Sam, Danielle &amp; Roberto will need to fight their inner demons &amp; stop an impending doom, before it's too late.The New Mutants is an amazing movie. Director Josh Boone has given us a unique, engaging &amp; creepy superhero film. This film doesn't deserve the critical drubbing, it received from everyone. In fact, it's a really good addition to the X-Men franchise, tying into previous movies. It surpasses last year's X-Men: Dark Phoenix(2019). The action set pieces are minimal but, highly impressive. The horror elements of the film, make it unique in the long running superhero genre. The highlight of the movie, is the effortless camaraderie among its five leads. Maisie Williams is outstanding as Rahne Sinclair. Williams continues to grow from strength to strength as an actor, after her star-making turn on Game of Thrones(2011-2019). Anya Taylor-Joy is spectacular as Illyana Rasputin. Taylor-Joy gives us another unforgettable performance after The Witch(2015), Split(2016), Thoroughbreds(2017) &amp; Glass(2019). Charlie Heaton is brilliant as Sam Guthrie. Alice Braga is fantastic as Dr. Reyes. Blu Hunt is mind-blowing as Danielle Moonstar. Hunt has a bright future ahead of her. Henry Zaga is excellent as Roberto da Costa. The supporting cast is impressive. The New Mutants is worth a watch, if you're a fan of Fox's X-Men film series.

Don't get me wrong - this isn't a great movie, and I enjoyed it mostly as a guilty pleasure. It had a nice plot that was mysterious and pretty spooky at the moments. It kept me guessing and I enjoyed it. This flick was also pretty nicely paced as at its running time 1 h 34 min it barely dragged. Performances were pretty descent by Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams - given the material. Unfortunately Blu Hunt wasn't that good.Overall, with lesser budget and a new direction this series took with this movie, I enjoyed The New Mutants as guilty pleasure way much more then lets say a terrible Dark Phoenix. This spin off has a potential, but needs to be updated if they want to continue with it."}, {"id": 905, "text": "The New Mutants is a spin-off superhero film based on the Marvel Comics group of the same name. Directed by Josh Boone (The Fault In Our Stars) and starring Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Charlie Heaton, it provides an adequate amount of entertainment for anyone longing for that last taste of X-Men related fun before they are fully integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.After losing her father and home due to a tornado, young Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) wakes up to find herself in a mysterious hospital run by the equally enigmatic Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga). Confused by her new environment, Dani is informed by Dr. Reyes that she is a mutant and that her powers need to be studied and controlled before she is allowed to leave. Dani is soon introduced to four other young patients who also have mutant powers; Rahne (Maisie Williams), a Scottish girl with the ability to transform into a wolf, Illyana (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Russian girl with witch-like powers, Bobby (Henry Zaga), a Brazilian boy who can harness solar energy, and Sam (Charlie Heaton), a Southern US boy who can fly at super fast speeds. Each of them struggle to control their mutant powers and deal with the trauma of their past, eventually bonding together to conspire a way to escape the hospital.The X-Men series of films have had a spotty history when it comes to quality, ranging from a clever and ambitious way to fix previous mistakes (X-Men: Days Of Future Past) to a boring and underwhelming conclusion to certain character arcs (X-Men: Dark Phoenix). In spite of its status as a spin-off, The New Mutants does feel like it is part of this universe, as the audience is reminded of it quite often. While I don't believe it is anywhere near as bad as Dark Phoenix, it still doesn't leave much of an impression to elevate it above being simply okay. The whole story felt as though it was on autopilot, weaving through the typical cliched tragic backstories of its main characters all while offering little to no surprises along the way. As things like this have all been done before in older entries, it just comes across as a lazy retread of something that we've all seen several times before. With that said, I did feel that the film's saving grace is the acting of its main stars, who despite the mediocre lines they had to read, managed to keep it watchable during most of its weakest moments.Director Josh Boone, who also co-wrote the film's script, does a reasonable enough job keeping things going at a decent pace, dedicating most time to developing the characters and providing explanations as to why they are in this hospital to begin with. There are some nice interactions between these youths and it definitely felt believable that they could all become friends, in that they are united due to their mutant abilities and mutual PTSD. Unfortunately, Boone does struggle to properly build tension and implement action into the story. Scenes that were clearly intended to be frightening didn't feel as impactful as they should have been, sometimes bordering on laughable, and the action scenes were overloaded with CGI, to the point where they hardly looked natural. That's not to say previous X-Men films didn't have their fair share of superfluous CGI or scenes that failed to illicit the appropriate emotions, but they at least had a kind of balance between that and the character traits whereas this film does not. This bothered me as it felt like a missed opportunity to do something creative with the ways in which the mutants showcase their powers at the most important times instead of just being saved for the climax of the film.Each of the five main actors gave solid performances, with Blu Hunt and Maisie Williams being the standouts as Dani and Rahne, respectively. I enjoyed their interactions and friendly bond that the two of them had with each other and it was nice to see them work together whenever they needed to. Anya Taylor-Joy was also fun to watch as Illyana, even if her Russian accent was slightly inconsistent at times. However, the two male actors, Charlie Heaton and Henry Zaga, didn't receive the screen time that they deserved. Aside from some scenes involving their tragic pasts, they felt somewhat shafted aside to make room for the other three mutants' backstories, which is a shame because it would have been nice to have all five of them with an evenly distributed amount of importance in the story, and this could have made for a more exciting conclusion.In the end, even though it could have been a whole lot worse considering the frequent release delays and production troubles it has experienced, The New Mutants should still provide some fleeting enjoyment to hardcore fans of the X-Men series before new circumstances come into play. It neither takes away anything major from the lore it has created over the years but it doesn't add anything hugely important to the series canon either. At this point, one can only wonder what direction the franchise will go in as a result of the Disney-Fox merger. All of the potential is definitely there, so let's cross our fingers and hope for the best.I rate it 6/10"}, {"id": 906, "text": "The New Mutants is decent new X-Men chapter.The characters are kind of boring.The movie is kind of boring until toward the end.It has been touted as being scary, but there is nothing scary about this movie. It's just another mutant (X-Men) movie about young mutants.The picture quality looks great thanks to the 8K digital camera that was used to capture this movie.The Atmos sound effects are nothing worth talking about, but the bass toward the beginning of the movie is absolutely awesome.Overall, this movie is a bad movie. It's a decent movie, and I think it is worth watching."}, {"id": 907, "text": "She's back.It's no secret that for all eight seasons of Game of Thrones, Arya Stark was my favorite character. I even talked myself into believing that the character played by the elfin Maisie Williams; smart, pure of heart and mission, and capable of making an ally of anyone; was not only deserving of ruling Westeros, but might actually pull it off. When Arya sailed-off into the unknown lands, I knew she would be the only character I would miss.Well the spirit of Arya Stark lives on as the heart of the teen group that premiers today as The New Mutants, and Maisie Williams acts the hell out of the role. From beginning to the end of the movie, she anchors this disparate, desperate group, wrangling (and occasionally wriggling) her way through the broken souls and bitter angst that, as usual for a Marvel Universe film, typifies the will-be heroes.Not that Maisie Williams' Rahne Sinclair is the only character that rises to the occasion. In fact it is Anya Taylor-Joy's unfortunately named Illyana Rasputin who finally drags a movie that takes too long to get started, into the promised Land of Heroics. For most of the film Illyana is so unpleasant, that it becomes almost predictable the trajectory her character will eventually follow. But for a few minutes The New Mutants allows her to do it so well, that she creates a reason for this franchise to exist.The rest of the mutants are so bland and ambiguous that they become little more than plot devices, including Blu Hunt as Danielle Moonstar, the ostensible central character in the story. Bleh! Her character is nothing more than this crew's Jean Grey--most powerful, TOO powerful, blahblahblah. Ultimately she becomes the focal point for the emergence of the love-struck Rahne (Maisie Williams) and the indomitable Illyana as THE new mutants.I want to rate it higher, but I can honestly only give The New Mutants six stars. As I say, it takes too long getting rocking, and only sustains its energy for about 15 minutes. But that's enough to see that this team can be a franchise in the Marvel Movie Universe, if they can write stories that focus on two very strong characters, portrayed by two very strong actresses."}, {"id": 908, "text": "I never read the New Mutant comics or knew anything about the characters. Just read some of the reviews so I was not expecting much from this movie. However, it seemed to interest me enough to go check it out. The beginning leaves you open to interpretation as the opening sequence of events has you wondering what the heck is going on, and who is this girl, Dani(Blu Hunt). She ends up waking up handcuffed to her bed in some sort of medical facility. Freaking out, she is visited by the Doctor on staff, played OK by Alice Braga. Soon she meets the others who are detained at the hospital, which looks like a mental institution straight out of the 1970's. The cast of characters playing the other New Mutants are good to very good, especially Rahne(Maise Williams) and Illyana Rasputin(Anya Taylor-Joy). The Kentucky guy, Sam, played by Charlie Heaton is pretty good also. So maybe the first half of the movie is all of the characters interacting and developing relationships together, good and bad. I was OK with the character development, it was pleasantly interesting. They eventually find some common ground that they're all being held against their will, and not entirely sure what the hell for.. The situation escalates from there and proceeds to get more intense. A few things I thought were cool was the psychic monitoring and the psychological manifestations becoming physical, which I suppose is where the horror aspect of the movie would play in. But other than that, not too much horror, but a little bit of deep supernatural stuff going on. Not really too deep though, as I would tend to find this movie geared for more of a 12-16 years of age audience. But, I did find it entertaining, slightly above average, despite a few flaws with some predictable and bland dialogue, but the strength of 3 or 4 of the characters helped it along. So not knowing anything about the New Mutants, I thought it was pretty good.. maybe you just need to approach it with little to no expectations.."}, {"id": 909, "text": "The New Mutants was supposed to be released on April 2018, this movie is part of the Fox/X-Men franchise, so everything in the storyline belongs to that timeline and it is connected to the latest X-Men movies - specially X-Men Apocalypse, X-Men Days of Future Past, and Dark Phoenix. The movie itself is great for the X-men fans who (like me) were so excited about Fox finally exploring the story of the new mutants, the ones that are not yet part of the X-men team, the rebels and the ones who were experimented on by other main Villain. I found this movie a little slow sometimes, and the dialogues are sometimes predictable. Maybe that's because the movie suffered so many changes when it was rescheduled, then when the Disney/Fox deal happened, they cancelled the movie. Disney decided then to release it on 2020 but the ending was changed so the movie wouldn't be the first of a trilogy as originally planned.I recommend this movie ONLY if you are an X-men fan, or even if you just want to really see the last piece of the Fox/X-men franchise before we get to see the new version of the entire X-men universe which now belongs to Marvel.I give it 7 stars out of 10!"}, {"id": 910, "text": "This movie was on my watch list for a long time. When I finally had a chance to see it, I was concerned about the low rating (5.3 from 24,223) and the many negative reviews.This is far from a great film but it also isn't atrocious. My rating is a 6-7; here's why:The entire cast is comprised of just 6 actors. Only 6. The setting is a single enclosed building. I have just described a low-budget set up. I shouldn't have but this is what this film clearly is for some odd reason.The budget (according to online sources) was between 67 to 80 million dollars. That's right. Where did the money go? Clearly it wasn't spent on hiring more cast, improving the script, location shooting or anything else that defines a big-ticket blockbuster.I love the X-men franchise. It is far and away my favorite superhero film franchise. I'm very angry that someone (or a few someones) abused this franchise to the tune of 70-80 million dollars. They got the money and then skimped on everything: starting from the script and ending with the director.It's hard to make an epic film when the setting is a single building and the cast totals just 6. I can only review what I see in front of me - not my expectations of what I think it should be. I can only review and rate this film based on the fact that only a small portion of the budget was actually used for the film in any real sense.As a low-budget x-men entry: this film truly delivers. Great acting, fantastic special effects, and above average story. As a low-budget film there are some obvious holes: like Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga) working 7 days/week, 24 hours/day to oversee 5 mutant teens in a huge building (when a few more nefarious super-powered staff would have delivered a much better story).Even as a low-budget film, the film's main failure was the unlikability of the teens. Rasputin (played excellently by Anya Taylor-Joy) and da Costa (very convincingly by Henry Zaga) were so unlikable (for most of the film) that the characters infected the entire mood of the film. Likable characters like Moonstar, Guthrie and Sinclair (and even Dr. Reyes) were unable to truly deliver these traits because of how the two teens were written.A couple more nefarious staff to aid Dr. Reyes would have made these two teens seem less obnoxious (but that was apparently too expensive or too complicated of a rewrite).I cannot, in good conscience, rate this as I would an expensive blockbuster. The money wasn't there. We'll never know where it went. I can only rate this as a low-budget entry into the x-men franchise. As such, it's a 6-7 low-budget effort."}, {"id": 911, "text": "I honestly dont think this was that bad. I liked the tone and premise and felt it had good action. A couple of moments where the green screen looked obvious, and I think the design of the smiley men could have been better.

I did like enjoy some of the easter eggs and foreshadowings (like the Buffy episodes in the background).Acting for the most part was good. Although Charlie Heaton's southern accent did sound hokey at times. I think I liked Maisie Williams the best. I did also like Ilyana (Anya Taylor-Joy). I thought she was a very interesting character. There was one part where her characterization felt abrupt. Going from hating/being accusatory etc to the next scene being a 180. And I felt like/kind of hoped that the film would provide more of a backstory to her (as again, I think she was the most interesting) but overall it was still entertaining.Yeah, it definitely wasnt the best movie ever. And for a film that had been delayed several times it could have used the time to improve on. But it was a still a solid film. The film still manages to be dark for being PG 13. I can see this being a fun Halloween film come next October."}, {"id": 912, "text": "I finally saw this film yesterday after much delay. The film was originally shot some years ago and was scheduled for some reshoots to make it scarier as they were hoping for it to be more firmly in the horror genre. The reshoots were delayed due to some scheduling problems with the young actors and then with the acquisition of FOX by Disney all further work was suspended. The reshoots never came to pass and the film was scheduled for release 'as is' which was also pushed back due to the pandemic. Anyways here we are with the final X-Men Universe film made by FOX before Disney reboots the property into the MCU.The X-Universe is my favourite of all the interconnected super hero movie series by quite a lot despite it not being as careful with continuity between the films. This however is most definitely one of the weaker ones and ts strange production history is surely a factor. That said it is passable entertainment and had some great ideas and concepts going that were not quite presented to their fullest.This smaller budget film with a small cast focuses on 5 young mutants being kept in a hospital to seemingly help them control their powers. It was written and began filming before Disney was in serious talks to buy FOX so was furthering the set up that they had started in X-Men: Apocalypse of bringing the next big villain from the comic books, Mr. Sinister. There are still traces of that connection and connections to Logan in the film but the post credit stinger with Mr. Sinister was removed as there is no point with the FOX era coming to an end.The first hour of the film is pretty ponderous and slow going, I would say it even feels padded. Perhaps the reshoots (which are often standard and built into the original budget) would have fixed this a little, The last half hour ramps up a bit and has some cool stuff in it. The cast do an okay enough job too but the film has a feeling of emptiness for the most part. When the final scene comes it feels like The New Mutants are truly set up to make a good sequel but as that is not coming all it says is that's all folks!"}, {"id": 913, "text": "I'm not much into all those superhero movies that have flooded the market and the only live-action film of the X-Men franchise that I even recall watching is The Wolverine because it took place in Japan and this country's culture has always intrigued me. I decided to watch The New Mutants because there aren't too many movies shown at local cinemas during the pandemic but I simply wanted to enjoy a film on the big screen once more before another lockdown. The New Mutants came as a pleasant surprise to me and might even inspire me to explore more films of the franchise in the future.This film revolves around teenage girl Danielle Moonstar whose Indian reservation gets destroyed during a terrible snowstorm in the summer. She is saved from her burning house at night by her father who dies under mysterious circumstances soon after. Danielle Moonstar loses consciousness and awakes in an isolated psychiatric hospital where she is welcomed by a seemingly empathic woman who presents herself as Doctor Reyes. The young woman explains to her new patient that she has a hidden power inside of her that she needs to discover and control to find out what happened on that fateful night and to move on in the future without being and danger for herself and others. Danielle soon meets four other teenage patients. She slowly falls in love with Rahne who prevents her from committing suicide. On the other side, she clashes with rebellious Illyana who only opens up to her stuffed dragon. The two teenage boys in the mysterious institution are Brazilian womanizer Roberto and shy American miner's son Sam. The quintet is regularly observed, interrogated and examined by Doctor Reyes and unable to leave the isolated institution. The five teenagers soon discover, develop and control their hidden powers but Danielle's power seems to be uncontrollable and soon starts to impact herself and those around her. Things start to take a sinister turn when the organization behind the institution decides to intervene to control Danielle's power.The New Mutants has convinced me on numerous levels. First of all, the five teenage characters are quite diversified, dynamic and intriguing. They complement one another very well and have excellent chemistry. Depending on your preferences, you will end up rooting for your favourite character since all five teenagers are quite different and present divergent strengths, powers and flaws. My favourite character was indeed lead character Danielle Moonstar as a resilient, intelligent and empathic girl with an interesting cultural background. Doctor Reyes as unpredictable doctor is also a truly intriguing character. The acting performances are great and especially the actresses are very convincing. Blu Hunt incarnates the girl next door authentically, Maisie Williams convinces as shy girl from a religious family who is slowly finding her own identity, Anya Taylor-Joy has much charisma and plays the traumatized rebel so authentically that one gets the impression that she is simply being herself and Alice Braga shines as mysterious doctor whose different facets only emerge in the film's final third. The movie oozes with atmosphere thanks to excellent light techniques, gloomy locations and ominous soundtrack. The film has a claustrophobic vibe that increases tension as the film progresses. The movie fluidly combines teenage drama with dynamic fantasy vibes and menacing thriller elements. Despite offering room for a sequel, the film appropriately ends at a point when the development of the characters has reached its peek and the main story has concluded. There is no question that the excellent finale invites viewers to watch one or more potential sequels.The reason why most people despised the movie is because they expected an overwhelming fantasy spectacle with intense action passages, relentless fight scenes and impressive visual effects. This movie however focuses on gloomy atmosphere, character development and detailed plot. Only the final thirty minutes quicken up the pace and offer the fight scenes most people expect from superhero movies. The fact that this film walks off the beaten path is what appealed so much to me in the first place since most superhero movies have become uninspired, repetitive and predictable.If you are interested in watching a superhero movie that doesn't rely too much on special effects but focuses on sinister atmosphere, profound character development and clever plot, then you will certainly appreciate The New Mutants. The movie also has an empowering message to find your identity and stand by it no matter what. The fact that the lead actress discovers and embraces her homosexuality is certainly on the pulse of time. The idea to include Native American tales in this movie is also a welcome change. The New Mutants is a superhero movie that doesn't feel dated but on the pulse of time and that's why this film will certainly strike a chord with many teenagers and young adults these days. Ignore the harsh negative critics and enjoy this excellent film on the big screen while you still can."}, {"id": 914, "text": "As a fan of the X-man universe I placed this movie on my must see list for 2020.

You have a group of gifted children being recruited. They're being tested. One assumes it is Dr. Moira MacTaggert who is doing the tests but that is shown to be false.

The character is supposed to be biracial. Why take this away from a character. I have the same issue casting Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie or Idris Elba as Heimdall. These are of Norwegian origin.

Without spoiling it, graphically to certain people it can be a horror, but it's more of a psychologic horror in my opinion.The story is different from the X-Men franchise, but it introduces new characters and it's a nice change from the X-Men. Well thought out with a balancing storyline, alluring with exciting moments, sometimes jumpy, enjoyable and a strong character build.The New Mutants released date kept changing, as someone who waited for this to be released, I'm happy how it turned out in the end.

You'll see what I mean. I expected this movie to be similar to Brightburn, and It had the potential to be as good, but fell short. For me Anya Taylor-Joy stole every scene she was in, and the other young actors also gave solid performances, but something was just missing... The horror aspect was sophomoric and probably won't impress veterans of the genre, and it rations out the mutant abilities at a snail's pace compared to other Marvel hero movies. When all the character building and exposition finally gives way to action, you've almost forgotten what type of film you were expecting, and then you are flooded with a heavily CGI dependent final scene that ties things up quickly...

The 39 metacritic score for this movie is waaaaaaay too harsh..Let's be honest, The New Mutants (TNM) lacks on a few fronts; the story brings nothing special or at least interesting to further expand or reflect on, the characters motivations and backstories are lacking or rushed, the acting and lines are often cringeworthy and last but not least; where's the horror? Just to name a few things that could made me understand the 39 metascore, BUT.TNM still somehow achieves to be a very entertaining movie! It's very cool to finally see a marvel movie trying to touch ground with the horror genre (even though it's not scary or gory at all). And the comic character 'Magik' is an amazing addition to the story (she could easily function in a standalone movie). There are some surprises here and there and the cgi is pretty good too.The movie had a constant flow between the positive and negative things mentioned above. Therefore resulted in me giving this movie a 6. Don't expect a classical X-men like movie; just go in open minded and you'll have a great time!"}, {"id": 919, "text": "Alright, well I didn't even know that they made a new movie set in Marvel's X-Men universe, so I thought that this was just another random mutant movie. Not that I am overly thrilled about superhero movies in any way, so maybe that is why I wasn't aware of this movie's existence.And as it dawned on me that it was a Marvel movie, I must say that while the promise of a good movies grew bigger, I can't really claim that it was something that had me thrilled or excited.I will say that The New Mutants didn't feel like a movie with any heavy ties to the X-Men as such. Sure, there were some references, but this 2020 movie felt very much like a stand-alone movie just lightly set within the same universe. And I think that is an aspect that will part the water; either you enjoy that or find it a nuisance. Personally, I enjoyed that part of the movie.Writers Josh Boone and Knate Lee actually managed to put together a wholesome story that proved to be entertaining and enjoyable, without the glitter and glamour of Xavier and superheroes in skintight outfits. And the fact that there wasn't an all-powerful nemesis to battle and no determined heroes is what worked well in favor of the movie for me.Visually then The New Mutants was quite the treat, as it was pure eye-candy when the CGI team unfolded their talents and brought the creatures and powers to life on the screen.The characters in The New Mutants were, for the most parts, actually enjoyable and interesting, and they had put together a good cast ensemble to bring the characters to life on the screen.One thing that didn't sit well with me was the fact that the movie just had to have a lesbian love story angle to it. Of course it did, as the sexism wave hangs heavily over Hollywood, and every director has to be politically correct and include gays, lesbians or transgenders in every movie. Don't get me wrong, as I have nothing against such people or such sexual preferences, but it constantly being painted out on the screen in new movies is just wearing thin and leaves you with a sense of 'what is wrong with being heterosexual these days?'I found The New Mutants to be an enjoyable movie and, for me, the fact that it didn't have that generic X-Men vibe to it.My rating of director Josh Boone's 2020 movie lands on a six out of ten stars."}, {"id": 920, "text": "The movie got delayed a lot of times. Actually before this was released now, there was another rumor of another delay. During pandemic/Corona times, it would at least have an excuse. But the sheer endless wait had an end. And while I guess this might have either heightened your expectations or lowered them, the movie will probably land somewhere in the middle. I could not tell if or what was reshot, even if some characters look generally older than the age they are supposed to be playing.Having said all that, this is the last X-Men movie that was made under the independent Fox logo. Disney bought Fox and therefor now holds the rights to their franchises. Which has good and bad sides to it. Disney can make and include even more Marvel characters in the MCU now. But it will also be more family friendly which takes away some of the edge some things may have had. Not X Men though, they were always on the PG13 side of things. So while this has some horror elements to it, it still isn't near an R-rating. If that matters to you.Surprising is that they took so much time and the end product is not really ... well it doesn't seem like that exceptional or worthy to be delayed. On the other hand it is not as bad as some made it to be on the day of the release, but I understand the anger or at least frustration. It's decent overall and entertaining, if you lower your expectations"}, {"id": 921, "text": "This was a movie that I remember something close to 2 years ago seeing the trailer for it and was interested in seeing it. Growing up I was into comics and I knew this fell into the X-Men line. I didn't know much about it, aside from the fact that this was going to be a superhero film that bleeds over into the horror genre. I've finally seen it now as a 2020 horror film when I had a free afternoon when it was out. The synopsis is five young mutants, just discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will, fight to escape their past sins and save themselves.We start this film with Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) being woke up by her father, played by Adam Beach. They flee out into the night as it is snowing, but we see fire raining down on them. He tells her to hide in a tree as he has to go back to help the others. She then sees him flung by something, dead. She runs into the night.Dani then wakes up in a hospital bed. In the vents she sees a face that disappears. She finds she is handcuffed to it and pulls her bed to the window. She doesn't understand where she is and then pulls her bed to the door. It is locked and she pounds on it. The voice of Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga) tells her to calm down and she will come explain what has happened.It appears that the event she saw was from an F-5 tornado. She is the only survivor of her tribe. She was saved and it appears she is a mutant. Dr. Reyes asks if she knows what that means and Dani seems to. The X-Men and their adversaries seem to be common knowledge. This teen is here as it is a hospital to figure out what her power is and once she is ready, she can leave to go to a school to develop and hone that ability. That is if she wants to.Dani then gets introduces to the others that are here. There is Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams) who seems to be from Scotland. She has the ability to change into a wolf and goes by the codename Wolvesbane. There is Illyana Rasputin (Anya Taylor-Joy). She is from Russia and has a hand puppet that is a dragon. From what we will learn, she's the most powerful one here, but also has the most deep-seeded issues. There is Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton) who can discharge energy to fly and he's from the southern United States. Then finally there is Roberto da Costa (Henry Zaga). He is a rich teen from Brazil that won't reveal to the others what his power is. It seemed to have led to a traumatic event that landed him here, partially at his parent's wishes.None of this group really wants to share anything. Illyana immediately is mean to Dani while Rahne takes a liking to her. She tries to show her that things here aren't that bad. That is until something happens in the night, while they sleep. They start have to face their past demons that might be a bit too real. Dani needs to figure out what her power is before it is too late. Dr. Reyes might not be who she says she is and might not be working for who these teens think either.Now to delve a bit more into what I stated earlier, I was really into comics back when I was a kid. Marvel was more of my jam and I really liked Spider-man. That's not to say that I didn't have a few here and there of the X-Men, Venom, The Fantastic Four and others to just name some of them. I bring this up as I recognize some of the more important ones and few of the lesser ones. The New Mutants did not fall into my realm of knowledge.When I heard they were going to combine this with a horror film, I was really intrigued as I've been a fan of this genre since I was child as well. I tried to temper my expectations as this really had some development issues. It appears that they were going to allow the co-writer/director Josh Boone to make the film he wanted with more horror elements. It appears he may have made it and then the studio decided to change things. They then decided that wasn't going to work after some sales when through and it just kept getting its release date and then moved.The reason I bring this up was that this movie doesn't feel like it knows exactly what it wants to do. It feels like a superhero movie with some horror elements, but it doesn't necessarily lean into either enough to really be good in my opinion. The movie is also a bit too predictable as well.That's not to say that I didn't like some of what they were doing here. Dani tells a story from her people, as she is from the Cheyenne tribe of Native Americans, about there being a demon bear. Everyone has this with them as a child and if you let it feed on your fears, it will consume you. From this moment, I knew that her mutant power is to show people their fears. I'm sorry if this is a spoiler, but we learn this like 15 minutes in if you're paying attention. I did like seeing what each of these people's fears are as some of them are quite dark to be honest. I really wish they could have made their movie as this would have been better to be honest.Since they don't really go far enough, the movie as I said is just predictable and it made it boring as well. They also introduce the idea of this Essex Corporation. From trivia I read, this was planned to be a trilogy that would give us more about this group and their leader. This is like dark X-Men and the movies would get progressively darker. I'm not sure what they'll do now though since I have a feeling this isn't going to do as well.That's not to say that the acting is bad in this movie though, as I believe it to be the strongest part. Williams is solid here and I'm impressed she could hold her accent as well as she did. I like the development we get of her character and the tragic back-story she has. It deals with her religion and the darker aspects of it as she is branded a witch. Taylor-Joy is really good as well. She is harboring probably the darkest secret of all. She acts out and it is really hard to blame her the more that we learn. Her power is the strongest and it makes sense with what she endured. Heaton is solid along with Zaga and Braga. Hunt is good as well. For her being our lead, I really feel like she takes a bit of a backseat which is odd. I'd say the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed in their minor roles.The last thing to go over would be probably one of things most people worry about, the special effects. This movie doesn't lean as heavy into the CGI as I was expecting it to. What we got was good. From Rahne being part wolf, which I'm assuming is part practical and part CGI was fine. Illyana's was probably the most difficult and I thought it was solid. Sam and Roberto's didn't bother me. The big bad at the end really impressed me too. The only other thing would be that of the Smiling Man (Dustin Ceithamer). I'd be willing to watch a movie about Illyana dealing with that for how dark I think that story would be. The movie was shot fine aside from that, I had no issues.Now with that said, it is a shame that this movie couldn't be made how Boone wanted it as I feel what we got falls short. There are some really good ideas here that don't get fleshed out enough so the movie feels like a superhero movie that doesn't know if it wants to be that or a horror movie. The acting though is really good across the board as were the effects. It does end up being boring for the reasons that I stated above though unfortunately. I just wanted more as I feel if we got it, there other two planned films might have happened. I would rate this as just over average in my opinion."}, {"id": 922, "text": "A movie about five new young mutants, who are discovering their powers and by lots of trial and error in the end learn to use them: you would think that this means a spectacular and high-paced movie chock-full of adrenaline and action. So it's almost a miracle that the makers succeeded in giving for more than an hour the exact opposite. The first hour is completely filled with endless recounting of all the sob-stories of the kid's various childhoods. I mean, I understand that some background is needed, but this is way over the top and downright soporific.It didn't really help that everyone acts heavily depressed, and the only adult around behaves and talks like a sleepwalking zombie on valium. Add to this the totally uninspiring and grey setting, and the almost total lack of any humor. And to top this, there was this almost insulting lack of logic. We are made to believe that 5 potentially dangerous and super-powered rebellious youngsters have to be kept prisoner and guarded in an enormous facility, and then they appoint just one single frail woman for this responsible job?!? Who apparently for ever has 24/7 duties and predictably falls asleep over her control panel at the most crucial moments?! Why didn't the makers throw in some scary wardens or armed guards or ferocious watch-dogs to at least liven up the story a little?Anyway, just when I started to slowly slide off my chair into a welcome sleep, the last 25 minutes came up and I have to be honest: suddenly the action kicked-in, the pace was upgraded to the highest gear and together with great special effects and CGI at last we got where we had come for in the first place: a spectacular super-hero climax.The acting? Maisie Williams reasonably played a depressed teen, but stayed way under her GoT-level. Charlie Heaton was equally adequate but I kept being distracted by the mid-west drawl they forced on his character. Anya-Taylor Joy played the only character that had some spirit, but it almost got a caricature (and why on earth this thick fake Russian accent?!). Blu Hunt did the best job, but she had the advantage that her part was the most important and interesting. A nice LGBT-touch by the way that her character and that of Williams got a crush on each other, very casually pictured, kudos for that! Oh, and I personally regretted that Henry Zaga's character didn't got more screen-time, he's extremely attractive with and without his shirt on, and I got the impression that he's got real acting-potential."}, {"id": 923, "text": "I'm sitting here in the cinema, the films just finished and I'm thinking 'I want more!' More in this extended universe, more about these characters and more about their powers. Especially Anya Taylor-Joy's character.It is easy to see the why the producers and critics said this film went through 'Development Hell' within the time between the original and final product. At times the script falls flat, the 2nd act drags on almost to the point of being boring and the screen just goes black in the middle of a scene obviously to cut a possible plot point due to the unlikely possibility of a sequel. Which was a huge shame.But overlooking the films short comings, the final act does come together in a way that I believe does tie a bow in the film and personally, I would love to see more come from this.I know it's unlikely but I would really love to see more from this film in an extended universe film series of go the way of the MCU and give it an MCU TV series.It is easy to see that there is so much potential with its characters and story and you can see the film wants to be something more.I would say it's the perfect example of company executives thinking they know what their fans want. Sadly we've seen the same from none other than 'Justice League'. Which also went through expensive reshoots and cuts when Zach Snyder left the scene and Joss Weadon joined.All in all though, as I said before, I can see the film wants to be more and I want more!"}, {"id": 924, "text": "Tone, Script &amp; Story: Mutants are bought into a facility to teach them control their powers.In Indian mythology there is a saying 'Shani ki drusti se khud shani nahi bach paaye' meaning Lord Shani could not pardon himself from his fierceness.

She doesn't remember how she got their and the doctor says that you are here to protect you from yourself. She and a couple of other mutants are in this facility.

Their backstories aren't the most unique but still intriguing The movie does start off pretty slow but once the second half the movie starts it gets pretty interesting. The acting here is really good. The sequences of the horror are handled well. Fox actually wanted a young adult film and Josh boom wanted a horror movie. We cannot blame the director for the turnout of this movie since the overall movie is pretty goodThis movie gets a 8 out of ten.

The last X-Men movie before they're introduced into the MCU became one of the most delayed films ever, but it finally got released this week. Shot in 2017 with an original release date of April 2018, Josh Boone had reshoots planned, which postponed the movie for the first time. Disney began negotiations to merge with 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), keeping the film in a limbo state. A global pandemic emerged, pushing the movie even further. Final outcome: a worldwide limited release three years after finishing shooting, and without any reshoots. So, obviously, my expectations were pretty low...Surprise, surprise, The New Mutants isn't a horrible mess, it's... fine! I feel really sorry that so many people worked on this film and had to wait so long to see it being released to the world. I love how it's far from being just another generic, formulaic superhero flick. Sure, it has tons of cliches, and it does still feel like an X-Men movie at times, but I'll get there. I genuinely appreciate that Boone and Knate Lee wrote a narrative packed with significant and detailed character development, including a compelling romantic arc. Every young mutant gets their own story explained front-center. Each time the film dives into a character's past, it never feels like an irrelevant subplot. It all serves a purpose.The technical crew had a very low budget to work with compared to other movies in the genre, so I must praise them for transforming a small, one-location film into something surprisingly entertaining. The visual effects definitely don't have that quality that viewers are used to seeing now, but they're reasonably okay for the most part. The horror atmosphere is definitely present, but it feels like the movie could have benefited from a more assertive, bolder approach to these nightmarish sequences. The best aspect of the whole film is related to the indisputably talented cast, with just one exception...From Anya-Taylor Joy's rebel behavior to Charlie Heaton's experienced performance, passing through Maisie Williams' emotional display and Henry Zaga's charming one-liners, every one of these actors proves why they were cast in such a well-known franchise. Despite the ridiculously flawed accents, all share great chemistry between each other, including debutant Blu Hunt. However, the latter fails to be a compelling protagonist clearly due to her inexperience. I don't want to be too harsh on her because I did see some great moments when she shared the screen with her colleagues. However, I do need to state that every scene where she acts alone or against a green screen reaches cringe-worthy levels of bad acting.Boone and/or the casting crew must also take responsibility for choosing her as the main character, but honestly, she's not even my main issue. That has to do with her own character. While she gets the same focus as her fellow mutants when it comes to her backstory, she never really has to deal with her powers' consequences. Some mutants hurt or killed people, and they're unquestionably damaged because of it. Dani doesn't have a single moment where she feels sorry for whatever happened in her past or where she's confronted with it. It's quite hard to connect with a protagonist when both the character and the actress playing her lack that captivating personality.Finally, Alice Braga, as the doctor, is probably the most formulaic component of the movie. From the first conversation she has with the mutants, any viewer can guess where the story is going. Braga is good as Dr. Cecilia Reyes, but coincidentally or not, her character is the only one whose backstory wasn't remotely explored. Reyes' motivations and what lies beyond the hospital raise intriguing questions that, unfortunately, never get answered. Maybe the supposed reshoots could have solved some of these issues, perhaps they could have added some more. I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that The New Mutants is far from being an awful mess.All in all, Josh Boone and Knate Lee deliver a reasonably entertaining screenplay out of the generic zone of the superhero genre, packed with detailed character development and decent horror sequences, especially having in mind the low budget. The New Mutants features a marvelous cast, where everyone shares tremendous chemistry with each other. All actors deliver great performances, except for the debutant Blu Hunt who unfortunately lets her inexperience overcome her evident potential. Contrasting with the overall character treatment, Dani Moonstar fails to be a compelling protagonist since she's barely shown having to deal with the emotional consequences of her powers like every other mutant does. Despite the refreshing take on the overall story, there are still a few cliches and formulaic components throughout the film, especially related to the hospital. Overall, it's surprisingly okay considering the numerous production issues, so I definitely recommend it at least just to say goodbye to the last X-Men installment pre-MCU.Rating: B-"}, {"id": 927, "text": "Much has been written about the road to release that this poor film went through.

But in the end forging strong relationships out of trauma is the essence of what the original story and this film are about. Young actors often lack the skill to carry off the challenge of translating emotions into performance. That's true here to some extent, but I believe the main fault with this film lies elsewhere.The biggest failure of the film is in the production design of molly Hughes. She needed to better understand the visual style of New Mutants that made it a success, in particular the genius of Bill Sienkiewicz. While McLeod was the original artist, his drawing was workmanlike with a solid but nondescript superhero style and he quit the title soon after launch. It was Sienkiewicz who brought the magazine to life, drove home the substance of Claremont's writing, and made it more than an also-ran mutant spinoff. Had Hughs, or more likely a different designer entirely, aimed for the bleachers with Sienkiewicz-inspired visuals instead of playing it safe with a moody haunted house theme, then the whole film would have been elevated to the level we now expect from Marvel.

A completely new and different story of mutants that follows the first two series of X-Men movies, where after the old mutants, a few appear from time to time who gradually discover their powers.

Although in the strong elements it has good effects and goes in a dark style / thriller, which could lead to a nice horror movie (especially with the crooked man-like eyeless figures the tall with creepy long teeth and fingers) unfortunately it does not give so much weight to everyone's strengths but it gets boring of trying to delve very slowly into everyone's character and story.

Nothing about this movie has anything to do with the comic book and it comes across as a really cheap and disposable effort.

The group did not entirely get the therapy they needed, but together, they can conquer their inner demons.It's a nice message of togetherness, but sadly, the group are each given just enough backstory (comprised of their worst memories/fears) and that's mostly it, with little else. The women of the group fare better than the men, in terms of development, but that's both a praise and a complaint. I wish the group had been given equal amounts of personality development. But suffice to say: the one you expect to be the standout character absolutely *is* that standout character. But she is No One.The other reviews that mention fluctuating accents and plot holes... Well, to be fair, I noticed some of that here and there (for instance, why is the rich kid the only one shown doing manual labor?) but not enough to bother me.Still, its a breezy 94 minutes. Time you won't regret, you'll possibly want more by the end, and that's fair praise for any movie."}, {"id": 934, "text": "The premise is definitely interesting. This new take on how hard and terrible it can be to come into mutant powers. You can almost understand the need for containment, for the protection of both the mutants and the rest of the people. Then, there is the also interesting premise that there is always someone ready to take advantage of a crisis.This is a movie that could have stood on those two legs alone and be great. But they blew it. No character development, no cohesion, bad acting with a couple of exceptions. Bad script and bad direction.Why a 7/10 then you ask ? Because I love the premise. I don't want to let it fade into oblivion. I believe that it can be picked up for a great series. Just the premise. Casting was all wrong except for Illyana and maybe Dr Reyes.Let just the movie fade into deserved oblivion, but keep the premise. Its fresh and interesting."}, {"id": 935, "text": "Josh Boone.... really don't care for his work on this at all. Had to have the 'teenage' girls in a couple (unseen to audiences) nude scenes where the cameras and studio people got to see them naked and make it sexual in several parts and comments. What a crappy writer etc. Everything doesn't have to be sexual. We all know what goes on in real life with many camera angles and easily hidden cameras and getting young Hollywood girls in positions to get nude for the not revealed scenes 'to the audience', but do you really have to do it to our favorite comics and especially a teen comic? Did it really have to have shower scenes and young teens getting hot and turned on by each other? Yeah real life has it, but a teen comic movie, really? Rahne and Dani especially, their connection in the comic wasn't sexual, it could be like sisters or best close friends with deep shared personal experiences and connection that way. It was a really cool teen Marvel comic, my favorite, in fact, and this just cheapened it. Too bad, really. With a different writer etc this may have been really good. Also, such a over used generic message to close it out too.. who hasn't heard that, over used a hundred hundred times.. bear, dog whatever. It was like it was written for 5 year-olds. The special fx were good, but too limited. They didn't do an end scene or after credit scene because they knew it wasn't done very well &amp; wouldn't be well liked ( not just covid and delays). Too bad Stan wasn't here to make this movie better. Too bad The Avengers Iron Man Cap etc writers and producers weren't here to help. I am still a true New Mutants fan and liked most of the actors so I gave them a 6, but the movie just fell far short. Maisie was not bad in her part as some wrote, the characters scenes just weren't written well and the directing and producing followed suit. There was a little bad acting at times, but it was mostly the script producing and directing for sure."}, {"id": 936, "text": "Ah the Marvel movie that could almost never get released which deals w/five mutants holed up in a psychotropic wellness clinic under the supervision of a mysterious handler. I won't get into the minutia of how this film was made a couple of years ago &amp; then reshoots (or non reshoots) &amp; its studio being bought out by Disney hindered its release but the film was finally dumped onto theaters just as businesses were slowly starting to opening due to the Co-vid crisis. Is it a train wreck or merely a fender bender? What is essentially The Breakfast Club goes to hell (thanks to the Double Toasted guys for that comparison) finds mutants trying to get better in this mysteriously sparsely populated facility led by a sole doctor (Alice Braga from the Queen of the South TV series). Things seem to be on the mend for the kids interred here but then a new arrival (who has not manifested her powers yet) sets into a motion a series of ever increasingly realistic scares (each inmate's past traumatic faux pas comes back to haunt them in vivid set pieces) setting them all on edge where a big reveal soon is something they'll have to deal with. Doing what it can within the confines of a PG-13 mild scarefest, the film does okay w/the minimal cast (Anya Taylor-Joy, Game of Thrones' Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton from Stranger Things, Henry Zaga &amp; Blu Hunt) &amp; claustrophobic locale but its insistence of being something it's quite not (imagine a hard R of this material) from a director w/the right pedigree, success may've been achieved. Definitely not the worst thing I've seen but a lot of potential was left on the table somewhere. There is some intimations that these are possibly the newly mutated kids from Logan (clips from that film are shown) &amp; the Essex Corporation (run by Mr. Sinister) is the company which runs this facility."}, {"id": 937, "text": "This film was the very mediocre end to the franchise that has been running for over 20 years. The CGI was stunning but that is what we have come to expect from these big budget comic-book movies. The setting was very eerie which lends itself to the roster of characters involved. The acting is entertaining especially from Maisie Williams as Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane and Blu Hunt as Danielle Moonstar / Mirage. Josh Boone does his best in the director's chair and the writing isn't terrible. However, this film was nowhere near perfect. As this was marketed as a horror picture, I was expecting big scares, but there were no scary parts, and it was very disappointing. The accent that Charlie Heaton has to use was incredibly grating and it really took away from his performance. The decision to skip over any backstory for Roberto Da Costa / Sunspot (Henry Zaga) led to the character having no real connection to the audience so it was difficult to get behind him and care about his role. In parts, the filmmakers hinted at some interesting plot threads (trying into 'Logan' and The Essex Corporation) but didn't act upon them so they felt like real missed opportunities. Having the 'Demon Bear' be the main antagonist didn't make real sense because it only had a connection to Danielle so lacked the attachment to the other protagonists. Some of the relationships between the titular characters were extremely forced especially between Rahne and Danille. Overall, it was very apparent that the movie had big studio interference which stopped Josh Boone from making the film he actually envisioned. Also, it was obvious that a sequel was originally on the cards which has now been canned. Finally, I now can't wait for Disney to reboot this franchise."}, {"id": 938, "text": "Some creative liberties have been taken with both the story and the characters, but for once i don't mind. for instance, they made my fave girl rahne more assertive, whereas i remember her as meek, shy and with as much killing intent as a bowl of wet grapes. still, even with that, she's the same kind and brave girl i adore so much.the horror aspect is derived not as much from the nightmarish creatures as the circumstances these kids find themselves in, being experimented on, manipulated and groomed for something they want nothing to do with, unable to escape.the movie also kept me interested by putting off the reveal of the exact nature of dani's powers. i couldn't for the life of me remember what was it she could do... yeah, she was never my favorite, what can i say.the romance was unexpected, but welcome. i usually hate romantic subplots in teenage movies, but this one was so sweet and innocent, and it hit very close to home for me. i'm actually surprised it made it past russian censors.some of the dialogue was cheesy, and the cgi was underwhelming, but i enjoyed watching this. hopefully i'll find the time to watch it again while it's still in theaters."}, {"id": 939, "text": "Dani(Hunt, reasonably promising newcomer, not ready to carry something this big, her role gradually forming an identity over the course of this, and sadly not quite compelling enough to get away with having little personality at the start, which is in part due to the script, as Split pulls this off) wakes up in in a creepy hospital, an old classic of a setting that this dusts off, only to not take much advantage of. She is told by Dr. Reyes(Braga, serviceable, as are other cast members, albeit some of whom mangle accents) that she's a mutant, whose powers have just manifested, and finds four others like her staying in the same institution. Soon after, their nightmares come to life and start hurting them(a very welcome deviation from other ghost stories and the like, where too frequently, the apparitions go boo, and that's it). What is actually going on? And how do they stop it, before it kills them all?At the risk of being as cliche as the film itself is in its worst moments, I wanted to love this. I do want to be clear that I'm not bitter about the disappointment. And this review will not be warped by that. I'm going to try to cover both the good and the bad, as I hugely disagree(though I do of course respecting their opinion on the matter) with anyone saying that it's entirely one, or, more frequently seen, the other. First off, how wild is it that it took 20 years of the film continuity before we saw the release(note that I did not say development) of an entry, that uses the X-Gene as a metaphor for puberty(which is part of how it originated in the comics, as those were the target audience), *and* that is so heavily focused on those going through it(instead of so many team members that are adults, for an emphasis on the allegory of minorities, which is extremely important, not that the two are mutually exclusive), and their angst? This is very much a teen movie(with the number of the tropes you'd expect from such) made for them, about them... and whilst it's not *by* them, clearly those behind the camera have a ton of sympathy and empathy for them. If I were to direct anyone to go for taking this in, it would be them. Either way, it's not worth risking Covid for. It seeks to emulate The Breakfast Club, and sometimes that really works. There's a clear passion for it and understanding of the material. However, unlike many other inspired heavily by someone else's work pictures(Sam Raimi got a lot of his visual style from the 1963 version of The Haunting, and while not everyone devoted to one of those will feel the same way about the other, I wholeheartedly encourage checking out both), here, I would honestly just say to go catch the original.Everything this does well, you've seen it done, at least a little bit, better elsewhere. The most you could say is that this is a very unique mix, and that if you're you're really into one or more of these, then this might scratch that itch. Before this, I didn't expect to see John Hughes mixed with Freddy Krueger. I admire that. Yet, I'm not sure I would say that they really gel. And the sense that these are five outcasts suffering detention, where ultimately the authority figure doesn't care that much about paying attention to what they're doing, goes against that we are explicitly told that the people in charge here, are well aware that these kids are potentially dangerous. On more than one occasion, the fact that they aren't always watched carefully(despite the omnipresent cameras...), leads to situations that could have gotten someone injured, badly. There are times where it's more luck than competence that prevents things from going horribly wrong. The scares are never all that effective, nor does this, at any point, even briefly, consistently maintain a sense of terror or suspense. I would personally chalk it up to a lack of experience on the (otherwise clearly talented) director(Josh Boone)'s part, rather than the often dreaded, and with good reason for horror, PG-13 rating. At the same time, this not being an R does take some of the bite out of most of the more potentially impactful material. Yes, by the end of this you have a very strong sense of each of these people you've been following are, still, there are better character studies out there. This suffers from a lack of focus. The lesbian romance is very sweet and I honestly have nothing negative to say about it. Outside of the the average at best climax, there is almost no action or tension in this, and the use of abilities is limited and not memorable. Knowing that this is unlikely to get a sequel(which, to be perfectly fair, it had great reason to expect to get, when it was initially in production) makes the small scale, and distinct setup for future installments, frustrating.This contains a little bloody and disturbing violence, suggestive material, and moderate to strong language. I recommend this to those who still find the idea appearing after all these criticisms - I mean, I'm not unhappy about my viewing of it. 6/10"}, {"id": 940, "text": "It's been thee years in the making, but has it been worth the wait? I first saw a trailer for The New Mutants in 2017 and have been waiting patiently for its big screen release. A lot has happened since then. For starters the movie didn't get the post production upgrades it needed to make it scarier and Marvel was bought out by Disney. The horror element has been dialled down by Mickey &amp; his mates and release dates pushed back until September 2020. The result is a much tamer vision of the X Men trainees directed by Josh Boone (he owns every New Mutants/X-Men comic and graphic novel) who are being prepped for a higher power, but is it Professor X who wants them or someone diabolical. Watch out for: Logan flashbacks. Basically this is a haunted house movie set in a real Asylum that freaked out the cast &amp; crew during filming. If it had been released three years ago it would have been a game changer and pioneer of a new genre of horror superhero LGBTQ movies, but that's all been done since then. Still it will find a teen, tween audience, just not fully satisfying adult fan boys and girls who remember the original comics. Pity this could have been really scary and you know I love a good horror film."}, {"id": 941, "text": "I'm glad a saw this, but did go in knowing that I wasn't going to love it; purely based on the bad reviews I'd already heard. I probably wouldn't even have bought a theater ticket for this if it wasn't for the current situation with the pandemic and the trouble this film has had with it's release. But like I said; despite not loving it, I'm glad a saw it on the big screen so that even some part of it's difficult creation was fulfilled.The cast is great; everyone pulls their weight and you don't ever feel like you're watching people acting. Some of the visuals fall a little flat at times when I was hoping for some achingly beautiful scenes - rain falling on the energy bubble for example. (This could have been made so much better and more vibrant if the lighting on the two characters was better.)The main problem for me is the writing; too cliched and too easy. Characters overcome their significant fears without any effort and nothing feels earned. There's no sense of struggle and that diminishes the impact of the finale. This could have been so much better with some simple changes and little more faith in the viewing public - but this is what I have come to expect from popular film franchises; everything is dummed down for the masses instead of moving to educate theater goers to raise themselves up to a higher level.Its a decent go at a superhero/horror genre and enjoyable, but ultimately let down by lazy writing."}, {"id": 942, "text": "With some larger scale movies finally being released in the UK, following the Covid cinema shutdown, The New Mutants is finally being given a chance to be seen on the big screen. Was it worth this monumental wait? In a word, no.Following the destruction of her village, Danielle Moonstar (Blu Hunt) awakens in a small private psychiatric hospital. Doctor Reyes (Alice Braga) informs her that she is a mutant and this place is for young or troubled mutants to become accustomed to their powers. There are four other students, Rahne (Maisie Williams), Illyana (Anya Taylor-Joy), Sam (Charlie Heaton) and Roberto (Henry Zaga). As Moonstar discovers that the hospital isn't all that it seems - each student comes under attack from their worst fears.There's nothing about The New Mutants that's irredeemably awful, from a technical standpoint it visually quite well done and the storyline is at least coherent. However, there's also nothing particularly noteworthy or memorable about it either. I appreciate that Josh Boone is saying at the moment that this wasn't the case, and it's the film he wanted to make, but I can't help but feel like the films been neutered somehow, with the horror aspects that we're purported to be in the film toned down. There aren't really any scares, even the cheap jump scares the might be in a similarly pitched film. There's some imagery that is creepier than anything we've seen in any other film in the X-Men universe but overall the experience of the film is that it's rather bland and generic.What doesn't help this is that the characters aren't very interesting. I'll leave Anya Taylor-Joy's Rasputin out of this criticism, as although that character feels familiar, she is at least having some fun with it (and it's nice that she gets to bring Lockheed onto the big screen). The rest of the characters are fairly interchangeable and are performed OK by their respective actors, but even if I was likely to be given the chance to see them play them again, I can't say I'd be too excited about the idea.Again, not the worst film I've ever seen, nor the worst in this X-Men canon, but its failure to properly flesh out any of its potential themes, characters or ideas hamstrings it from the start."}, {"id": 943, "text": "REVIEW - THE NEW MUTANTSRelease date 4 SeptemberSince 2000, the X-Men franchise has soared as high as X-Men: First Class and fallen as low as X-Men: The Last Stand.This film was actually completed in 2018 but due to a merger, Disney not feeling the horror theme fits into their family viewing and now covid this has finally been released 4 years later.I say horror because all of the trailers pointed that way, a much darker themed film which was welcomed by fans as a whole new way to tell the story, the only other horror genre film being the excellent Brightburn.Each character is given their own back story, some going into greater depth than others while each of the characters are in a hospital teaching them how to control their various powers.From the start it certainly looks darker but the scares simply don't scare, so I do wonder Disney had their way after all because whilst definitely an interesting and original concept for the X person franchise and from trailers seen looking really scary actually wasn't and unfortunately even the big fight sequence at the end just lacked the edge of your seat treatment because........no spoilers.Turn your brain off, sit back and just watch it for what it is, a coming of age movie set in a hospital, the brooding teens have powers and someone and something just isn't right.Not the best, not the worse but unfortunately not helping the franchise either.Rating 6 out of 10"}], "reviews_amount": 944}
