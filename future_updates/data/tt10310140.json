Many may say the story is stupid and too straight forwards...but this is a movie, that could've been made in the 80's. People who grew up with movies which don't take themself too serious like Commando for example really miss such movies. And i'am not talking about cheaply made C-movies. In the 80's there was an audience for this kind of movies and that's why they were highly quality produced. It's about the fun. And i had fun watching this movie. It's just this kind of flick you tell your friends about Hey have you seen this crazy movie where Mel Gibson as Santa Clause saves christmas with guns? And of course they answer with no. And then you tell them: Well, buckle up, kiddo. You're in for a good time, get the whiskey!.Nothing more to add. We need more films like that,"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Just funny enough not to be too grim or dark, but just straight enough to be tense, and ever so slightly surreal. Acting is pretty good, and the story is a darker version of the normal holiday fare. I found it thoroughly watchable, and really enjoyed the ending."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Before I read the synopsis &amp; watched the trailer, I thought this was another low budget bad santa story. I was wrong.An interesting take on the Chris Cringle story with a great message from the most bad-ass Santa I've seen.A great cast, a few comedic pops, short Christmas vibes, cussing &amp; bloodshed.Not action packed. More storytelling based. Good on a lazy boy in Gold Class."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Having no expectations whatsoever, I'm ecstatic about it. The evil boy that has all these evil plans, just great, the hitman, also a great performance and then Mell Gibson, he knows how to act. In the beginning you might think it's a kids movie, because all the action and killing is off screen, but halfway it turn into a great killing frenzy. This movie deserves way more then a 6.0!!!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a very spoiled, entitled, and sadistic young boy. He has the advantages of privilege and lives with his wealthy Grandmother but is rude and condescending to the staff. Billy is also very arrogant and petty to the point that a Runner Up finish at his private school Science Fair after a string of wins motivates him to hire a Hitman (Walton Goggins) to intimidate the victor to falsely admit to cheating so he can claim victory.This is not the first time Billy has hired the Hitman and when he gets a lump of coal for Christmas from Santa (Mel Gibson) he is enraged and hires the Hitman to take out Santa.Santa has his own issues as a decline in revenue has forced him and his wife Ruth (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) to take on a project with the government to not only restore his fully stipend but to pay additional funds that will ensure financial stability. The fact that the Hitman has his own reasons for having issues with Santa further motivates him to take the job and rushed north to face Santa on his own turf. Fatman is a dark and entertaining new holiday entry that gives a contemporary take on Santa and his Elves as they must contend with the issues, politics, and changing world that face many companies.The at times dark nature of the film is an interesting contrast to the usual overly sweet films that are commonplace this time of year and Gibson and Goggins backed by a strong supporting cast turn in memorable performances. While not one for the kids; Fatman is a solid piece of entertainment and Eshom and Ian Nelms keep things moving at a steady pace and provide an interesting and contemporary look at Santa in the modern world and combine it with a story about finding a way through adversity.3.5 stars out of 5"}, {"id": 5, "text": "This was a good movie. Will definitely watch again.

Dark, funny and plodded along like a spaghetti western of old."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Best christmas movie since Die Hard. Dont listen to those cry babies who make like someone stole their candy. If you are one of them,go see disney's bambie and whip for a cartoon's mom. P.S&gt; Mel is still one of the Greats."}, {"id": 8, "text": "The plot is essentially this: spoiled kid gets Cole so he hires an assasin to kill Santa. Santa, who is unaware of the target on his back, is facing an existential crisis because no matter what he does kids these days keep getting worse. The film culminates in a surprisingly violent and well done shootout/ fist fight. If that sounds interesting, you'll love it. The acting is great and no one phones in their performance despite the late night scyfy channel esque plot. Don't let critics fool you on this film, it clearly wasn't made for them."}, {"id": 9, "text": "This was a fun twist on Santa for those who like dark comedic humor. It was on point and the fact that Mel Gibson plays cranky Santa makes this movie solid. All in. Enjoy."}, {"id": 10, "text": "I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I've lost my influence. Maybe it's time I retired the coat. Chris (Mel Gibson)Fatman is neither It's a Wonderful Life nor Die Hard. It is the most eccentric holiday story since Bad Santa, a tale of Chris in decline, accepting a government contract to keep his elf-driven enterprise going. That statement may give you an idea of how tonally this story covers the map from dark comedy, to thriller, to Western, and to most other genres in between.Gibson is such a competent actor that as Chris he handily takes us through different emotional states so we are in his capable hands to make the story stand up. He shows his despair at the passing of his glory days, then softens us with his abiding love for his wife, Ruth (Marianne Jean Baptiste), and faces off an assassin, Skinny Man (a terrific Walton Goggins).This is not the Fatman story we have grown up with-he is the reality of happiness, a state of confusion at once exultant at goodness and then morose at evil. Even his elves are not their traditionally cute-just diverse and surviving.The ultimate bad guy is not Skinny but a pampered 12-year old, Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield), who contracts Skinny to kill Chris as revenge on Chris giving Billy for Christmas a lump of coal (rather than bringing back to life his parents, as we find out later). Most of us would sulk for a day; Billy hires a gun. This film does not cater to our expectations about the mythical Christmas. In fact, it's closer to the bloody time to which Christ Himself was born.The emergence of the military into this well-known lore represents the intrusion of government into our imaginative and mythical life. However, the army comes off well, more a benign force than an intruder just as the elves are not spritely but mostly just good workers.Fatman upends out given myth to update it into times fraught with combustible elections and rogue pandemics. Yet, good will out even in the direst of circumstances:I've come for your head, Fat Man! Skinny Man You think you're the first? You think I got this job because I'm fat and jolly? Chris"}, {"id": 11, "text": "Wasn't quite sure what i was getting into with this one but was immediately hooked from the start! Excellent acting backed up by a creative new spin on the myth of jolly ol st. Nick! Merry Christmas!!!!"}, {"id": 12, "text": "There are not enough Santa based dramas. This helps to fill that void. Fatman builds Mel Gibson's Santa Claus in the same way Nolan built the darker Batman. Sure, there's a bit of magic. But it's conceivable that this could happen in a real world.Overall this movie keeps you anxious with that Uncut Gems style of action. You know who the good guys are. You know who the bad guys are. You can't predict who will beat who. It's well worth the investment and likely to become a staple in my household for Christmases to come."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Die hard is a Christmas movie and so is this. Go watch this in theatres and have a great time. The movie is funny action packed and treats it's self way to seriously...in a good way action and Christmas makes for a really fun cinema movie"}, {"id": 14, "text": "Not your traditional Christmas movie (and *not* for kids), but oddly heartwarming and not nearly as nihilistic as it's gritty exterior would have you believe. Great performances all around, and clever script and concept. Exposition is minimal, but the world-building is clear. There's a lot of fabulous one-liner mythology and little hidden gems in the dialogue - will be re-watching for those! Enjoyed the juxtaposition of kindness and violence. Delightful and highly recommended!"}, {"id": 15, "text": "Fatman was a watchable christmas story told in a little different way ,so if you are not fan of a sweet and cheesy Holiday films then this one may to be one for you.Gibson was fun to watch as a cranky tired of life Santa and he sold his character in a fun and good way.Goggins was also good as assassin and he was maybe only real character in a film except Gibson one.Story wasnt nothing brilliant but it had some fun moments in it that worked for me.Parts with kid who hired assassin were weaker parts but i can ignore that.Fatman was a solid Christmas based film in a different way"}, {"id": 16, "text": "I didn't quite know what to expect, but with an R rating for violence, I knew it wasn't going to be The Santa Clause! I love these darker takes on Santa (Rare Exports is a favorite), so this one was quite satisfying.

I found it entertaining. I can't really lock it into one category for a movie but just go into it open minded and I am sure you will enjoy it."}, {"id": 18, "text": "I'll keep it short. It was hilarious. Great job Mel."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I mean, Mel Gibson as Santa with a gun and an attitude. In my mind this was going one of two ways, Santa Slay type camp or trying to be some sort of serious action thriller. I think it toed the line well. The relationship and chemistry between Mr and Mrs Claus is one of the best Mr &amp; Mrs dynamics shown on screen. Is this the greatest movie of all time. No. But it sure was a damn fun hour and three quarters"}, {"id": 20, "text": "FatmanThis was a very strange Xmas movie, it was difficult for me to accept that Mel Gibson was Chris, (Father Christmas) to begin with so I got off to a rocky start. Once you understood the comedic premise asking what does Santa do the rest of the year and who is paying you had covered the movie.Overall it was gently funny, but I was distracted several of the sub plots and a bit bored. I giving this a 5, meaning worth a watch if it sounds like you sort of thing"}, {"id": 21, "text": "The idea of Santa having a hit put out on him by a disgruntled, corrupt, psychopathic child is interesting - and given that Mel Gibson had signed on I figured it was worth a shot. What Fatman is though, is hard to describe: Fatman portrays adult themes, profanity, and violence mixed with adolescent dialog and plots. You have an (alcoholic) Santa character vacillating between compassionate and psychopathic. You have fantasy concepts mixed with attempts at realism/grittiness and the standard injection of woke themes (Mrs. Cringle is Black?) that left me wondering who the heck this movie is supposed to be for? Adults? No - Writing is simplistic and bland. Children? No - too much profanity, violence, and adult themes. People who consider themselves edgy? Maybe(?).At the end of it all, my overwhelming impression was What WAS that!?"}, {"id": 22, "text": "High quality production movie with great actors.

Seeing Santa from A new perspective. From firing a gun to cursing. And Mrs. Claus being an Aussie Aborigine. This deserves no less then 10 stars. This film is fitting for 2020.

It had the potential to be great but was not.It starts out with an intreaguing story about a disgruntled boy not getting his way but soon becomes long drawn out and slow. It never recovers from that.

I can tell that actors are socially distancing in the movie. I expected more. I expected a somewhat coherent story. Fantasy and reality is melded together. There is no realism in this. It's just sad. 2020 is sad. This movie is sad. Mel Gibson should start drinking again to see if that helps (probably not). If this is how movies will be post-corona then I say it's no use. Just stop.

The movie is great."}, {"id": 33, "text": "As many other commenters before me mentioned this is by no means a bad movie. On the contrary for what it is it's solid in many departments like acting, location and directing.But, and there's always a but with a 6/10 rating, the story is just a tad bit slow and the payoff is not really working with this much of a builtup.After a really strong start that characterizes the differenty paties pretty well we get a lot of time watching dialog after dialog without any real development of the story.The time from the point where the hitmen was contracted to the final showdown between him and chris should have been way shorter. Maybe the hitman requesting support from other killers who are disappointed by santa whould have been a good idea. This would more resamble the the day the raindeer died scenario pictured by scrooged back in the day, which we're still all waiting to happen one day.Here's hoping this not-bad-at-all movie inspires more christmas themed action flicks!"}, {"id": 34, "text": "Christ only knows what this movie is meant to be.

I thought this would have more action/showing how much of a badass Santa is/was. Instead this was kind of like The Drop, imo. Slow build to a violent, action ending (although this one was longer).It did have a little inconsistent tone to me. It kinda threw in a little bit of everything: dark humor and grit to a dash of campy, Xmas easter egg-y, satire-ish stuff with an indie film filter. Rode the line of being too serious vs sarcastically serious satire, not sure if that was intentional or not. Think of like the Liam Neeson movies like Cold Pursuit.. Entertaining overall, but not that memorable really."}, {"id": 40, "text": "At about 1 hour and 40 minutes, this is a short and fun Mel Gibson movie. Mel Gibson plays a more realistic version of Santa Claus and ends up having a hit ordered on him by an angry child from his naughty list.The film is a blend between comedy and action, both of which deliver. The movie is funny at times and the action scenes are great.Definitely a Must See for any Mel Gibson fan."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Pulpy, well written and edgy; Fatman is destined to become a holiday cult classic.In this dark comedy/thriller, an unorthodox Santa Claus is fighting to save his declining business. Meanwhile, a neglected and precocious 12 year old, hires a hit man to kill Santa after receiving a lump of coal in his stocking.This film sounds ludicrous but really delivers the goods. Mel Gibson is so great, so badass it's hard to turn off your screen. Walton Goggins is as terrific as ever, always playing a twisted villain. This is the perfect B-movie with the most insane twists and tons of blood... perfect for the holidays (LOL). The humour is on point and the story is original.

As novice writers and directors in this film, they were on point with the directing, cinematography, score and especially the casting - Gibson was the perfect Fatman. But I feel the story got lost trying to be a funny comedy (which I don't recall laughing at all) about Santa that's not meant for kids, yet it feels like it should have been tailored for kids. You have the Fatman as a convincing real-life character dealing with the military (why even?) and real-life problems, and then this story revolving around a spoiled bratty rich kid and his creepy, silly Disney-ish evil hitman. This could've been a huge hit as it had everything it needed done right, except the writing. So had the Nelms at least consulted a seasoned screenwriter for some major edits, I'm sure every critic would've love this movie. Sadly, it's only a 7/10 from me.

This is a different kind of Christmas movie. It has comedy in it but it also contains a lot of bloody violence. Mel plays Chris Cringle, aka Santa Claus, aka Fatman. Marianne plays Ruth Cringle, aka Mrs Claus. Chance plays a spoiled 12 year old rich boy that is used to getting everything he wants, even if he has to grease some wheels to get it. Walton plays a hitman that Chance has on his speed dial. Chance is a little disappointed when Mel leaves him a lump of coal for Christmas-it seems that Chance was a bad boy-and so Chance hires Walton to kill Santa. But the job is going to be a little more difficult than Walton anticipated. Santa has been around for a long time, remember? So he has learned a few things over the years. It's not going to be just easy pickings for Walton. To complicate matters even more, the military is on site at the North Pole trying to make a deal with Mel to use his elves to make military hardware in the off season-the elves do have a reputation for being good workers and delivering the goods on time.

He even goes all Bond villain in the snow in a White Hunters suit. Proving not all bad guys wear black, remember Storm Troopers? This movie is a slow burn that lives up to the trailer and beyond. It feels like Fargo with hints of Tarantino and a big build up to a gun fight Spaghetti Western style, it's also dark like Nolans' Batman, but it will make you laugh out embarrassingly loud not just LOL. This is one unorthodox, disillusioned Santa suffering an existential crisis in Pandemic times. Let's face it he didn't get this job because he was fat and jolly. What we see is a Santa who has loathing for a world that has forgotten him. Mel's not playing a Bad Santa, rather a Bass Ass Santa who keeps his armoury under his bed.

What I was most surprised by was their take on how Santa manages to do what he does (with government subsidies) and how he runs his workshop more like a typical factory. It definitely fit the tone of the movie, and I liked that Santa just kind of felt like an average joe who was struggling because it was a take on the character I hadn't seen before. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well developed the relationship between both of the Clauses was and found myself rooting for them throughout the film.

The plot is fairly straightforward and you get what you expect, but there's definitely a level of charm to the film that I quite enjoyed."}, {"id": 178, "text": "A kid hires a hitman (Walton Goggins) to whack Santa, portrayed by Mel Gibson as a cantankerous fat bearded guy running a dwindling gift manufacturing and delivery business who happens to be really good with firearms. Meanwhile, the military hires Santa to manufacture control panels. It ends with a western style standoff in Alaska. This bizarre mix of black comedy and thriller is certainly not for all tastes, but is nonetheless unique entertainment although the tone veers wildly from one scene to the next. Walton Goggins is a treat, as usual, as a hugely disgruntled hit man with a chip on the shoulder against Santa. Interesting and watchable fare for a slow evening."}, {"id": 179, "text": "Honestly wasn't sure what to make if this movie . It is stuck between violence and comedy ( and not that funny ) .

I wasn't too thrilled about that idea though, as I was expecting another cheesy holiday movie but Fatman is different. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. It's definitely not a Christmas movie for kids that still believe in Santa Claus. There's a fair amount of violence and killings so not sure if kids want to see that if you want to keep them in the Christmas spirit. But for adults it's entertaining. Mel Gibson, once a decent actor, played in a lot of bad movies lately, at the point where I was wondering if he forgot how to act. But in Fatman he got it together again with a decent performance playing Santa Claus. Walton Goggins always seems play mean characters and he's good at it so no reason to change that. The whole cast did a good job making Fatman a different Christmas movie than we're used to. It changes from the eternal Home Alone franchise they push down our throat every year over and over again."}, {"id": 183, "text": "It's hard to find anything good about this film.

The are not. The trailer, like many others, over time has sold this picture very well, alas the final cut, is a mixed up bag of nuts and bolts that don't fit. I think it was probably shut down due to Covid and they just never found their feet, when shooting commenced. I like Mel Gibson, I think he has the potential for a few great films in him and I do not have an issue with Chris's wife, Ruth being black, unlike some on this board. I'm ready for a black James Bond, 2020 get over your bigotry. I did however find Marianne Jean-Baptiste's acting flat. It felt like she didn't want to be there. Why , oh why, did they build Walton Goggin's character, Skinny Man, up with an interesting hobby of collecting Santa's old Christmas presents just to drop it without explanation? Why did he buy and have shelves, of Santa's present's wrapped in plastic? He seemed to obsess over them in the first half of the film!? I think his appearance in the film with all the snow, playing an assassin is why people get that, Quentin Tarantino vibe. Django &amp; Hateful Eight come to mind. It isn't a classic sadly and the army coming in to build panels for jet fighters!? What the heck? That's when you know it's turned the corner. It just doesn't make much sense after that. The centre can not hold. You'll probably watch it because, like me the trailer sold it but I should have known better. The trailer had the best bits in it. I did chuckle when Santa is calling around for help with the business and he's on the phone, trying to drum up business and says, Elon this is Chris, what have you got for me? Santa's little helpers have some good lines, the best is in the trailer and were not used to full effect. Elf 7, (Eric Wolfe.) was a solid actor. As others have said this could have been a great alternative, Christmas film but it fails badly. Such a shame!! Mel Gibson is the best part of it. Have a bloomin' lovely Christmas one and all. Let's hope 2021 is much, much better. I'm going to watch Klaus (2019), with my son, a far better experience of a disheartened, Father Christmas."}, {"id": 187, "text": "This is not a charismas movie and certainly not a children movie, but more a story based western if anything. It has humorous elements, but it is never funny. Basically, the journey of a killer to reach Santa, a kid that is being a villain for some reason and Santa who actually is battling a mild depression because how unpleasantly the world is evolving.The writers put a lot of logic and thought in to it and tried to make it grounded. For me it worked quite well, but sadly for most people it didn't. It is a world where Santa exists. NOT reality obviously. Once you can realize this flaw, it starts to make sense. They explain a lot of elements as logical and reasonable they can with such a dumb premise and they stay consistent with everything they show/we learn. They break or avoid some clich\u00e9s you would expect in such a movie.On a technical level it was fine. Very few bad scenes, but sadly very few good scenes as well.The cast was fine. The acting was better than expected and in many scenes the acting was even great. The child actor as the villain was surprisingly good. I liked his scream and how unlikeable he was.. The score was a mix between stock-music-like and actually really good. There was very little action in the movie, but when it was there was mostly fine. They actually use single fire and reload their guns! The standoff between Santa and the Hitman was tense and fun. The outcome was unexpectedly expected. It evolved in to a solid action movie for a few minutes. It is competently shot with fine camerawork and since I do have a soft spot for movies that are shot outside, I was satisfied. Sadly not many locations the actual story takes place.Marianne Jean-Baptiste's hair was the worst thing ever. Why did she had to have haircut like a hipster? Why couldn't she have normal hair? Her Hair was the only thing that pissed me off.I have some problems with the movie, but what makes this movie good is how serious everyone takes the entire premise. Yet the entire movie takes itself not serious because it is about a killer trying to kill Santa. The 2nd act/buildup to the standoff was a little bit convoluted. It was still interesting to see how they would reach the 3rd act.The conclusion was not as good, but it made sense for the characters and felt natural."}, {"id": 188, "text": "What the hell did I just watch??

I also wondered why I sort of ran to the theater to see it. It's really because movie theaters are open in my area, and I have been enjoying Mel Gibson's career resurgence. Since I didn't really follow Fatman leading up to its release, I didn't know much about it except that it sort of is a 'Revenge Santa' movie. Given Mel Gibson's reputation with his films being violent, and my interest in alternate Christmas content ala 'Silent Night, Deadly Night', I was willing to give 'Fatman' a try.The concept of Fatman sounds like something out of B Movie Heaven: When a spoiled brat receives a lump of coal for being naughty, he hires a hitman to kill Santa! Unfortunately, Fatman never charters into B-movie territory; but takes itself entirely way too serious. Sometimes this works, most of the time it doesn't. There is entirely too much buildup and not enough payoff.Fatman has a charming, almost Hallmark movie-of-the-week like quality; such as the location of the film being set in North Peak, Alaska, and that Mel Gibson's character name is actually Chris Cringle. Taking the realism even a step further, Cris' business of bringing joy to the world has been in a steady decline, with the kids around the world seemingly turning more bad. With profits not being what they're used to, the government is forced to step in to subsidize the cost.The idea of a child hiring a hitman to kill Santa sounds like the perfect opportunity to see a Jolly Ol' Saint Nick from Hell. Fatman never dives into those waters, but instead focuses on the Cris Cringle we already know: He is a family man and he loves his elves. I don't think I caught the reason as to why our antagonist Billy had entirely way too much power in his hands. By the end of the film, Fatman of course has the opportunity to destroy Billy. If the reason for Fatman letting him get off easy was for a sequel, then my faith in a higher power has diminished."}, {"id": 206, "text": "Oddly violent in some areas , then weak in the others There's some good plot lines, and some decent characters, decent background of Chris etc, and a use of the military But then it gets quite graphically violent where it didn't need to be.

Rudolph is glowing, Santa is coming to town and the Grinch is stealing Christmas. Adults that remember these shows are watching them with their children and grandchildren now. But what about a Christmas film that the adults can enjoy? Something a little more inclined to be viewed when the kids go to bed? Enter FATMAN.Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a spoiled rich kid whose father is incommunicado and is being raised by his grandmother. Billy has a deep Napoleonic complex (witness a portrait of the ruler on his wall) and feels the need to win at all costs. For example when he loses the school science fair he brings in hitman Jonathan Miller (Walton Goggins) to capture the winner and threaten her with returning the prize to stay alive. Needless to say this puts him on the naughty list and he gets a lump of coal for Christmas.Meanwhile Mel Gibson stars in the title role as Chris Cringle, who lives with his wife Ruth (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) in North Point, Alaska. Chris is down because his business is waning. It seems children are not behaving as nice as they should. News reports of some dropping bowling balls off of freeway bridges and setting houses on fire have dampened his spirits and it shows.In an effort to keep his factory running and Christmas alive, Chris has been contracting work with the US government. But this year's check is half of what it once was. In an effort to keep the work he does going he agrees to a 2 month contract with the government. In return for more funds he and his elves will be working to build items for the military. He's not happy about it but he has to do so if Christmas is going to keep going.After Billy gets his lump of coal he is angry with Santa. So much so that he contacts Miller and puts out a contract on Santa. This is a contract Miller is keen to take as he has his own issues with Santa from his childhood. To this day he finds people willing to sell items from their childhood that Santa presented them and buy them from them. Now he has the chance to get his own revenge against Santa.While Miller tracks down clues to discover where to find Santa, Chris and his elves begin working on the contracted government project. Happy with the work they've done they want to extend the contract but Chris tells them this is a one time project. In the meantime Captain Jacobs (Robert Bockstael), the Army liaison in charge of the guards enjoys his time with Chris and the elves working for him.Eventually the confrontation between Chris and Miller will take place. After all that's where the plot is going here in the film. Along the way there is plenty of dark humor involved that will have you snickering or outright laughing as the film rolls forward. Plenty of language is on hand to get this film an R rating and if that wasn't enough some blood is shed. No, this is not a Christmas carol for the kids.The film hits the right notes when discussing Christmas because there does seem to be a lack of cheer these days. Cynicism runs rampant with young people these days and the talk of being honest with kids and not letting them believe in Santa seems to be a growing trend. But why not let them have some fun before they have to face being adults? That may not be the main concept here but it does play into the story.Gibson is aging well and does a great job here as Chris. If you didn't catch it already, yes he is THAT Chris Cringle. From knowing the names of everyone he comes into contact with to knowing if they were bad or good. Jean-Baptiste is a delight as the cookie baking Mrs. Cringle. Goggins is superb as the hitman Miller, allowing us to see the cold hearted killer that he is as well as the grown child disappointed in a gift he requested of Santa that there was no possible way of delivering. Watch to find out what that is.Dark comedies are hard to pull off. Some go over the top while others seem afraid to tread on items the comedy is based on. FATMAN doesn't pull punches and delivers some truly funny moments. Perhaps not knee slappers but funny none the less.

Chris Cringle keeps up target practice, blasting away at cans on fence posts with an automatic pistol. He never misses his mark. He drives a battered red Ford pick-up when he isn't cruising the clouds in his legendary sleigh with his fabled reindeer team. Constantly munching on his wife's Christmas cookies, Chris serves as his own accountant. Lately, he frowns more often at the amount of the subsidy checks Uncle Sam sends him. Sometimes, after he exits the Post Office, Chris bellies up to the bar at a local tavern. He has been known to safeguard the marriage vows of countless husbands eyeballing a sexy barkeep with her alluring bedroom eyes. Occasionally, Chris dissolves his Alka Seltzer tablets in his shot glass of liquor for respite from his own woes. Mind you, Father Christmas's business hasn't been as prosperous as it once was, and he has suffered setbacks. Indeed, the bearded fellow has grown sarcastic and grumpy. Children are no longer the same. Although it is never adequately explained, this Santa Claus has the ability to heal himself, and we catch a glimpse of a gunshot wound inflicted on him during his night flights. Naughty teens have been known to open fire on his sleigh as he traverses the heavens. Chris maintains a company of loyal, hard-working, efficient elves who thrive on sugar and carbs. They can conjure up untold merchandise galore at Santa's secret factory on a sprawling, snow-swept ranch in Alaska. Although Billy Bob Thornton's two crude Bad Santa movies broke new ground for Santa Claus movies, Small Town Crime co-writers &amp; directors Eshom and Ian Nelms have reinvented Santa as an action hero with a moral conscience in Fatman. Incidentally, the film draws its title from the derogatory usage of this synonym for Santa Claus. Despite its provocative blend of realism and fantasy, Fatman amounts to a sober-minded morality tale about the choices people make and the consequences. If anybody knows anything about who has been either naughty or nice, Santa Claus knows, and he doesn't tolerate nonsense. Mel Gibson's stern Santa grumbles about the bad behavior of children. Ever wonder about those unsavory souls who didn't get what they sought from Santa? In Fatman, Santa leaves a lump of coal in their stockings as punishment. Surprisingly, Uncle Sam has contractually obliged itself to reimburse Santa for the volume of toys he distributes at Christmas. Since Santa has been delivering more lumps of coal than gifts, Uncle Sam has reduced the amount of subsidy it pays Santa. Furthermore, the future of Santa's shop and his workforce appears in jeopardy. Grudgingly, Santa agrees to re-tool his factory temporarily for the production of military aircraft parts for the Pentagon so as to ensure the continued prosperity of his business. Meanwhile, Santa's intransigence has prompted one of the naughty to retaliate with lead in the shape of bullets! In Fatman, Santa tangles with two villains. First, he has provoked the rage of an evil twelve-year old, Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield of Good Boys), who refuses to admit defeat just as virulently as Donald Trump. Consistently, Billy has won four First Place Blue Ribbons for his elementary school science projects. When he loses to Christine (newcomer Ellison Butler), Billy summons the second villain, Jonathan Miller (Walton Goggins of Django Unchained), an adult assassin with no qualms about shooting a couple asleep in bed. Although Goggins plays the murderous Miller with sinister anonymity, Chance Hurstfield steals the show with his flawless, sociopathic performance as Billy.Before he goes after Santa, Miller abducts poor Christine. He stands by quietly while Billy threatens to electrocute her with twitching battery cables if she doesn't expose herself as a fraud. Of course, Billy winds up getting his Blue Ribbon. Nothing can redeem Billy's wicked lack of scruples. Abandoned by his father, Billy lives in a mansion with his wealthy grandmother who dotes on him. Billy takes advantage of her affection for him and forges her signature and cashes a number of checks! When he isn't looting granny's bank account, Billy lords it over their obsequious servants. Ultimately, Santa's lump of coal sends Billy over the edge, and he hires Miller to turn St. Nick into Swiss cheese. Billy dreams of having Santa's head on a stick, but Miller refuses to smuggle a severed head through two border checkpoints as well as preserve it from the elements. Like pampered but tyrannical Billy, Miller lost his parents early in life and suffered a similar kind of anguish. It doesn't help matters either that Santa gave Miller the coal treatment, too, when the hitman was growing up. Predictably, Miller seizes the chance to wreak vengeance on Santa.As soon as Miller sets foot on Santa's property and starts shooting up the place, Fatman turns into a full-fledged, bullet-riddled actioneer. Scattering pipe bombs at random on the premises, Miller eventually finds himself face to face with Santa in the equivalent of a Wild West showdown. Santa wields two handguns, while Miller shoulders an impressive looking assault rifle. The ensuing firefight turns out to be a sanguinary ordeal with each man extracting blood from the other. Mel Gibson gives an avuncular performance as a disillusioned Santa who refuses to quit no matter what the consequences. Indeed, the Nelms brothers make Santa Claus look like a kind of boondocks version of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

The difference for this one is that the rich kid has an enforcer/hitman on the payroll. The guy from The Shield who played the dirty cop from Georgia plays the twisted hitman.

The acting overall was pretty good.If I have any complaints is that there were certain parts of the storyline that made no sense other than to prolong the action. I mean Santa getting subsidized by the US government? And surely Santa had more powers than he used. And by no means do I want to come across as racist, but come on, a black actress playing Mrs. Kringle?

It seems Mel Gibson was born for this part, there could not have been a better choice for Santa. At least not for this Santa. Walton Goggins is a great actor for sure, I like him since The Shield. But he surely surpassed my high expectation in Fatman. His performance is pure gold. Marianne Jean-Baptiste has a great chemistry with Mel Gibson, another ideal casting choice. Last but not least, Chance Hurstfield plays the nasty kid, and he surely does a great job since I disliked this little devil soon after some minutes.The setting (the film was shot in Canada) also fits perfectly into the winter / christmas scenario. It creates the fitting atmosphere for this wild ride.FATMAN delivers the perfect mixture of humor, drama, action and violence.

It is like somebody wrote the outline and a commission of b-writers randomly pasted in dialogue, the odd joke here and there and random actiony bits.The notion of taking a known narrative or character and subverting it isn't new.

After an intriguing-enough start, it fizzles out in plot (I mean, I like a good irreverent comedy, but this sure didn't cut it), the action doesn't exactly instill interest and a decent ensemble is left to fend for themselves given the lackluster screenplay. Tackled right, Fatman could have been disgraced actor Mel Gibson's comeback flick (by no means, endorsing what he did or his attitude). He plays a Santa that isn't cheery, spreading smiles and distributing wrapped presents around the world. This version of Chris Cringle is often drunk, bruised, and totally devoid of the Christmas spirit. Quite certainly, what keeps him going is the resilience shown by his wife Ruth (played by Marianne Jean-Baptiste), with whom he shares believable chemistry.An angry kid orders a hit on Santa: this is Fatman's one-liner. While that may sound pretty enticing on paper, it doesn't hold your interest for 95 minutes as the treatment is a tad formulaic. The showdown between Santa (apparently, a mind-reader) and the assassin (played to generic effect by Walton Goggins) is restricted to the film's final 15 minutes or so, and it gets over so quickly that you forget what went down, along with the rest of the film.

You're more likely to laugh at the action scenes (and not in a good way) than at the funny lines. It isn't a thriller, because the story is undeveloped and, despite the movie having an interesting premise, the actual plot is quite bland. They missed every opportunity to make the story interesting and compelling. Throughout the movie I kept expecting it to get better, but it just never did.This definitely is a different kind of Christmas movie, but different doesn't necessarily mean better nor even good enough.

I must admit that the storyline was a massive swing and a miss in terms of it being entertaining or enjoyable for me.I mean, a storyline so devoid of Christmas feel that you just sit there all throughout the course of the movie wondering whom this Chris character (played by Mel Gibson) really is, because it sure was no Santa Claus.Sure, the idea behind Fatman was unique and original, but its transition to the screen did little to work wonders, much less work in favor of the movie as a whole.Sure, I managed to sit through the entire ordeal, but I can't really claim to have been entertained, and this is by no means a movie that I will ever be watching again. And it is certainly not a Christmas classic in any way. So it can join the Die Hard movie on the 'not a Christmas movie' shelf.The acting in Fatman was actually good enough, but it was just hard to buy into the script and storyline, which ultimately reflected poorly on the entire movie as a whole. So the actors and actresses were definitely struggling with an uphill battle in order to carry this movie.

The action came in finally at the last 15 minutes of the movie and as for the comedy I diddn't crack smirk not even once.On the positive side the reason I gave any stars at all was due to the acting which I thought everyone did a pretty good job overall.

The only way you can classify this as a Christmas movie is because the name 'Santa Claus' is spoken. The action is nothing but mindless, and while Mel Gibson's portrayal of Santa going through the roughness of life was well-done, it was not enough to make this film worth watching.An essay would have to be written to truly describe how bad this film was. Basically, the characters had no backstory. The story itself was poorly written by dropping us in the middle of this child wanting to kill Santa for receiving coal. And while the idea of the US military working with Santa was nice. It did nothing, but create an obstacle of questions. After questioning everything else about this film.

Quite possibly the best Mel Gibson's performance in some time, another proof Walton Goggins is great with oddball criminal characters, and plenty of entertainment with heart to offer. Its biggest flaws, really, are all the laid-out, left-out lore, plot possibilities and potential. If you're looking to add a solid alternative christmas flick to the annual traditions list, it's most definitely recommended.Santa is real, his name is Chris, and he's rowdy, cranky and been there a long time, and also a businessman, fighting to save a declining business. There will be no spoilers, but the universe of Fatman, even though possessing a little magic, is real and grounded, and Santa has to make realistic choices.. Ain't no Christmas Chronicles. Meanwhile, a rich, spoiled and smart kid with a potential grow up to become a murderer, hires Walton Gogginns to kill Mel Gibson, over receiving a lump of coal in his stocking. Let the chase commence.Fatman, with relatively little means, builds an interesting world of possibilities, taking good advantage of putting Santa Claus and everything that comes with him in our rough world. The success of that is also ensured by Mel Gibson who puts on an awesome, believable, and just plain cool performance, and together with Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Ruth (Mrs. Claus) add pleasant warmth to Fatman. Waltons Goggins plays a cold-blooded, eccentric but grumpy hit man with a serious grudge for Santa Claus, and does so charmingly. Lastly, Chance Hurstfield played the villainous kid excellently, because I hated the character.Now, the problems with Fatman lie in the writers putting out all that stuff on the table in the beginning, and then commencing the simpler, more typcal-to-thriller/revenge story plot lines, in process losing momentum and providing pay-off that's not better than the build-up. The more christmas-related side of Fatman does not get strengthened and a good amount of the lore is left at an introductory level. Fatman overall tries to do a whole lot, be realistic, be magical and be about Santa, be grim, be funny, but ultimately not all boxes are ticked. Tell you what though, I'd be up for a sequel and that extra exploration.Fatman has that indie spirit, and that reflects in the technical and aesthetical aspects as well. It is, however, shot on a 20 million budget which is not that little, and I don't know how much went to the cast, but Fatman, while looking nice and good, doesn't have the potential grandness in not only the story, but also in the visuals. Nonetheless, it never seems cheap or has a on-the-nose weird camera angle.

It feels like somewhere down the line the world got too big for Santa and as such Santa was force to make some deals with people like the Military in order to keep Santa's workshop afloat. Seems like a low point for the magic of Christmas but that magic is wearing down as children become less and less innocent. Plus it looks like Mrs. Claus died and Santa has been sacking up with one of his elves, a black one at that (wonder if that was a coincidence, Mel).Add salt to the wound, Santa gives a rich kid oozing with first world problems a lump of coal for Christmas, and this kid sends a Santa obsessed hitman to track Chris Kringle down and kill him.Mel Gibson is no Kurt Russell when it comes to playing an alternative St. Nick. In fairness Russell is playing the Kringle that still has a twinkle in his eye in The Christmas Chronicle movies while Gibson's fat man sounds like a southern preacher who lost his faith in god. it's perfectly grim.Walton Goggins plays the hitman and to his credit he's a show Steeler. Perfectly menacingly and funny all at the same time. Can't help to laugh at his Sinister plan to get Santa.Mel Gibson makes good movies. it makes it hard to boycott him."}, {"id": 282, "text": "Starring Mel Gibson, this Christmas production is not in the same genre of films that we watch with children at the end of the year.With an indicative rating from the age of 16, Fatman brings a fanciful and hopeful narrative of Santa Claus, the good old man with a white beard who brings us gifts and the joy of Christmas, in a more realistic and embittered situation.Situated in the real world, where Santa Claus needs to seek new commercial partnerships with the American army to save his operation from bankruptcy, the mythical and magical figure tries to maintain persistence in the increasingly disappointing and scarce, Christmas spirit, as he struggles and gun to the teeth.It would be difficult to imagine a story in which Santa Claus, a practically omniscient and immortal man, as well as his wife and elves, could walk the streets, go to the bar, maintain his wedding and pay as bills from his toy factory as a being real human. Fatman can manage to bring this narrative in a very elaborate way thinking of the realistic air of the story.This fantasy picture that links comedy and action has no super jokes or sketches designed to be explicitly informed, but it is able to hold your attention in a very interesting way. Imagining the serious, plausible explanations and techniques in a subtle and objective way for the existence of all this fable, the film generates a good dose of humor and curiosity.With subtlety in presenting this magical figure hidden in the form of a common businessman, with many years of marriage and that practice shooting and crossfit, this movie conveys empathy with the good old man - strong as hell -, discredited in human kindness and Christmas, as well as that of a bankrupt businessman after trying to pursue the famous American dream.Bluntly, arcs of redemption or even great moral lessons, Fatman captivates with curiosity, the air of comedy it involves, and the action and shooting scenes with the villain of the film, played by Walton Goggins, an assassin cold, calculating and distressed with Santa Claus, as well as the sulky child who hires him to kill him.It is not ideal to have very young children in the room when watching this movie, but the production's Rambo style makes it fun to watch at various times of the year."}, {"id": 283, "text": "Given the year most of us have had, FatMan is the kick in the classical holiday bells we've been looking for, I'd say.With Mel Gibson delivering the crotchety/sweet and worn down Chris Kringle that only he could deliver, and the ever increasingly iconic Walter Goggins effortlessly delivering a slithering, obsessed assassin assigned to kill the FatMan himself... how could it go wrong?Well, quite easily, actually (I mean, seriously - is this flick serious?). But, rather surprisingly, aside for some mild pacing the film lacks at points, it manages quite deftly and sincerely to manage the heavy task of juggling tongue-and-cheek hard edge grit and (you guessed it) Christmas mother-flucking-spirit.It's no Christmas classic, and certainly no Tarentino, but it's not trying to be.Stuff FatMan in your stocking.

Smarter filmmakers would adjust the script accordingly if they can't swing the budget. The Nelms brothers may be pushing for a revolutionary Christmas film. They really only achieved an intriguing misfire. Chris is not appealing and I wonder if I really don't like Mel Gibson anymore. There is a dusting of human ugliness all around the man. There's nothing to care about him or this movie. It tries to be a dark satire and ends up as a loud shoot-them-up. It thinks that it's funnier and edgier than it is.

I like how the movie attempted to make Santa a relevant concept in modern society, it was a nice touch; however what I don't understand is who is this movie for? Some strong language makes this a pass for kids; plus the guns and killings that take place including stabbings.So, why don't I rate it so highly? Well most of the movie takes place with the assassin traveling by car, repeatedly. The child character bears no real relevance to the plot really, since the assassin had his own motivations to kill Santa anyway.So most of the movie seems wasted. Plus there are so many scenes with Santa and his wife that seems to repeat in tone and content.

In order to survive Chris takes on a military contract to make the proverbial ends meet.

This alleged black comedy is clearly aimed at people like me whose favourite Christmas movie is Bad Santa but whereas that gem was genuinelly funny and done in the worst possible taste while still managing to be sweetly sentimental thanks to a terrific performance from young Brett Kelly. This, however, is seriously short on laughs. Worse, it's poorly scripted, directed, acted and very violent; this is a Christmas movie clearly not aimed at children.The plot, for want of a better word, has obnoxious rich kid Chance Hurstfield hiring hitman Walton Goggins to kill Santa after he leaves him just a lump of coal at Christmas. Meanwhile Santa and his elfs find themselves making parts for the U.S. military to make ends meet. Done well, this could have been inspired instead of the under-cooked turkey it turns out to be. In fact, rather than watch this rubbish revisit Bad Santa or even watch It's a Wonderful Life for the 40th time or just go to bed early and hope that Santa brings you something more than a lump of coal."}, {"id": 294, "text": "Fatman is a film with such a ridiculous premise that you wonder how it was even made. The premise is that  Chris Cringle, also known as Santa Claus, is forced into a partnership with the U.S. military to save his declining business. Making matters worse, Chris gets locked into a deadly battle of wits against a highly-skilled assassin, hired by a precocious 12-year-old, after receiving a lump of coal in his stocking. I was very intrigued by this movie and the fact that Mel Gibson himself is playing Santa Clause. So was the movie a jolly good time or giant lump of coal?Firstly, the idea and concept of this movie are great. It's ridiculous but it's different and a unique take on the legend himself. The director/writer (Eshom Nelms) manages to somehow bring this legend and make him grounded in reality (sort of). Seeing Chris's/Santa's struggle with declining income due to lack of nice kids and having to not make toys but help the military is intriguing. You're watching this movie hoping to see how Chris/Santa overcomes this dilemma and you want to see him be fulfilled by the end. There is also the massive tension with the impending Hitman getting closer to discovering Santa's location that adds some thrills to the movie. The third act is also a blast to watch.Mel Gibson as the titular character is great casting as well. Mel doesn't phone it in and gives a genuinely strong performance. One moment that sticks in my mind is the part where Santa has to tell the elves that they have to work with the Military. Through Mel's eyes and his bodywork, he convincingly shows the audience how heartbreaking this is for Santa and its surprisingly quite moving. Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Ruth Cringle/Mrs Clause is also really good and her interactions with Chris Cringle/Santa (Mel Gibson) is where the heart of this movie is. The chemistry between the two is heartwarming and makes for an enjoyable watch when the two are together. Chris is grumpy and frustrated the world but Ruth gives him the words and encouragement he needs which is what keeps him together. Walton Goggins as Jonathan Miller the Hitman is good casting as well. He is quirky yet scary and Walton gives a good performance in conveying that.However, the movie does have some pacing issues and can feel quite slow at times. There are a lot of scenes that are just people walking that I feel could have been cut. Likewise, there are a couple of scenes involving the Hitman shopping which I don't think needed to be in the movie and slowed the pacing. Some scenes add to world-building but not the main narrative such as how elves work or how Santa is stronger than normal people. Nonetheless, the scenes don't amount to anything as Santa doesn't ever use his super strength or how the elves operate doesn't matter as they aren't that important to the main story. The 100-minute runtime could have been shortened by at least 10 minutes in my opinion.The movie also has a fair amount of tone clashes. When the movie begins with the kid, it feels like a family comedy. When it goes to the hitman the movie feels like a dark comedy and after getting the call to kill Santa it feels like a thriller. When it comes to Santa it is character-driven drama and then the third act is an action movie. The movie will constantly change perspective from Santa to the Hitman and occasionally to the kid leading to some jarring tone changes. It doesn't always mesh well and can be a bit annoying when it goes to the kid as those parts aren't as enjoyable as the other stuff.Overall, the movie is surprisingly enjoyable. Despite the absurd premise, the movie delivers a relatively entertaining movie with some potent and heartwarming scenes. It may not be a full-on action movie that marketing might lead you to believe but it is certainly a good time."}, {"id": 295, "text": "Just when you thought 2020 couldn't possibly get any weirder, along comes Fatman to make you realise once more that this is the year of the unexpected.The film no one asked for and the film that absolutely didn't need to be a thing, Fatman see's grumpy Aussie icon/villain Mel Gibson become Chris (aka real life pistol shooting Santa!) whose not only battling a problem to stay in business thanks to kids these days being naughty rather than nice but Walton Goggins St. Nick hating Skinny Man, whose been employed by Chance Hurtsfield's little brat Billy who wants Santa dead after he delivers him some coal for Xmas.It's an utterly bizarre set-up that in an even odder turn of events is played almost entirely straight by its cast and directing duo Eshom and Ian Nelms, who instead of letting their tale run rampant into black comedy and accept its idiotic narrative, choose to instead make sure Fatman is a straight faced incarnation of an Xmas movie that feels like a distant cousin to Bad Santa, sans jokes and overweight red heads.There's funny little moments in the film, Walton Goggins is going for it and his Skinny Man's hatred for Santa and kidnapping of science fair winning children needs to be seen to be believed, while mostly unexplored issues with Santa's elves and contracts with the military signal moments the film might've been able to really make things click into gear but a huge portion of the Nelms film feels like its only ever half-baked at best as its relatively by the numbers plotting takes hold.You can't help but feel disappointed by the fact that this bizarre oddity didn't manage to milk (and cookies) more out of the central concept of a grizzled Santa and Mrs. Clause fighting to remain viable in an ever changing landscape while its underutilized use of some game leading men makes you feel frustrated that the material they were working with wasn't able to maximize their commitment.As good as his been in years (not as though that's saying much) Mel Gibson appears to be having a lot of fun here under a significantly bushy beard and he against all the odds makes for a Santa you want to see more of while Goggins is doing a variation of his Vice Principals persona here that has made him a recognizable and reliable face when it comes to off-kilter characters that appear to be on the serial killer spectrum of human personas but they don't get much time together in the films brief 90 minute runtime, while there's a sense they're both never really given killer moments to work with in the film.Final Say -There was potential here for Fatman to be a pitch black Xmas comedy classic yet while it has brief moments of surreal goodness, its insistence to play things straight and eschew big laughs hurts its chances of achieving anything of a lasting nature despite its game leading men.2 pistol wielding Santa's out of 5"}, {"id": 296, "text": "I don't know how this movie got made, but I am really glad it did.This is a sick, violent, sophisticated thriller, and at the same time it is a dark comedy that had me laughing out loud, and at the same time it is a Christmas movie. In fact, it is one of the most poignant Christmas movies I have seen in years.Christmas has become commercial, because we have become commercial - we know what we want, and we just want more and more of it. So this movie shows Santa's workshop as an elaborate business, one that we are squeezing and taking advantage of. Santa is tired of it, but what can he do? He cannot ignore his omniscient view of people's morality (or their lack of it). He must adapt. But of course the greedy spoiled children of the world do not approve. They expected him to be a blank check, and one disappointed little boy finally goes too far and actually seeks revenge against Santa Claus.I have seen Christmas movies lately that tried to be dark comedies and ended up perverted and ugly (Krampus, Better Watch Out). But this movie does not lose sight of the moral that the best Christmas movies strive to achieve, the moral of morality itself, of goodness and care and simple compassion. Like the Grinch, like Ebenezer Scrooge, the Santa Claus in this movie has a kind heart that we can appreciate after he has rediscovered it.Does this message belong in a violent movie? Absolutely. In fact, that was what has been missing from so many soulless, choppy action movies these days: a heart. It's the heart that makes action movies like Die Hard and Terminator II so enduring.This movie is far from perfect, and yet it works almost seamlessly. The hitman didn't have much depth to him, he was almost a caricature, but I think that made him a good foil to Chris himself, who has a wife and a team of workers who respect him. I dislike Mel Gibson as a person but I have admitted that he makes some great movies, and he throws his all into this one. The comical absurdity of the movie made it seem preposterous at times, and I went with it. Like Julie Taymor's Titus, this movie goes over the top and knows it.I honestly wish they had come up with a better title for this movie, because when I first heard of it I just thought it sounded like a fist-brained parody of a Santa Claus origin story. It is not that, at all. I'm not sure what would have been a better title - Harder than Coal? I know titles can be tough, but Fatman really doesn't fit.I had trouble motivating myself to watch this movie, but I genuinely enjoyed it.

Starring Mel Gibson and Walton Goggins, it is an avant-garde take on the mythology of Santa Claus that only offers sporadic moments of entertainment.In North Peak, Alaska, Chris Cringle's (Mel Gibson) toy workshop is facing financial turmoil due to there being too many naughty children acting out of line. To help keep his business afloat, Chris partners with the US government to help them create the necessary parts for a top secret fighter jet. Meanwhile, a spoiled rich kid named Billy (Chance Hurstfield) swears revenge after receiving a lump of coal for Christmas and hires his personal hitman (Walton Goggins) to track Chris Cringle down and take him out.I've always found Christmas films to be an odd means of entertainment. The very concept of people waiting exclusively until the very end of the year to watch them seems so strange to me, as I like to watch movies at any time without that looming feeling over my head that it isn't the correct season to be enjoying them. With that said, I think most of them end up being hit-and-miss, with some that are considered classics, like Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life and some that are clearly intended as throwaways, like those countless made-for-TV Hallmark movies. Fatman, on the other hand, falls into neither of these categories, instead attempting to try something new with the genre but failing on almost every count. I'll admit what attracted me to it in the first place was its bizarre premise - a rugged, tough-as-nails Santa Claus fighting back against a skilled assassin. Sounds amusing enough, right? Well, that could have worked had the film played into this goofiness with the correct tone, and this is where it falls flat. This movie takes itself WAY too seriously, setting up the whole revenge story like a regular action thriller almost completely devoid of any humour. I can only really recall two moments where I chuckled slightly, and these weren't at any jokes but rather in disbelief at how brutally intense things played out. I'm not saying I expected a brilliant dark comedy filled with laugh-a-minute moments, but I did assume I would be smiling a whole lot more.Another major problem is the strange choices in editing. The film's first act sets itself up as a standard revenge thriller but then jarringly cuts to some awkward attempts at comic relief. None of these parts are funny nor do they make any sense leading into each other and it becomes highly distracting to the overall viewing experience. When a film can't completely decide what tone it is going for, it becomes near impossible to have any kind of attachment to what we are watching and this severs that important connection the filmmakers have with the audience. In other words, if the film doesn't know how it should feel, then those watching it won't know how to feel about it either. During my viewing, I couldn't help but think of better dark comedies like Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz which perfectly blended intense action with hilarious moments. Perhaps in the hands of someone like him this film could have worked better but one can only dream at this point.The only real thing that made this film watchable was its cast. As clumsily plotted as the rest of the story was, it's still somewhat amusing to see Mel Gibson play such a gritty, downtrodden version of Saint Nick in that typical style he often brings to his characters. With his dirty beard, skilled marksmanship, and a big belly, there's definitely something to be said about the veteran actor taking up a role like this so late in his career. Additionally, Walton Goggins was his usual sinister self as the hitman tasked with offing the eponymous character. Even though most of his schemes were ridiculously implausible, I was at least interested in seeing how he tracks Santa Claus down as though he were just another regular person and not a mythical being of folklore.In the end, this film had some decent ideas but terrible execution. To give credit where credit is due though, the filmmakers at least tried something different with the whole Christmas movie genre, but that doesn't mean the final result was worth the effort.

This lack of good boys and girls in turn has halved his U.S. government gift procurement stipend - like a federal Christmas stimulus program - Santa figures he adds three trillion to the U.S. economy - and he's in dire straits financially and contemplating retirement. Luckily, Uncle Sam sweeps in with an offer to have the elves build weaponry during the slow months, which Santa reluctantly accepts.You can pretty much forget that part of the movie though as the Army guys are totally unnecessary, and just added for some half-assed political commentary about the military industrial complex or something.The real antagonist comes not from Santa's budget, but from Walter Goggins, a Santa-hating hitman, who is hired by a disgruntled, spoiled child. Goggins is pretty great, even if he's a little all over the place, because the movie's a little all over the place. Apparently his hatred of Santa is somehow the result of his abusive childhood - he asked Santa for new parents? - but this is never fully explained and like the Army bit is just kind of unnecessary backstory.

The pace of the movie can seem a bit slow, because the real action doesn't start until the end of the movie. The build-up to this action is filled with scenes where Santa tries to adapt to his new way of life, the hit man trying to find out where Santa lives and the spoiled child checking the way things are going. If she had put a little less of these different storylines into the movie, the pace would have been a bit faster.The acting is done appropriately by the film cast. Mel Gibson comes out well in this movie as a bad version of Santa Claus. Together with Marianne Jean-Baptiste, he plays Santa Claus in a fun way with a suitable Santa Claus. Walton Goggins also plays a somewhat exaggerated hitman, who also hates Santa Claus himself. Chance Hurstfield also stands out as an annoyingly spoiled kid. Despite playing the role in a good way, his storyline does come across as an extra unnecessary storyline."}], "reviews_amount": 303}
