Everything in the movie is so good and captivating. I had an great weekend with my family watching this movie. What i really like in this movie is belowA) The way director portrayed the story B) Twists C) Screenplay D) Visuals - LocationsAll the best to the crew members. Good thing is that all you guys are working and apart from your busy schedules, you really took time and worked on this movie. Really a lot of Hardwork gone thru .. I really appreciate all of you and Good Luck!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "It's a copy of Forgotten- 2017 Korean movie. However, it is a great attempt. Cinematography is at its best. The actors didn't act well and doesn't look realistic. Please take it as a constructive feedback."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Very rarely we see psychological and psycho thrillers in telugu. But debutant Kiran gave a neat thriller. Though lead actors faces aren't convincing at first they make us get involved later. Bgm , Cinematography and Visuals are highlight with limited budget. First half is a bit weak with slow pace. Few twists are good. Slow pace overall. Overall a neat thriller by a debutant."}, {"id": 4, "text": "One the best movies in recent time. Give it a watch"}, {"id": 5, "text": "I found the movie good until a point when it seemed so stupid and silly. The father and Meera were trying to escape from an injured man and left a barrel gun right in his hands for him to chase and shoot. Father disarmed him in the snow later but again left him with that gun and started running. Wtf was this?! I won't even mention how absurd this seemed. Again it is shown the Adithi was given was oxygen and other supplies for god knows what reason when the villain duo had already decided to murder her before putting her in the trunk. The last scene made no sense how that trunk metal banged as the driver Laxman had already shot Rishi in the chest from behind and RIshi was dead for sure. Everything was good apart from these silly plotholes. They ruin such good plots with so stupid things."}, {"id": 6, "text": "This is the worst movie ever seen and looks like the movie maker has lot of friends who reviewed it well and am sure they did it against their will.

Special commendation to Mr. Bhargava (Arjun), who is not an actor but a full time senior Google employee!

The father, arjun (bhargav) is a complete showrunner and an amazing actor. Unlike the big budget movies with big name actors the story is fresh and engaging. The climax gets a little dragged but is essential to the entire plot to connect the dots. I've really enjoyed this movie and don't let others spoil the story for you. The story, direction and cinematography are really awesome."}, {"id": 18, "text": "This movie has kept me engaged all along. The camera work is superb and actors were great.

I had high expectations and the film met them. What's Good: 1. The story is great. India makes very few suspense thriller movies and a good suspense thriller movie is an exception. This film is one such exception. 2. The performance of all actors is good. 3. The first half of the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. After that a huge twist comes and you see a flashback. You start thinking the film is becoming predictable but it isn't. The director plays with your mind constantly till the end. 4. There are no songs in the film because the film didn't require them. Due to that the length is 1 hour and forty odd minutes only. What's bad: 1. Although the story is great and unpredictable, after watching the whole movie some people like me will feel it has a lot of happy coincidences which doesn't happen in real life."}, {"id": 46, "text": "The cinematic experience was amazing and this thriller grips your attention until the reveal(s) :).

Kudos to the entire crew."}, {"id": 48, "text": "Kudos to the entire team of Gatham for making this Suspense, Psychic thriller movie. At times when you think that this particular character is the main villain then comes the twist and turn and the plot proves you wrong.

But I was proven wrong first things the movie has basics right, Actors did good and story and movie is very engaging and good run time as well. Then the visuals were great, very good locations, some of the best cars as well. I seriously wished to know the budget of the film and if this can be made at a low budget like I assume it's a lesson for some of the commercial movies on what they could make at less budget.

Its as if they just made the movie because crime thrillers are a trend now. Recently a lot of movies are coming up like this. Some psycho committing crimes in a foreign country. Many scenes which happens in the movie feels out of place. So many things are just added to the movie to make the story and none of it makes sense. Also everything happens in a hurry in the movie.

I'm never reading film reviews in newspapers, especially from 'the Hindu'.It's a very predictable film. When I say predictable, I mean PREDICTABLE- so much so that it actually annoys you. The acting is stupefying, never seen a film that has worse acting.It calls itself a thriller, haha that's funny. This film will now come to mind every time I come across the word 'thriller' -and I'm sure I'll shudder in terror. Ugh I'm scarred for life.Recalling the film is a torture, I go through this anyway to prevent further agony for all you innocent people who have no clue how excruciating this junk is. Oh brothers and sisters, I hope you take my suggestion, if you don't, I pity you. :p"}, {"id": 81, "text": "With no new movies releasing, movie buffs are having hard time to look out for fresh content....and here is a gem that comes along knocking on Amazon Prime. I started with looking out for a story that can keep you engaged. The production quality, camera shorts that are of international standards pulled my interest. This first was obvious in the opening credits where the scenes are shot with an aerial view. The director Kiran Reddy is knows his job very well. We see a deep influence from Hollywood but that works in favour of the movie as most of the movie markers are in the USA. The movie has its aha moments with twists and turns that can leave you stunned. The lead actor Bhargava Poludasu comes in as a surprise and his transformation to the central character is seamless. He definitely acted with restraint and someone to look out for in future. The other actor Rakesh Galebhe with his looks like Atif Aslam, confuses us for some time, works well for the movie. The movie stayed with me for a while. And somewhere the movie strikes a balance on morality, revenge saga, thriller. If you are searching for content, this movie is will not disappoint at all. Good work Gatham team!"}, {"id": 82, "text": "I think I just saw one of the most irritating films of the year. This is on par with Nishabdam, in its execution of story. Although, this makes more sense than that trash. There is not much story here as half of the film is spent on flashbacks. The main conflict is about a father trying to find his daughter, who probably got murdered at the hands of her boyfriend. And that plot is stretched out to a mind-numbing length of a film, that leaves you exhausted rather than intrigued. The antagonist is one of the most bland and caricature-ish villains put in a Telugu film. By the end of the film, he comes off as laughable. I couldn't stand the actor that played him. The story lacks any urgency and conflict, after the first 20-30 min, since it's all a flashback. And the flashback also has not much urgency, as the protagonists are more worried about getting the information out of the antagonist who's asleep, rather than actually search for the missing daughter. And there are many logical loopholes that you want to go like, Wait! He could've easily done that. She could've easily taken the gun away from him and escaped. And stuff that gives away the dumbness of the proceedings. The beautiful camerawork and the bgm just exist as a gloss, than actually serving the story. Strictly a one time watch for the indie effort, because you may forgot your Gatham and get a headache if you watch it once again."}], "reviews_amount": 83}
