There is plenty of comedy moments mixed with gore and likeable characters. Enjoy beautiful Polish forest."}, {"id": 1, "text": "This movie revolves around a little group of youngsters who have to camp in the woods to overcome their childhood trauma's and electronic devices addiction. This adventure goes sour very fast when they encounter the local monsters. The monsters are very well made, the costumes and prostheses are very convincing and very funny. For a country that has no worthwhile movie industry whatsoever this is a very good accomplishment."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This film caused quite an outrage in Poland mostly due to it's clear link to a film The 2 who stole the moon starring 2 twin kids who later became the president and prime minister of Poland. The two monsters, two evil twins clearly link to that very film on top of other hidden political pokes.Overall it's an entertaining and fun picture which doesn't reinvent the genre wheel but is a lot more of an homage to the 80s. In a country that produced like 5 genre films over the last 50 years, I consider it a first, successful step in the right direction. So don't be fooled by haters, who keep saying that Polish cinema is not allowed to make silly, commercial horror films. Especially commercial films that criticize their own country.I'm actually surprised the film wasn't burned at stake in a country like Poland. On mediakrytyk website (which is pretty much a Polish version of rotten tomatoes) the film scores 68% positive out of 74 reviews from pretty much all Polish newspapers/websites.Anyhow, if you like classic slashers, this one is a fun watch. A cool flick, full stop."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Saw this movie on Netflix yesterday and thought at first that it is some comedy movie (because of the title and cover) but it turned out to be a perfectly well dont horror movie. I was even more excited after knowing it was shot in poland (i am from germany) because there are not many horrormovies made in the EU in the last decades.the actors are professional troughout the movie. i dont see a difference to any hollywood or big budget independent movie at all.The writing is - especially in the first third of the movie - very original. You think about some clich\u00e8 but the writing goes in another direction just at the right moment. for example, in every american slasher movie, the muscular dude is a bully. hes not a bully in this one. in fact hes a virgin and he dies first (clich\u00e8 would be that virgins die last). There are many more examples like this where i thought that it seems that the writer intentionally broke clich\u00e8 and i likethat very much about the movie.color grading, sfx, music, camera and so on, are all top level. Creature design, too and i really liked it. Music has ben done very well and i wonder which track they used sometimes throughout the movie that seems uplifting and joyful, really like this melody.As for comparisons, i would put this movie higher than any friday the 13th movie. this movie could easily be in the same row as the hills have eyes remake or wrong turn (the first part) which i really really like, but it has a few (and really only a few) downsides....Once you let the horror start, never let it stop again! This is something, every horror director has to learn (including myself, i made 2 movies up to now (FPS : First Person Shooter and Hellstone). I appreciate the background story of the two mutants but thought it was a bit too detailed. Regarding the alien infection this reminded me of the x-files or venom (the black stuff) and i think it would have been way better if the asteroid had just glowed or maybe released some radiation or dust. After all, pace is everything and there are 2 ways to pin people to their seats. 1. slow and steady suspension (like in shining or high tension from alexandre aja 2. a explosion of horror that does not stop til the movie is over like in evil dead. Those are just some suggestions to the writer, though he really did a great job on the movie.All in all, i was really happy that i found this movie on netflix and i think that mr. kowalski (and the team involved) has got great talent and i hope that he will pursue filmmaking further and i look forward to future movies of him and the team.Great work !!!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "It's Polish, and I tried watching it in German, with subs, and the original language as well, but turned to English eventually.It resembled a lot of familiar horror movies, like f.i. Wrong Turn, as mentioned.But it's not bad. It does have it's gory moments, and I liked it.It's not great, but also not bad."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Let's just get it out of the way now. The movie is clich\u00e9 in every way possible, so what! The story takes place in a camp in the woods of Poland while trying to rehabilitate technology addicted teens. Simple premise. The acting is good IMO. The standout being Julia Wieniawa as Zosia. A few others on top of being clich\u00e9 were just downright annoying, but not enough to deter my score. The music cues were a nice touch. The cinematography was splendid tbh. Great shots and angles. The violence was wonderful with awesome kills and genuinely creepy, but dope monster/creature designs that I haven't seen in a few years. I definitely recommend giving it a try and watch it in its nature language; don't go right to English if you're fine with reading subtitles. The immersion is far better, but that's me! Solid addition to Netflix."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Under the layer of an archetypical slasher movies there's a strong political statement that some people fail to recognize. The story of two twin brothers is a clear link to The Two Who Stole The Moon and that's just a start.

If that's something that doesn't bother you, I do recommend this movie though. It's just hard for me to get past."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Those reviews are obviously by friends and family of the filmmaker.This film is bad, really bad. It tries to be a horror/comedy, but never really horrors and is NEVER funny. It is almost a high school play's version of 'Hills Have Eyes'. It manages to hit every single horror clich\u00e9, but instead of being clever and witty like 'Cabin in the Woods' it comes off as just stupid plot devices. There is nothing to praise about this movie, even the gore is second rate."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Well worth your time! I was never bored with this movie, it moved along at a good pace. There are plenty of gory scenes and the killings were absolutely brutal. They did a good job of building up the suspense and the characters were well developed. The storyline might remind you of Wrong Turn but was original enough to keep you guessing. I highly recommend this movie if you want to see a good horror movie!"}, {"id": 11, "text": "I was looking forward to seeing this movie and now that I've watched it I feel that much dumber, I think they ripped off at least a half a dozen other horror movie scenes. It's like the old jokes when we were kids how many pollacks does it take........ lol"}, {"id": 12, "text": "I like how the film pays homage to the horror genre. As one of the main characters Julek points out, there are many clich\u00e9s throughout. There are stereotypical representations of the teens. You can easily guess that they, along with their camp guide, are going to die one by one except for Zosia who has a deeper backstory. Some of the characters do evolve, but they lack depth.Also, there are some plot holes/inconsistencies that I felt make the movie rather complete. My questions:1. What happened to the twins' father? I see a picture of him and his wife, but there is no mention of him. 2. How does the postman make it out alive? 3. What is the context of the meteorite, and what about the black goo coming out of it? 4. How does Barket survive that deformed monster? 5. What becomes of Zosia? 6. What about the suspicious priest? 7. What happened to the rest of the camp participants?I'm not a big fan of gore and killings, but I feel like they should make a sequel to answer all these questions. My take to stream it or skip it: if you have nothing better to do on a quiet night and just want to kick back and relax (or perhaps get a few laughs), stream it. Skip the popcorn though, because there's a lot of red in it."}, {"id": 13, "text": "This movie was dissappointing. It was like someone mixed wrong turn, hills have eyes and scream together and said, okay, this is good enough, let's make a movie out of it.

The younger members of the casts acting wasn't bad but that's the only positive"}, {"id": 19, "text": "Bartosz Kowalski's W Lesie Dzis Nic Zasnie Nikt (2020) works neither as a proper homage to the vintage, nor an inventive satire on its themes. Sadly, it's not even remotely entertaining either.Admittedly, horror has been the domain of American and Asian cinema. Indeed, the argument could be made that European moviegoers were spoiled by the foreign influx. That, however, shouldn't mean that in-house productions are all trash. Thanks to people such as Robert Eggers, Ari Aster, Julia Ducournau and Ben Wheatley, horror fans in Europe begin to get choosy too. So, in order to make the headlines, you really have to push the envelope. Polish director Bartosz Kowalski couldn't stray further away from that goal.Kowalski's anchor is an almost mute character Zosia. She's played by Polish juvenile celebrity Julia Wieniawa-Narkiewicz, whose bland, uninterested face speaks volumes about the whole film. Furthermore, it's also her poorly developed arch, which doesn't help the inexperienced actress build a role worth investing in. And since that's the only emotional leverage up Bartosz Kowalski's sleeve, you get the picture.Let's be honest - nobody watches slashers for agitated debates on the meaning of life or character development. If anything, it's the bloodshed that counts.The gore and scares in W Lesie Dzis Nic Zasnie Nikt (2020) are stylistically close to the Wrong Turn movies. It's largely over-the-top, with bodies cut in two, beaten up against a tree and minced. So, the blood's there, but style isn't.That too leaves W Lesie Dzis Nic Zasnie Nikt (2020) far from modern masterpieces. Thee visible budget constraints play their part here, yet a few horrors succeeded despite facing similar issues. Look at Creep (2015), and the legendary The Blair Witch project (1999) to grasp what I'm getting there. These films were brilliant in avoiding the formulaic paths. For Bartosz Kowalski, sticking his head out means leaving his comfort zone. And the director is clearly not ready for that kind of commitment.Eventually, this entire effort is just as fruitless as this camp that tries to convert kids from online to offline. One tedious slasher won't change the European horror game. But in the of W Lesie Dzis Nic Zasnie Nikt (2020) case, that actually may be a good thing."}, {"id": 20, "text": "The film is not for everyone but is definitely a great piece of entertainment."}, {"id": 21, "text": "A nice horror film which, paying tribute to classic horror films, plays with Polish politics.

It's about some boys who go to a technology disconnect camp and in the forest some evil twins attack and eat them. Quality. Parsimonious obscenely. The first half is boring in the extreme. The original idea of the camp and what it entails has potential but only that. Unnecessary sexual scenes. It falls into cliches. With absurd and pointless moments, like the story they try to develop. There are scenes that are disgusting and not scary, you see all the organs of the murdered. Underdeveloped characters that are only there to die for. Some effects are good and some are lousy.

Very much a Polish Wrong Turn, with a bit of Cabin in The Woods mixed in. It takes a bizarre twist, when we learn how things came to be, and there are enough shocking moments.A few times we hear points about how it is for people in Poland, being gay etc. It seems that the writer and producer wanted to make a few points.Clich\u00e9s apart, rather good. 7/10."}, {"id": 31, "text": "But not from America this time around, but from Poland, Europe.

The trailer and opening had the late 70s/ 80s style of horror music on which grabbed me. There are some funny parts that I'm not sure if it was meant to be funny, or it's just my sense of humour. I'll just say this without saying too much. It's a camp where teens are sent to because they're addicted to technology and their devices. Funny enough premise? I think so. The movie is from Poland and is dubbed into English or at least the version I watched. I normally prefer subtitles but for an old school style horror film, the English dub made it that much more fun. It does have an old school horror vibe to it. I call it fast food horror that gets pumped out around Halloween. It wasn't bad for 4 in the morning.

I guess the supernatural part is how the brothers can't be killed but they also threw in a sci fi meteorite that could explain this. I came to the reviews to see if anyone understood how Bartek got away from one of the mutants only to be killed by the mailman but then I remembered they never explained how the mailman lived either. I even went to the wiki which goes from Bartek being discovered by the killer then jumps to him killed by the mailman as if the killer only wanted to play hide and seek. It also never explained why the mutant brothers were allowed to continue living in their house after taking the mailman's legs 30 years earlier.

The cinematography and framework should be a case study for any indiefilmmakers wanting to delve into the horror genre.The direction, and effort from cast and crew are to be commended. This is a fun ride and delivers on all fronts in terms of what audiences want from what I would call a Monster in the House genre .1. You have the monster(s) 2. the house, being some remote teen camp and forest area in poland where kids go to get free from their addiction to technology. 3. The Sin - which maybe the story is trying to take a look at peoples addictionsI like the protagonist a young girl who has lost her parents in a car accident, and her sidekick successful gamer/streamer who has amassed a huge following but needs to grower braver in the real world.I loved following these characters as they get deeper into trouble.My real criticism with the story is more around the origin story of the Monsters. Its a little too close to the Venom origin story ... hopefully it doesnt end it a lawsuit. From a unknown planet, Venom was a symbiote that was sent from a meteor that crashed landed on Earth in New York. It came into contact with Spider-Man and when it did, it changed Spider-Man's appearance and personality.I recommend this film!"}, {"id": 53, "text": "476. Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight. Well, I loved it! I mean the title is a total lie, everyone sleeps the night this takes place, well, except for two, but we will get back to them later. The main premise is this, a bunch of tech addicted teenagers are sent off to a camp called Adrenaline to detox. We follow a smaller group comprised of: Hot girl, hot guy, gay guy, fat nerd video game guy, the girl that doesn't quite fit in with the rest and in the lead an outdoorsy looking counselor, and off they go for a several days long journey into the woods, tech free. As nighttime falls and they start to set up their tents and stuff things seem to be going rather well... until... light spoilers ahead... Hot guy can't sleep, so he heads down to the lake to, oh no, to use his forbidden cell phone he snuck in, and even worse... a marijuana cigarette!! Suddenly out of the darkness he's startled by Hot girl, she partakes in the marijuana cigarette as well, and through some casual flirting she discovers Hot guy is a virgin! So, she quickly remedies that and heads back off to her tent. Hot guy now with a smile on his face settles down in his sleeping bag, when he's startled once again, only this time it's a local man, a large grotesque local man, who, in a very Jason Voorhees-esque move, picks up the sleeping bag and slams it against a tree and drags the body away. The next morning when the gang discovers Hot guy missing and start freaking out, Hot girl confesses to their deed and they go to check things out. That is when, Girl who doesn't quite fit in with the others notices blood on a tree, and thus begins the race out of the woods to stay alive!! First half of the movie has definite Friday the 13th vibes. But this one adds a little something extra to the backstory of the killer, which I enjoyed as an interesting little twist to a familiar tale. The soundtrack and the cinematography in this one is really great. The Girl who doesn't quite fit in with the others, Zosia, was great. Earlier on, Fat Nerd guy, Jurek, compares her to Sarah Connor at one point and as the movie goes on the comparisons keep growing. Jurek also seems to be a fan of the horror movie genre, much like Randy from Scream, he seems to aware of the rules they are breaking if they were in a horror movie. So if you put Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a bit of X-Files: 'Home' into a blender, you'd get something like this. A super fun gory slasher flick!!

So we get all the stereotypes as well among the potential victims, however this time a few of them actually have interesting character-traits so you feel for them and want them to survive. The story is filled with gaping holes (what's wrong with that priest and what is that liquid oozing out of the meteor!?), but involving anyway and tries also to blend in a bit of criticism against certain things in the current situation in Poland. These jabs are maybe a bit clumsy at times, but seem sincere. And having evil twins as monsters is probably pointing a finger towards the political twins Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski! Even though that the movie at times is a bit slow-moving, I was actually hooked from beginning to end. The gore-effects, when they come, are good and will satisfy gore-hounds. The acting is okay, but make sure not to watch the english-dubbed version, the voices are terrible and make the actors seem worse than they are!

It's like you're watching horror movies that you already know, so the whole thing is hardly surprising and definitely not creative. What is surprising, though, is the soundtrack - suffice it to say that it's weird... Reminds me of The Goonies from 1985. And the 'monsters' were created quite well. I was really glad to see a lot of new faces on the screen. Surely, this wasn't the debut for some of the young actors, but still it was entertaining to see new talents. I quite enjoyed it, although there were two or three moments when I couldn't help laughing out loud since the scene was so predictable or out of common sense. Watching this film you really need to stop analysing and thinking - just enjoy what you're served.

This being the first Polish produced film I have ever seen, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the acting. Over all the effects are good, though there were some issues with a severed head and the prosthetics that the killers wear.The negatives; The movie is like every other horror that has come before, the groups is slowly killed until there is but one lone survivor, and you can tell who that will be pretty much from the beginning. The only other negative I could see was the afore mentioned issues with the effects, up and until the ending. There is a scene at the end after you think the movie is done.

I couldn't help thinking that more could of been made of the woods itself and the plot develops too quickly.

The main value to this movie comes from its soundtrack. I would usually give a slasher this generic either a 3 or a 4. However, the soundtrack really sticks out and helps bump this slasher up to a 5. At times, there will be music that sounds straight out of a 1950s UFO movie. It appears as a quixotic choice at first, but will make sense as the movie develops. Other than the music, the movie scores points for protagonists I found myself caring about as well as decent kills. However, the killers in this movie are very unmemorable and this criticism applies to the entire plot too. On the whole, there are better slasher in the woods options to watch.

No. Its a just an unoriginal one. Echoes of Friday 13th, Halloween, Deliverance, Wrong Turn, and other's in a similar vein, are everywhere to be seen. Indeed, it even admits as much, so its not taking itself too seriously.Acting and pacing are on target. The setting works too. Where more attention was needed, was in the creative fright department. The build up of existential threat and menace, is pretty nominal and the inevitable deaths, when they occur, feel pedestrian. This film is more gory than anything else. A fact which, on its own, soon gets a little predictable and at times, tiresome.So yes, this film does have just enough to be passable as a functioning horror.

I get the idea where the makers are paying tribute to all the slasher movies of the 80s and I kinda liked the idea but the execution is a big let down. The plot is the same old where you have a group of teenagers getting lost in a forest and you have someone chasing them.There are plenty of violence and gore scenes. Cutting, chopping...all in. Mind you, there is no problem with the bloodfest but adds nothing scary or exciting. The story is a dull affair too where you are stuck with plenty of cliche scenes and cliche acting. The villain or the monster here is cringy and looks really-really stupid.The background music plays a very important role in a horror movie and this is where the makers have gone wrong by adding a music score that is more cringy and less spooky or chilly.If you just need a slasher or bloodfest kinda screen time then go ahead and enjoy it.

Surprisingly the villains are the odd part in this one. Usually the villains make the movie, especially in horror, but they sort of phoned in the origin story for this one.They could have just left out the space rock and it would have been fine. The look of the villains is more gross than scary, and they don't play up traditional horror setups to raise anxiety in the audience.Despite the failures and lack of personalities in the villains, the cast picks up some of the slack, with Julia Wieniawa-Narkiewicz carrying most of the movie."}, {"id": 119, "text": "Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight : Polish horror film.A Bootcamp for teens addicted to social media, gaming, no phones, tablets, laptops are allowed.

Let's begin with the pros, well, the setting of the movie is a real bullseye! You can feel the nostalgia while watching a movie that takes place in a forest, especially in the area of a lake. It's as if you were part of that movie, pulls you into it, perhaps. Moreover, the actors (I'm quite familiar with both main female protagonists of this movie) performed really well, maybe lost the pace here and there, but overall, it was quite pleasant watching them. What's more, the dubbing was spot on, really well done!Let's move on to the cons, the first one is the actual storyline, it is focusing on a group of kids in the middle of nowhere; cut off from the entire world and 2 human creatures that are hunting them down, one by one. The human type creatures sort of resemble the fat green monster that lives in a swamp, yes, shrek. Really disappointed with such antagonists, they aren't interesting whatsoever. If instead of those creatures we saw a killer on the loose, I'd be hitting that 8 or even 9/10. In addition, some of the secondary protagonists are just flat characters, nothing special and quite boring! Last but not least, most scenes are very predictable, so there is no wow factor.To sum up, I do recommend this movie for the nostalgia that it builds and the setting, but definitely not for the storyline.
