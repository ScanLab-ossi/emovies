{"name": "David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet", "titleId": "tt11989890", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "David Attenborough has been a part of my life since I first started watching nature programmes when I was a very little boy (I was born 1968)In nearly 70 years of film making he has pretty much visited every place possible on the planet and travelled millions (literally) of miles to do so.He has never failed to awe and wow us with the wonders of the planet.So when SIr David, at the age of 94, makes a new, one off film with the strapline My witness statement, you have to sit up and take notice.I decided to see this on it's release date in the cinema, to really immerse myself in the wonders of the world on a big screen.The film opens with Sir David in the ruins of Chernobyl where he shows the results of ONE stupid, mammoth mistake and then leads into the state of the world today.SIr David takes you on a journey through his life, showing population levels, CO2 levels and %age of the planet still classed as WILD each time. He presents the facts in his warm caring style but showing a picture of how bad things have got.STATISTIC : Of all the animal biomass on earth, 60% is estimated to be human livestock, 36% humans and a mere 4% for everything else.The narration pauses with about 30s of silence and the look on his face says everthing - no acting just a man looking back over the years - brought a lump to my throat.But after all the doom and gloom he says This is my witness statement. But it doesn't end there, we can fix this and I'll tell you howFo the second part he talks about all the ways we can, as a world and a species, start to fix things and put them right. But these are not just pie-in-the-sky methods, he talks and shows about how positive change is ALREADY happening. Watch for the examples from the Netherlands &amp; Costa Rica.He talks about the human population peaking and how we can make this happen sooner by actually IMPROVING people's lives - no draconian fertility laws, just the course of nature.SO he ends on a positive note - he really believes we can fix this and based on the fact Costa Rica DOUBLED its jungle and forest cover after mass deforestation in just 25 years and when you see how nature has reclaimed Chernobyl it will hearten you too.The fixes don't require us to deny ourselves but to manage things BETTER and in fact if we do things BETTER we will have even more.Now we just have to get our politicians, especially the deniers, to wake up and DO SOMETHING.I honestly believe that anyone who gives this show a negative or neutral review or rating (under 6) either has completely missed the point OR is a denier and there is no hope for them at the moment.Final thought - Many scientists have said that the lost of biodiversity on the planet at the moment is so great and so rapid that it has to be classed at the 6th Great Extinction Event the planet has suffered in the 4.5 billion year history. Whatever happens, life WILL flourish again, but the question will be, Will humans be part of it or will we go the way of the dinosaurs?"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Unbelievable, I have watched many documentaries over the years on natural history and climate change. But this is the nail in the coffin. The final hurrah. This should be shown in schools and so many more places for education.

I have children. I hope, in due course, to have grandchildren. What sort of world will they live in?Attenborough's message is not new, though coming from him we *have* to believe it. The planet's heading for disaster. And yet he says it's not too late.That last bit I find hard to believe. Life on Earth, Attenborough says, will survive, in some form or another. Humanity might not.I wonder if we deserve to?"}, {"id": 13, "text": "When Sir David Attenborough makes a documentary and calls it his witness statement you have to watch it, there's no good reason why anyone shouldn't watch this one. The documentary begins with shots from present day Chernobyl where humanity has long gone and now nature is taking hold of it. Sir David time lapses through his career and talks about how the actions of humans have put the planet Earth in jeopardy, how the biodiversity is being lost and how the climate changes are being proven catastrophic not only for the species around us but for ourselves too. In the second half, he talks about what'll happen if we continue the trajectory we are on right now, the result is something which no one would want to happen, afterwards he gives account as to how it doesn't have to be that way and how there's still something which not only we can do but we must because we have no other choice, the ending makes you gloomy about what humanity has done with Mother Earth and at the same time very hopeful and determined more than ever that we are going to make things better. A species can only thrive when everything else around it thrives too ... This is not about saving our planet, it's about saving ourselves."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Any nature fans must watchCalling the film (streaming on Netflix) his witness statement for the environment, David Attenborough goes on to trace his more than 60-year career as a naturalist, mapping how steeply the planet's biodiversity has degenerated before him. Global air travel was new when he began his work, and footage of him as a young producer encountering exotic flora and fauna lends a moving, even haunting, note to his plea to restore ecological balance.We can turn this around."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Having watched David Attenborough for numerous years and his love for the natural world which has manifested in the form of great documentaries, I must attest his message is extemely important.Humanity has a choice; to either continue as we are and run ourselves into an unsustainable and bleak future or to make amends now, in the hope that our future generations continue to thrive in a world we have all long enjoyed.Change doesn't start with educating or influencing governments or politicians, it starts with each one of us. If we all made the effort to make small changes to not only our lifestyle but our mindset then perhaps it is not too late.Everyone should watch this, and is duty bound to educate our younger generations."}, {"id": 16, "text": "This film is astonishing. It serves as a greatest hits of Attenborough's career, featuring some of the greatest wilderness shots ever put on camera. It doubles as a powerful statement about the direction we've taken our planet, and examines the choices the human species has to make. I've never felt such awe, sadness and hope in the space of minutes, or sometimes simultaneously. This is Attenborough's most powerful film because it examines the very essence of humanity, and our unbreakable relationship with the world he has spent his life researching. A must watch"}, {"id": 17, "text": "This magnificent piece of cinematic art is informative and beautiful, but at the same time sobering and heartbreaking. I cannot recommend watching this enough!"}, {"id": 18, "text": "''The saddest, yet most hopeful film I've ever seen. This man is not only a national hero, he is an hero for the whole world.

This review sincerely says what I want to say. Thank you very much for inspiring new generations. As a 19-year-old teenager, I have been fighting plastic pollution and climate change every day since my childhood and convey your invitation to people. I will never forget my dear David Attenborough and his testament. Show everyone you know about this documentary and the facts about our world, even if they are not interested in nature. Nature has no owner, country, or religion. It belongs to everything that exists on it. Yes, I cried too."}, {"id": 19, "text": "This is the best thing I have ever watched. Everybody needs to watch it, it articulates the planet's issues so beautifully. David Attenborough is a god send. The storytelling makes me feel so simultaneously desperately pessimistic and yet so hopeful. If only all humanity could watch and appreciate this."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I knew his voice from my childhood when my father were watching his film but never know him until today. This documentary made me cry and now I feel more responsible for our planet for future generations and my kids. Highly recommended to everyone to watch.I think all governments in this world needs to start educating people more serious about our planet life. Today, C19 taking people life and if we all don't make act humanity has no longer exists in future. I gonna start change myself with small things to care more and we all need to care more."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Ignoring this movie should be criminal.

Sir David personal witness statement to the planet and a urgent message to us to change the way we life for our own sake.

I really hope humanity choose the right path toward a better sustainable future"}, {"id": 33, "text": "Words can't describe how shocking, stunning, amazed and horrified I felt while watching this film. My tears dropped when I saw the earth from outer space, when the blue whale blowing water, and the coral reef turned white. It's an extremely powerful message to us all, from the earth, from the legendary David Attenborough. Remaining Wilderness of 2020: 35%"}, {"id": 34, "text": "A must watch. Heart breaking. Encourage everyone you know, young &amp; old to watch this program."}, {"id": 35, "text": "As much I love all nature documentaries of David Attenborough, this latest movie is without doubt my favorite, even if it wasn't as delightful or 'rich' in its animal shots.Simply going along with the timeline of Attenborough growing older, we see how the nature is destroyed by our exploitation, how other beings suffer from pur expansion, how the remained wilderness has dropped from 66% in 1937 to 35% today. 70% of the birds existing now are domestic chicken fed in tiny cells to be eaten. Only 4% of the existing animals on earth are not grown by human to service ourselves. But he's not just warning, he is giving out solutions and bringing up attention. Watching him being 93, walking around Chernobyl, looking back at his old times, and making such immense effort to spread his words, I feel very touched and lucky.I strongly recommend the documentary as I am so touched myself by his work that I cried while watching. After all the nature will always rebuild itself with or without human. But if we want to survive and protect our civilization, we have no choice but learn to take care of the nature."}, {"id": 36, "text": "Everyone on Earth needs to see this amazing film.

He will pass away without knowing if it is going to be fixed. I am so sad I just want to bawl my eyes out."}, {"id": 39, "text": "David Attenborough is a personal hero of mine and I must admit I've never seen him like this. I've known for a long time that we're destroying our planet and ive lived in ignorance.

This is one of my favorite documentaries of all time and I would recommend it to everyone."}, {"id": 52, "text": "As David explained, the urge to change is bigger than ever. Everybody should watch this documentary, Our planet, and all the other fenomal works of Sir David, to feel an live by the urge to change."}, {"id": 53, "text": "This was one of the most powerful documentaries I have ever watched. Here we have David Attenborough, 94 years old, giving us his life testimony, his story. But it isn't just a testimony of his life, it isn't just his story. It is a part of the life testimony of human kind as a whole, seen through his eyes, during the part of history he's been a part of.The conclusion of his life experiences, experiences which excels most other's, is explicit. Nature is developing in the wrong direction and we need to take action on a global scale now. If not, destructive cumulative effects will trigger each other one after another and the degradation of nature will increase exponentially to a stage where we are left incapable of changing the outcome.At this stage the documentary could have ended. It would have left the viewer with a bad conscience, yet a powerful message. But no, that is not the way of David Attenborough. He is an optimist, not a pessimist. Despite being a front row witness to human kinds extensive abuse of nature he is optimistic. Despite being 94 years of age he wants to contribute. With this documentary he gives us his wisdom, his contribution.What do I feel after watching this documentary? I feel optimistic. I feel a desire to contribute. And I feel David Attenborough is a true legend."}, {"id": 54, "text": "A lifetime witness statement on the wanton destruction of our planet. I can't think of anyone more qualified to set out the perils we face if we choose to continue without a huge readjustment to how we ALL live. David Attenborough always gives us hope citing a way forward but it is obvious in this film his sense of utter despair. If you care about the 'tomorrow' which most world leaders believe never comes, this is a MUST watch film. With a sense of optimum, maybe there will be enough of us that will act on its message to make a difference."}, {"id": 55, "text": "This film is unbelievably moving. It blew my mind. I thought I knew what global warming and climate change were, but I knew nothing. Yet it's very optimistic and provides solutions as to how we can save mankind.

Start by sharing this movie and rate it up!"}, {"id": 57, "text": "After joining Instagram and making all of us surprised, David Attenborough introduced their new document. A thinkable document. A Life on Our Planet gives us a general information about what is going on on our planet? The way sir David narrate is lovely. The sudden changes of beautiful pictures into ugly and gloomy pictures may shock you so you will find what the real disaster is and also you will realize that we need immediate changes in every aspect of our lives. In addition, in world environment day the theme of 2020 was said biodiversity and the importance of biodiversity was shown well in this film. I figure out the hopeful perspective that A Life on Our Planet gives us. Sir David states his solution for solving problems. The look simple but they are effective so instead nagging all the time, face with problems. Another thing that we can mention is there is no hyperbole in this film. I can summarize this film just in four words: important, simple, short and helpful."}, {"id": 58, "text": "David and team have given me hope beyond reason that we can save and restore our beautiful planet. I have not felt this empowered in a long time and I now know what I aspire to do in life, Help Lead the Change!

The visuals and its messages are striking, exhilirating, realistically morbid but at the same time offer a glimpse of hope.

Human population growth has seen growth rates like never before, and many people are unaware of how this growth has negatively affected our planet. I, too, was unaware until watching this documentary. This is why this movie is at the top of my list of recommendations to any person who wants to become educated on climate change. Anything from why it occurs, One of the main reasons why I found this documentary so compelling was that Attenborough uses undeniable evidence to show that humans are the cause of an overworked planet. This masterful camera shots, numerical evidence, and scientific data all support a narrative that becomes increasingly clear as the documentary continues.Another way that he presents his case is through by presenting the negative effects that are already prevalent on our planet. The rising sea level and temperature has come at a cost that is rapidly reaching a point of no return. Should we reach that point, living on Earth would become increasingly difficult as sea levels rise and temperatures continue to rise at a steady rate. One numerical way that Attenborough provides evidence to support his claim is by pointing out the stark decline in biodiversity as human population growth reached exponential levels. The loss of biodiversity negatively affects us because it harms our relationships with the planet. It changes the rhythm of the seasons and the change of resources between the living and the nonliving. Attenborough's goal is to create a mutualistic relationship with the planet that we exist on before we reach a point of which our very existence cannot be supported by our planet any longer.What makes this documentary exponential is also the fact that Attenborough shows that he has committed his life towards these pressing problems, but his main message is that there is still a large amount of work to be done. He points out large scale habitat destruction, carbon emissions, and a rapid decline of our natural resources. With the most masterful shots that I have ever seen, he showed habitat destruction, ice glaciers decreasing, coral bleaching due to rising sea temperatures. It becomes necessary for us as the human species to help build a sustainable future for the generations that will come after us. Attenborough continuously makes it clear that the problems that we are faced with are problems that we can all work towards helping. In a single documentary, we point out the work that needs to be done in order to build a greener future.I would recommend this to any person that has the time to watch this eye opening piece of work that Attenborough has helped to create. Anybody who watches this documentary has the potential to learn many things about their impact on their planet, and how changes to their everyday lives can leave a lasting and meaningful impact towards the planet that has already provided humans with so much.

Do not look away from this documentary for a second. It will show you seemingly irreversible damage done to this earth, but give you specific hope that'll make sure not all will be lost. It will show you that everything that has been destroyed can be rebuilt. My personal favorite part is where he shows us that this is not about saving our planet: it's about saving ourselves. Because if humanity perishes due to its own errors, life will start anew anyway. It's all about the legacy we leave behind that will determine whether our species becomes extinct... or gets to live another century to see the world rise from the ashes we created.All in all, a convincing documentary, not with necessarily lots of new visual content, but rather an incredibly moving, personal story beautifully tied together with video footage and fantastic music."}, {"id": 186, "text": "This is David Attenborough most personal and most hard hitting documentary to date!Rather than focusing on just the natural wonders of the world, the legendary presenter reflects on his career and highlights how the environment and natural world has changed during its course.The impact of his stern words are heightened when you see the facts that support what he is saying. However at many points whilst what he is saying and explaining is quite frankly horrifying, it's not all doom and gloom.In his unique way, he outlines some of the routes we can take to reverse the damage mankind doing, and return the natural world to a balanced and abundant position, which is nothing if not motivating / uplifting.As he mentions, this is his witness statement, and never had a message from someone so important been so needed.As he explains we have ravaged the natural world with impunity, but in order to save ourselves, we need to address and restore the naturals worlds balance.Hopefully many people will be as inspired and awakened as I was when watching this."}, {"id": 187, "text": "The thing that makes this documentary so inspiring is that it is not a lecture.

The beautiful imagery accumulated over 50 years of natural history film-making coupled with a considered, poignant and practical analysis of where we were/are and want to be offers stark warnings, certainly, but also scope for hope and optimism too if only we can get a grip. His manner is affable and authoritative, he is the teacher every one of would have loved to have had - and perhaps, had we, things wouldn't look quite so ominous! The photography - particularly the archive - is gorgeous to look at and underscores perfectly the points he is making, and the global perspective he takes gives this a currency far and away more valuable and penetrating than any politically driven assessment. It's a wonderful film that everyone ought to see. It also serves as a fitting testament to the visionary people at the BBC (often together with WGBH) who created these documentaries over many, many years - providing an essential spine for this narrative, but also so much of my own understanding of how the planet works.

In this documentary David Attenborough presents us some moments of his previous documentaries from his start until today.

Finally, I will use two phrases of David Attenborough because I found them very interesting, important and I believe that it's food for thought for everyone of us: 1) We require more than intelligence to survive, we require wisdom... and 2) If we take care of nature, nature will take care of us...."}, {"id": 189, "text": "This film is my witness statement. This opening quote hit me hard, as it should you, if you enjoy the rare moment of living on this planet right now... David Attenborough intentionally breaks the fourth wall from his decades of documentaries to record (and express) his emotions, ideas, inspirations, and possible future to help guide us, instead of simply educating us, on what (still) exists on this planet (our shared singular planet) currently in our collective lifetimes. It is not absent of deep emotion, wise reflection, and determined concerns without presenting an archival presentation of what is still possible to pull us all from the brink he had personally witnessed in his lifetime. With a currently living 101 year-old grandfather, this kept my attention and drew my focus to every word of wisdom he had to share (just as I have, personally with my inevitably aging grandfather) whilst still able to share it with us all - with a hope of sharing wisdom behind our own age.

But it's politics basically, some people or companies will not let go of their power and money. How can we change, when the big boys won't let us change? I have learned that if you want to teach a child, person or an animal to both behave and change, you'll need to take something away from them, or remove an option for them. Then, and only then will you get the change you are seeking in creating. But as being a smart grownup, how can we just sit and watch our planet being drained to extinction?I recycle, I don't throw stuff into nature. I leave the forest as I entered it. But still, I see plastic and other things, just thrown away around in the forest. Luckily we all know someone who cares enough to pick it up and recycle it. We need more people to do the same.

One for all and all for one.10/10 (How can I give anything less?!)"}, {"id": 192, "text": "David Attenborough presents here what sort of feels like it could be his equivalent to David Bowie's Blackstar. Much of the documentary is Attenborough reflecting on his past, and being self-aware of the fact that his time left on this planet is limited. It's a sad thought, but he seems determined to keep warning us about the direction that our planet is going, until his life's end.While this is a well constructed and important documentary, I do have a couple of more complicated thoughts on it. The first is the timing of its release. For a lot of people who don't concern themselves as much as they should with the environment, there is no way they are going to pay attention to this right now. Have you seen how much else is going on in the news?? I know the survival of our planet is more important that just about anything else, but neither the media nor the general public are logical when it comes to what they should pay the most attention to. It's good that the filmmakers made this short and digestible, and that Netflix seems to be promoting it pretty well, so I hope it can reach a decent audience... but I'm not hopeful, unfortunately.Then there is the matter of it retreading themes explored in Attenborough's most recent series, and in some instances, reusing footage. This is a minor point though, because what is being talked about is still relevant, the way it presents these ideas whilst also covering Attenborough's life story is interesting, and some of the same stuff still hits really hard (the sight of those walruses falling off the cliff is still unbearably sad to look at).So: it's not 100% original. And it's at no fault of Attenborough's, but I feel like the timing of the release may make it fade into the background for many potential viewers. But since its themes are still relevant, and since I could hopefully be wrong about this not getting enough attention, I can't it good conscience mark it down too harshly. The narrative is still strong, Attenborough is as great and interesting a presenter as always, and it covers a lot in less than an hour and a half. While I'll always be skeptical that a well-made climate change documentary can sway those who truly don't care, I'll remain hopeful that this one might still have an impact (hell, I watched An Inconvenient Truth a decade after its release, and it changed many of my personal behaviours and beliefs).And sure, this is largely 83 minutes of David Attenborough lecturing you about the planet's future, but he's earned the right to lecture anyone he wants about anything on the planet, dammit!"}, {"id": 193, "text": "My personal love for nature and it's ongoing crisis around the globe continues to motivate me to spread the message of hope just as Sir David Attenborough still does. It's only when you see the vast lands, the beautiful species on land and within, that you get a deeper appreciation of what exists on our planet. And he has shown us marvelously with his experience that it's now time to wake up, it's time to act and now is the time to not just save our planet but ourselves from our inevitable doom. It's quite simple to watch such eye opening documentaries and turn a blind eye. But to make sure you do something about it to make an individual change is what truly matters. It's as simple as spreading the message that we need to do better, we NEED to become better in order to survive. We NEED to rebuild on ourselves and put out our bets energy into the life that gave US life. It still does given out irresponsible actions towards diet, transport and lifestyle. We need to rewire our brains and our lifestyles to acknowledge the fact that there's more to life than what we percieve it to be. If we didn't eat meat for 2 days in a week, we're not going to die. If we survive in plant based diet, we can assure ourselves that we do not need what's been shown to us that we actually need. Capitalism will ruin not only the basic humane and moral life of ours but in turn will take our planet away from what it once was. The only way that it can thrive is with renewable and sustainable ideas. With Sir David Attenborough's and along with the entire globe's effort, we can truly imagine the life we can live in the coming years. Ah, what a sight! Let's start making a change, for even the smallest one can spread throughout the globe for a better world to live.

Restoring our planet's balance is as simple as ABC.But is it? It only works if all nations take part. What are the chances of that? What would he say to the Middle Eastern countries whose main export is fossil fuel, to Malaysia and Indonesia who rely on their oil palm plantations, to Brazil which has the Amazon rainforest also known as the biggest timber reserve known to humankind? And peculiarly poaching has been left out. How do we convince people in certain parts of the world not to kill endangered animals?The world's resources are finite but so is the human lifespan. Until we address self-interest which is the real impediment to saving the planet, countries will act according to their national interests, companies will only be concerned about their profit and individuals will remain slaves to consumerism. What incentive is there when most of us will probably not be around to experience the worst case scenario?As the recovery of environment during the current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates, it will take no less than a worldwide shift towards personal responsibility and ethical behaviour. Frankly, anyone who lauds this documentary is hypocritical if they are not prepared to take fewer overseas vacations, downsize their McMansions, drive energy-efficient vehicles, reduce their meat consumption and material possessions."}, {"id": 195, "text": "Let me say first, I LOVE David Attenborough, and I love that he fights for nature and wants to make a point even at his rip golden age of 90+. The footage he shows is brilliant and mostly new (due to being on Netflix I suppose). The biggest flaw in this new installment of let's save the planet is that his view on how humans will turn the corner and not face extinction is entirely flawed.First we start with slashing forests down for more cattle and coffee plantations - that's not going to stop. Costa Rica is a bad example and even if they were a great example, Brazil will never stop it, Indonesia will never stop it, they prefer to grow tobacco instead of having some useless trees. In the end, the government wants money, the people want to earn money, not look at trees and live like hippies around them. Which is actually the problem with most of David's ideas - the governments, the corporations, they will not follow! Nature can recover, we've seen that not only in Costa Rica but also in Malaysia where they created a fake rainforest to see if it would turn out the same, and I don't need to go to Chernobyl 40 years after the disaster to check if nature takes back the space - I can see that in my garden after just half a year of neglect. Mr. Attenborough, nobody wants to go to Chernobyl because it's radioactive, but you cannot assume that people would leave alone free land in e.g. Oregon, for nature to grow a forest if it could be used for agriculture or new housing developments instead. That's not how our society works.Fishing is the WORST solution he provided, enabling no-fish zones to provide spill-over to fishing. The example he made was PALAU of all places. Fact is that Palau receives almost all of their food from the US - Hawaii if I'm not mistaken - by boat. Once the boat didn't come for a month and they all didn't have vegetables for that time period. The locals all live on welfare rather than farming on their own and they all burn their trash to cause more harm to the environment. The fisherman in the documentary throws a tiny net out to catch his fish - that's not the problem anyway - it's a huge Chinese vessel coming along, ignoring any kind of no-fish zones (Palau, Tonga, Galapagos, Antarctica just to name a FEW examples, they are everywhere and will NOT stop!) and the poor fish are all gone. You cannot have this working if rogue nations like China and to many extend Japan just fish whatever and wherever they want.Overpopulation, Mr. Attenborough, may peak soon but that's not because of society educating young women or family planning - it will be because there is no food, no space, no health care system to care for all of it. His example, a horrible one again, is that Japan stopped having babies! Well, that's their attitude, a lot of women work and don't want children, true, but they are also facing a disaster of no young generation to fill the gaps in the pyramid. Is every nation going to be like Japan? No, Europe has parts of their populating declining but that's mainly because of family planning and understanding that you don't want to have 3-4-5 children anymore. China's controversial one-child policy may actually have worked to level the population growth but I suppose nobody wants to talk about that. Does the rest of the world follow? No. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, they still have a huge amount of kids. Religious believes, no access to family planning, contribute to an oncoming disaster. Let's face it, the Catholic Church banning contraceptives is medieval.The elephant in the room is that politics and corporate greed will always destroy our planet rather than individuals. We can recycle our trash as much as we want but BP oil spills are worst than us not having recycled our entire life. Brazil says they cannot control the Amazon burning down - I'm sure the plantation owners are happy to see new land becoming available for more cattle that make your burgers (which is horrible again because cows cause more harm to the environment than humans due to constantly belching methane, so do your part and switch to chicken meat).Lastly, people are selfish and greedy too - let's not lie about it. Maybe you personally reading this are a kind soul, bless you, but there are enough individuals who seek opportunities to gain money, spread their seeds, exploit nature if necessary. That's going to take a lot of effort, and David is maybe trying to reach us for this point but I think he definitely failed in his approach. New York will be cleaner when we switch to renewable energy? Let's hope so!"}, {"id": 196, "text": "We need to 're-wild' the world. Richard AttenboroughAttenborough, a natural historian, has been chronicling the changes in our natural habitat for most of his 94 years, so his A Life on Our Planet documentary is a fitting capstone that summarizes his vision for sustainability as the answer to saving the planet. His narration is soothing, his demeanor avuncular, and his message simple: We can prolong a healthy world if we become a part of nature, not apart from it.Some of the pleasant footage comes from the nine series of the BBC's Life collection: Life on Earth, The Living Planet, The Trials of Life, Life in the Freezer, The Private Life of Plants, The Life of Birds, The Life of Mammals, Life in the Undergrowth, and Life in Cold Blood. His approach is quiet reasoning as he takes us from the teeming wilds of the early 20th century to the current dangers of overpopulation, excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the dramatically reduced wild earth left.A short 83 minutes, A Life soothingly shows how we have encroached on nature, but it brings hope that we can save the planet by reasonable activity. Attenborough's mission statemen is one of the best, most helpful, and most entertaining documentaries you will ever see.You'll wish he were your uncle. You'll wish we would listen to him.

There was very little visualization involved - I only remember the decrease in forested area of Borneo being shown; most of it was Attenborough's narration. Emotionally, there was the polar bear swimming in the ocean (great), but it was unclear why exactly the walruses were falling off cliffs. Overall, I felt the documentary didn't explain why biodiversity in particular is what we need. Why not replant with the trees most efficient at carbon capture for example, or those that grow the fastest, such as bamboo? Or why not combine that with artificial carbon capture?Finally, two major omissions:1. Covid-19. It's been shown that the temporary absence of humans has revitalized certain ecosystems on a very short time frame - such as the Hanauma Bay in Hawaii.2. Artificial meat. Yes, we should switch to a more plant-based diet, but how realistic is that? Well, artificial meat makes it a lot more palatable."}, {"id": 198, "text": "Depending on when you were born and where you were born, some things the very famous David A. is showing to us here, will be familiar or not.

Or what we consider positive.Why am I even saying that? Well just to put things into perspective. And to make you realize where the movie comes from. Visually this is amazing. And all the animals? I just love that. Some may feel differently about that of course. But this is about the animals as much as the wilderness and the planet as a whole. Something we tend to forget. Not just during a pandemic (which helped the world itself heal a little as I've come to understand), but generally speaking.A documentary that seems to have found the right crowd (considering the rating here, good for the movie).

David Attenborough is a 93-year-old man who has experienced many things on our planet. He tells his story of global decline and offers a vision for the future. The living world is a unique and spectacular marvel. Billions of individuals and millions of kinds of plants and animals working together to benefit from the sun's energy and the minerals of the Earth. Leading lives that interlock in such a way that they sustain each other. We rely entirely on this finely tuned life-support machine and it depends on biodiversity to run smoothly. The way we humans live on Earth, is now sending biodiversity into a decline, caused by bad planning and human error. It will lead to a place in which we cannot live. We have cut down 3 trillion trees across the world. Half of the world's rainforest has already been cleared. We cannot cut down rainforest forever and anything that we can't do forever is by definition unsustainable. If we do unsustainable things, the damage accumulates ultimately to a point where the whole ecosystem collapses. To restore stability to our planet, we must restore its biodiversity. We must re-wild the world. When it comes to land, we must radically reduce the area we used to farm to make space for returning wilderness. We are also hunting too much ocean life. Without the large station of other marine predators, the oceanic nutrient cycle stutters. Without predators, nutrients are lost for centuries to the depths in the hotspots of fish start to diminish, which leads to the ocean dying. Ocean life was also unraveling in the shallows. Corals began bleaching and dying. Scientists discovered bleaching was caused because the ocean was warming. Climate scientists had warned that the planet would get warmer as we burn fossil fuels and release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Summer sea ice in the Arctic has reduced by 40% in 40 years. Our planet is losing its ice, one of the most pristine ecosystems is heading for disaster. Attenborough suggests that the living world is essentially solar powered. If we face our fossil fuels and run our world on the eternal energies of nature too. Sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal. A renewable future has many key benefits. Energy everywhere will be more affordable, our cities will be cleaner and quieter, and renewable energy will never run out. He also recommended that when fish stocks reduce, we can respond by restricting fishing practices and banning fishing entirely from many areas. In one act, this would transform the open ocean from a place exhausted by subsidized fishing fleets to a wilderness that will help us all in our efforts to combat climate change. The human population's rapid growth has caused us to utilize more and more resources until we run out. To improve the population, we have to work hard to raise money for poverty, give all access to healthcare, and enable girls, in particular, to stay in school as long as possible. We can make the population peak sooner at a lower level, which causes the population to stabilize and decrease the population. Our blind assault on the planet has finally come to alter the very fundamentals of the living world. David Attenborough has offered a vision to better the future.

And very few explains it better than Attenborough in A Life on Our Planet. This is ultimately a horror story, a true story, of the impact we humans have had on our planet, and the grave and looming danger we are now facing.A child born today will witness the total collapse of everything we humans have taken for granted for hundreds of thousands of years, and it is humans that are at fault. But it is all still fixable. Though I'm afraid that humans will not rise to the challenge, before it's too late.I don't mean to be a cynic, I try my best, even though i stare doom in the face. I recycle, i eat all the food i buy, i don't drive a car, i don't use fossil fuels, i wear my clothes for as long as it's possible, and i send them to recycle once they are worn out. I do all these kinds of things, because it doesn't really take up much of my time to do it. It's all quite simple really, once you get used to it.A few years ago, i read about how much food we people in the western world throw away every year, and the number was about half of all food produced. Half. It is a staggering number, and a testament to the mindset we humans have come to inherit. We take everything around us for granted, and thus become blind to the overwhelming damage we slowly but steadily inflict on the nature around us, which we are completely depended upon.There are still those on this planet, millions upon millions in fact, that do not believe that the climate is changing. People who think that everything related to climate change is fake, and it does not matter how many violent record breaking storms, record breaking wildfires, record breaking temperatures, and record breaking ice melting we see and experience every single year, some people simply refuse to take in reality.It would be a damn shame if we perished now, just as we started to get good at space travel, before we had the chance to truly explore if there is life elsewhere om the solar system and beyond. It would be a damn shame, if we after all this technology we have invented, and all the smart people we have on this planet, simply could not persuade enough leaders to take action, and we make irreversible changes to the planets ecosystem that will be devastated for millions of years.Some humans might be able to live through all those years, adapting to whatever comes next. But they will venture back to the stone age, and they will be looking up at the sky, gracing at the moon, not knowing that once upon a time, long long ago, their own species actually walked on that. As time passes by, in the hardship we have to endure, we simply forgot, and no one is left to tell the stories of what we once did achieve.This is to me the saddest realization. That we simply couldn't fix our mistakes, even though we were told time and time again, that we had to. I hope I'm wrong in my pessimism, and that humans actually do succeed in turning it around. But it needs to happen now, right now.

I am an Attenborough fan and have watched all his documentaries. Because I admire his work I placed my expectations high. I just wish it had said more, encouraged more, targeted some key areas of development in a specific manner. The documentary is a rushed account of our current state. The focus, I felt, from the trailers would be on solutions. But it swiftly moves through to meet a time limit. That renders it superficial. What it presents is common knowledge. Great visuals as usual though. I expected it to be insightful. Empowering individuals with the courage to act and showing them how. Clearly Specifically targeting Industries like fashion, food, the luxury cruise are imperative in the discussion of climate change and behavioural changes that are necessary to bring about this shift. Promoting conscious consumerism to individuals is essential for the well-being of the planet. It merely scratched the surface. Generic and broad comments avoided targeting specific corporations and governments. A more courageous work would have been groundbreaking. The powerful need to be convinced and coerced into adapting ways that promote a positive impact. A voice and persona like Attenborough could have made a grand impact. I felt that was sorely missed."}, {"id": 205, "text": "This is not an easy or pleasant film to watch, and I would not advice a child to watch this without an adult close by.The film presents the story about human progression and the impact thereof on the natural world, throughout the lifetime of David Attenborough. It does so calmly, somberly and truthfully without embellishing, using new footage combined with excerpts from nature films dating back some 70 years. At the end of the film, possible solutions are presented, that may alleviate or even reverse some of the effects humans have had upon the world.An important film with an urgent message. Force yourself to watch it! Even the scenes where you wish to look away.David Attenborough is a fantastic narrator and he has given voice to so many great nature films. This may be the most important one! 10/10 from me."}, {"id": 206, "text": "David Attenborough is a fabulous nature film maker and I love the idea of showing how the planet has changed within his own lifetime. That was brilliant.The thing I didn't like pertained to his comments on the population. He cited Hans Rosling's work on how the global population will level off at 11 billion once every country is developed and families only have 1-2 children. We have 7+ billion people on the planet right now and we are exhausting the earth's resources faster than it can keep up with. Our current population is unsustainable so adding 5 billion is impossible. The planet was at its optimum human population when Attenborough was born. It's only a matter of time before the planet ejects humanity as a cancer. We refuse to acknowledge and deal with the real problem of over population.Last thing. Michael Moore did a fabulous documentary called Planet of the Humans which exposes renewable energy for what it is: dependent on fossil fuels. We need to face that niggling truth as well while getting away from fossil fuels."}, {"id": 207, "text": "If you care about yourself, the next generation, nature and animals... do yourself a favour and watch this strong piece of work. It's a dazzling documentary about our impact on planet earth and how we can reverse it to our own benefit and have a sustainable lifestyle.The whole team did a wonderful job on this documentary. Perfect narration, superb soundtrack, dazzling cinematography, meticulous editing, professional directing, and wonderful storytelling in a linear way.The only thing that could be better in this wonderful and necessary-to-watch piece of beauty is, focusing more and deeper on the solution part and trying to show to the masses that changing the lifestyle is easier than it seems. It's just the clutter that big political and economical powers are making to stop you from hearing the nature's sound and will!I myself have changed my lifestyle years ago and I'm extremely happy about my decisions. It's been now six years that I'm a vegan and I never ever looked back to that dark and wrong lifestyle and diet.I believe we can change our system and lifestyle to our benefit. It's not impossible. They're just new different ideas, we just have to adapt ourselves to them.Witnessing all of these horrible things that lots of us are doing to this world is hard on these kinds of documentaries but it's something that we have to do and this one was another eye-opening and inspirational one.8.5/10"}, {"id": 208, "text": "A beautiful and well-made documentary, of one of the best contributors to our knowledge about wildlife, Sir David Attenborough.Being a short doc (90 min runtime), it covers most of Sir David's work from the beginning, around the 60s, to the present day. It is clear that this man has a passion for nature, for living beings and for our planet in general.He was a pioneer in the discovery of many unexplored territories in the 70s, always with the intention of learning from these places and with the native, and never with the intention of exploring these areas to obtain any benefit.It ends with a message about the future of our species, the destruction of the planet and much of animal and plant life, if our selfish, capitalist and immediate return habits are not changed quickly.For those who do not know his work, it is a good summary of his career as a defender of nature."}], "reviews_amount": 209}
