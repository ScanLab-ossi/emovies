Fahadh Faasil gets the breakthrough of this thriller, mysterious and puzzled plot which involves the audience so depply into it. Director and producer's have made a good use of OTT platform and gave their best to convey the message to the viewers. Malayalam industry has tried something out of the box to present the whole plot in a virtual reality way and I believe they have been successful in doing this.

Hats off to them for creating such types of gems again and again. It's editing, BGM, screenplay are just extraordinary. What to say about acting when the names of Fahadh Faasil and Roshan Mathew are there. Darshana Rajendran also gives a very impactful performance.

Fahad nailed it.... great work guys"}, {"id": 8, "text": "Just watched it on Amazon Prime on the 'Thiruvonam' day from Denver, Colorado. Quite frankly it was so hard to switch off 'Searching' expectation. But, as the movie progressed , it got me glued to my seat and switch off that other movie's 'screenplay'. The story is very good (not perfect for the small plot holes etc) and the acting is excellent, starting of course with Fahad and others.

It has subtle elements of respecting space, identity, love beyond all conflicts and the need for mutual respect. No over acting. No distractions.

C u soon comes with many expectations and delivers it right. C u soon has a good story, gripping screenplay, superb performances from the 3 leads and brilliant virtual cinematography. The negative, I felt was that there are too much of video calling between characters which I found unrealistic because in real life people only go for video calling is for lengthy and casual conversations, one which people from abroad do with their loved ones. On the whole, c u soon is a must watch to see that how efficient malayalam cinema can be."}, {"id": 12, "text": "This movie was shot on an iphone during the pandemic, I find it very hard to believe because this movie is so beautiful.

The amount of bravery needed to venture into this untrodden terrain of film and making it a hit is EXTREMELY COMMENDABLE.

This movie has an extra character playing a pivotal role here and that is it's background score. Yes it is a Character here. The score is so perfect and unexpected. This was already a brilliant flick even with a mediocre score but they created a cherry on top. It will surely haunt you afterwards while the score will haunt you during the running time. Must Watch.

I loved all the performances. I felt Fafa's acting/emoting was under done on purpose during the initial phases of the investigation. Maybe to create a feeling of contrast and emotional investment in the mystery after he stumbles upon some key truths. I felt towards the end of the movie there is something that Kevin leaves unsaid not just to the character Jimmy, but also to the audience as a whole. Maybe its only a personal hunch.The star of the movie is definitely Mahesh Narayanan. From what little I know about direction/editing/virtual cinematography I felt that he did an incredible job. This film would not have happened without the maverick that he is. Amazing job!While its impressive that he also wrote a story and screenplay that not just fit into the format of the movie but also discussed a social issue that emotionally tugs at the viewers heart, I felt that the flaws in the story still should not be overlooked. For example, how weak the villain is or how easily Kevin and Jimmy gets access to almost all the major evidences/truths without much hiccups, how Kevin's screen is almost always capturing his life/ his laptop camera is rarely switched off and how his laptop itself is bugged despite him being a cyber security expert etc Many crucial questions arises in the mind of the viewers, for instance, why did the villain strike a deal, instead of probably killing the threat after retrieving what belonged to him?Since it is a screen based movie, its imperative to understand that the viewers would scrutinize every little detail on the screen. So the fact that Kevin's screen has a sticky note with 'printf fibonnacci series' or there are typos in the news articles he reads in the movie should not be brushed off as minute details. This might miss the eyes of normal audience but still reduces the believability factor/verisimilitude to the ones who notice them. Spending a little bit more time on reviewing and re-editing both the script and the screens could have given us a more flawless work very close to a masterpiece.Hopefully, all or at least most of the loose ends in the movies will be resolved in the sequel where we get to know the characters and their backstories in a real life point of view.

Excellent use of technology and tools to shoot this while people stayed at their respective locations during Covid. Good concept, story line and execution. Fahadh owns the movie and Roshan Mathew pretty much nails his role.The standout scene for me is when Fahadh realises he needs the help of his colleague, but he had just blocked her a few mins back.

Let me start by saying that 10-15 mins into the movie and I could see what was coming. A stellar performance by the 3 leading individuals in this screen-based movie - Fahadh, Roshan, and Darshana were emoting through nothing but their facial expressions. In a format where most of the scenes are limited to your upper body, the text messages, and the sound (boy, the sound is always greater than visuals), they did a great job. I never expected anything lesser from Fahadh because that dude is a genius. He has proved his excellence and what he's capable of doing on-screen through each of his performances. One better than the other, and I am glad that he took on this project and co-produced it with his wife. However, the plot is where the entire thing fell short. While the entire subject the movie focused on and well, reading the comments and reviews, I've noticed how more than most people could only focus on the moral issue of scamming people, especially needy young women in the name of job offers and decent pay by agents only to realize that they are being sold as flesh to others. This is something that people are familiar with and exists, yes. But I am shocked that people missed out on the fact that Kevin (Fahadh) who is a Computer/Cyber expert capable of hacking/intruding into people's privacy is persuaded into doing what they call a personal background check of Anumol Sebastian (Darshana). Even as this screen-based movie pans out into the moral issue I described above, Kevin's apology towards the end that I should have done a more thorough background check makes me wonder how the audience could be so tone-deaf to the harsh realities facing the virtual world. There was nothing thrilling about how this movie panned out for me. From the beginning to the end, we get to see privacy intrusion (which frankly I didn't notice in most reviews like a grave concern) to this moral issue. Frankly, I watched the movie in 3 sittings because there was no drive to this. A stellar performance for a weak storyline still doesn't make up for the weakness of the storyline. Again, my personal experience. P.S I have watched 4-5 screen based movies, the editing in this one is great for Indian standards. I wasn't expecting anything like Searching or Profile, but yeah, Searching is a fine Screen-based/Digital thriller. I am glad that C U Soon happened and that Malayalam Cinema is going beyond the conventional formats. Take a bow for this experiment. I have a lot more to say, but as I said, you can watch it for the performance, the screen-based format experience, and the editing. I think it could have been a whole lot better and I really wish more and more people spoke about two major issues this movie reflects. 1. Conning people in the name of jobs and subjecting them to a world of torture where they have no other option but to do it. 2. The intrusion of privacy - I am not saying they normalized that act, but seemed like the audience missed out on the same."}, {"id": 121, "text": "Hats off to this unique attempt by the director and the editor and as usual amazing acting done by all the actors, keeps you on the seat through out the movie, please go ahead and watch it."}, {"id": 122, "text": "The movie is simply amazing.

Inspired heavily from the narrative style of films like Searching and Unfriended: Dark Web, the story moves forward primarily through Google Duo video calls and Face-time as a web-security expert searches far and wide for his cousins missing girlfriend. The nuance and subtlety driven into each character by the three brilliant leads-Fahadh, Roshan Mathew and Darshana Rajendran instantly buy you into the storyline. While Fahadh as usual captivates you with his eyes, Roshan conveys the urgency and desperation of his character with elan. However, it is Darshana Rajendran who steals the show as the initially timid 'Anumol' who becomes a well-fleshed out and awe-inspiring character towards the end. The fact that this film was conceived and shot completely at home, via iPhones and tablets during lockdown just goes to prove the adage from Johnny Flora If necessity is the Mother of Invention, than adversity must surely be the Father of Re-invention. Highly recommended."}, {"id": 145, "text": "Tldr; A webcam genre movie that is better than the sum of its parts, and was entertaining enough for the evening, but I would never watch it again, or recommend it.As far as the found-footage / webcam genre goes, I have maybe seen a couple dozen of these films. This is arguably the most illogical, inconsistent, utterly incomprehensible mess I have seen in this genre. It demands the viewer accept ludicrous premise after ludicrous premise (I am trying to write this to be general enough to avoid spoilers)...that all it takes to hack into a person's Internet accounts is a low quality JPEG image of the front of their wireless router.that these same people involved with this magical cyber security &amp; hacking, would use one-factor authentication, and leave their webcams on all the time with their social media account logged in, including while they sleep.that one person helping another person flee an abusive situation, would help the abuse victim change their phone number in order to hide from their abuser, and then go seek out the abuser to give them the victims updated phone number.that people who swipe as a match on an online dating app, would propose marriage to their families after a few days of chatting, and this wouldn't be called out as rash, reckless behaviour by the families involved.that people can have relationships, where they discuss, virtually nothing, ever, and seemingly purposely avoid talking about key plot points that are happening to them, for no reason whatsoever, other than to create unnecessary complications to the plot.To say you have to shut your brain off with this movie is an understatement. You practically have to feign ignorance of the laws of physics, let alone human nature, in order to make this movie comprehensible, let alone believable. The webcam / on screen framing is illogically inconsistent, the scripting borderline incomprehensible, and the musical scoring is so utterly incompetent, that it seems whoever scored it did not understand certain scenes either. All that being said, I'd be lying if I said I didn't find it entertaining. In fact, some of its flaws, and incompetent story telling, added to the experience for me, as I tried to figure out just what the frack I was *supposed* to think while watching this mess of a movie. It was particularly fast-paced for cinema from that part of the world, and it had some compelling moments, all the while seeming to be made with effort and intent. While I would never recommend this, if one were compelled to watch a Malayalam take on this genre, I wouldn't try to stop them. It was maddeningly incomprehensible, but compelling enough that I never once wanted to stop watching."}, {"id": 146, "text": "C U SOON (2020) MALAYALAM REVIEW #cusoon #cusoonreview #malayalammovie #review . . . \ud83d\udcdc Plot: Jimmy meets Anu on an online dating website and decides to marry her.

Taking nothing from Director Mahesh Narayan, C U Soon is valiant effort in replicating the magic of this genre for Indian audience. The movie begins on love affair and slowly turns out to be an edge of seat thriller. The movie oscillates between desktop , mobile screens to inflict powerful story telling and has an intriguing screenplay and something indian audiences might have missed if they skipped searching.Fahadh is undoubtedly a gem of an actor and he needs no criticism, he is unflinching and outstanding. Robin Matthews as Jimmy has given his best performance yet on screen and i believe now that he has so much potential . He should definitely avoid being choked by making movies like choked. The star here is Darshana Rajendran, she is marvelous and so brilliant as Anu Mol. She has imparted her brilliance in Emotional scenes without flaws.Overall , C U Soon is a decent movie which you will engage in but wont be having a lasting impression on you. The Brilliant takeaways are the style of storytelling and editing. Was wishing the movie had a better storyline still.

Surprisingly aesthetic work form the broader 'Found Footage' genre with negligible motion blur and good quality video all along. Appreciably short runtime considering desi standards.

Decent performances although Matthew's leaves one wanting for improvement.The Bad: A complete neglect of all aspects that make a good thriller. The background score is a real letdown, reducing the movie to a drama form the prospects of a nail-biter. Dismal and prodigal use of various characters.

For the most part the mystery goes good. But once the suspense is revealed there are some glaring plot holes which are caused by the forced romance plot.

Fahadh is just there to get the hype going. His subplot was totally unnecessary. It was more or less a filler stuff.This can be watched for the format in which this is done.

But it is true and has happened due to the malayalam film industry. Before going into the review of the film I would like to give a kudos to the guy who has given the title CU SOON to this film. It relates to the story and as well as gives us hopes about the reopening of theatres indirectly.The film does not have any breathtaking aerial shots or camera movements but just has shots were actors are acting in front of their webcams and is still engaging.The first 20 minutes is pacy and introduces the characters Jimmy{Roshan Mathew} and Anumol Sebastian{Darshana}. Speaking about the acting of the lead actors, an amazing performance from all the three. Fahaad Faasil is amazing as an angry and irritated{ due to the untimely work timings} but still helpful Kevin Thomas. Roshan as a charming Jimmy kurian is amazing and Darshana as a cute lady named Anumol is excellent{both their perfomances were natural}.And also, technically the film is top notch, a great attempt by the technical team. I am not going to say anything about the story as it will become a great spoiler. So as I said, the positives of the film are the natural acting of the cast, the screenplay and the work of the technical team.But the problem is after a certain point of time we lose our patience due to the continuous display of chats and chrome tabs {but that can be forgiven as it is shot in the lockdown}.It is a great attempt by the team of CU SOON to give an amazing film in this pandemic and kudos to director Mahesh Narayanan{of Take Off fame} to take an initiative of writing a script at this time.

Though it is very difficult to direct a movie through computers , webcams and chats etc , that too during this pandemic period, the director has beautifully narrated the entire movie through computers, chats and mobile phone screens with characters visible through the camera of the devices.This movie stands unique of all other movies and it has proved that big budget is not required to make a successful film. Rather its just the director's capability , skills and creativity along with the support of the crew members that makes a successful film.I did not find any drawbacks in the film.Such films must definitely be appreciated for their efforts , hard work and creativity, in spite of this pandemic ."}, {"id": 155, "text": "The movie seemed to be conceived, and made in the light of the present circumstances of the pandemic which made the contemporaneous; not on the basis of the outbreak but the consequences; yes the lockdown, however thematically the storyline doesn't have anything to do with this similitude, but the makers decided to tell this story in a virtual setting. The movies touches some of the current affairs such as, virtual communication and the exposure to various messaging collaboration tools, questionability data/security, hacking, shady activities of some enigmatic NRI/upper class expats, victims of internationsl sex slavery, immigration legalities, and so on. A movie with a balanced mix of conventional/convincing and unconventional faces, regardless the outcome is praiseworthy. Viewers will certainly feel for a couple characters essentially Darshana, Saiju, Amalda and of course Fahad's performances are the take away. We all are watching this movie years after the release of VHS, Searching or unfriended, however watching a movie of similar backdrop in my mother tongue is a unique experience to be honest, apart from that there none much great about this movie. But a must watch !"}, {"id": 156, "text": "Malayalam Cinema yet again makes it a point that, good content is the key for any creation, and good content is not always directly proportional to the cost involved in making it. This film adds up to the promising yet challenging phase Malayalam Cinema is traversing, wherein not only the makers but also some of the mainstream lead actors are willing to experiment with Cinema.C U Soon is an experimental film, with multiple genres. The experimentation to build the characters, the plot in a virtual world has turned out very organic. The filmmaker placed all the characters at different locations and the intent to use the digital medium for the characters to communicate justifies it quite well.Once the characters are established, the digital screen does not distract the viewing experience, it comes out as true as any cinematic experience. Though there can be disagreements on this by elderly people as they may find it difficult to fathom the progression of the plot with a digital screen showing text interactions between characters and other technical operations performed on the PC/iMac to decipher the mystery.The overall experience was super gripping, the performances were rock solid by all the key characters, the central characters were relatable to the core. The other thing that worked for me was the background score, it just enhanced various moods of the film quite efficiently.After watching the trailer, I was expecting an out and out mysterious thriller, it's like the mystery element remains till the end rolling credits, never mind the makers obviously had better plans to deal with it, so no regrets on that aspect. The film progressively and maturedly drives into an uncomfortable zone and it manages to extract out a poignant experience leveling up the overall experience, than being just some gimmick experimentation with all the digital frames flopping around and all the twists &amp; turns devised into it.'C U Soon', available on Amazon Prime, is a film not be missed, let's embrace such creative experiments in Cinema, and let's appreciate, encourage the efforts invested by the artists, especially the makers, involved in it."}, {"id": 157, "text": "For those who love films, Malayalam movies has been the gold standard of movie making. Talented actors, storytellers, directors and DOPs have raised the benchmarks in the last decade or so, weaving in a natural lifelike method of stories that are easily identifiable. As the standards have grown, a breed of performers stand out such as Fahadh Faasil, Roshan Mathew, Dalquer Salman, Anna Ben, Soubin Shahir, Chemban Jose, all of whom have led the renaissance of a new era of film making.CU Soon takes the industry into the 21st century, with digital technologies and social media (both the positive and negative aspects of it) woven into the script as it's backbone. It touches on many aspects of modern living. The global aspirations of Indians, technology that connects, irrespective of geography, love and romance in today's world, human trafficking and exploitation and many more. But these flow into the narrative seamlessly and the entire cast is in terrific form to live up to the characters played by them. It's convincing with their little quirks and side stories that doesn't override the key plot.For those familiar with the Hollywood movie - The Searching, the visual representation of the film is quite similar where as audiences, we're watching the film through the filter of the characters screen. Thanks to COVID and social distancing, we all identify with living in a fishbowl and Mahesh Narayan (Story and Direction), makes good use of this style to make the most of the lockdown. Despite the constraints, the film does not drop the ball for a single second and one cannot take their eyes of the screen. At 1 hr, 38 mins, the movie is taut and well put together. Up to the half point of the movie, the suspense is kept on the knifes edge, and we're wondering on which direction will the story go, making conjectures in our own minds.Once the story starts unravelling, it still does not disappoint and holds its interest right till the very end, leaving behind a huge moral question for Roshan Mathew to answer and the audience roots I'm for it to be the right one.A great watch and kudos for the entire team for this and specially for Fahadh for backing this creative product."}, {"id": 158, "text": "The Malayalam film industry has a different style in choosing the backdrop as opposed to the C U Soon analysis routine. In Prime Video C U Soon movie, screenplay combines technology with a social problem in Kerala.Topics of the current generation, such as collecting information using web chat apps like Facebook, Google Hangout and Skype, are nicely displayed on the screen.The highlight of the film is the directing of the film through chatting between mobiles and computers.Adding suspense, mystery, and thriller to the story of why the two lovers fell in jail under unforeseen circumstances, the film takes the story to another level.The way the story is written, the way it is told in a way that is easily understood by today's youth is great.Also impressive is the way the suspense continues in the story to the end. The emotions in the characters are new as shown on the screen.Fahad Fazil, who is closer to the audience with films like Super Deluxe and Trance, once again put on an amazing performance.The emotionally charged acting through his eyes in the climax further impresses the fans.Roshan, who has gained fans with his negative shade in the Malayalam film Kapela, has impressed by playing a sympathetic role this time. Feel Good gets emotional with his actions not only in the scenes but also at crucial times.Darshana Rajendran Performance It has to be said that Iron Thirai fame Darshana Rajendran is alive in the role of Anu Sebastian.It must be said that it has done full justice to the role of telling the problem faced by Kerala young women.Feeling we have 'Run out of gas' emotionally with the help of a character who has less dialogue and more scope for emotions.Director Mahesh Narayan's talent is captivated by the heart-wrenching story of how young men and women get into trouble with the lure of taking jobs.The film is designed to add technology to a social problem and give a new feel to the audience.The film manages to impress not only the youth but also the family audience with no place for pornography.It very beautifully makes us aware of the fact that how technology has taken over our lives and some of us are already suffering from it. You should watch this film with English Subtitles."}, {"id": 159, "text": "In the pre-pandemic era, Searching, directed by Aneesh Chaganty, unknowingly set a tight, harrowing template for a thriller set in the online, digital world. Now, with our living, working, and private worlds upended as far as the vax can see, it's not just a pre-adult demographic that's exposed to the incessant stream of digipacks, but all of us as well. And that includes bank client officer Jimmy Kurian (Roshan Mathew), who, in the Malayalam movie C U Soon - which uses the same template, but takes it into a superbly distinctive journey of its own - based out of an apartment in Sharjah, swipes right on Tinder and falls for Anu Sebastian (Darshana Rajendran) swiftly and surely.Writer-editor director Mahesh Narayan (Take Off), also the virtual cinematographer for this project - a credit we'll be seeing more of, I suspect - having shot the entire movie on iPhones in apartments in Kochi during the pandemic - keeps his script tight and economical. Using all the icons that apps deploy - three blinking dots, to show, for example, if someone's typing - and online chatting techniques - typing, only to tap the clear option to rescind and rethink one's thoughts - the director radiates warmth and yearning in the budding romance between Anu and Jimmy. Those same icons and popping sounds ratchet up the tension later on in the movie. That Jimmy's impetuous and thinks from his bleating heart is established as he quickly sets up a video call with Anu, his mother in the US (Maala Parvathi), and cousin sister for them to meet Anu, also living in Sharjah. Under normal circs., all would have been okay. The catch here is that the couple hasn't met face-to-face, and Jimmy pops the nuptial proposal on said call. That something's amiss about Anu is apparent, but love is blind, and virtual love blind to any muted, worrisome signals pulsing across the network. It's a telling portrait of our times. As all of us slip in wearisome work and home routines and the only time we're stirred is while prepping for stir-fry veggies, we're all craving that long-forgotten touch, a dash of excitement, a breeze of adventure, and a surfeit of scenery change. Which is what makes us all vulnerable to online missteps and stumbles.Meanwhile, Jimmy's mother, Mary, wary of her son's sudden online handfasting, ropes in her nephew, maverick, and moody night-shift IT dredger in Kochi, Kevin (Fahad Faasil) to hack out more information about the girl. Kevin, struggling with his own relationship with team lead and lover Sanjana (Amalda Liz), scoffs at his cousin brother's latest amour. What he thinks of women and affairs of the heart is established as he and Sanjana spar over work and his ego. This angle, perhaps, is the only one in the movie that limps a little, but director Narayan moves the video calls and chats along at a snappy pace, so there's no time to ruminate as Jimmy gets into trouble, mysterious events circle around Anu, and it's up to Kevin to unravel and disentangle his cousin - and the family - from a rapidly disintegrating situation.Wound up tightly, C U Soon uncoils swiftly and effectively with director Narayan wearing his experienced and ace editor's hat, and in the process of expending its fraught energy, exposes a gutting and heartbreaking side of what so many women and job seekers from Kerala undergo in the Gulf countries even in these hyper-connected times of Facebook and Hangouts. And as Faasil's Kevin discovers the truth, his demeanor and fa\u00e7ade changes and melts, the unspeakable horror that unfolds on his screen crushing his superbious shell. The actor - also co-producing the movie - plays Kevin with a studied and effective intensity that segues from disdain to genuine concern, his phiz a portmanteau of bubbling emotions. Fahadh Faasil is a joy and a treasure to behold and cherish at the cinema, and C U Soon cements his place at the thinking actor's marquee. Aided by Gopi Sundar's background score that swells and rouses in the romantic scenes a la Ilaiyaraaja and taps nervously elsewhere, the movie also has a very effective and sincere Roshan Mathew and a heartrending act by Darshana Rajendran raise their scenes to more than a digi-slick-and-click.Even if director Narayan ends the movie with a prayer for all of us to congregate at cinema halls soon, he wouldn't want you to, in the meantime, carelessly swipe and chat indiscreetly online. And even if you do, the movie's biggest hope is that you do what's right by the other person in the chat window."}, {"id": 160, "text": "With C U Soon, Mahesh Narayanan proves that he has plenty of interesting stories to tell, in interesting formats, about interesting characters. Taking the worldwide lockdown into account, Mahesh and his stunning set of actors (Fahad Fazil, Roshan Mathew, and Darshana Rajendran) pull off an effort that thrills, tugs at your heartstrings, and leaves you with one of the most satisfying film experiences in recent times.If you have watched films like 'Searching', 'Profile', or most recently 'Host', you'll be familiar with the subgenre. The proceedings unravel over different device screens (phones/laptops), telling a story that revolves around the virtual lives of the film's main (and supporting) characters. It begins as a simple scenario of meet-cute between Jimmy (Roshan) and Anu (Darshana) on a dating app and they vibe quickly. In a span of a week (and several video-calls &amp; chats later), Jimmy falls deeply in love with Anu and expresses his desire to marry her. However, Anu's background and digital presence remain shrouded in mystery.That's when Kevin (Fahad), Jimmy's cousin and a cybersecurity expert, makes his entry. Things escalate pretty quickly from there on and all of it is best enjoyed spoiler-free. This is Mahesh's second writing and directing feature (after a spectacular 'Take Off') and while the scale here is a lot smaller than that film, it's compellingly written and crafted. At a run-time of 98 minutes, the storytelling is crisp with no unwanted scenes. Performances-wise, Roshan is great, Fahad is exceptional as usual (his eyes, good lord, they're gifted!), but the top honors in C U Soon go to Darshana Rajendran who comes up with a tremendous feat that makes you feel immensely sorry for Anu.Being an ace editor, Mahesh makes exemplary cuts that smoothly transition from one device screen (and/or app) to another, revealing significant details in every scene. The climax is an emotional rollercoaster, one that works so well because of the lead actors and the way they've been written. This will, in all probability, be the best OTT Malayalam film until we get to set foot in a cinema hall again. A big thank you to Mahesh, Fahad, Roshan, Darshana, and the rest of the crew for satiating our cravings for good content, superb storytelling, and kickass performances."}, {"id": 161, "text": "'C U Soon' (2020) - A routine thriller done differentlyWatched this much talked about Malyalam film directed Mahesh Narayan yesterday.There is nothing new and the film treads the routine path of an average thrillers that are abundantly available on OTT platforms these days but, at the same time, scores very high in terms of digital technological innovation .The film, however, suffers due to its weak script. The very first shot begins with a chat on an online wedding web-site and smart viewer can well anticipate the events that would unfold later. And once the secrete is out in the open there is little scope for any character development due to steady deployment of computer screen shots all through the film. Needs to be appreciated, however, that there are no logical inconsistencies in the presentation.The innovative film-making format is laudable. Music too is appropriate. Direction ... mostly editing ... is fine. As for acting, Anu (Darshana Rajendran) does all the heavy lifting. Jimmy (Roshan Mathew) in the lead role is okay while Kevin (Fahadh Faasil) keeps the hype going.Incidentally, the film reminds me of Gustav M\u00f6ller 2018 Danish film 'Guilty' which portrays the plight of a police officer's race against time when he receives a distress call from a kidnapped woman.This film can well be compared with 'C U Soon' since it's also a thriller and, though shot in a conventional manner with a single character siting in police control room, viewers are left to imagine events happening elsewhere virtually. The character of visible police officer and other non-visible characters &amp; events are brilliantly developed through creative script and dialogues. The suspense, thrills, twists and turns keep viewers glued to their seat stupefied and the moral dilemma in the end makes them ponder over the happenings for a long time after the film is over.C U Soon lacks such depth of content due to average script and limitation of the chosen medium. The movie appears shallow in that respect. Besides, with its small plot-line, the director seems to be trying to fill the time to make it past one and half hour mark. Also those not accustomed to fiddling with the computer and the digital gadgets may find it quite difficult to follow.My rating...For tech-savvy viewers with penchant for thrillers: 8 out 10 For art-house movie viewers: 5 out of 10 Rest: 3 out of 10Ram Tayade (Deshmukh) 4-9-2020"}, {"id": 162, "text": "It's wrong to call C U Soon an experimental cinema, instead it can be described as an Indian prototype of high quality, low budgeted future of independent cinema. Though Searching set the tone for this genre of cinema, C U Soon is not at all far behind in any way and nails it completely with its spectacular screenplay and an interesting storyline laced with mystery. C U Soon set entirely on computer screens and smartphones, the film follows a love smitten young man to becoming a victim of circumstances.The film mainly targets millennial audiences, who would be completely well versed all the computer and Internet jargon. C U Soon, produced by Nazriya Nazim and Fahadh Faasil, is a quickie that is quick to hit its stride and draw the viewer into its intriguing, dynamic virtual setting. It calls for absolute, uninterrupted concentration, which isn't, contrary to how it may sound, a dreary drill for the audience. The methods it uses instead enhance manifold the thrills that the folds of the mystery-laden tale hold.Full credit to director Mahesh Narayanan for going all out with the concept with a equally convincing screenplay. Though there are small logical loopholes, it can be overlooked, considering the venture. It was good to see Fahadh Faasil to his usual best after potboilers like Adhiran &amp; Trance. Darshana Rajendran too delivers a moving portrayal of Anumol, a girl of many shades.Overall, C U Soon would a very satisfying watch for audiences of all ages. Though non malayam speaking audiences would find it difficult in understanding line by line typed messages on screen initially, subtitles would eventually come into play and save the day. C U Soon is a great example of cinema of the future in India."}], "reviews_amount": 163}
