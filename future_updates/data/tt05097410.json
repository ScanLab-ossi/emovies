{"name": "Noelle", "titleId": "tt05097410", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "I was excited for Noelle despite the reviews, and after watching, I still don't understand all the ridiculously critical reviews. This is a Disney Christmas movie targeted for kids for goodness sake. The plot to me is a mix between Elf, and The Santa Clause, and it honestly is better than MOST of the Christmas movies on the Hallmark channel. It is a light-hearted fun movie and I love what the movie conveys even though most of the negative reviews are based around the fact that its too feminist. The movie is showing young girls that their capabilities are endless, and that being a girl shouldn't hold them back from being whatever they want. The fact that so many people take issue with that is sad and ridiculous."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I'm not one to write reviews often. Disney has captured a cute and enjoyable amount of Christmas spirit with this movie that was helped along way by Anna Kendrick. A Christmas movie should do one simple thing ... give you the feels ... The feels are delivered here."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. A tad cheesy, but most Christmas movies are. It was adorable, sweet and had lovable characters."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Everyone else who purchased Disney streaming has watched Noelle or will watch for the upcoming Holiday season. I really had no expectations of loving this Christmas movie but it turned out to be a cute and fun retelling of a story we all know. Great Movie for families. Anna Kendrick was just right for this role, she was a joy to watch and was so cheerful.."}, {"id": 4, "text": "I thought it was decent for a Disney Christmas movie. It has some pretty good humor. It also has originality. I saw it on Disney+ on Nov. 13, 2019 a day after they just launched it for streaming and good graphics. I enjoyed it, but it's not on my list of favorites for holiday movies. I would recommend watching it once for sure. I gave it a solid 7 because of the humor. It made me laugh and laughing is therapeutic for me."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I loved this film, and so do the kids... I'm disappointed to see the low ratings, hence why I'm here. This film is not only a break away from the typical romantic holiday film, it also breaks down so many gender barriers. I'd rather my daughter watch this, than many other holiday films that further the idea that a Christmas movie has to be about finding a man. The little reindeer is adorable and Hader is charming. Shirley MacLaine is amazing, as always. Check it out for yourself, don't let the 6.3 number deter you, some folks are just Scrooges."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I actually really enjoyed this movie. Anna Kendrick is charming as always and Bill Hader is just awesome! The movie reminded me a little of Elf (which is my favorite Christmas movie). I'm sure I'll be watching Noelle every Christmas now."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Noelle is supposed to be about the true meaning of Christmas. A lot of the reviews are stuck on what they perceive is a woke agenda to push gender fluidity down our throats! That's not the case at all. How many families out there is lead only by a mother? Doesn't she play Santa ever year for her children until they lose that innocent wonder and belief? So why Is it so hard to enjoy a movie where the daughter of Santa knew the spirit of Christmas better than the son? Stop looking at Hollywood to solve all your problems and politics but look at Hollywood to bring you entertainment that represents all and not just one side. Every movie doesn't have to be political or have an ulterior motive!!! Noelle is a cute and enjoyable movie. Sure it can be a little cheese and predictable but go into with open eyes and open hearts! You won't regret it!"}, {"id": 8, "text": "I enjoyed this a lot. It's a new take on a Christmas movie and tackles modern day issues in a funny way. It's disconcerting how many people are upset at the idea of a woman becoming Santa just because of tradition. It's a cute watch- cheesy and a good family film."}, {"id": 9, "text": "My wife and I decided to watch this new Christmas movie despite the low reviews. We are glad we did. This movie will become one we watch every year now. It has great lessons to be learned and some amazing heart touching moments. This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy not just once but for many Christmas's to come."}, {"id": 10, "text": "If it wasn't for having stars like Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader in this, it for sure would have been an Disney Channel movie. It is very cheesy and very predictable. And the CGI, while not the worst thing I have ever witnessed, is clear they didnt have a big budget. And if those Disney Channel type of movies are your jam, then sure I think you'll like this. But there was too many times for me where I was cringing over the dialogue (lots of christmas related puns) or over things happening in the plot. I think the actors did the best they could with what they were given and there were certain little moments here and there that I liked but overall....not the best film. But I suppose if you are looking for something safe to watch this Christmas with your family, then its fine."}, {"id": 11, "text": "This is just cute. It's no easy task to put out a new Christmas movie...even if you are Disney. Some of the reviews will tell you this is changing tradition or trying to rewrite history to add more women. Whatever. It's got a lot of heart, a great cast, and amazing costumes. Just enjoy it."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I never felt immersed in this movie the way I would in many others. As others started it is very boring and definitely has an agenda and that agenda is not to entertain. However the reason I couldn't get into it was the overboard advertisements and product endorsements. There is actually a line where Shirley McClain's character jumps out and asks if Anna's character likes her Supercuts haircut. I could probably recite more of these than the plot since that seemed to be the main point. iPods, Petco, etc... I actually commented that I'd rather watch a Hallmark movie and I am not a fan."}, {"id": 13, "text": "I'm guessing Disney's budget for original content all went towards the Mandalorian. The script feels like a first draft written by a film student. Almost all the jokes fall flat. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped. The plot is lazy and predictable. Dialogue feels forced and unnatural. Despite the respectable cast, there are way better Christmas movies out there. I'd skip this one."}, {"id": 14, "text": "If you are desperate for Xmas films and don't require much more than something nice to look at (excepting the CG, which looks like it belongs in another world, along with the badly backlit characters through the entire film) then you will probably like this. It has costumes and some colourful scenery. If you require something more from your holiday fare then give it a pass. My main complaint is that the movie flatlined from start to finish; there were no moments of wonder or joy, no lead up to a fun conclusion, nothing. It feels like someone boring telling a story, talking to you in a monotone on and on. Its a shame because it could have been a decent little film. But it's not."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Ipad commercials throughout the entire movie. Is this what Disney has become, hidden advertising in their movies."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Good actors waisted on bad writing, boring story, weak humor, and terrible CG."}, {"id": 17, "text": "I get it white man bad, incompetent. Girl good. Can we produce a movie that isn't this woke. Even in the thriller mystery genres, I know who the bad guy is. It's the white male best friend. EVERY TIME. . So with that in mind. Your kids will probably enjoy this movie and have the narrative enforced that men are bad and incompetent and women are superior. If we are in a patriarchy, the men are doing it very badly. lol"}, {"id": 18, "text": "Well that must one of the most boring christmas movies i have seen in my life. The characters don't connect at all and yeah girls do everything better and men are lazy. They totally forgot that christmas is a team effort. Why couldn't sis and bro work together to save christmas. What a letdown."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Seriously? Why? I love Christmas movies and I was really looking forward to this one. Leave Santa alone! Santa is not a woman. I'm sick of all these woke movies trying to get us to believe men are incompetent and can't do anything and women have to take over and do a better job. Over it!"}, {"id": 20, "text": "Then this movie is for you. I might have smiled once or twice but not more than that. Predict plot, jokes that aren't funny, typical 2019 Disney production."}, {"id": 21, "text": "It's reasonably charming if you can see past the social engineering and advertisements. The sets look and feel really Christmassy, something you can well imagine Disney doing well. They got two half decent leads in for a camp and cheesy Christmas movie and it certainly has its charms, the little reindeer is incredibly cute (yes the cgi isn't top notch, but this isn't Infinity War) but of course, like most movies these days nothing is sacred and it does unfortunately fall to the predictable pandering that most movies have done over the past 4-5 years, which is a shame as this could have been a Christmas classic, instead, for me at least, one watch was enough. It wasn't terrible but the messaging spoils what could have been a real charming experience."}, {"id": 22, "text": "I was looking forward to watching this film with my family, but boy was I disappointed. The film was very low budget, which I could work around. The plot was very predictable and there were many cheesy lines. Again, these are things I could work around, having seen many Hallmark movies.What rubbed me the wrong way was feeling like an agenda was being pushed. If I'm watching a cutesy Christmas movie, it's to be entertained, not to presented an example of how flexible gender roles are. I really wish a different movie was selected."}, {"id": 23, "text": "I wanted to like this movie. Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader are awesome but the script was obvious and predictable, it fell short of funny and I think we should all just pretend it didn't happen."}, {"id": 24, "text": "What a waste of 2 hours. It tried really hard to be the new Elf, but wasn't funny or entertaining. The only reason it gets any positive ratings from people is they like the actors."}, {"id": 25, "text": "I love Bill Hader, and Anna Kendrick is great...but this was awful.Every show and movie I watch lately is forcing this feminist agenda down my throat, and now even Santa. No thanks.Shirley MacLaine is still alive....that surprised me though..."}, {"id": 26, "text": "Why why you ruin every classic with a modern society problems .... was this even worth making the store roll all over feminists ?... And the script is so poor ."}, {"id": 27, "text": "This film was so bland and had no heart or soul. I normally like a bad Christmas movie but I could only watch 30 minutes worth and turned it off."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Sigh more painful Hollywood B grade trash. Cant they write a fun movie without pushing an agenda? We get it middle aged white man bad woman good. Frankly I'm shocked the female lead wasnt a woman of color. Total cringefest with forced and badly written dialog. Even Bill Hader cant save this Christmas on Elm St."}, {"id": 29, "text": "I understand that they wanted to make a goody, innocent kind of movie. But come on, such movies end up being naive and cliche. One person in Santa Country (or the Poles as they call it) knows all about GPS and online stuff, while she i.e Noelle has no idea what a city is. Wow, this is very absurd. Her character is innocence flowing which literally drowns your senses. In the end she is just too weird, irritating and plain stupid."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Three good actors make a horrible choice and taking on this project. Script was abysmal, product placement was shameful, woke culture being force-fed, and the plot is ridiculous to boot. A complete waste of time, a 1 star is not an exaggeration."}, {"id": 31, "text": "First and foremost, I do not understand nor do I agree with all of the positive reviews for this joke of a movie. I absolutely love Bill Hader and Anna is a great Actress, however everyone else was horrible and gave a turd of a performance. The script is just as bad. There is one line in the movie me and the wife will never forget the bacon is burnt on the outside and raw in the middle. I don't even know what that means. This is a clear rush to release movie and is not an instant Christmas classic. It's a Christmas turd at the very least."}, {"id": 32, "text": "I kinda knew what i was getting my self into,but dident expect it to be that awful. everything was bad the acting,cgi,script, there wasn't a single laugh punchline that landed.Im sick of this feminist touch Hollywood is spitting out, of course we had to have a female santa."}, {"id": 33, "text": "Noelle is the kind of film which you know isn't gonna be that good but it doesn't stop you from having a fun time. It maybe predictable and cheesy but it does have its sweet moments which work well. It works well for the kind of film it is with its plot and chacraters but that is also it's biggest issue. The CGI is really under average and doesn't even feel completed. It does take out you out of the film sometimes. The performances kind of saved this film. Anna Kendrick is really good here. As is Billy Eichner and especially Bill Hader. If it wasn't for them, the movie would feel like a Disney made for tv movie. Its enjoyable and fast paced and it's okay for what it is. It's just poorly written sometimes despite a rather obvious message. But it's a decent enough christmas movie to watch near Christmas time"}, {"id": 34, "text": "Not only is the movie boring, it's almost an exact ripoff of Rankin/Bass' The Year Without a Santa Claus, just without anything as interesting as the Miser Brothers. If you want to watch basically this movie, watch Rankin/Bass'; it's at least shorter."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Cute movie.. Kinda syrupySo you got the typical coward guys world. Day to be Saved by single women... Another hollywoerd take that is filled with the west coast garbage."}, {"id": 36, "text": "This movie was so cute. Anna Kendrick never fails me. The plot was fresh for a Christmas film and it had a decent amount of humorous moments through out the film. I think it's great for kids and adults, and would love to see a sequel out maybe for next christmas!"}, {"id": 37, "text": "This movie is the perfect example of everything wrong with Hollywood. They make the male character a bumbling idiot who needs to have the woman come and do everything for him. Santa! Of all characters, why santa."}, {"id": 38, "text": "35 minutes into it the kids (6,8,11,15) asked us to put something else on and abandoned it, but my wife and I continued to watch it ourselves thinking that it must get better...it doesn't.Disney made BILLIONS last year...we deserve better. It's a BLATANT rip-off of Rankin/Bass Year Without a Santa, Fred Claus, and Elf...without the great story. Oh, and the non-stop product placement was as pathetic as the main character telling us Christmas is really about understanding and...iPads. Hollywood is out of touch with average people. We really wanted to like this because of Anna Kendrick."}, {"id": 39, "text": "Tradition change, says Santa. But Santa is not a man!! So where is RuPaul??"}, {"id": 40, "text": "More of a iPad commercial then a Christmas movie, watch something else."}, {"id": 41, "text": "How many movies can Disney ruin? This movie felt like a collection of commercials and cliches. Horrible in every way."}, {"id": 42, "text": "Soooo Anna Kendrick runs around aimlessly with little reason for being while a hapless Bill Hader is supposed to be Santa Clause but doesn't want to be. Hmmmm. The rest of the plot is a cheap badly executed eskimo out of the north pole knockoff of Elf. Hader looks as much like he should be Santa Clause as he does Darth Vader.They go to Phoenix of all places and spend most of the movie there. Glad it was Phoenix this time around and not LA or NYC. The film makers actually do a good job of showing Phoenix off which I liked having lived there. Still, Phoenix in a Christmas movie like this didn't really make sense or work.The quasi-love interest private investigator?!? was a cool dude with a cool car but he was honestly kinda boring. His kid was more interesting but the kid was a plot device.The mall, CGI baby reindeer, growly old elf lady, and elf supreme court all also did not work.I liked the IT nerd elf but not the endless product placement. This movie is basically a commercial for amazon prime delivery.This movie is strange but a reality."}, {"id": 43, "text": "The movie was okay. Noelle was very innocent and didn't even know what a city was. The thing is all these liberal companies are pushing all this women can do stuff men do and I totally agree with that. But making Santa a girl!!! Really? Santa should not be a girl. There are certain characters and positions that should not be played by a girl and that's Santa. I don't mean any offense to women. There are also some things guys can't do but women can. I mean it's true."}, {"id": 44, "text": "Cute and fun. Bad script. Full of SJW themes. The movie could have been done differently and achieved the same result."}, {"id": 45, "text": "This is anything but joy. Disney needs to tone it down the product placement, awkward progressiveness, and tone deaf attack on mega corporations."}, {"id": 46, "text": "An hour and forty minute IPad commercial with other endorsements and a couple chuckles. Woke propaganda."}, {"id": 47, "text": "I'm so tired of left wing people pushing their agenda through movies and tv shows and media and now children's movies! Christmas is about celebrating The birth of Christ, not what it means to you. Parts of this movie are cute, but overall this is garbage and trying to manipulate viewers about the real reason we celebrate Christmas."}, {"id": 48, "text": "It had its moments, I laughed a few times, it even had a nice heartfelt moment. We all saw the ending coming and you hoped it wasn't going to happen. But it did, Santa got woke. Sigh. Oh, and traditions are more than just wrappings. Stop messing with them."}, {"id": 49, "text": "I watched this with my kids. They liked it. But they like everything Disney. For me it was almost unbearable. Terrible CGI. Bad script and storyline. Typical woke garbage. Subtle anti-male, anti-christianity jabs are littered throughout the movie."}, {"id": 50, "text": "A obvious plot from the beginning. Outlandish attempt to change the very essence of the religious and traditional roots and very meaning of Christmas. Agenda driven and lacking the beauty and warmth of a real Christmas movie. Promotes IPad shamelessly and suggests Buddhism as the source of peace and Joy. Shame on you, Disney."}, {"id": 51, "text": "I can't help writing about this ridiculous flick as I am sick of these typical 'Muricans' so-called comedies. I thought it was a good decent family drama. Turns out it's super cliche, absurd, and utterly horrible. I don't need to elaborate the details. Every negative review has done it. I'll sum up my thought about this Noelle story in one word: CRINGE.Anyway, WATCHING THIS feminist-holliweird lil flick RIGHT AFTER WATCHING the old heartwarming woodsman's story in KLAUS (2019) is too bloody painful! The whole idea of this film is a joke. This is easily, I mean, absolutely one of the worst Christmas---trying-to-be---comedy flicks I've ever seen."}, {"id": 52, "text": "Really witty, cheesy, and entertaining movie ruined by pushing a PC, woke agenda. Stick to the classics."}, {"id": 53, "text": "If you like, cute, heartwarming, and funny then I suggest you check this film out for yourself. Anna Kendrick is as usual a delight and the rest of the cast doesn't disappoint. Like the movie Elf, it has a message for the tenderhearted, the kid in all of us. I laughed, smiled and shed a little tear.I plan to add this to my annual Christmas playlist as soon as I can."}, {"id": 54, "text": "It has everything that a Christmas movie needs. Plus the soundtrack was done by one of my favorite bands, Lawrence. It also features a member of the band, Gracie Lawrence and is written and directed by Marc Lawrence. Overall good movie"}, {"id": 55, "text": "I'll never let my children watch this crazyness. Thanks again disney."}, {"id": 56, "text": "Disney, Christmas, and Anne Kendrick. What was not to like. I enjoyed the film which makes light of modern culture. Julie Hagerty plays Mrs. Claus as if she was still in Airplane. Anne Kendrick was adorable as Santa's daughter trying to save Christmas as her brother doesn't want to take over the job. Shirley MacLaine as an elf was enjoyable as well as Billy Eichner as the tech guy. In a way it shows how technology is killing traditions. Sad on a certain level. The kids might like it too."}, {"id": 57, "text": "As I said in the header, this is proof of what Disney' Main goal is, to change history &amp; make you think the way they do!!! Besides the bad acting, not woke!!! Would love to know who the Genius was that came up with that because to be AWOKE means you see what Disney &amp; the like minded are doing!! Let me jump to the real problem here,it's wanting you to believe Santa is a female!!! Let's go back to what has always been known about the origins of Santa!!! Chris Kingle was a MAN who decided he would give out presents pretty much!! Santa is a big man whose belly jiggles like jello &amp; has a long white BEARD!!!

Written by committee? Check. Sponsored by Apple, Hilfiger and a Phoenix megamall? Check.

It checked all the Christmas boxes. Heartwarming and lots of fun. Anna Kendrick was as funny as usual, and you have to respect how genius her comedy truly is. The whole cast was great. I also love the changes to typical Christmas tales. Even though you can see certain things coming, the story is told in a way that is light and hilarious while tugging at your heartstrings. I enjoyed it, my family enjoyed it. I think anyone who criticizes it needs to realize that the stories told during the holidays are basically all the same. They've all been done.

They even tried to fake some sentimental garbage towards the end about what Christmas truly was... only to sum it all up into a joke about... you guessed it: iPads!...

The first movie we watched? A Christmas movie of course! It was one of the Disney folks' first attempts at custom content, but it wasn't very good. The acting was OK.Cheryl said: That gal is a singer, why isn't she singing in this movie? Then (spoilers below) it turned out to be a propaganda film for modern radical feminists who want to overthrow every single masculine image in the world, and replace it with a woman (who can do better presumably, or at least as good). And the men in the movie are mostly girly men, exploring their Feelings, or they are nerds, incapable of feeling anything at all (like joy at Christmas, when we celebrate the birth of our Savior).Ignore the fact that Santa is legend, and derives from Northern European roots, and comes from a place and time where strong masculine men had to work hard to simply survive the elements, let alone try to do good in their world.Lastly, they tried to coopt Christmas and turn it into a Non-religious holiday by having Buddhists and folks at the North Pole into yoga and eastern mysticism, of all things.We rated it 2/5 stars overall.NOT recommended."}, {"id": 84, "text": "So...here we have a story of Santa having kids (boy Nicholas and girl Noelle) and naturally, the boy is being groomed to be the 24th Santa to take up the reins (pun intended). However, as they prepare for the first Christmas without their father, Nick is expected to take over...and after some advice from his sister, he bolts, leaving a cousin to be in charge and be the next Santa. Noelle goes after him and they both discover that SHE is the one who inherited the twinkle to be the next Santa.First off, Santa isn't a real person (sorry for those who still believe) so there's no strict code (as the Elder Elves stated) as to the requirement of a male to be Santa. That said, Santa - Father Christmas - is based on Saint Nicholas of Myra, also known as Nicholas of Bari, who was a 4th century monk who became the patron saint of children. So for 1600 years, Santa Claus (Sinterklaas) has been a man.Second, this is Disney, and they have a habit of creating social justice stories out of things that are better left alone. That said, they did a pretty decent job of making this transition to a female Santa without the negativity associated with the militant PC Warriors we have in the streets instead of a hospital padded room.I can't say for sure that's what the filmmakers were going for, but in the grand scope of things, I found myself liking the overall story concept, the execution of the plot, and the fact that it is left open for a possible sequel where Noelle and Jake are together and have a mixed child that becomes the first Santa of color. As long as they keep the general spirit of Christmas in the film, I'd be up for watching it.Overall, I liked this film. I only gave it an 8/10 because there are things I would have done differently (like have someone other than Shirley MacClaine in it anywhere)...but I didn't make the film and I enjoyed the hour and a half distraction. This will definitely be part of my holiday viewing list in the future."}, {"id": 85, "text": "In the Disney Movie 'Noelle' directed and written by Marc Lawrence, the movie stars Noelle Kringle (Anna Kendrick) and Nick Kringle (Bill Hader) on their Christmas adventures.The setup for the plot is simple. When Santa passes away, his son Nick Kringle is the next in line to play the part. That being said, he isn't exactly great at it nor does he fully understand how to be Santa Claus. As a result, his sister Noelle Kringle tells him to take the weekend off so he can destress. However, Nick has unexpectedly traveled to Arizona for vacation and it seems he isn't coming back.Now, it is up to Noelle Kringle to find where his brother is in Arizona and bring him back to the North Pole and save Christmas day. However, she isn't alone in this endeavor. With help from the detective Jake Hapman (Kingsley Ben-Adir) she stays with him and his family while they piece together the mystery location of the scurried away, brother. He is then found to be a yoga instructor and wants to keep that business going instead of being Santa Claus. In the end, although the brother is brought back to the North Pole, it is discovered that he wants to give the reins to Noelle Kringle, considering that she has more talent than Nick, in terms of being kinder to kids, actually caring about children, and also has the gift of speaking any language naturally including verbal and non-verbal. .Overall, the comedic plot is indirectly centered around this idea of female empowerment which doesn't feel forced into the plot. I felt Anna Kendrick perfectly conveyed someone that walked the fine line of funny, courageous, and talented in this entertaining film. For example, one scene had Noelle explaining how she was super hot being in Arizona because she is from the freezing cold North Pole. In order to fix her little dilemma, the next scene shows her cuts into her inside a supermarket freezer. The movie has tons of little moments like these that come unexpectedly but are very welcome to the charm of her character.That being said, if I had anything negative to say about the writing it is towards the end of the film. It kinda feels like they were really trying to push in the reused Christmas puns just because...they could? Although it felt unnecessary it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the film.Technically speaking, the cinematography, editing, and lighting are great. The cinematography is great with a good amount of sweeping shots rather than the repetitive camera changes that are usually seen in lower-budget films. The editing was great because each scene felt fluid and nothing was really dragged out. Finally, the lighting was fantastic. You can clearly see how the North Pole conveys a sense of warmth and comfiness and the scenes in Arizona convey that super hot, bright, and sunny feeling. All throughout the movie you are really immersed.Personally, the movie is really fantastic. From the plot, the cinematography, the writing and dialogue, the editing, the lightning, and much more I would rate the movie an 8/10. The cinematography is great with the number of sweeping shots however, some clever framing could have been done for a nice extra touch. The editing and lighting were great as colors and quality were super vivid in each shot, combined with natural story pacing. That being said the Christmas puns were overly intense towards the very end of the film that could have been removed entirely or used newer better ones. The movie leaves you feeling wanting more but leaves you feeling satisfied with what you got."}, {"id": 86, "text": "Wow being from az they got Phoenix just right lol.

I aslo disliked how every men and women in north pole are... well... polarized. Every men are traditionnal while every women are progressists.Most of the movie is her discovering normal Arizona while searching for her brother. You can't help but compare with Will Ferell in Elf. Kendrick make such adorable faces but her body is often very stiff, wich undermine the jollynes she is supposed to embody.Once she does embrace her true calling, it is very fun. I would have like to have more of Santa Lass. This should have gotten way more screen time instead of the trying to force her brother.

No Oscars will be won, but if you like Christmas movies (and don't have a bee in your bonnet about old traditions being shaken up) you might find it fun. P.S. People who have claimed this is woke are missing the point and probably feel the white man is under threat. It offers a twist on a traditional character, and addresses it directly. Essentially the message is that not everyone is right for the role people expect them to fill, and it can be the unlikely person who is best for the job.

What a heartwarming and lovely holiday movie Noelle was, I have a lot of good things to say about this film so lets get started.First of all the movie had amazing cinematography, it was hilarious, it had an interesting family dynamic and premise and was also fairly nostalgic in places. The movie looked visually fantastic, it instantly made you feel warm inside and reminded you of Christmas, the world building was also fantastic for the north pole. Next the movie was absolutely hilarious, this was largely due to Anna Kendricks infectious charm and comedic timing, but the movie made me laugh out loud on multiple occasions with how clueless Noelle was in the real world, and the humour just worked and landed all the time. I also thought the general premise of the movie of Santa and his job being a family dynamic and having loads of different parts to it was really interesting. The movie for me was also very nostalgic in a lot of places. It reminded me a lot of Elf, which I think is a Christmas classic, It had the similar charm of someone from a completely different world trying to fit in to what we as the audience think is normal day to day life, Anna Kendrick also had the same amount of humour and charm as Will Ferrell which is an added bonus.My next few positives would be the fun set up, likeable main performances and chemistry between characters. I thought the set up of Noelles brother taking her comments to him literally and living a normal life in America was just a great set up for the whole movie, it set up the desired goals for the characters well and set up the fun light hearted tone as well, I also thought the comedic performances from Bill Hader and Anna Kendrick as well as their chemistry between each other was fantatstic. Anna Kendrick was absolutely perfect In this role and she was just so charming and likeable, every single one of her jokes and comedic moments landed due to her fantastic delivery and the great dialogue she was given, she also worked very well with Bill Hader, they bounced off each other really well with their comedy and just in general and there chemistry was great.My only slight negative for the movie would be that it was fairly predictable. You could tell what was going to happen with the story pretty much straight away and the movie didn't really try to surprise you with doing something different which would have been nice but it still didn't stop the experience from being amazing.My next few positives would be the inclusivity of the movie, its great themes and its script. I thought the movie did a fantastic job at exclusivity, it showed kids from all different classes and walks of life and how Christmas for them isn't as fun as what everyone thinks, this was great and very touching for me, Therefore because of this the movie had great themes, the theme of hope and kindness was really touching and well explored throughout that will truly make a lot of people connect with this movie. The script itself was also great, its comedic dialogue was superb, and its commentary on how difficult it is for a lot of members of society to survive, but that Christmas gives people hope and offers an opportunity to show kindness was just truly powerful, with the monologue in the final act being really moving.My final few positives would be how heartwarming the movie was, the character arc for Noelle and the final act. The movie just handled its more emotional moments so perfectly it just filled my heart with such warmth and joy when watching, it just felt like a perfect holiday movie. I also liked the character arc for Noelle. Despite it being predictable it was still well constructed, going from alone and not being needed, to having the well explored powers required she truly was a fantastic and well-deserved Santa, and her acceptance felt well earned. The final act in general was also just fantastic, it had all the humour, craziness, and heart that the movie had all in one package that just worked and ended the movie amazingly and putting a smile on my face.Overall, despite the story being predictable, Noelle, is a hilarious, well-constructed holiday movie with plenty of emotion and heart, held together brilliantly by the fantastic performances from Bill Hader and the true star of the movie Anna Kendrick."}, {"id": 161, "text": "I have to say I did not expect to laugh so much!

It has many plot holes and many the jokes related to the innocence of the leading character are so dumb that are almost cringy. It's practically like an Enchanted but with Christmas jokes instead of princesses.I enjoy the story for his story, characters and acting cause the jokes are actually blank, they are just a couple of then that are actually hilarious. SPOILER I don't think this movie is trying to transmit a feminist message with the twist of Santa being a woman, I think the message is that it shouldn't matter your gender for a job, it just matters that you possess the capacities for it.And I'm here for it. In addition, I appreciate the fact that this movie is about exhibiting that Christmas is about giving instead of receiving. It's not something completely unfamiliar but it's pretty well developed in here.Rating: 7/10 Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader are awesome. The emotional movie has a good massage.

But one day Nick is nowhere to be found in the North Pole, forcing Noelle to go to the outside world and find him before Christmas Eve.A good idea for a Christmas movie, and had the movie had more weight and substance to it it could have been a nice holiday gem. I like some of the side stories such as Nick ending up becoming a yoga instructor half way through, thought that was funny; having Santa end up as a Yoga instructor. I also liked the scenes between Noelle, a private investigator she meets named Jake, and his son Alex. I always like Christmas movies where they turn Santa's workshop into some industrialised business making profits, it's always been a funny twist to the Santa Clause legend.Overall though this movie isn't very memorable, even with the likes of Kendrick and Hader in it. It just feels like a run of the mill holiday movie; feels like they should add it to the Hallmark movie channel. And some of the CGI in this movie feels really dated, mainly this baby reindeer Noelle befriends.This movie will be one you watch once and then move on with your life.

In a lot of ways Noelle does this spectacularly! The leads do a fantastic job, the ser design and costumes are spectacular, the humor is on point, and it's overall a well put-together movie. However, agendas in movies are always obvious. Disney thinks they're sneaky with their agendas, but you can see them a mile away. I love the idea of having Santa's daughter take over for him when he dies. It's original, it's clever, and I'm sure that girls all over the world would feel empowered from this! But that wasn't enough for Disney, they had to take a stab at 'the patriarchy.' In the first scene Santa tells Noelle's deadbeat brother, Nick, that he is going to be Santa one day but then he tells Noelle that she can just make pretty Christmas cards. And then in the middle of the climax the council of elves tells the town that they had read the elf constitution wrong and that Santa did not, in fact, have to be a boy and that it was just a tradition that they had been blindly following for thousands of years. You're honestly going to tell me that not only the elves at the north pole, but Santa himself are mysoginists??? Are you kidding me right now??? There were other examples throughout the movie, but these were the two most striking because they're in the beginning and the climax, literally the two most important parts of the whole movie, and both times Ibwas ripped right out of the movie because I had to try and wrap my head around misogyny in the land of reindeer and hot cocoa.

Her brother Nick (Bill Hader), who is to become the new Santa, gets cold feet and goes missing. So, it's up to Noelle to find go out into the world and find him. Disney made this a couple years ago. It was originally going to be a theatrical release but got held back bringing on the rumors that the corporation didn't have much trust in it, and they they were probably right. Noelle is a rather stale effort.The general story on paper could've worked, but nothing about the script manages to stick the landing. The movie foreshadows how things will turn out pretty early on. Yes, a lot of successful Christmas films can be predictable, but it all depends on how it goes down and nothing of a whole lot of interest happens or is said. This is a fish-out-of-water movie, too, and I usually like those, but that aspect has even less to work with than the Christmas part. Usually good actors Hendricks and Hader aren't able to salvage the lines in this.I also found the film to be a little mean spirited. You're expecting the people behind Christmas to be optimistic, but the elves and even Noelle's mother end up being pretty petty to her.To the movie's credit, there are few good jokes here and there. (There's a good bit with a gavel.) I also appreciate that the threat to Christmas' future, Noelle's cousin Gabrielle (Billy Eichner) who wants to digitize and streamline the way the holiday is done, isn't portrayed as a true villain but in a more nuanced way as someone who means well but is misguided.I also felt the depiction of the South Pole Christmas town to be rather underwhelming. It feels a little mundane for the place where holiday magic happens. The buildings look like they're from a regular tourist town or a Hallmark Christmas movie. The outfits mostly look too much like regular winter clothes. And how much do fake elf ears cost? Because there seemed to be a lot of effort to keep ears hidden.Your kids may get more from this and be less discerning. The movie does try to provide positive messages and a story of female empowerment. As for adults, understand this isn't downright bad; it just doesn't feel an hour forty well spent. Watching felt like more of a task than a pleasure."}, {"id": 220, "text": "Disney has officially released its long-awaited streaming service, Disney+. While many viewers are excited to rewatch their classic favourites and new upcoming Star Wars and Marvel series, it also seems that they will be creating their own original films every so often as well. One of their first at launch was that of Noelle. Just in time for the Christmas season, Disney+ released this Christmas film to warm the hearts of families around the world. Sadly, I feel that the execution of this movie is a mixed bag. Do I think Disney+ is worth purchasing? Yes, very much so. Do I think this is the movie that you should watch before anything else? Probably not.After the passing of their father, siblings Noelle (Anna Kendrick) and Nick (Bill Hader) find themselves having to take over the family business. With their father having been Santa Claus and them having lived in the North Pole all their lives, they know nothing else. Nick is next in line to become Santa but ultimately flees the scene when nerves kick in. Noelle ventures to find him and hijinks ensue. Noelle is a film that works as a sweet, yet super corny little Holiday flick, but the third act of the film sort of took away from the rest of it for me.Without giving anything away for those who wish to watch, the third act of this movie really begins to hit you over the head with the messages it's trying to send. While I have no problems with these messages, it's almost like the filmmakers thought viewers didn't see these messages slowly presenting themselves throughout the entire movie. I liked the conclusion for what it was, but the way it was executed fell flat for me. There was a lot of emotion set-up throughout the movie that does have a payoff, but I felt disconnected from it all.Anna Kendrick is as loveable and quirky as she has always been and Bill Hader (although having much less screen time) is quite good with the material he is given as well. Where this movie fell apart was easily in the screenplay. I didn't mind the direction here, in fact, I actually liked it, which was no surprise seeing as I enjoyed director Marc Lawrence's work on Music &amp; Lyrics. With that said, he also wrote this screenplay and I found a few key elements were missing to make the finale of this movie truly work.In the end, Noelle is a passable, at times very enjoyable Christmas movie, but ultimately collapses by the end for me. It's not that I despised where they went, it's just how it was done. For fans of Holiday films, no matter what they are about, this movie might appeal to you more. I personally love a great Holiday flick and I'm usually pretty forgiving of them, but this one didn't quite work.

It was a TV movie, but this was even bad for a TV movie. Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader did fine acting. They didn't really have any scenes I found myself laughing at. That was a big problem. Almost to none of the comedy was funny. There was one of two jokes, but besides that, it just wasn't funny. I seemed like they tried to make this movie like elf, but they failed miserably. Julie Hagerty was a little weird in this film. I have seen her in a new film recently and realized this is not like her at all. The setting was fine I guess. Most of the film was in Arizona. That was really the only good thing. The acting was sort of good too. I can't get over this character though. It felt like he was reading a book to a bunch of Kindergartners. He did a terrible job.Overall, Noelle is not a film I would recommend watching."}, {"id": 222, "text": "From the opening scene, the messaging is clear and heavy handed in Noelle; get ready to discard your traditional views and embrace a new and brighter future where santa doesn't need to be a man. This heavy handedness does not however mean that this film cannot be entertaining.Anna Kendricks plays a North Pole princess that learns about being generous, letting go of her self-absorbed way of life to ultimately give on a global scale. These are positive themes, and it touchingly addresses topics around Christmas for people who don't have great Christmas experiences. The film does well at finding quirky humour in banter between the leads and touching the heart with life challenges. To see these things you will have to look past a truck load of product endorsements, obvious pandering to gender and ethnic equality and just plain stupid behavior written only to feed the forced narrative. Never mind the choir of Santa's helpers - a litteral line up ethnic stereotypes; The elders of the North Pole are another conspicuous lineup of ethnically diverse men who are blithering idiots at all points until they're suddenly not, while the three lead women in the film are the only common sense in sight.Not content to slight patriarcal stereotypes,z7 they also find time to take jabs at organized religion. The North Pole is governed for thousands of years by blind tradition with a board of elders, a book of santa (the Bible of santa clausenes) and a founding testament. When a person makes no mistake in this society they are instantly excommunicated, losing status and acceptance, judgemental attitudes alienate under the tenets of their creed - all portryed in a negative light. The movie places the moniker in santa we trust on the money of the North Pole as if to solidify that God himself needs to be a tradition done away with; an idea comically played out in the humourous use of religious explicatives in the North Pole replacing God's name with other Christmas related things. This movie takes subtle jabs at the church and Christmas traditions beyond those including Santa Clause and for some viewers this may prove to be delightful, others might find it off-putting.Now, seriously speaking, this all doesn't make for great storytelling, but it can result in a quirky, cute Christmas story with some tugging at the heart strings. The reason for Christmas provided by the film is a good one, and it doesn't become just another Christmas movie. There's also no shortage of silly humour, played well by the leads that will appeal to families that want light hearted fun for their family and can look past the political undertones."}, {"id": 223, "text": "I'll start off by saying that I LOVE Christmas movies.

It can even be rather loosely held together with plot if you feel something. You should find yourself at some point laughing, crying, and going awwww and of course feeling the magic. Unfortunately, Disney+'s first attempt at creating a holiday classic fails to deliver enough of any of these. The humor was very base line and very predictable. It often relied too much on modern tech humor which means that older generations won't be enjoying it as much. Sure it had some really good moments but there were far too many jokes that just didn't land.You have little to no emotional connection to most of the characters...Santa even comes off as a misogynist at times.The holiday magic is there at least.

All I can say for sure is that the last half got legs, and actually made me feel like a Christmas should make one feel. A little happy, a little sad, and a little nostalgic.

Nick is unsure about how to do this and gets stressed out. His sister Noelle Kringle (Anna Kendrick) advises him to take it easy to take his rest.Noelle is looking for her brother. When Nick gets lost, Noelle is blamed for his disappearance. She has to find him before the Christmas party officially starts, because if she doesn't find and prepare him on time, she has to make sure that as the new Santa she sees everything to arrange for the Christmas party and that all children have their Christmas presents on get time.This is a nice new Christmas film to watch with the family, but the film is meant more for younger viewers. For adult viewers, the film may seem familiar and predictable. To watch a nice Christmas film with the whole family, you better look back at a classic such as Elf, The Santa Clause or Home Alone. Furthermore, the film does not really have the quality of a cinema film, which explains why Disney chose to put the film on their new streaming service Disney +.The effects also look more like effects that you see nowadays in a less film than a real family or cinema film. Adult viewers can see that the animals have been placed in the film with CGI despite the fact that they can look cute. Younger viewers will notice this less and can enjoy the animals and what they do in the film more.Anna Kendrick delivers fun and appropriate acting in the lead role of this film. She looks nice as a positive person who goes to the real human world for the first time and feels like a fish here. In this way she manages to create some comical moments in the film. Bill Hader also does fun in the film, but he does not play such a big role because his character is missing for a large part of the film."}, {"id": 226, "text": "Pretty bad and awful.Anna K is a good actress.

'Noelle (2019)' tells the tale of the first Christmas since Santa's passing, which threatens to derail itself when Santa's son - his supposed successor - runs away from his responsibilities. It's up to the eponymous Noelle to travel all the way to Phoenix, Arizona and bring her brother back before it's too late. The majority of the movie plays like a 'fish out of water' comedy, as the North Pole-born protagonist struggles to fathom a place with people who aren't nice to each another and weather that burns instead of freezes. It's here where the piece finds its most success, its characters interacting in often enjoyable ways and its general vibe being rather charming. It's also somewhat of a strange detour, as it doesn't really mesh with the flick's snow-covered opening and high-flying finale. To be honest, the first act is really rough. Its cheeriness seems somewhat forced and it's all pretty generic, too. Eventually, though, it settles into itself. Though it always has issues (such as dodgy CGI, blatant product placement and a typically heavy hand), it ends up being fairly entertaining. It also has a good message and manages to deliver it rather well. In general, it sticks the landing. However, it does take a long time to get to its ultimate point. It's almost like two movies stuck together, in a way. It's a decent festive effort. 6/10"}, {"id": 228, "text": "This is being said with a heavy heart. Love Christmas, so this is not coming from a Scrooge or a Grinch. The concept was an interesting one and sounded like it had ideas that tried to do something different. The cast is a talented one, Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader are always watchable and have gotten a lot of enjoyment over-time out of Shirley MacLaine's early career work. So this is coming from someone that really wanted to like 'Noelle' and should have liked it.Sadly, count me in as another person that didn't care for 'Noelle' and was very disappointed by it. The cast is one of the better things about it, but the script and story sink 'Noelle' badly. It is not one of the worst Christmas films out there, but there are far better too. Despite seeing it on Disney+, 'Noelle' did feel like an average or just below Hallmark/Lifetime Christmas film with sporadic attempts at doing things differently but mostly followed a typical formula but in a heavier manner than most.'Noelle' has its good things. Generally it doesn't look too bad. It has a slick look to the photography and doesn't look drab or garish. The soundtrack has memorable and easy to listen to moments, not making the mistakes of being used too constantly or being over-scored.Most of the cast do laudably with what was given to them, the material was beneath them but they did well. Kendrick is charming and Hader has nice amusing moments and likeability. MacLaine enjoys herself. There are sweet, cute moments that are sadly too far and between.The one exception when it comes to the cast is to me Billy Eichner, who is too subdued and it didn't seem like his heart was in it. The direction does work against the actors, tending to be too routine and the character interaction could have done with more spark generally. Nor the character writing, too many of the characters are not likeable or interesting so it was hard to root for them or anything here. There is one exception when it comes to talking about the production values and that is including the CGI, which looks horribly fake and felt too out of place as well.Like has been said above, it is the script and the storytelling that are the biggest drawbacks. 'Noelle' fails when it comes to entertainment, any attempts at humour fall flat and come over as lacking in wit or sophistication and instead come over as very cheesy and not always tasteful. The more dramatic moments are too sugary sweet, very dreary in momentum, very melodramatic and the sentimentality is hard to stomach. The story is both dull and contrived, and any attempts at diverting from typical festive formula come over as mean-spirited and heavy-handed to the point of being shoved down the throat.Altogether, rather mediocre. Wanted to like it so much more but sorry it just didn't connect with me. 4/10"}, {"id": 229, "text": "It's basically a kid's movie.What we've learned is that Disney Plus is not gonna put a lot of dough into special effects.

She no longer has a neck, most likely due to all the nip and tucks over the past 90 years.So if you are under 12, you'll like this movie.

It is practically a clone of the film Elf making it a fish out of water story. It's practically a larger budgeted Hallmark film with well known actors such as Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader and one the end that's what this is.Noelle feels cheap in a lot of ways and very familiar and I can see why Disney would have opted to release this on their streaming service rather than theatrical. It's not a great film, but isn't terrible either. It's a very silly film, corny to a fault and kind of lame, but the charisma of Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader is what saves it from complete disaster.If you're looking for something that's more akin to a hallmark film or something that will just put you in the Christmas spirit, this film might do it for you, but not everyone is going to be won over by the familiar been there done that story.

With already some tough competitors, Disney+ offer it's own original films such as Lady and the Tramp, and the Christmas family film, Noelle.With Disney+ going live mid November across Australia, it helped push that early Christmas cheer by releasing Noelle, which was originally titled Nicole but was changed to Noelle to go with the Christmas theme.Noelle explores the life of Santa and his jolly family, as he passes down the family legacy to his son Nick Kringle (Bill Hader) in becoming the next future Santa. As Nick struggles to learn the ins and outs of what it takes to be Santa, his sister Noelle (Anna Kendrick) makes a friendly suggestion that Nick should go away for a couple of days to clear his mind and come back refreshed for the job. Having never stepped outside of the North Pole, Nick takes his sisters advice and leaves without notice and embarks to Arizona.When news spreads that Nick has left the village, panic sets into the community as they worry Santa is missing and won't return in time to deliver the presents to all the good children across the world. With little time before Christmas, Noelle makes her mission to bring back her brother and restore the Christmas spirit amongst her village and discovers some hidden skills along the way.Every year when it gets close to December, the excitement builds inside me for what cheesy Christmas films are going to be released, and Noelle provided that thick cheesy goodness. Even though that within the first 5 minutes you can tell how this film is going to end, it still provides the goods. Anna Kendrick offers her witty humour and delivers some festive Christmas puns making her the star of the film.Noelle was originally set to be released in cinema, but Disney decided to withdraw that movement and went with releasing it as Disney+ original to help boost subscriptions. I must say, I'm glad that went with this decision as I don't see the film being a huge blockbuster hit. I struggled to understand what audience they were targeting, as presumably I would've though this film would be perfect for the younger children but it lacked a bit of the silly humour that only a child could laugh at.

Filled with comedy, a message, and warmth. And as much as I didn't want to like this film, I can't help it. Because deep down I know that I enjoyed it more than I'd like to admit.Around the halfway point of this film, I was really unsure about how I felt. This movie is very adamant about pushing its messages through. And trust me, there are a lot of messages. It tackles ideas, such as our dependence on technology, our attitudes towards things different and our habit of relying on preconceived ideas. While these themes are at this point quite overdone, this film also has themes that can't be explored enough. Such as breaking tradition in the face of something new and better and learning to be who we really are and embracing that. It is a Disney film, after all. Had it not forcefully pushed some message, I would've been quite surprised.With all that being said, no matter how many messages there are and no matter how important they might be, the film needs to be enjoyable to have any impact. Whether this film is actually enjoyable or not, isn't up to me, but I did enjoy it more than I expected. There are certainly some bad moments and moments that I needn't have seen, but deep down, Noelle is fun, heartwarming and cheesy in a good way. Everything that a movie like it should be. If you were to look at this film critically, you'd be appaled. But this film shouldn't be looked at critically. What's the point? If it manages to make someone laugh or cry, or feel happy, then what's the point in complaining.One thing that I have learned about myself this holiday season is that I enjoy these cheesy Christmas movies more than I would've ever thought. They are quickly becoming quite the quilty pleasure and, quite frankly, I'm happy about it. There is just something so wonderful about these films. As bad as they are, more often than not, they make me smile and feel warm and fuzzy. Maybe it's the fact that Christmas is my favourite holiday, or maybe I just like bad movies, but I always end up being glad that I spent the time watching one of these films.Noelle is exactly what you'd expect. It does everything exactly how you'd expect, and that's its biggest strength. These films are supposed to feel familiar, and this one certainly does. If you like these types of films, you'll have a good time with this one. If you don't like them, Noelle isn't going to be the one to change your mind. But if you can watch it without thinking too much about whether it's good or bad, you just might end up liking it."}, {"id": 234, "text": "Noelle certainly doesn't do much to grab your eye for a Disney+ original film, but even with its flaws, it is able to pull its own weight by the end of the film to provide for a satisfactory, if corny, Christmas film that can prove to be surprisingly sweet. The film starts out looking like a deeply unoriginal mishmash of christmas comedies before it. However, as it goes on, the film does luckily become more enjoyable, even when it truly doesn't amount to too much. Bill Hader as Nick Kringle is by far the funniest stand out of the bunch, with a scene-stealing performance from Diana Maria Riva in the small role of Helen Rojas. The film can be predictable, corny, and rather played out, but it is also decently entertaining. By the end, Noelle is sweet enough to grab your attention and make you feel something, which is quite impressive considering how long it went on without doing it even a little for the majority of the film, but it is certainly appreciated. In the end, Noelle is yet another forgettable christmas movie that does nothing for its actors, Disney's new streaming service, or Christmas really in general, but it is certainly not a bad choice to watch, and is certainly a preferable option when it comes to non-big screen films from and for this holiday season. My Rating: 6/10"}, {"id": 235, "text": "Noelle Kringle (Anna Kendrick) and Nick Kringle (Bill Hader) are the children of the jolly big guy himself- that's right, Santa Claus. Unfortunately their father passes away with Christmas night not far away. The suit and the responsibility of being Santa Claus now falls on the oldest sibling, Nick (Bill Hader). But Nick expresses his lack of interest in being the new Santa and he runs away from the North Pole. This leaves his younger sister, Noelle, to chase after him and try and convince him of his responsibilities as Santa.This film is one of the two exclusive releases on the new streaming service Disney+ (the other is the live action remake of Lady and the Tramp).Noelle is a film aimed at young children and families. The film's story line is way too predictable for anything else. From the opening act of the film the film's ending is obvious. While this did bother me slightly, I reminded myself- it's a Disney Movie.Actress Anna Kendrick is wonderful as Noelle. I personally enjoyed her enthusiasm and innocence, particularly when she decides to try and find her older brother. She's just so fun as she interacts with those who are both naughty and nice- she is easily the highlight of this film.The film Noelle also has other great actors but I couldn't help but feel they were simply under used given their resume and talent. Actors Bill Hader and Shirley MacLaine were fine here, but given what they did in this film it feels like any actor could have done the same job and that the director has simply not utilised them to their full capacity on screen.I also had a minor issue with the film's CGI work, particularly for one of the animal characters Noelle has interactions with throughout the film. Not only was this animal slightly annoying, but the CGI was rough and it was obvious that actress Anna Kendrick wasn't looking at this character correctly (looking above, below, beside or through the animal). Once again, being a kids film, I doubt people will care as much.Overall, Noelle is a jolly family film. Yes, I found some flaws with it, but because it's clearly aimed at families and young children it's hard to be a naughty boy and write a nasty review. It's a light hearted Christmas comedy with a positive message for all, plus the film has actress Anna Kendrick who is simply the biggest highlight and will bring joy to those who watch it.5.7/10 Walkden Entertainment"}, {"id": 236, "text": "In Noelle, Bill Hader and Anna Kendrick play Santa Claus's children, Nick and Noelle. When they're father dies, Nick reluctantly takes the family job of Santa, and yet ...If you don't know where this movie is going in the first 10 minutes then you've never watched a movie before. The whole thing is a predictable mash-up of previous Christmas movies, taking elements of Elf's fish-out-of-water concept and mixing it in with a standard save Christmas plot.So yeah, it's easy to criticize. And honestly, when a friend recommended it I only watched it begrudgingly. But it's actually tremendously fun.Kendrick is adorable as the wide-eyed innocent, Hader is excellent as the freaked-out son, and there's a hilarious bit about the problems of using predictive analytics to determine whether children are naughty or nice.The main issue with the movie is a certain laziness, with plot points thrown in and then ignored and with Shirley MacLaine's character never quite coming to life. It's a shame, because with a somewhat tighter, more thoughtful script this could have been every bit as good as Elf.Anyway, ignore the haters, this is a solid Xmas movie."}, {"id": 237, "text": "I love Anna Kendrick. She's cute, spunky, multi-talented. A great actress. I've seen most of her films and I'll admit Noelle's draw for me was getting to see Anna Kendrick in another great comedic role. Getting to see Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader together in a high quality Disney film about Christmas? I was all in. Unfortunately, I gotta admit that after watching it, I've come to the conclusion that Noelle wasn't really a great film after all. I was completely mesmerized by the scenes that took place in Santa's HQ at the North Pole. It was fantastic! I wanted more of that but as soon as they got to Phoenix, Arizona, one of the most boring places on Earth and the last place you'd ever associate with Christmas, I had checked out. It didn't work. It didn't feel Christmas-y. I stuck with the film to see how it wold play out. I had my suspicions about what was going to happen...and, well, I was right. Sure it was predictable, but I was hoping it would still that spark that Christmas feeling. It didn't. So in terms of seasonal Christmas movies, which are a dime a dozen these days (thanks to Hallmark and the Lifetime Channel), Noelle is going to be quickly forgotten. I don't expect that it will become a timeless classic or a film that'll be replayed by fans each year. When you compare it to many other Christmas movies, it's on the lower end of the scale. This is unfortunate but it had the potential to be much better. It had a great cast and a great plot. It just needed better writing and direction."}, {"id": 238, "text": "Noelle (3 out of 5 stars).Noelle is a cute Christmas family film which has a little fun with the performances from Anna Kendrick and Bill Hader.

He is overwhelmed with the holiday from practicing on the sleigh, trying to guess what children want for Christmas, and trying to decipher who is good or bad. Noelle sends him on a weekend getaway.

Noelle goes off to Phoenix and in search for her brother to save Christmas.The plot is cute and fun. I love how they played with the setting taking place in Phoenix. Noelle is high spirited. She is thinking everyone is just as nice until she comes across them. Which is kind of funny. It is kind of a different take on the movie Elf in a way. Noelle meets a single father who is struggling to make it the best Christmas for his son. She meets homeless people in a shelter and seeing the hardship some people are going through. When she finds Nick, he is trying to start a new life for himself as a yoga instructor. Which is also kind of hilarious.The film has some fun and cute moments. Anna Kendrick is lovable as an actress. She is funny, high spirited, and her character makes the movie entertaining. Bill Hader is also good as well as a burnt out brother.The film's story may not be held together with its weak direction. As Noelle is falling for Jake (Kingsley Ben-Adir) who is a single father and is helping Noelle through her journey. Noelle loves his son and tries to turn their down spirit to a better one. It never resolves back to it. But when it does it felt a little rushed. The film is fun, it is cheesy, and the visual effects may not be the greatest cause it looks bad. To the part were you can notice what is green screen with the visuals and how bad the cgi is with the reindeers.Overall, Noelle is a fair film. The story is cute. The cast is great. The film has a little fun for being a holiday movie but it sure is a forgettable one."}], "reviews_amount": 239}
