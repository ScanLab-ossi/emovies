Still it is understandable that budget would be an issue. Still the VFX does not disturb the concept of film"}, {"id": 1, "text": "A must watch. Hilariously junkie and unafraid to make a satirical statement on the system and the politics of the system. The humour in Bahut Hua Samman is a mix of old school slapstick comedy, sharp lines, along with a sizeable dash of crudeness. The use of popular and peppy songs of the 80's era adds its own special touch. In the end, when all's well with the world, everything has fallen back into it's right place, Bahut Hua Samman leaves you with the message to speak up, to question, to demand answers - in other words - to keep the spirit of democracy up, running and healthy. It's a good one-time watch, funny and entertaining, if you don't overthink things much, that is."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Satirical dialogue fresh story explaining punjivaad and consumerism affluently.. Sanjay Mishra and raghv Juyal as always good.. but surprise pack is Abhishek Chauhan.. Nidhi has done great job... Overall I like it only lacks it's pace in middle but cover up at last"}, {"id": 3, "text": "For some anti Modi and so called democratic people, It's a kind of sarcasm on the so called current situation in the country. Just keep your political views aside and enjoy the movie, it's a masterpiece. Haven't seen such creativity in a while."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This one out of nowhere arrived on Hotstar, is a treat. Refreshing, satirical, crazy zany humour, likeable leads, awesome performances from all the casts and amazing compilation of soundtracks is a must watch. Abhishek Chauhan is someone to look out for. Sanjay Mishra is always reliable. Nidhi Singh does justice to her character always and Raghav too has good comic timing."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Must watch! Good acting by Raghav, Sanjay Mishra &amp; nidhi... 10/10 to the writer for speaking his heart out.Brave Indeed!!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "A worth watch, doesn't bore at all. Eventful and engaging. Sanjay sir as usual, legend. Raghal Juyal is good. Cubicle fame Abhishek Chauhan has done a pretty decent job here. His is spontaneous. Hope him to see more. Nidhi Singh has also done a good job. All other characters are also good. Ram Kapoor in cameo role of a shooter is also worth watch.Story is good. Based out of Varanasi. Please do watch it."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Hilarious, fun, lots of satires on our political system and the dynamics of our country, along with some very sharp satires on the current regime too... This is a very bold attempt...the humour is a mix of old school slapstick comedy, sharp lines, along with a dash of crudeness. Use of peppy songs of the 80s &amp; 90s just touch it up all at right places. In the end, all ends well and everything falls back into it's right place, but Bahut Hua Samman will leave you with the message to speak up, to question, to demand answers - in other words - to keep the spirit of democracy up, running and healthy. All in all, it is a good one-time watch, funny, entertaining, if you try not to find the story line or don't overthink on it.... For me this one falls in the category of Jane Bhi Do Yaaron league.

Bahut hua Samaan is a perfect example of art which is used a is a tool to educate, motivate, and activate our citizenry, inspire or may be open our hearts and minds to look beyond what they are being shown through the media. It's a dark satire and also a tribute to Indian Cinema of 80s. The uncanny reference to the social and political issues is remarkable. Some action VFX looks hilarious but then it's a brilliant take on action heroes of this era. Sanjay Misra and other actors have done a great justice to the writing and direction .

I would advise all viewers to refrain from such conjecture and not fall into the negative agenda being spread by the makers here..!!

This is quite like Pariwar on the same platform with at times below average comedy &amp; overperfromance. Both promising premises wasted.Directed by Ashish Shukla, produced and bankrolled by Yoodlee films, film division of Saregama starring Raghav Juyal, Abhishek Chauhan, Sanjay Mishra, Ram Kapoor, Nidhi Singh, Namit Das and Flora SainiThe plough position and taati scenes were interestingly nice. The run time is long and editing was one of the awful parts of the movie along with unnecessary cuss words.Disney Plus Hotstar's latest direct to digital release Bahut Hua Samman is a satirical comedy, which seeks to create awareness among the masses about their duty in a democracy - their duty to question and censure those they've voted to power."}, {"id": 116, "text": "Very good entertainer.

An extraordinaire job done by entire team."}, {"id": 151, "text": "An amazing movie in 2020.. the best movie of this year.. pankaj mishra did a fantastic job!! Like some people are saying that it is against one ideology... its not... its just giving a point of view from the other ideology and that too in an amazing way and in now it tries to change your ideology.."}, {"id": 152, "text": "Is slow and steady like a Coen Brothers film. The humour is sometimes loud and in your face but sometimes subtle with a subtext. In either of the cases, it is a great watch. Watch for a good laugh sprinkled with some Sanjay Mishra's Bakchod Baba gyaan."}, {"id": 153, "text": "Don't waste your time guys ... I saw this movie . Found this movie neither comedy nor funny.... You won't find any thing to watch for. I started to watch movie with hype and hope after watching rating .. but m still cursing myself why I watched this one.."}, {"id": 154, "text": "A brilliant satire and comedy. Reminded me of the cult classic Jaane bhi do yaaron. I will watch it again when I need to de-stress!"}, {"id": 155, "text": "Truly awesome.... Do watch... Can't say much about it."}, {"id": 156, "text": "The story reflects the current democratic situation of India, where people are so much dipped in bhakti that they've stopped questioning which is a basic right of every citizen. And that's why the story is relateable. Cast and crew support are all outstanding actors and there is no sign of nepotism. It's a movie that should be in your must watch list."}, {"id": 157, "text": "This movie scores everywhere. Very good actors, great direction, amazing camera work and of course superb comedy thriller.

Just simple, light movie..enjoy it with popcorn!!"}, {"id": 163, "text": "Simply full paisa wasool. Hell of a entertainment."}, {"id": 164, "text": "The movies storyline was great. But it didn't require the evergreen Hinduphobic ideology of bollywood. For instance: 1. Akhand bharat - a term used by Great Chanakya to unite entire Bharat (India) is used as a name for a company which destroys people's lives. 2. Again a Hindu sage whose only ambition is to earn money and attain power. There are idiots in every religion but every time hindu. 3. The sage and story around him is created in such a way that its character (of swami) resembles Baba Ramdev of Patanjali. I think the writers forgot to look the level of expansion yoga got through his teachings. I am not a fan of Ramdev but neither of this idiotic film. 4. Bhola (as name of Shiva) and yadav (Krishna's vansh) are both criminals who want to have intercourse with one woman. 5. A minister is doing vipaasna in a deep state or as the movie says 3 days and 4 to go after that he gets up and start abusing a man with foul language and starts beating him. Maybe vipaasna doesn't treats your mind well.These are just few examples. I will not say don't watch the movie. Do watch it and see what these people are feeding in the minds of teenagers of Bharat. And then think how you should rate this movie."}, {"id": 165, "text": "'Bahut Hua Samman' brings back the crime-comedy genre, which had taken a backseat for quite some time. It has all the prerequisites of the genre and makes for a fun watch, if you are not expecting too much.The film starts with introducing the two male leads and how they get involved in a bank robbery plan. It takes too long for the narrative to reach till this point. An engineering college backdrop is setup, a quirky mentor (Sanjay Mishra) then comes into picture and an elaborate hiest takes place. And if you get restless while reaching till this point, be warned that this is not even the main plot.As the robbery goes wrong, more characters are introduced and a deeper conspiracy theory unveils behind the bank robbery. Ironically, the film gets interesting only now as the story comes to its actual core and you wonder why was so much surplus added in the start just in the name of wacky characters and funny dialogues.Some scenes are very interestingly conceptualized and the humour works in most places. The director tries to bring in some originality to the crime-comedy genre (holds true until the inspiration behind it is caught) which has its own limitations. Thanks to Saregama being the producers, the makers get access to a huge music library, which they put to liberal and effective use. Retro songs, and primarily disco numbers, are very smartly superimposed on scenes, uplifting the flavour a notch above. The climax action in particular is very well edited! The comic-strip type scene switching is functional though and doesn't add too much value.As the focus shifts to the bigger conspiracy, the two male leads take a backseat in between and you do not mind it much. They anyways seem overused in the initial reels. One does feel that the buildup behind the robbery could have been more original and interesting beyond the formulaic diary with some secret information. Also the climax could have been more imaginative rather than the archetypal shootout in a warehouse.Suddenly in the epilogue, the comedy tone of the film abruptly changes to a social tone with references galore to capitalism, Marxism, patriotism, democracy and a lot other jargons, perhaps with the intent to justify it's title. This attempt however seems forced as it never comes as the underlying subtext from the start but is only touched upon in the very end.Raghav Juyal and Abhishek Chauhan are decent in their parts though they tend to go a little overboard at times. Nidhi Singh is good. Ram Kapoor plays his part well. Sanjay Mishra certainly steals the show.Watch it as a timepass caper and you will enjoy the film."}], "reviews_amount": 166}
