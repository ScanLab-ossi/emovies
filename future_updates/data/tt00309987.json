{"name": "The Dreamers", "titleId": "tt00309987", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "Some people think Bernardo Bertolucci could be placed among Italy's other great directors such as Fellini, Leone, or DeSica. But there are still people out there who never forgave him from LITTLE BUDDHA, or that thought LAST TANGO IN Paris was overrated soft-core porn. His latest film, THE DREAMERS, might be misunderstood as a film about the 1968 student riots in Paris. It's not. Instead, it uses 1968 Paris as a backdrop for the triangular relationship of a na\u00efve American with a pair of incestuous French twins. Young and innocent Matthew (Michael Pitt) just arrived in Paris from San Diego in order to study the French language, but finds himself attending to the Cinematheque Francais instead. 'Only the French would build a movie theater in a palace,' he states in his narration. As he spends his vacation inside screening room with chain-smoking New Wave pioneers, the student riots start breaking out and he ends up meeting twins Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel), who both are very similar to Matthew except that they are\u0085 hmmm\u0085 very French. After engaging interesting conversations that range from Nicholas Roeg to rock n' roll, they all start bounding up as friends and the twins invite him over to their apartment for dinner.Theo and Isabelle's apartment consists of the stereotypical French family: They all smoke like chimneys and mom and dad (Anna Chancellor and Robin Renucci) are poets who love to talk about art and philosophy. When Matthew learns the parents are leaving for a month and that he can stay with the twins in the apartment for all this time, he finds himself in heaven. But things are far from heaven. He soon sees Isabelle and Theo have an unhealthy closure: They bathe together, sleep together, and masturbate in front of each other. Is there something going on or are they just too European?At first Matthew is disgusted by their behavior, but the sexual tension between him and Isabelle (and to some extent, Theo) soon wins over. This is Bertolucci we're talking about, after all! The apartment eventually becomes one filthy, inhabitable place and the kids can barely survive. They run out of food, money, and are close enough to fall asleep in a bathtub and wake up dipped in menstrual blood. You would expect the story could take a LORD OF THE FLIES approach of turning the twins into psychopath savages, but screenwriter Gilbert Adair (who based the movie upon his novel) gives us a much more interesting story to watch. These kids are, like many of us, movie buffs and spend their time challenging each other on identifying film references. The punishment for not knowing how the famous assassination scene in SCARFACE turns out to be sexual interplay between the characters. Is that a punishment? The discussions in the apartment cover sex, cinema, music, and politics. So you have the kids discussing who is funnier: Keaton of Chaplin? Who plays the guitar better: Hendrix or Clapton? Is the Vietnam War right? But my favorite is weather or not Maoism is the way to go. Theo describes Maoism as an epic movie with thousands of idealistic thinkers carrying their little red books and revolting. But Matthew adds that it would not be a very engaging epic since everyone carrying the little red book would speak the same dialogue, wear the same clothes, have the same characteristics. They wouldn't be characters, they would be extras. It's in moments like these where the actors really shine. Eva Green in particular is a true charming revelation and it's a shame Fernando Meirelles wasn't able to cast her in THE CONSTANT GARDENER like he wanted to.Bertolucci isolates the characters from the events happening in the streets as much as he can, keeping the camera (for most of the time) inside the apartment. It's not enough to call the film a Dogma 95 sell-out, but it's really engaging and quite different from what you would expect from the director of THE LAST EMPEROR. The movie is called THE DREAMERS because the kids live inside their little mystical cocoon isolated from life and not doing anything about the problems they discuss. Matthew is the only one who seems to realize how immature it all is and how sick the incestuous relation between Theo and Isabelle makes him feel, unlike the usual 'Europeans are way cooler than Americans' stereotype you would expect from these cultural clash topics. Once the violent revolts start kicking in and the kids' orgy cocoon is shattered by the stone breaking the window, they eventually join the riots. But that is when Matthew finally realizes he will never convince the twins to change their nature. The film was rated NC-17 in America by the MPAA. So it's okay to show Jesus Christ being slowly killed for two-hours, but a\u0085 gasp\u0085 a penis is truly outrageous! The NC-17 rating truly killed the film from getting any kind of attention it deserved since Americans still confuse it with pornographic material. We all know that rating systems across the world are different. In America, sex is seen as a more serious taboo than violence while 14 year olds can see this film in Italy and the French gave it a -12 rating. It's not only sex however, the French slasher film HAUTE TENSION was recently given the NC-17 tag also, and for violence. While I know the MPAA will never change their ways, I really think it's time they grew up and decide to create a new rating in-between R and NC-17 showing the this film is intended for adults only. Similar to what they did when RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK came out. America really needs a complete ratings make-over and the MPAA should really think of replacing their team with people who actually know right from wrong. Otherwise, brilliant films like these will keep getting overlooked in the future. (5/5)"}, {"id": 1, "text": "The characters of The Dreamers love movies. They pass their time quoting them, reenacting scenes from them, and debating age-old questions such as the merits of Chaplin versus Keaton. When at the cinema, they make sure to sit in the rows closest to the screen. Why? So the images will reach them before anyone else, while still fresh. If this strikes you as illogical, perhaps The Dreamers isn't the movie for you. This is a film about film lovers and will likely be most appreciated by lovers of film in return. The basic narrative follows Matthew, a young American (the boyish Michael Pitt), who is studying in Paris during the late 60s, the time of the student riots. The film does a good job of setting up the loneliness which engulfs him in this foreign place, so we are quick to understand why he so eagerly accepts the offer to stay with French twins Isabelle and Theo (Eva Green and Louis Garrel) he has met at- where else?- the cinema. As the three take up life in their spacious Parisian flat, vacated by the twins' parents while abroad, Matthew senses that something about these two is a bit off. It isn't long before he is aware of the incestuous undertones constantly present in the twins' interactions with one another. In attempting to confirm that their relationship does have some degree of limitations, Matthew questions Isabelle, receiving the chilling response, He is always inside of me. It may be reassuring to Matthew, as well as many audience members, that no, these characters never sleep together in the literal sense. What is at work here is something much more difficult to explain. The film handles it well. Eventually, in an attempt to break Isabelle out of her self-inflicted dependency on her brother, Matthew asks her on a date, which proves to be the most joyfully innocent moment of the film. From here, things turn slightly ambiguous and the film opts to relinquish the personal, in favor of a more political ending. It is interesting to note the closing credits run over chanteuse Edith Piaf's Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien (No, I Regret Nothing). If we knew whether or not this was chosen in irony, a lot would be explained. One can't help compare The Dreamers to Bertolucci's other Parisian-set exploration of erotica, Last Tango in Paris. That film contained two lovers who were very much dead inside. The Dreamers contains three who are filled with youthful exuberance and have seemingly endless passion for things such as politics and the arts. Both films are frank and graphic in how they depict sex. As a matter of course, both stirred much controversy. I suspect many people will watch The Dreamers already expecting to be incensed by it. That is their loss. For those who are willing, The Dreamers can be a changing experience. What exactly it changes, however, is certainly bound to vary from person to person. Perhaps it will force you to reconsider your political outlook. Possibly it will alter how you view societally unacceptable relationships. Conceivably it could lead you to the realization of just how great an impact the films have on some people and their existence. Or maybe it will change your stance on who really was better: Chaplin or Keaton? Side note: I found it endlessly refreshing to find a film where characters spoke in their native language when appropriate, and the audience was forced to make-do with subtitles."}, {"id": 2, "text": "The Dreamers is all about three young adult upscale hippy types who languish in a flat in Paris in the late 60's and talk about cinema, politics, sex, and other stuff while sharing some first experiences. Two are brother (Garrel) and sister (Green) identical twins (or so we're told) who have an almost metaphysical bond and the third is an interloper (Pitt) who falls in lust with the sister. There's little plot to this slice of young adult life flick which seems to be more of a Bertolucci pet project than a commercial product for the masses. Less than engaging and much less than compelling, The Dreamers immerses itself in the esoterics of the place and time to the exclusion of anyone who wasn't there then. Beautifully filmed and masterfully crafted with some young actors doing superb work under difficult circumstances with plenty of graphic nudity and sex, The Dreamers will play best with aficionados of French cinema, Bertolucci fans, etc. Those who are squeamish about sex/nudity should pass. All others, be prepared for a marginally interesting watch. (B)"}, {"id": 3, "text": "Mon dieu, The Dreamers is one crappy art-house movie! It's highly self-indulgent, pretentious and offers nothing except a glimpse on Eva Green's luscious anatomy (and some bare butts and small sized wieners for the more female male out there).The story is paper-thin and laughable at times. The shocking moments in the movie (rubbing menstruation blood in the face, incest, masturbation while someone is watching, etc..) all feel forced and do not serve the story at all. There are more subtle ways to show that the main characters are deranged and decadent than wanting someone to shave pubic hair as a proof of love.Here's the basic outline of the story: naive American student meets French twins while protesting at the cinematheque in Paris. They invite him to live with them at their flat while mommy and daddy are away on a long long trip. The three create their own world of rebellion and decadence and screw everything up in the end.There were two hilarious scenes I really could enjoy: 1) The Dreamers are out of money and food, so naked Theo (the twin bro) puts on a jacket (nothing else) and goes straight for the garbage can in the backyard to find something to eat. I literally could not stop laughing!2) Isabelle (the twin sis) finds daddy's paycheck and realizes that their parents visited them while they were sleeping naked in the tent, so she decides that they have to commit suicide because of the shame. She takes a hose from the kitchen to kill the boys and herself with gas. But SUDDENLY there's a riot on the street, they all wake up, Isabell has to change her plan, quickly puts back the hose and tries to act casual.The characters in The Dreamers act highly illogical as Mr. Spock would say. This fact combined with the impression that all three are arrogant morons, who think Well, f*** up the system, cause daddy is going to fix it!, makes the story really offensive. I'm in my late 20ies but I wanted to kick them all in the nuts, except Eva Green, mainly for anatomical reasons.If you want to see an interesting film about incest, dysfunctional relationships and consequences watch The Cement Garden or way better, read the book by Ian McEwan."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Yesterday I watched Dreamers.I admit i had had prejudices about the film.I have seen Last tango... and I did not like it(check my comments about it)but this film is much more mature.Although it is about 2 hours i didn't feel bored.The shooting is brilliant,the dialogues are very well-written.All three leading actors play very emotionally and convincingly,bearing in mind their youth and relative inexperience.There are many aspects of life mixed in this film and analyzed deeply and intelligently:coming of age,America vs.France in the field of culture,history(the riots and complexities of 1968 Paris revolution),the radicalism of young people and their uneasy relations with their parents and of course the phenomenon of cinema(not only the pluses of it but its minuses too)I admire Bertolucci's bravery in putting this aspect of cinema as a problem to be discussed-that sometimes cinema not so much REFLECTS life rather than REPLACES it.Even Isabelle's attempted suicide is theatrical and indeed the brother and sister's infatuation with cinema prevents them from growing into mature personalities,from leading a morereal life.This film is so rich and complex that it should be a subject of a medium article and not just of a comment like this one.I would rate it 7 out of 10.I would have given an even higher mark had it not been about the incest theme which I find superfluous and disgusting and ultimately unnecessary and had it not been on the too-graphic to my taste sexual scenes and showing of male and female genitalia.Here in Bulgaria it is not recommended for people under 16 which I think is correct as young people may accept this film in a wrong way. I am sure this film will be perceived as one of the most interesting artistic achievements of the last several years."}, {"id": 5, "text": "At first it looked like this film could be fun but its shortcomings were so blatant that after about the first half hour the only enjoyment you can get out of it is by carping and criticising and making witty sideswipes to your friends (opportunities for which are plentiful).The French student riots of 1968 are established as the backdrop at the start of the film, and are crudely re-inserted at the very end. Through the main body of the plot that background's completely irrelevant, except that sporadically one of the main characters will read out a few lines of political philosophy to each other.The main plot is an awkward three's a crowd sexual coming-of-age story, where the wide-eyed American Matthew, naive to the point of self-parody, inserts himself into the incestuous relationship between two Parisians. Isabelle, as is typically the case in this sort of set-up, isn't really a protagonist but gets pulled between the two men who act as poles. The thing that offends me about the whole incest story is not, like most people who disliked the film, that I've got a moral objection, but the fact that it fails to develop in any way. We've got Theo, straight out of a nineteenth century opium den, being withdrawn and arrogant, and when he can't get his way through intimidation occasionally tries to strangle people. Then we've got Matthew who is distressingly earnest and comes up with sickening things all the time along the lines of we're all connected, love is the greatest force but apparently has no objection to sitting in the bath with Theo having smug, ill-informed political debates and throwing menstrual blood around.None of it makes any sense. Isabelle and Theo are testing the boundaries of sexual norms in their corrupt bohemian boudoir and they choose to involve the completely incongruous Matthew. Why? - because he likes films, you see, and they need someone to run around the Louvre with them. Predictably Matthew, who thinks this is all larks for a while, soon enough tries to persuade Isabelle that sleeping with your brother is well, pretty wrong, you see, and girls your age should be going out with a boy to the cinema, drinking cherryade and paying for it by putting out a bit in the back row. But Theo, who's read about Mao Tse Tung don't you know, isn't to keen on this injection of capitalist bourgeois morality separating him from his big-breasted sister.So what does the film turn into - it's basically Matthew trying to make a 2-hour porn film with Isabelle, but having to appease Theo by occasionally getting into the bath with him and making arguments so desperately crass that Theo looks like an intellectual. Really this is an appalling hatchet job of a film, I've seen pornos with better characterisation and more subtle socio-political debates than this. Each of the three stars I've given belong to a part of Eva Green's (Isabelle's) anatomy."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Based on Gilbert Adair's novel'' The Holy Innocents'', ''The Dreamers'' is a very different movie from the conventional ones I am used to watch. Isabelle and Theo, the twins, has a very intimate relationship for brothers that I don't understand very well and Matthew, their new American friend (and lover) starts to accept the way they are and fall in love with both of them. One thing I need to complain about the movie, is the hypocrisy that I read in the trivia section, saying that if they show Matthew's and Theo's relationship it might have been too much'' for the public, but Theo and Isabelle, that are brother and sister, can sleep together and have the most unusual behavior of all. I don't agree with that and if I needed to choose something that would ''shock'' someone, an ambiguous relationship between brothers would be much more shocking then a gay relationship.Anyway, Matthew is a young American exchange student that came to Paris in order to study French. The year is 1968, and he easily become friend of the twins Isabelle and Theo, since they three love to watch movies. As their friendship grows, Matthew learns of the extreme intimacy shared by Isabelle and Theo and enters into their world. First he falls for Isabelle for later also love Theo, and the three seclude themselves from the world, falling further and further from the reality of the 1968 student riots."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I've never been so harsh in a one line summary, but there it is. I had a feeling within the opening minutes that oh-oh, I've made a mistake here. I'm kicking myself now for not sneaking out of my seat and into the theatre next door.Forgive me, but even if a story is wholly fictional, a yarn from end to end, you still need to BELIEVE in it, and it's characters, in order to enjoy the tale. With this one I couldn't, not from the first frames. That's not true. I did enjoy the opening titles, the way the names appeared and disappeared like dancers within the steel lattice of the Eiffel Tower. But right after that, as soon as Matthew started telling us this fake memoir of what he supposedly did in Paris in 1968, my internal bulls--- meter spoke up like a rude child. You're not Matthew, you're some actor in a French movie directed by some guy with a big ego and a whoop-to-do reputation, and the year is 2003 not 1968. Naturally I waited for story to get involving so as to shut up my internal little kid, but it didn't and he didn't either.Moving ahead now, let me just say that the lead actress is pretty. Very pretty. Embarrassingly so. And when she says of her brother Theo, he is always inside me, well, that pretty much speaks for all of us. Like one of John and Bo Derek's classics, two hours spent watching Isabelle prancing around in and out of her negligee would probably be both terrible yet...very worthwhile. Spoiler warning to future husbands: there's not much in the way of secrets left to tell.But the rest of this crap is crap. I've never seen a French movie try to look French before, but this one does. I've never seen a poet look more like hapless clerk from a hardware store, but their father does. And I've never seen two actors playing brother and sister who are so clearly pretending. You can feel it. The two sisters in In America FELT like sisters, not just because in real life they are. To me, the relationship between Isabelle and Theo just doesn't ring true.None of this rings true. And now I've spent more time writing this bad review than I did watching the stupid film. A movie with sex is probably wonderful, but atleast put a decent movie around it."}, {"id": 8, "text": "And, trust me, it was nothing like this! Sure, I would have dreamed to have met(and more!) someone like Isabelle when i was 20. This movie is pure garbage and anyone who thinks to the contrary ought to get a reality check. It has 3 beautiful young actors who have nothing better to do than have sex, sleep and drink very expensive wine. Nice. Those of us who were actually teenagers in the 60s do not have this experience at all. It is fantasy. Don't get me wrong: If the purpose of this artsy film was to titillate and show off the gorgeous, voluptuous bodies of these 3 young persons, then it succeeded in every measure. But all three of them (as portrayed in the movie) are self-obsessed, self-centred, rude, spoiled rotten kids. Parents were total idiots too. Thank goodness, the 60s were not dominated by these amoral teenagers; otherwise we may not have succeeded as a Western Society into the new millennium. Take this movie for what it is: nice camera-work, good Parisian scenery and 3 gorgeous nude teenagers screwing like rabbits. If you are reading more into it than that, then you are a true idiot. It is artsy pornography. Nothing more."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I want to comment on Mr. Roland's 'review' on this film that's pasted as a primary user comment on this site. What are you talking about, sir? Beautiful film making? Yes, Bertolucci has employed a few ingenious cinematography tricks, but the film is utterly pointless. Like someone who has too much to say (or too little), the message, the plot, the POINT of the entire film was lost, awash in masturbatory gestures (pardon the pun) of an aging, decaying, film maker. Mr. Roland, it is a shame that you sang such high praises to this motion picture, JUST BECAUSE the sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of monumental scenes from classic masterpieces managed to pull a veil over your eyes, disguising the failure of this film as a piece of artwork, worthy of an audience's ATTENTION! wake up! As for me? that was '2-hour-period of my life that i would never get back'."}, {"id": 10, "text": "**SOME SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***Is Bernardo Bertollucci showing his age in this mediocrity or is his reactionary outlook laid bare? The Dreamers is bad cinema at its best. The parisian setting of that 1968 spring is but an excuse for an essentially superficial commentary.Prior to watching it i read a review that portrayed the film as 'an account of the sexually perplexed life of three characters and their contemporary (political?) worries.' So far so good. As the reel unfolded I managed to identify four (4) points of contention that could double as 'worries' [i.e. arguments/points relevant to the undoubtedly turbulent setting]1. The pseudo-philosophical ramblings of Matthew (Michael Pitt)  in the avec parents dinner where a Zippo(tm) lighter serves as the vehicle of a wholistic expose [we're all part of a bigger plan, everything's in total harmony etc.]Interesting. [heh]2. An evocation of Vietnam in a dialogue between Theo [Louis Garrel] and Matthew. Again, simplification at its best. Americans kill villagers vs. Americans are obligated to join the army. [Similar to Southpark's Drugs are bad...mkay?]3. A critique of communism that would make Western cold war propaghandists stutter. (Mao as the director of a cast of extras etc.) 4. A vague 'respect' for Cinema [note the capital C] that materialises in the 3D pictionary the characters enjoy playing [in the form of guess the film etc]. So long for French film theory and critique [film theory was incedentally at its peak around that time];)Even if we disregard the setting (afterall, it could have been set in 80s Paris for all that matters) and focus on the story itself [the three lovers etc] we see the dynamic of this threesome numbed; just when their relationship is about to get out of hand Matthew makes sure to remind Isabelle [Eva Green] the merits of monogamous dating and sharing a glass of soda etc. 1/10"}, {"id": 11, "text": "okay people,just because Bertolucci made a movie with two twins and a blonde American going around naked and doing silly stuff ,this is masterpiece?This is your interpretation of art?where is the art?while he is doing her and her brother is watching and making eggs???Is that art or just because in the name Bertolucci everything around is pure art??even the blood on their face, that was sick was...okay let me guess this one....masterful intelligent pure pure art!!!if any other director made this film he would be buried with the worst reviews ever!!!!if you are Bertolucci everything is good and intelligent and that is how everyone judge this movie,i m sure that even the people that didn't like this movie wrote they liked it because of the name of the director...because everybody found it artistic and masterful...."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Asked to explain the almost total absence of the homoerotic element of his novel, screenwriter Gilbert Adair has cited the need for the three main actors, who are heterosexual, to feel 'comfortable' in their roles.One thinks back to the generations of gay lead actors and actresses who managed to convince audiences of their attraction to co-stars for whom they can have felt nothing.  This particular skill is known as ACTING - a skill apparently not expected of the pampered little darlings here.Not that they looked particularly comfortable, anyway, in their protracted cavortings.  Perhaps, given the illustrious name of their director, they expected to find themselves in something more reputable than the slice of kinky soft-core porn on display here."}, {"id": 13, "text": "An American in Paris, 1968, at the height of the turbulence following the firing of Henri Langlois, the founder of the French Cinematheque, meets a pair of fraternal twins, Isabelle and Theo, cinema buffs, sparks a friendship, gets introduced to their intellectual parents, and then are left to their own devices when the parents leave. For young college kids in Any Campus, USA, that would be like letting the cork out of a well-shaken bottle of beer: all that gold liquor would come spewing out in an orgy of bacchanalia and you'd have any combinations of American PIE, PORKY'S, and ANIMAL HOUSE. Not in Paris: these young kids are true idealists in every sense of the word; they are in complete love with the theories of cinema, directors (Theo, in one scene, quotes: Nicholas Ray is cinema.), and the love of reenacting scenes from their favorite films.Of course, such reenactments come with sexual overtones, and this threesome play with more than their minds: their own sexuality comes into play. Isabelle is a little more than taken with Matthew, but is bound to Theo in more ways than she can possibly, truly understand. Matthew has discovered them in bed together, naked, and later Isabelle has Theo perform a sexual act as if he were alone while she and Matthew watch. Indeed, there is a deep incestuous streak in her relationship with Theo, and she even prides herself in saying he has been inside her often. However, a game in which Matthew must forfeit and gets almost raped by both Theo and Isabelle into having sex with her -- in which they discover her picture hidden inside his shorts in a compromising place -- discloses that Isabelle may have been a virgin all along: her blood, which later arouses her and Matthew as much as it has her shed tears of womanhood, is the smoking gun.However, there is a moment when Theo makes it quite clear that Matthew is an outsider and that even when he has been inducted to be one of them (Bertolucci includes shots of FREAKS as a key element as he does with other movies to enhance a mood, or a parallel sequence). Matthew, despite this sudden warning, glides along, getting deeper and deeper into his threesome, until a moment comes when Isabelle has decided to end it all, herself, her life and that of her brother and her friend. It made me wonder if she was aware that perhaps she couldn't have them both -- that a part of her would be bound to Theo, and that other part of her, the more carnal aspect, the one which had made her a woman, would want Matthew. It's a disturbing moment, placid, perfect, and dangerous, but one in which the outside world literally comes crashing in... ending their acquaintance, possibly in an irrevocable manner.Bertolucci is, as always, a subtle storyteller who knows the type of movie he is making. The music is fantastic, classic rock at its best, deeply rooting it in its year. The sex is graphic -- there is full frontal nudity on behalf of the three leads. I don't believe this is shocking -- violence, to me, certainly is -- inasmuch as necessary to tell such an erotic plot, and to establish the intimacy between the three. The way they interact is as if they'd known each other forever -- a closeup in which Matthew exchanges ideas with Isabelle while his head rests above her private part is quite moving and devoid of titillation. Ditto for a scene later in the film which introduces Isabelle, topless, wearing black gloves, in front of a black background, looking like a living Venus de Milo. While Theo, off screen, enjoys sex with another girl and sparks her insane jealousy, she allows Matthew to enjoy her own body as well.Will people think Bertolucci has lost it? I don't think so. He has never shied away from sex in his films and erotic scenes are intrinsic to the story being told. THE DREAMERS may not quite break grounds, but it is an important movie about an important time in cinema and today no director in Hollywood seems to have what it takes to make this kind of film without calling too much attention to itself. Such a thing is what makes THE DREAMERS a film for people with special attitudes -- or Europeans -- sex is a natural thing, something which is a part of these characters, and not an excuse to show hard bodies on screen. It's a great little story, deliberate, and somewhat ambiguous by design, bookended by spurts of violence and those notorious riots."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Roger Ebert gave this movie 4 stars, his highest rating. This proves to me that the most naive people in the world about movies are, and have been for some time, film critics.Simply show these critics some nudity, European (in this case, French) mores, and sexual perversion, and voil\u00e0\u0097you have an artistic film.To those of you who have been duped into thinking this film is great, let me assure you that I understand this movie completely and, yes, still think it's horrible. It's not artistic; it's pretentious, smutty, and shallow. The characters are not courageous rebels, they're reprehensible, self-centered deviants. Don't get me wrong. You could make a good movie about reprehensible, self-centered deviants. Just don't try to pass them off as cutting edge or courageous.And I'm not even talking about the incestuous sexual perversity. I'm talking about the characters being plain old boring and reprehensible. Just as an illustration: near the end of the film when the parents return home to find their two children and guest naked and passed out in a tent inside the apartment, amidst stinking garbage, empty wine bottles, and bodily fluids they couldn't be bothered to clean up, these parents leave their children (and guest) another check to further purchase the indulgences that have led them to their present situation.

Why, not only to commit suicide by turning on the gas and breathing it in herself, but to try to murder her brother and American lover. Does anyone else see a serious character flaw here? Is this someone whom we non-artistic types should admire? Not long after this the movie ends with a completely random scene, none of us caring what happens next or what has come before.

One cannot discount Bertolucci as a filmmaker, his craft is superb and his technique unsurpassed, but his sexual politics are highly questionable.  This is probably the closest I have ever seen a film teeter-totter on the edge of having real bisexual characters, yet carefully making sure to never cross into that dangerous and forbidden territory.  One could say the same about its incestuous brother / sister couple, for he never entered her, so technically they didn't really have a sexual relationship, so by this logic they basically weren't really a couple.  And Michael Pitt never really did anything with Louis Garrel so basically they were both straight, except that they liked to be naked a lot and take baths with each other, against the hot backdrop of the '68 Paris riots.  What kind of message is this film sending?  That it is okay to lie naked and so intimately close to other members of the same sex just as long as you don't touch them in any way that might be considered sexual?  Or that one would go too far by having a brother and sister make out or worse make love on screen?  But implying that they do, except actually they don't, is okay instead?  This is very confused filmmaking when dealing with sexual politics and it sends mixed signals; a kind of very strange, conservative, and conformist message to the art house scene.  My opinion: if you're going to make a film about a boy that falls in love with a girl and a boy, whether they are brother and sister or not, then make that film.  Don't make a film pretending to be a film about a boy that falls in love with a girl and a boy but only makes out with the girl.  This is a highly pretentious and cold way of treating a potentially beautiful concept.Interestingly, the way the sexuality of the three-way relationship was treated mirrors the way the Paris riots where treated, they were utterly glossed over and unreal, they felt like an overtone to a movie about a hopelessly romantic yet sexually mature heterosexual American boy falling in love with a confused little French girl who just happens to live with her weird heterosexual Siamese twin brother.  And they all love to sleep naked next to each other.  It is unbelievable how a film about love, sex, and the beauty of openness can be so utterly cruel, closed-minded, and conservative. If you like your sex and history the way you like your toast, buttered on one side only, then enjoy this bitter piece of celluloid chocolate."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Bertolucci is no more. Not the man -- the filmmaker. How sad it is to see the creator of The Conformist, Luna, and Last Tango desperately trying to regain his form and instead ending up with a nudie picture that's so pretentious and empty, it wouldn't make the first cut at a film school festival of artsy wannabes. This movie makes you wonder (unfairly perhaps) if Bertolucci's long-time collaborator, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (absent from this film) was actually responsible for the unforgettable images in Bertolucci's earlier movies. On the plus side, this abomination is much shorter than the terrible The Last Emperor. What's next for Bertolucci -- a five-minute long porno flick?

Well, after watching The Dreamers, my esteem for Tinto Brass boosted. Tinto Brass has the courage to make films about healthy, fun, enjoyable sex and pays his due for this, not being considered a great film-maker. Whereas great film-makers like Bertolucci or Kubrick shield their disturbed fantasies by the cultivated cinema illusion, gain prizes and kid us all.Incest is the clue of the film, the morbid relationship between a brother and a sister who can't grow up and have normal connections. A few disgusting scenes of having a bath with a menstruating girl, deflowering a menstruating girl (while her brother MAKES AN OMELETTE), sadomasochistic sex etc. Where is the connection with 68's revolution?

But something piqued my interest and I actually bought the DVD to watch it again. And again. And again. I loved it - even though there were repellent aspects to it, and ultimately I don't think it succeeded in describing or explaining the events of May, '68. The political events became like a curtain backdrop to the primary event which was the relationship of the three people. I'm not sure that focusing on these three was the best way to showcase the events going on France at that time. I just saw Oliver Stone's World Trade Center and he uses the same conceit- focusing on the lives of two people caught up in the disaster. It didn't work for me in that film at all. Be that as it all may- what I did like is the acting (very courageous on everyone's part) and the direction by Bertolucci was superb. As a heterosexual female, Micheal Pitt really does it for me, but I have to say I admire Eva Green for taking this role. Bertolucci is such a master, every frame so beautifully staged and shot. The sex scenes were incredible."}, {"id": 23, "text": "First off, I will say that I generally liked this movie.  The characters, environment, editing, and music were all quite adequate.  I particularly liked Matt Pitt's character, for I thought this was going be a sort of fish-out-of-water story with Matt as the naive, innocent American.  However, he is very much the willing accomplice, and not as innocent as we are initially led to believe.  Still, there were a couple missing pieces that prevented me from completely enjoying the movie.(***SPOILERS AHEAD***)Ok, so, first and foremost among the missing pieces - we never find out the secret behind the brother-sister relationship.  I mean, the incest taboo is one of the strongest, if not THE strongest, cross-cultural taboo known to humanity.  I always imagined that it would take some sort of serious trauma to make a brother and sister have a sexually intimate relationship (OK, they never ACTUALLY have sex, but still...)  I mean, we're not talking about kissing cousins here, these people are SIBLINGS!  Anyway, we are never really given a clue as to what made them hot for each other.  We are sort of nudged in the direction of them being too sheltered and innocent for their own good, but I just don't buy it.  There's something else going on here, and we are never told what it is.  I feel cheated.The second missing piece - the guy-on-guy action.  I'm sorry, but even as a hetero guy who takes very little pleasure in guy-guy sex scenes, by the end of the movie, I was practically screaming to see these two guys get it on. We are teased, teased, teased some more, made to think that it's going to happen....  and then it never happens!  How can filmmakers get away with this sort of thing?  If for no other reason, it would at least have been interesting to see how the guy-guy coupling would have advanced the plot. Instead, we are treated to endless scenes of the two boys bickering over various subjects, which, for me, provides some of the lowest points of the film.  Particularly pungent is the scenes where they argue over war/violence.  Can we say contrived?Anyway, I don't want it to sound like I didn't enjoy the movie, because I did.  However, because it is missing a couple of crucial elements, I probably will not recommend it too highly to any of my friends, nor will I be watching it again any time soon.3/5"}, {"id": 24, "text": "I know its meant to be a weird threesome movie but, I think it was just too long and too fussy.

The writers were just too busy thinking of him as Leonardo DiCapro but he isn't DiCapro like! If they badly wanted him to be involved on this, they should really have made him grow out his hair and not wear those hideous costumes.

A genuine iconoclast, he has produced movies of lasting value although, perhaps, of more interest to serious cinema lovers and film academics than to a wider audience.Bertulucci's vision of film is that of a political activist in a director's chair.  Film to him matters for far more than its transient entertainment value.  Bertulucci has stated that cinema is the true poetic language and in The Dreamers he has gone further than in previous efforts to unite a love of film with his heartfelt belief that it encompasses and presents the realities of both personal experience and political change and turmoil.The year is 1968.  It was, as I well remember as a military intelligence, General Staff Army officer in the Pentagon, a disturbing and troubled year. Anti-war demonstrations, often violent, racial unrest leading to major upheavals in America's cities, Resurrection City, distrust of government and the political process, the Police Riot during the Chicago Democratic Convention - these and other events were the fragile tinderboxes of widespread dissent.  But compared to France, the United States was experiencing unpleasant but ultimately absorbed and defanged behavior The country's youth, a minority of them, demonstrated, a few committed major crimes and most cared about futures in which they believed.  Racial bigotry and discrimination produced some change, not enough but not so little as to sustain recurring rioting.In France the Republic came close to falling as first students and then workers battled police with a fierceness that threatened social and political stability.  Three characters in The Dreamers, each a devoted cinephile, fall into an unusual - and for some audience members today unsettling-  menage a trois as they try to reconcile a love of film with a Paris of threatening disorder and violent change.American Matthew, played by a dreamily listless Michael Pitt, is using his student deferment to study French.  At a demonstration protesting the government-ordered closing of a major movie theater devoted to    the full range of film history, he meets beautiful Isabel, Eva Green, and her brother, Theo, Louis Garmel.  A friendship quickly develops and the siblings invite Mathew to their parent's spacious but cluttered apartment, first for a meal and then to stay while the parents go on holiday.Theo disdains his author/father and behaves like the petulant child he really is.  He fancies himself an intellectual but Bugs Bunny has expressed deeper thoughts. Theo is the stereotype of the don't trust anyone over thirty character of those days.Matthew realizes that Theo and Isabel are unusually close for siblings.  In point of fact they have a physical relationship, the depth of which is never fully revealed.  Matthew is drawn into explicitly shown sex with Isabel, the reason for the rare NC-17 that is the movie's rating (I.D. was actually checked at the ticket booth and anyone looking south of age 25 had to proffer acceptable documentation).  Too many reviews of this movie emphasize the incestuous relationship to the exclusion of more important themes.The trio acts out various tableaux based on questions about classic film scenes which are interspersed throughout the game-playing which is a central part of the siblings' interaction.  However sensational the sex scenes are to some, Bertulucci's key success is showing the insidious transformation of harmless games into a coda for sexuality and political belief and action. For Theo, film is a reality that transmogrifies his world view.  An increasingly credulous, and sensible, Matthew is madly in lust with Isabel but when Theo asks him to consider China's Great Cultural Revolution as a glorious film with Mao as director and millions as the cast he knows something is amiss with his friend.In the Bertulucci tradition of a film within a film, the three-way sexual relationship is both an encounter with and a retreat from reality.  But the world can't be kept at bay forever as Bertulucci shows in the final scenes.Hardly a perfect film, The Dreamers is, once the sexual explicitness is relegated to its proper place, a homily about how film matters but that it may not always be a safe harbor for its devotees.  The non-physical relationship of the three young people is far deeper and more interesting than the erotic aspect.There's little chance a movie with an NC-17 rating will be in many theaters or play long in those where it is booked.  But anyone serious about the relevance of a vibrant cinema owes Bertulucci a careful viewing of The Dreamers.At the end of the trailer there was a magnificent absurdity (this can't possibly be deemed a spoiler).  We're all used to being assured that no animals were harmed during filming.  This one proclaims that Indigenous trees were planted to offset the release of carbon dioxide during filming.

But NO! I was in for a disappointment. The movie has absolutely NOTHING to offer. It is just a collection of some of the most disgusting scenes/ideas that you can ever imagine(or perhaps cannot).A sister watching her brother jack off, in a masturbation scene that takes painfully long to end? The brother watching his sister being f.u.c.k.e.d. by their American friend...and later touching where it bled?? Or how about that scene where the brother goes downstairs to get some food from the garbage and they actually eat some of it!! And to what conclusion? Zilch! Even the political movement (or its influence) is almost negligible. What is shown is only the three central characters' love for cinema and their so-called sexual awakening. Gosh...gimme a break!! OK..I must admit that Eva Green looks great..she is perhaps the only thing watchable in this tripe! Not that incest is something I've seen in films for the first time...but there are other stories/films which have shown it or handled it in a much better manner than this worthless piece of s***.

To my disappointment this movie lived up to none of my expectations. First of all, the best movies tell the best stories and The Dreamers contains no central story and really no plot what so ever. The graphic sexual nature of the film is neither an artistic expression of the human body, nor is it overtly pornographic, but simply exists as does the rest of the film, with no point and no effect. The Dreamers attempts to include classic elements of cinema, such as Charlie Chaplin films into the storyline, yet these brief inserts add little to the already under developed characters. The Dreamers is not an offensive film, but certain parts seem to attempt to get a reaction out of the viewer in an offensive way,such as when Michael (The American) wipes period blood all over Eva Green's face after they have sex and continues to kiss her while her brother looks on. This scene would not bother me in the least if it added something to the story or over all feeling of the film. The same goes for when Eva Green has her period in a tub that they all share and her and Theo attempt to shave Michael as a sign of trust.

Set in Paris in 1968 this is so not about the riots although they provide a counterbalance to on one hand the perceived wisdom of the parental generation and the abandoned lifestyle of the new. We get a most evocative picture of the time but Bertolucci seems to be coming down a little heavy with the notion that the oldsters bankrolled the kids' excesses which achieved nothing. But then perhaps he's right. The film perhaps loses a little of it's assuredness towards the end but maybe the ambiguity is intended. Certainly the downbeat ending is appropriate and we can reflect on the fun we have had before with all the strange sex and wondrous film referencing complete with those delicious clips.

The movie creates a very peculiar myth about the relationship between cinema, France's sexual revolution, and the student movement, leading the viewer to believe that without this combination, modern cinema would not have been born. But even if we disregard this, the fundamental problem is the place in cinema history that the Dreamers wants to claim for itself. The film is psychologically vapid and devoid of any cinematic virtues. Basically, it's layers upon layers of decadence. Not only does it fail to pay respect to the films it references, but it does not even have the self-consciousness necessary to place itself in any kind of relationship to the tradition of cinema.

Aside from that, it has no plot, little to no romance, lots of explicit scenes of nudity, incest and nonsense scenes."}, {"id": 32, "text": "The ad for The Dreamers suggests that two very sexy boys are going to hit the sheets. Forget it. Not on your life. The Dreamers is unquestionably homoerotic, but it is not, strictly speaking, a gay film.Okay, the movie offers lots of eye candy. The camera lovingly caresses the male co-stars' full, sensual lips and frequently bare behinds, and leaves us begging for more. But if you expect them to get it on with each other, you'll end up extremely disappointed.Yet I think Bertolucci's latest work ultimately conveys a very gay-positive message. For that reason, it's worth a look-see. Let me explain.Matthew (Michael Pitt) is a young American spending a year in Paris -- 1968 to be exact. His university studies save him from being drafted to fight in Vietnam. In any case, that would run contrary to his principle of non-violence. As they used to say back then, he wants to make love, not war. He becomes friends with Isabelle (Eva Green) and her twin brother Theo (Louis Garrell). Matthew becomes Isabelle's lover but clearly also has the hots for Theo. Alas, his desire is doomed to remain unfulfilled. Theo talks a good line about freedom from his parents' values and the dictatorship of France's political system. But he is utterly incapable of taking his philosophy of sexual liberation to its logical conclusion.In a very real sense, as the title suggests, Theo and Isabelle are dreamers. They very naively believe they are free and independent of their family and society. But Bertolucci shows us this is far from the truth. Theo and Isabelle are children who never grew up. They rely on their parents' generosity to keep body and soul together. They are even absolutely dependent on each other. Isabelle has never been on a date with a boy, and Theo has never been intimate with a woman, not even his sister.Only Matthew is able to break the vicious cycle, to grow up and become a man, to be the person he dreams of being. He achieves a freedom that remains beyond the reach of straight men like Theo, who remain trapped in sexual stereotypes dictated by a male-dominated society.The Dreamers appears to suggest that, by accepting themselves as they are and freely expressing their desire, gays become mature and independent human beings.In so doing, The Dreamers echoes Bertolucci's 1970 masterpiece, The Conformist. In that earlier work, Marcello (Jean-Louis Trintignant) represses the memory of a gay experience as a teen, and his feeling of being abnormal, by trying to be like everyone else. At the end of the film, however, Marcello learns that Lino, his abuser, whom he thought he had killed, is alive and trying to pick up another young boy. Marcello gets rid of Lino and has sex with the boy himself. Marcello thus accepts himself as gay. He is no longer a traumatized teen, but a grown man, free to choose how he wishes to live.Marcello (in The Conformist) becomes what Matthew (in The Dreamers) wishes to be, and Theo never can. Matthew dreams of fully experiencing and expressing his desire. Theo lacks the courage to live his dreams.The slogan shouted by French protesters in May 1968 holds true for Matthew, as it does for gays in our own era: We've only just begun. The fight goes on."}, {"id": 33, "text": "I don't care what the film buffs have to say about this movie with all the symbolism, the hidden meanings, the so-called depth, the psycho-analytical slant, the art house beauty of the actors walking around naked etc etc,it was very very boring and very very false and had no meaning what so ever. There was nothing to learn either - two very messed up twin siblings decide to act out their infantile fantasies together with a dumb American who can't believe his luck in getting to have sex with such a gorgeous girl (yes guys, you can see Eva Green's body from top to genitals in this one!) and yet he is at odds with his obvious American puritanism. He probably went home and married Ms Small Town girl and masturbated to the memory of Eva for the rest of his life.

The second theme is CoA (coming of age): a private world that an exceptional brother and sister have made, and into which they invite a kindred spirit, an American student. The themes intertwine, but they are distinct, which creates the richness of the film as each theme provides both background and motivation in the other. I think most critical reviews miss the mark when they lock on to one aspect (usually centering on the sexuality) and overlook what else the film is saying. And just for the record, when it comes to the subject of incest, granted Theo and Isabelle take adolescent sexual exploration to the extreme; but in my opinion the film is clear that when Isabelle has sex with her new boy-friend, she is a virgin. Theo and Isabelle were simply consistent in their shared enthusiasm of exploring life together; the problem is they tended towards the excessive everywhere.I find The Dreamers Historically Interesting, Deliciously Nostalgic, Sensuous, Sexy and Impetuous. So here is a film buff challenge for those of you who like it as much as I do. I made up a list of the films referred to in The Dreamers and watched them as a group, most of which I had not seen before; then watched The Dreamers again. It made it that much richer, (for example you understand why the sultry Greta Garbo so desperately wants to remember the details of that room and then you see how the apartment has become that same kind of fleeting refuge for the three students). Then there is Bande a Part, by Jean-Luc Godard; watching it on DVD along with the exhaustive reference notes in the extras, in my opinion The Dreamers is one long homage to Bande a Part. So here is a list of the 13 films for you to enjoy in themselves and added texture for The Dreamers:Shock Corridor, the Cameraman, Breathless (a bout de souffler), Top Hat, City Lights, Band Outside (Bande a Part) Blonde Venus, Freaks, Scarface, King Kong, Queen Christina, The third Man, Les Enfante Terrible."}, {"id": 41, "text": "I don't understand all the fuss about how bad Bertolucci has become and how awful this film is--allegedly.It's a pretty good film.

Sound track didn't work for me either, except the Dylan song.All in all, the sort of film that gives arthouse a bad name."}, {"id": 43, "text": "In the summer of 1968 American student Matthew is in Paris; he is spending a year there to improve his French; he is also a cinephile, spending much of his time at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise watching films old and new. Also attending are twins Isabelle and Theo although they don't talk to each other until the man in charge of the cinema is fired leading to protests by his supporters. During the protest Matthew gets talking to Isabelle and later gets invited home for dinner. It is raining so he ends up spending the night in the spare room. The next day Isabelle and Theo's parents depart for a month long holiday and the twins invite him to stay. It is clear that Isabelle and Theo aren't like most twins; they have a relationship that is almost incestuous. They spend their time discussing films, enacting scenes from films for the others to guess and when they can't expecting them to perform forfeits of a sexual nature. It is one such forfeit that begins Isabelle and Matthew's sexual relationship. While this is going on the city is in turmoil but the trio barely notice as they are so wrapped up in their own world.What you think of this film will largely be down to what you think of the three main characters; if you find them interesting people to be with you'll probably love it; if you find the to be pretentious bores you won't; unfortunately I found my self leaning towards the latter camp. I suspect it would also help if you have a good knowledge of the films they reference. This isn't to say the film isn't well made; I liked how their actions were intercut with clips from the films they were referencing and thought the actors did a fine job portraying their characters. There is a fair amount of nudity and sexual activity that some viewers might find excessive although it is for the most part dealt with in a very matter of fact way; filmed in the way one might film a clothed person rather than being coy or attempting to eroticise the nudity... there is one scene that might shock though when it becomes clear that is was Isabelle's first time.

The scene where Theo forces Matthew to have sex with Isobelle is clearly due to a sort of attraction he has for him (witness after the  scene how Theo wanted to know if Matthew had been turned on by watching Theo masturbate). And the naive Matthew goes along with all this, until the siblings threaten to shave his pubes, thus threatening his masculine identity, threatening to somehow break him.And at the back of all this is the tumult of the violent world which none of them seem to understand entirely, each grasping different aspects of the whole.

I agree that the main character who was supposed to be an American did not sound like an American at all. It seemed like he had a foreign accent. Perhaps if I knew French history around that time period, it would make more sense to me. But if you're looking for a movie to sit back and relax and enjoy, I would definitely advise you to get something else to watch.

The former is lacking \u0096 almost the whole thing is set in a claustrophobic left bank apartment -  it is as if Bertolucci has joined `Dogma' (or is it Dogme?) \u0096 but there's plenty of sex. In fact I would advise the average prude (especially the American fundamentalist variety) to stay well away. The movie is set in 1968, the year of the Paris riots that led to the resignation of General de Gaulle as President of France. It's strange to see the 60s portrayed as a romantic era; it certainly didn't seem that way at the time. In fact our three main characters here, immersed in their sexual explorations, are almost oblivious to the turmoil until a fateful brick comes through a window. Michael Pitt is Matthew, that stock character, the American innocent abroad, up against a youthful and decadent French brother and sister, Theo and Isabelle (Louis Garrel and Eva Green) who are, however, not quite as hard boiled as they think they are. The three are united by film buffery, and there are animated discussions on whether Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton was the greater comic, and why the French appreciate Jerry Lewis and the Americans do not.But its sex which powers this movie, rather kinky, nihilistic sex, though in the end Theo is roused to do something of a political, if rather futile, nature. You feel a bit sorry for these kids. Matthew no doubt goes back to the US with expanded horizons but you can't help feeling that Theo and Isabelle are permanently emotionally crippled. Explicit, but not profound. Nice musical score though."}, {"id": 56, "text": "It's sad to see. Bertolucci was one of the most influential film makers in the 70s.

They invite an American student to live with them. They are dreamers, while the riots go on outside in the streets. Yes, there is also some sex here and the twins are almost incestous.Bertolucci seems to be saying: -Look at these great young people and watch how they approach life and death!

Is Bertolucci the last one to know?"}, {"id": 57, "text": "Against the backdrop of late 60's civil unrest in Paris, three young people connect in an unusual and provocative way in this very personal film by director Bertolucci. Pitt plays an American student studying in the City of Love who meets siblings Green and Garrel and strikes up a friendship, at least partly based on all of their love of the cinema. Shortly into their camaraderie, however, Pitt discovers that the twin siblings share a most irregular relationship, sleeping together nude and forcing each other to do outrageous and kinky things if they should miss various pop quizzes regarding classic film. Intrigued and vaguely repelled all at once, Pitt eventually takes greater part in their shenanigans, forming deep connections with both of them and moving in with them, though their craziness threatens at all times to spill over into violence, criminal activity or even death. Pitt, frequently looking and sounding very much like Leonardo DiCaprio (who was offered this role but turned it down) turns in a believable and, like all of the leads, very daring performance. Green, whose first film this was, makes a rather striking debut, portraying both emotional and physical intimacy with dexterity. Garrel also provides a captivating persona as he rounds out the star triad. The only other performers of note are Chancellor and Renucci as the twins' liberal-minded, absentee parents. Classic film buffs will enjoy the emphasis on the great works of people like Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and others, though some of those fans may be repulsed by the exceedingly frank depiction of sexual escapades and casual nudity. The film has little plot, actually, but manages to be eye-filling and captivating under the assured direction of Bertolucci. This particular era and the subject matter clearly matter to him very much. Some viewers may find the whole enterprise indulgent, but the intriguing way in which the relationships are handled make for a reasonably arresting viewing experience. The young actors in this film were encouraged to present themselves as casually and naturally as possible and they did rise to the occasion (including even more graphic scenes that never made it into the final cut of the movie.) All of them show their bodies unclothed, especially Green, though there is a notable scene in which Pitt awkwardly and obviously, for whatever reason, covers himself after exiting a bath and leaning against a sink."}, {"id": 58, "text": "This movie is well made, pretty and the acting is believable. However, I was ultimately not interested in the subject matter. Perhaps the writer believes that merely adding strangeness to a movie qualifies it as art but in my view it takes more than that. The movie would have benefited from a solid plot instead of being a seemingly unconnected series of scenes. If you are looking for a movie that presents you with strangeness then this may qualify but if you want one that involves, or conveys a message, then this is probably not for you. If you want an artistic movie then I would suggest Amelie or Delicatessen as much better choices."}, {"id": 59, "text": "This movie was disturbing at first to me, but then beautiful.

I felt that Matthew kind of let us American boys down by his reaction to a nude Eva Green offering herself to him.

Matthew, an American exchange student is initially thrilled to have found Theo and Isabelle and is convinced about the passion for cinema they have. The siblings seduce Matthew into a life-like fantasy they have created for themselves dripped in decadence and disregard for a life carved of traditional notions of self, family, sexuality and nudity. Or as their father would say ... that what provokes, not transforms. They imitate art, failing to notice and sometimes even choosing to overlook the realities of a world of which the very same art is born. They do not understand that the magic, the passion and mysticism they live by is not very much separate from the passion in purpose, solidarity, faith, ambition... things they reject with such ignorance. And with ignorance comes fear; fear of confronting the new, the unfamiliar. Matthew. Matthew enters their world with questions and a curious mind. He thinks, appreciates and speculates.Witnessing Theo and Isa's relationship on his first night, he does not form a judgement on them on grounds of popular morality. He believes in their shared love for art and the sensibilities that are inherent in people who appreciate it. Which is why he is open to exploring the relationship they build, trying to make sense of it all, hoping to be a part of what he is willing to, but doesn't necessarily understand. Theo. Theo is the hollow image of the person Matthew thinks he is. Unlike Isabelle, Theo is not unaware of the follies he has built his life on. Everytime he converses with Matthew he understands what he knows deep inside but consciously chooses to ignore it, because it's easier. It's easier to look at the world through a window of privilege and status, and tailor your own twisted version of radicalism rather than confront your inability to contribute to or transform the society you so heedlessly abandon. Theo is threatened by Matthew because he sees this. In the scene were they argue about a certain ideology, Theo tries to strangle Matthew but feels drawn to him instead (Bertolucci really missed an opportunity to explore that dynamic) which is very different from the kind of attraction Isabelle has for Matthew. However his comfort and Isa's selfless companionship are too precious for him to gamble with. It could never be the three of them.Isabelle- Isabelle is the stake. She is an extension of Theo, an accomplice, but not his counterpart. She does not bother herself with Theo's philosophical ramblings nor does she hold any opinion of the world outside. She is unaware and is thus free of any internal conflict. Although she is an exhibit of Theo's influence, she is a traditionalist at heart. Isa's room, her shame at the thought of her parent's finding out, her being a virgin until she meets Matthew, show that Isa is not her brother. When Matthew comes into her life, Isa is caught between two halves. She has a chance of redemption. So why does she not take it?In what is a very poorly written third act, Theo and Isa break free from the impediment that tries to bring sense into their world; a world where they defy defy defy without reason, without thought, where passion is the product of madness and violence. Theo and Isa will always find a way back to themselves. With each other to back their delusions they will never have to face change. Matthew does not judge Theo and Isa for their choice to live a life, unconventional. But he judges their choice to turn a blind eye to what true passion and art stands for. A poem is a petition, a petition is a poem.Filmmaking wise, I liked a few things, didn't like a few. For one, Eva Green (ugh, goddess) is clearly not a mature actress. Probably because this was her debut film. So well shot, aesthetically pleasing, three drop dead gorgeous human beings on screen. I am not culturally informed to give my opinion on the debates between Theo and Matthew, but they were so obviously the cringiest bits. A little style over substance issue, but I loved the style so no one's really complaining. It would take a lot to shovel out and read into things to construct character sketches in our minds. It would've been easier if we got to see them do something interesting instead. The ending was terribly rushed and actually very embarrassing to watch. I wish they'd explored the last act to it's full potential.

As their relationship develops they form an intimate and intense circle.I would not say I particularly enjoyed this film, but I am glad I saw it as it was made by a highly proficient director with a team of excellent technicians and talented artists. The cinematography and editing were excellent and the actors really excelled in their parts which must have been slightly uncomfortable.The title refers to the trio, who seem to live comfortably in a dream world thanks to money from parents and a rather large roof over their heads. The other dreamers in the movie are the political dissidents that protest in the streets of Paris against the established order in favour of Marxist Leninist ideals popular at the time.The film is similar to Bertoluccis seminal work 'Last Tango in Paris' with regards to its explicit sexual content and erotic scenes. However, they are very artistically filmed and there is a humorous quality to them, for example when Matthew copulates with Isabelle on the kitchen floor for the first time, her brother Theo is in the background cooking fried eggs as though him being there for her first sexual encounter is the most normal thing in the world.An interesting film by a world class filmmaker, this is worth a watch for its artistry and the unusual tapestry of characters and their relationships on display."}, {"id": 72, "text": "Bertolucci returns to a Parisian apartment for more role playing games and nude encounters.

There are probably numerous parallels between the two movies, but I was too bored to look for them.

When I woke up, they were still quoting lines from movies, having lots of sex and being very daring in a bourgeois kind of way.The film does succeed in being very French in an overly-stylised fashion, but only if you think that 1968 and Satre is what it's all about.

Here's how it strikes me: Matthew begins as a deep thinker with a strong moral sense, but rather detached from the world and submerged in movies and images. His lovely Asperger's-influenced speech to the Father about the lighter's proportions and the interconnectedness of all things shows where he begins. He is convinced that there is a moral right and wrong, though not quite committed to which is which.Theo, by contrast, is an idealist in his own mind, but has no intention of actually living or dying for his ideals. He prefers to wax passionate in private about his convictions, which are based on fads of the moment and whatever propaganda seems most beautiful to him at the time. Matthew challenges Theo to live his convictions, but Theo angrily refuses.And Isabelle is a narcissistic baby, obsessed with movie images and acting them out, seeing herself always from the outside, and desperately in need of love. She is the driver of all the action up until the window breaks.Originally, Isabelle sees attractive young Matthew as completing the cocooned relationship she and Theo have built. He will be 'one of them', and enrich and legitimize their forbidden love. Theo buys into her idea, enjoying the interplay of ideas with Matthew and attracted to him too, and using him as a surrogate for the sex he'd rather be having with Isabelle but has denied himself.Matthew quickly grows up though. He loves them both but sees that the twins can never 'grow up' while wrapped in each other. Isabelle cannot live without her brother's love, and cannot live if it's discovered either. Matthew tries a traditional one-on-one relationship with Isabelle, and Theo counters by bringing home his own girlfriend. Isabelle feels betrayed and breaks down -- her true love is Theo, a reflection of herself. Matthew realizes he'll always be an outsider to them. Isabelle and Theo have a touching mumbled sleepy private conversation in French where she insists that she wants nothing but Theo's love, forever, and exclusively.Waking first and realizing her parents have seen them, she attempts a romantic, movie-scene painless murder-suicide for the three of them. Again, she would rather die than grow up.When the window breaks, reality intrudes in every way, and each character suddenly grows up. Isabelle abandons her suicide, hides the evidence. Matthew realizes that the violent demonstrations are meaningless violence and renounces them. And Theo shoos them all outside to join the street demonstration.The ending is perfect -- Theo pulls Isabelle away from Matthew, who refused to fight. Theo and Isabelle begin the riot and huddle together in the center of the violence, ready to die, as Matthew walks away. Theo has responded in the only way he can -- both to Matthew's challenge to live his convictions, and Isabelle's insistence that he never grow up or leave her.

But soon they will awake from their dream and realize that the world is still there, so they must deal with the reality of 1968.The time in which the film is set is just amazingly used with these three characters and there are many memorable moments that every true Cinema lover will appreciate. From discussions about who is funnier between Chaplin and Keaton to recreations of famous scenes from films like Bande \u00e0 part and the original Scarface. And the music of The Doors, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin is just amazing. I love a lot The Doors and the song The Spy is just perfect for this film.About the cast: the three main roles are played in a great way. Pitt has been working with some great directors in a very short time. Eva Green is just amazingly sexy in this film with many explicit scenes in a great performance.Conclusion: I love this film. A great love story with a background where Bernardo Bertolucci pays homage to a generation of dreamers. The erotic scenes make this film not for all the audiences but I do recommend this gem to any true Cinema lover. 9.5 out of 10Region 4 DVD: contains great bonus material, comments by Bertolucci and two terrific documentaries, one about the filming and other about the events of 1968. Both are very interesting."}, {"id": 77, "text": "You would think that the city of lights would make for a film set among many Parisian locations. However the only major landmarks we see in the film are the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre other than that the majority of the film takes place in Theo and Isabelle's apartment. The graphic nature and scenes in this film show how far Bertolucci will go to create a great film. The relationship between the three characters is one of love. Not only between Matthew and Isabelle or Theo and Isabelle, but between all three characters. The love scene in the kitchen. The masturbation scene (which I am sure secured it's NC-17 rating, that and the nudity). All in all a great piece of not only film, but art in general."}, {"id": 78, "text": "I found the contra-positioning of the nearly feral innocence of the twin's and Mathew's characters set in the turbulence of 1960's Paris to be intriguing. Bertolucci sets up parallel environments of the revolution in the streets (effected by news-footage) and the coming of age or rebirth in the characters' lives. Innocence faces reality on both a cultural as well as a dramatic stage. The film's tenor and mood mirrors well its title of The Dreamers as it lulls viewers into a quiet though inwardly provocative dreamlike state. The sex scenes are tasteful and artistic as is the cinematography. Great film. It's a keeper."}, {"id": 79, "text": "Young impressionables--an American boy, a French girl, and her twin brother--united by a love of cinema, converge in tumultuous 1960s France.

Piques your curiosity enough to wonder what is going to happen next, but nothing much does. The ending is especially dissatisfying and out of whack with the rest of the film."}, {"id": 80, "text": "Deeply disappointing 'comeback' movie for Bertolucci as we were all led to believe that The Dreamers was his masterful return back into 'Last Tango' territory and abandoning his US-friendly big budget mainstreams.  But we were wrong. The king is dead. This limp, uninspiring tale of cinema-loving siblings that befriend an American writer, is bland to the extreme. Eva Green has a face that belongs on a cinema screen, and a body to match, but she just can't act.  Michael Pitt is marginally better, but he gets very little in return from his female counterpart to act otherwise.But it's Bertolucci who depresses the most.  Where is the flair, the bravura, and the style of his masterpieces 1900 and Il Conformista. And where is the eroticism needed to ignite this film.  Still nestled within Brando's camel overcoat it seems."}, {"id": 81, "text": "If you have a Che Guevara poster glued to your bedroom wall (or of any other serial-killer), you should enjoy this film's message.History repeats itself. Hollywood supported Communist tyrants. Most of the Marxist tyrants have gone with the fall of Communism. So now Hollywood supports America's enemies, the (Radical) Moslems. Will Hollywood never learn? Same with Bertolucci. In the early 70s he tried to bring porn into the mainstream with his muddled drama, with an overweight Brando sodomizing a young dyevochka in Paris, an absurd task. Three decades later, and Bertolucci re-visits both porn and little old gay Pari, thinking that the time is ripe once again to try to introduce porn into the mainstream with a sexy young dyevochka. Will Bertolucci never learn? And guess what? The movie is set during the students' revolt in 1968. What a surprise!! Trust an aging, stubborn, decadent, rich old Marxist (yes, Marxists have their class system, too!) like Bertolucci to get increasingly nostalgic (or even more nostalgic) about his and every Left-wing idiot's favourite year. Him and Oliver Stone should just be tied to each other, placed in a box and sent to North Korea, which is a place that pretty much exemplifies what Communism was and still is. And when the box arrives, it should be sent directly to a gulag, where it should be opened with fanfare.Seriously now, the movie has the kind of predictable political dialogue and topics that had me yawning. It was the same old idealistic clap-trap that Leftist American and European propaganda films have been serving us since almost the beginning of cinema. I, for one, am really sick and tired of it.Point 1: How stupid or just plain hypocritical and mankind-loathing do you have to be not to realize how misguided your pathetic 60s views were? Point 2: How predictable and unoriginal can you get, bringing up Vietnam for the umpteenth time - and with nothing new to add, what hasn't been already discussed before or shown in movies? The movie. History does repeat itself. (Like this review. But why should I be any better than the damn movie I'm reviewing?) Just like Maria Schneider had to carry that dull turd Last Tango In Paris with her formidable body (especially breasts), so did Eva Green had to do in Dreamers. Without her and her AMAZING body, I don't know how I could have pulled off the equally amazing feat of finishing this movie. Eva is built like a goddess, easily beating out her 30 years older female competition from that other soft-porn movie based in Paris.Almost the entire movie is Eva, Pitt and that slimy little French actor jabbering pointlessly, debating politics and movies endlessly, boring the crap out of me. This is what is known among the more pretentious - i.e. clueless - reviewers as a character-driven vehicle. In other words? No plot.This no plot business would not be a problem at all if the dialogue and the acting had been better. Pitt does a solid job as the effeminate-like gentle American (I guess Di Caprio turned down the role, i.e. not wanting the world see that he has a vagina instead of a penis). Eva's acting is irrelevant almost: she contributes with her breasts alone - no acting required, I assure all the male readers. However, this Garrel, the French guy, is simply awful. I smell a heavy stench of nepotism in the air...The dialogues and the interaction between the 3 characters are your typical European nonsenso-rama art-f*rt garbage. So many reactions, grimaces, and lines made no sense, that you just end up giving up on the film after only 20 minutes or so. Everyone's in high spirits, being manic, full of energy, jumping up and down that Parisian flat like a rubber ball, and it's just... pretty silly.Btw, the movie is heavy on incest and graphic displays of penis (Pitt, no not Brad) and vagina (the divine Eva Green). I'm sure Bertolucci thinks there's nothing at all wrong with twins of opposite - or the same - sex being a little intimate... The senile old decadent pervert...How did Bertolucci convince Pitt and Green to degrade themselves like this? Sure, they were desperate, young, struggling actors, and this Grand Master offered them a role in a film!!!! Plus, he told them that it was for artistic reasons, a tried-and-true method of suckering gullible thespians into nudity of any kind. However, now they have to live with this naked embarrassment for as long as they live, just like all the other soft- and hard-core actors and actresses...But, just as every Commie regime has to eventually end, so does the suffering when watching this 2-hour snooze-fest. The last scene shows a bunch of riot cops marching toward Bertolucci's camera. Yes, smash it! I almost shouted, but remembered that it's just a movie. So in that sense, yes, the movie did get me emotionally involved! The cops did smash Bertolucci's camera and then the blessed sight of end-credits appeared on the screen. It was like being in a gulag for 5 years and then seeing rebels on the gates who bring freedom...

He's a young Keanu Reeves.I actually thought Eva Green done good with this film. I know for one I would want a lot of money to do any form of sex scene. She plays the kind of obsessed but needy sister really well.Louis Garrel was also alright. Not great and I was put off with him when he was masturbating midway in the film.

Then again, her innocent charm reminds the audience of her youth. This character alone sets the stage for what this movie is all about. Most of the audience has no clue what is happening at France during the time and how it is mentioned in the first 5 minutes of the movie that the masses are fighting to screen any movie they want. Having respect for all kinds of genre and films of any subject matter, we look at the subject matter of The Dreamers, and we begin to understand.

There were barricades in the streets, firebombs, clashes with the police, a crisis of confidence.

Though fine acting by Eva Green as Isabelle, Michael Pitt as Matthew and Louis Garrel as Theo. The background of 1968 Paris when the students took to streets works wonderfully and the passion for films amongst the young lead characters is interesting.

What I'm saying, I guess, is that I expected to be shocked and I wasn't. What I liked about the movie was the fresh breeze that brought because of the different, unfamiliar subject for me - the youth of late 60' and another approach on evolution and discovering oneself, throughout the perspective of a twin brother and sister couple and their American friend. All of this involves a lot of sex, games, wine and movie talk, which are delightful. But it feels like there could have been more to it, more changes, more dramatic evolution.

And the sex scenes seemed like bad porn - if there is such a thing as good porn.  They just weren't arousing.  (When I think of poignant sex scenes, I always come back to Warren Beattie and Natalie Wood in Splendor in the grass, which conveyed the pain of NOT going all the way.)  So, many people loved this movie, but I hated it. For 60s nostalgia, Woodstock comes closer, but I haven't seen anything really all that close yet."}, {"id": 92, "text": "SPOILERS In the modern world the definition of 'student' is clear. Expected to drink a lot, do no work and have strong political views, the notion of students as revolutionary thinkers is as strong now as it used to be.In 1968 perhaps the most famous student revolt of all time took place. In Paris, France, thousands of students, upset at the apparent evilness of their Government, rose up and rioted. Based on a doctrine of socialism and flying soviet flags, the students thought with their minds and fought with their hearts. Ultimately though, like most students of today, you find yourself wondering how many truly believed in the philosophy and how many merely wanted to appear intellectual or fit into a group.Based upon three students in Paris at the time, The Dreamers appears to demonstrate the way in which cinema obsessives of the time would hide themselves in closed worlds whilst sprouting doctrine as if it were truth. The film is actually incredibly beautifully shot and contains a superb soundtrack. Ultimately though, with a weak conclusion (a sturdy message, but no resolution), an over use of sex and a message almost pretentious in it's portrayal, the film fails on many levels.Matthew (Michael Pitt) is an American studying French in Paris. Devoting a lot of his time to the cinema, Matthew is overjoyed when he makes friends with brother and sister Theo (Louis Garrell) and Isabelle (Eva Green). As the three begin to spend increasing amounts of time together, Matthew finds himself drawn into the closed and self contained life of the pair, whilst simultaneously feeling stuck on the outside. As the old phrase said Twos company, threes a crowd.Shot beautifully by Bernardo Bertolucci, The Dreamers gives the impression of being incredibly thought provoking and powerful. Set at a time of civil unrest and featuring three well acted performances by an unknown cast, the film has all the makings of a true classic. It's a shame therefore that it just doesn't work.Arrogant in quantity, The Dreamers is one of those films that people feel they are intellectual just by watching. Watched either by people think they are clever or by those who like the idea of the large amount of nudity (of which there is an excessive amount), the film never really gets to grips with the issues at hand. Yes it makes bold statements, and yes one or two of these are truly amazing concepts (Matthew pondering a lighter and his final speech to Theo are highlights), but for so much of the film you find yourself hating these characters and the story. It is just so superficial that it is hard to take seriously. The film acts like just by sprouting the occasional word of wisdom, you are intelligent. It is, for lack of a better choice, an intellectual soft-core porn film. You see nudity, you see even more nudity, and yet that's OK because one of the characters has just said something profound. No! Gilbert Adair is probably a nice man and writing The Dreamers he probably truly thought he was creating a piece of cinema to go down in history alongside some of the films he covers. Unfortunately though, he just doesn't get the balances right.Impressions of The Dreamers are also not helped by Adair's weak finale. As one predictable event unfolds, history begins to take control of the event. Then the character Matthew makes an amazing speech, only for the film to then conclude thirty seconds later. The script could, and arguably should, have continued for at least twenty minutes more. Conclusions aren't reached, plot lines aren't tied off, and the story just finishes with another sign of arrogant beauty. It attempts to leave a poignant finale, but instead you find yourself wanting to slap the writer and director for not working together to properly conclude the piece.It's hard to know why this film deserves to be praised. Increasingly arrogant throughout, the film tries to trick it's audience, just like most of the characters, into feeling intellectual just for watching a piece of cinema. If you talk to someone who thinks they're smart, this is one of those films which they will praise. Like Nietzsche is for books, The Dreamers is for cinema. It's a chance to show intelligence without actually having any.The Dreamers is arrogance personified. Vain, ignominious and superficial, the film is not well written, and is definitely overly laden with sex. Still, despite all this, it is still occasionally beautiful to watch. Creating tributes to classic films, the occasional camera work by Bertolucci is a joy to watch. Unfortunately this one bonus just adds to the problem that the film is both pretentious and superficial. You should watch this film, but only so that you can shout down any 'intellectual' who tells you it's good."}, {"id": 93, "text": "I can't say I found this film all that great and hardly erotic at all, despite its marketing. One thing I found amusing was the undercutting of the very beautiful dialogue our narrator delivers during the opening scenes.He talks about how he likes to sit in the front because he gets the images first and goes on very eloquently. I liked that speech. But then later he comes there with her on a date and says they can sit in the back because the front row is for those without tickets. I think this must be some kind of ironic commentary on overblown film analysis masking real motivations. Something to consider when analyzing this film, which analyzes so many other films."}, {"id": 94, "text": "This movie is one of those classic Art House flicks with lots of skin and just enough subtext to be considered Art.  As is sometimes the case, Bertolucci seems to be more interested in giving you JUST ENOUGH information/titillation to keep you seated.  I personally found Mr. Pitt's characterization to be oddly stifled.  I also think he did an amazing job with what he was given (precious little).The other two leads were by turns bad and worse.  And to top it all off our Leading Lady's breasts where so odd looking and perverted (probably by surgery) and since she doesn't get to hide her secret shame... It gets pretty surreal.A friend who went with me to see it, and who really didn't like the film very much, asked me about the parents' reaction to their discovery late in the film.  Why would they do that?I told him that my take was they were not parents.  The father was a child and the mother was too soft, for her children, her husband, or her own good. The kids never had any limits.And I must admit that the movie was too much about urinating.  Folks urinate on and into all manner of things that cause us Calvinist Americans to cringe.  SPOILERBut the D\u00c9NOUEMENT for me occurred when Theo is strangling Matt, simultaneously trying to stop Matt from telling him the truth about himself and hump Matt at the same time.  The sad, stupid thing is Matt is right about Theo, and Isabelle.  Theo needs to get down with the obviously interested (and bisexual) Matt.  Theo also needs to stop pretending to be a communist when he obviously isn't one.  And Isabelle needs to get the heck out her brother's bed.They miss the points offered and are most likely dead by the end of the film.  The points Bertolucci is trying to make with using classic film scenes inter-cut with his own work are lost on me.  The flashes are short-lived and in truth only illuminate the less hypnotic film created here.  To a one, every old film dazzles and singes the mind and eye.  Bertolucci may be trying to say that the late '60's were ugly and bereft of magic.  I honestly don't understand why he'd stick us in one of the shabbiest apartments in Paris.Still, I love many things here.  I love the faster-than-usual-for-him pace of the film.  I love Michael Pitt's performance.  I love many of the set pieces.And it is, after all, Bare-Toe-Lew-Chi!"}, {"id": 95, "text": "This movie struck me as the sort of movie that would be considered Artsy because it was about people who have no connection to pop culture, and do things that are quite depraved rather unabashedly. In this case they are young, idealistic film (NOT movie) buffs, who have the added bonus of being extra-artsy by virtue of being not only European, but in fact French. The story is not particularly gripping, nor are the characters at all sympathetic.Matthew, the American boy, meets two twins he finds fascinating, but who frankly come off as weird, guarded, and strangely off-putting. Nonetheless, they welcome him into their odd world, where they are basically having an incestuous relationship. What happens is then described by many as a sexual awakening but is in fact a rather poorly disguised voyeuristic look into some very unrealistic fictional characters.The twins, Isabel and Theo, turn out to be very shallow and snooty, but motivated by some sort of need to prove how deep they are. (Artsy!) Isabel then loses her virginity to Matthew basically because Theo dares her to. They then spend the next few days making love (which is the arty French-guy term for the fairly grotesque acts of depravity and incest that are going on here), until they run out of food and begin to eat garbage. See?? The stark humanity of sex and suffering? Artsy! This is ART, guys!

The Dreamers is a love letter to the French New Wave, with all the spectacular erotica that Bertolucci can offer. It's a celluloid porno.. literally speaking.

Like all of his movies, Bertolucci asks for nearly everything from his actors, and every time, it never fails. Clothes come flying off. I always seem to respond very positively to art house films that veer towards pornography. It's not because I get a thrill out of it. There is something so powerful and intimate about sex on film. Sex is the most private, vulnerable state of the human experience. Through the sheets, we see our characters completely unravel. Granted you have to be a good actor for this to work.

They started talking. I started watching. That's the first time I saw The Dreamers. I was mesmerized by the story and the characters. I enjoyed every scene of it. After that, I just wanted to watch the film again and again and again! I bought the DVD and watched it at my heart's will.

Then, one day, searching something on the Net I found the book by the same name as the film, The Dreamers, and there were Isabella and Matthew on the cover. I bought it and read it like no book before and I loved the story even more.

That film, of course, was both celebrated and condemned for its frank sexuality, and 'The Dreamers (2003)' was similarly introduced to me as a controversial, sexually-driven drama. Such a description misses the mark entirely. Bertolucci's film, set during the 1968 student riots in Paris, is the director's tender love-letter to the art of cinema. As a city falls apart amid civil unrest, one element remains constant: those wonderful cinematic moments imprinted on celluloid, resonating with audiences even decades after they were captured. To illustrate their timelessness, Bertolucci frequently juxtaposes his favourite movie moments with similarly-framed shots from his main narrative, emphasising their relevance even in contemporary times.Yet, there is also an additional level at play \u2013 a self-criticism of sorts. The film's resident cinephilics, brother and sister Theo (Louis Garrell) and Isabelle (Eva Green), often talk of social revolution, but nevertheless spend most of their time engrossed in the cinematic past. When Theo ultimately joins the student riots, discarding his romanticism in favour of Molotov cocktails, I wasn't sure how to respond: was it a betrayal? Or was it the awakening from a dream? Bertolucci reflectively and affectionately captures the milieu of the late 1960s counterculture, a time of social and cultural upheaval. The three main actors \u2013 including Michael Pitt as an American student living in Paris \u2013 are convincing in extremely gutsy roles, and the gamble paid off for at least one of the trio: Eva Green turned out to be the next Bond girl, and a very memorable one at that, in 'Casino Royale (2006).'"}, {"id": 99, "text": "If, like me, you have reached the age when you need assistance in understanding how today's young people behave, watching a North American movie production may help you. However if you want to understand not only how they behave but also why, what they are really thinking, and how they regard today's world, then you may get more help from one of the better European or Asiatic films, and The Dreamers might provide a very good starting point. If you recognise any need to become more aware of the factors contributing to the evolution of the society of the future you have few other options, but you might also be helping to reduce the generation gap and its associated stresses that have led to much recent street violence. My generation has no obligation to accept the judgements or wishes of a younger generation, but it has a real responsibility to at least understand them; young people today are very ready to discuss and defend their beliefs and this needs to be encouraged.My apologies - I am writing a review - not preaching. Films like The Dreamers are less common in North America than in Europe and therefore tend to finish up more controversial here where far too much attention has been paid to the sexuality in the film. Not this but the more appropriate thoughts above came to my mind when I started commenting on it for IMDb. This film nominally follows the inter-relationship between three young people with an intense love for the cinema, an American student in Paris at the time of the 1968 student inspired street riots and French twins of a similar age. But this only provides a background against which its director Bernardo Bertolucci used the individual frames and sequences to build our appreciation of both the intensity and the shallowness of the beliefs that motivate his principal characters. It is easier to follow this film if one is a movie fan - flashbacks from classic films called to mind by one of the characters are used to set moods or changes of emotion. Street activities and even their layout or architecture are built into the fabric of the film. It would take many viewings before a critic could develop a full understanding of the message the director is trying to convey. Quite correctly this was an NC17 film in the US and Canada, much of its imagery would merely be confusing or disturbing to anyone younger, apart from this its very frank portrayal of the sexual interactions between the characters has also proved disturbing to many adult viewers. It is certainly not a film with universal appeal, although it is extremely rewarding for those viewers open to its attempts to probe the generation gap. Isabelle and Theo, the French twins, initially appear to their very conventional American friend Matthew to be modern radicals in full tune with the many concerns about society that young people were feeling during this period, and he willingly allows them to induct him into the various causes the rioters were attempting to promote. But gradually as the film runs we see him becoming disillusioned. He starts to appreciate that circumstances have led the twins into an over-close relationship which has begun to dominate their lives, so that despite lip adherence to these various progressive causes they are really becoming addicted to a personal lifestyle that is essentially self destructive. The film's ultimate message is obviously subject to the interpretation of the individual viewer, but in essence Bertolucci very gradually shows the twins as parasitic, they are not producing but are becoming conspicuously greater consumers, and this is clearly intended to be a parallel progression to that of the street rioters who initially have many very genuine concerns, but whose behaviour evolves in a way which makes their protests increasingly ineffectual. There is no future in anarchy as it rejects the very concepts of compromise and working together which provide the only basis for eventual progress.No film attempting to convey such an ambitious message could totally succeed, nor could it hope to appeal to all filmgoers. Anyone planning to view it should at least read some reviews first to prepare them for what to expect, and if it does not sound the type of film they would enjoy they would be wise to stay away. But for those prepared to view it both closely and sympathetically this film can be a very rewarding experience. The credit for this must be shared between the director and the three young principal actors. Theo is played by the son of French director Phillipe Garrel and his background may have made it easier for these three actors to achieve the confidence in Bertolucci which must have been essential during the filming of some of the more intimate sequences; but all three of them have a remarkable maturity and offer us superb performances.The film is based upon an original novel by Gilbert Adair. He also wrote the film-script so it should reflect the intentions of the original work fairly well; but I still want to read the book to assess whether Bertolucci has merely attempted to recreate it as a movie; or if not how far he has gone in re-interpreting it. Meantime my tentative rating for The Dreamers is 8 stars."}, {"id": 100, "text": "Michael Pitt is an American Matthew studying in Paris in 1968. However we never see him do much studying of the kind that universities sponsor. He is also a big movie fan, normally going by himself.One day he comes upon Eva Green as Isabelle, who appears to be chained to a metal barrier. When he approaches her about helping her, and wondering why she was chained, she pulls her hands forward and shows that it was only a protest, she wasn't really chained.But this brief introduction results in an invitation by Isabelle to join her and her twin brother, Louis Garrel as Theo, also movie fans.As the three get to know each other they play many games involving famous movies, often imitating scenes. Matthew doesn't quite know what to make of this strange brother-sister pair, but goes along because he has no other friends in Paris and they seem nice.Things take a leap forward when mom and dad leave home to take a vacation, and the twins invite Matthew to move out of his seedy hotel room and into a spare room in their home.Matthew begins to take a great liking to Isabelle, and it seems that she returns the affection. In a dare, Theo asks Matthew to make love to his sister on the floor in front of him, which he does. But Theo's reaction appears uncomfortable.Matthew observes that Isabelle and Theo often sleep together, in the nude, but it never reveals explicitly if they are sexually intimate. However it is clear that they are very close, and would probably be impossible for someone like Matthew to come between them.In the end, Matthew thinks he loves Isabelle, but she and Theo seem more interested in pursuing their own interests."}, {"id": 101, "text": "Watching Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers, I thought it had something in common with another movie I'd seen earlier this year: Three, starring Kelly Brook. Although stylistically, the two movies are poles apart, they do have one thing in common: they are both showcases for a glamorous female star dressed up as proper movies.There is a political backdrop to this story, about the student riots in France 1968 but this is largely pushed aside. The characters involvement in it bookends the film at the beginning and brings the story to a logical if not altogether effective ending.The story concerns Matthew (Michael Pitt), an American exchange student on a placement in France. He meets two siblings Theo (Louis Garrell) and his entrancing sister Isabelle (Eva Green) who share his love of classic movies and invite him to stay at their apartment while their parents are away on vacation. Completely smitten by Isabelle, Matthew is increasingly drawn into the pair's illicit, incestuous private world where film trivia quizzes descend into sexual and psychological mind games...Without doubt the film's star is future Bond girl Eva Green. Anyone who liked her in Casino Royale will absolutely love watching her here. It is not for nothing that Bertolucci has described her as so beautiful it's indecent. I've compared this film to Three, but unlike Kelly Brook, Eva Green can act. Her best scene is a short sequence on the streets of Paris with Matthew. Her expressive deep blue eyes convey the tragedy of her character: she's drawn to this idealistic young man, but she's hopelessly bound to her brother, a union that will eventually be the undoing of her.I wish Bertolucci had featured more scenes like this and pared down the often painfully (and I do mean PAINFULLY) explicit sex scenes. He could have tied the central story better in with it's backdrop and significantly broadened the audience. There's nothing wrong with nudity in a good movie if it is used well, but overdosing on it the way Bertolucci has here makes the effect anodyne, and turns the film into little more than slick-looking pornography.Eva Green is a bewitching actress, but with a complex political background that simply isn't drawn on enough, I came away feeling that the movie was a wasted opportunity."}, {"id": 102, "text": "This film is a wonderfully stylish and imaginative.

Movies should all be more like this, less afraid to show natural parts of life, aka, sex and nudity and such. Hopefully one day it will become more acceptable to show this than violence. What is more offensive in the end?...This film also had amazing music with it. Everything from Janis Joplin to the Doors. I also liked the fact that it had both English and french and it was set in Paris. It just added a nice change in scenery.

The female lead is a perfect natural beauty, and the male leads look and act young enough to feel very real. The movie is very earthy - possessed of a lack of shine and polish that makes it a wholly more satisfying experience than it could be with more sunshine and clean underwear.By far the best aspect of this movie, though, is the feeling of purpose that comes through the story - you envy the characters their direction and idealism.

The story was very weeak and it never really went anywhere in the end. The one aspect of the movie that was very good was the soundtrack and how they made several references and movements to their favorite movies. The acting from the French girl was very good and she was a typical Bertolucci character. Michael Pitt played a very annoying character as the young American who finds these two french siblings. He seemed to just be trying too hard to really give a very dynamic performance and ended up over acting in my opinion. THis movie does live up to its reputation of being very erotic and how it is Pure Bertolucci. Only he could direct some of the sexier scenes and like i said, he does do a good job directing.

I don't think that Bertolucci succeeded in taking full advantage of the material inherent in that turbulent, revolutionary time in our history.**SPOILER** The first third of the movie was terrific, the passion of the characters for film,inter cutting older films into the scenes, acting out scenes from older films. Great stuff. But then, I think Bertolucci got bogged down in the incestuous, although not consummated relationship between the twins and their drawing the young American into their web. I felt like I was watching the undoing of three young lives; lives that were intelligent, potentially funny and passionate. To focus on sensational taboo type sex scenes to demonstrate the passion of the time does a great disservice to those of us who lived through that age.

Don't know why anyone had trouble with the actors, they seemed quite real (as my memory of that era serves), with Michael Pitt reminding me, quite vividly, of an old acquaintance or two.  Even the suggestion of incest is off-putting, but this is the storyline. The nudity was refreshing, hey this was the late 60's and among a pretty wild trio.  Even movies of that period was very frank in their use of nudity, e.g. the terrific Women in Love. The movie remembrance scenes were a highlight for me, Queen Christina especially welcome.  POSSIBLE SPOILER!! Pulling this down to a 9 (still a mighty fine evaluation): the frank use of nudity for the sister, but only a small dose for the men.  And come on, the missing element, although highly suggested, was the lack of any real sensuality between the two men (although you can almost feel the desire between the guys, but Bertolucci, of all people!, chickened-out).For a limited audience who will likely enjoy the warm, wacky, wondrous nostalgia.  Try it on DVD!"}, {"id": 112, "text": "This is definitely a film made for those of you that were lucky enough to be a film goer in the late sixties and early seventies when film was considered an important art form. This story takes place in Paris, France in 1968 when Henri Langlois who was the founder of the Cinematheque Francais was ousted and this started a chain of violent riots between the supporters of Langlois and the police. At a protest rally an American student named Matthew (Michael Pitt) meets Isabelle (Eva Green) and after chatting she introduces him to her twin brother Theo (Louis Garrel). They invite Matthew to stay with them in their home while their parents are away for a month and it doesn't take long for him to discover that Theo and Isabelle have a strange and unique brother/sister relationship.*****SPOILER ALERT*****The three of them spend their time talking about films and politics and they start to play games that involve sex. Isabelle loses a game and Theo tells her to have sex with Matthew who is reluctant but goes through with it and finds out that he has taken Isabelle's virginity. After time passes Matthew starts to think about his role as a pawn in their sex games and how different they are in their attitudes dealing with certain issues.This film is directed by the great Bernardo Bertolucci and it's easy to see that he has a personal passion and fondness for that certain time period. The film is a real treat for serious movie buffs and the characters here frequently recite lines of dialogue from other films. Also, this film inter-cuts from the actions that the characters are engaged in to clips of older films that mirror what is taking place. Bertolucci does a good job of recreating the mood of the times and the attitudes that the youth had during those chaotic years. Even though I do admire this film I do think that Bertolucci is trying to recapture a moment that he mastered in Last Tango in Paris. This story greatly resembles that film and it's almost impossible not to make some sort of comparison. Eva Green gives the films best performance and she displays both strength and maturity that is rare for a relatively unknown actress. Watching her career develop will be an interesting one to watch. As is the case with most of Bertolucci's films there is a requirement for an abundant amount of nudity for both female and male actors and this has me think about the casting of Pitt in the lead role. Pitt is a good young actor and he deserves lots of credit for allowing his genitalia to be shot in a close-up but he doesn't really possess screen presence. Since most American actors will not do full frontal nudity I suspect Bertolucci had very little choice in which actor to cast in the lead. Even if it seems obvious what Bertolucci is trying to recapture I'm still grateful that we live in a time where there are still a few filmmakers around to remind us that film is an art form and should be made accordingly. It's been over 30 years since Tango came out and you have to ask yourself what went wrong since then? This is a gutsy and intriguing piece of work that would seem common place in the early seventies but now your hard pressed to find an audience that is sophisticated enough to view this for what it is.

In the scene where Isabelle pulls down Michael Pitt's shorts is played for laughs.  It's like two 12 year old boys watching a porn flick and having to crack jokes to cover up for being uncomfortable.  That scene COULD have been erotic. For much of the film, Isabelle prances around in a see-thru dress like a 1920's silent screen vamp.  It's campy, silly, somewhat unbelievable but not erotic.  No incest, no homosexuality.

He is in love with cinema; he spends all his free time going to movie houses watching the most daring work of avant-garde film makers in art houses. One day, there is a protest outside a government building and he meets a woman named Isabelle (Eva Green). He gets friendly with the bilingual Isabelle as her mother is British and father is French. Later, he meets her brother Theo (Louis Garrel). All three happen to share a very serious passion for films and a perfect fit as friends. Matthew lives in a small apartment and is offered the chance to live with the siblings as their parents are taking a vacation.Before the parents leave, Matthew sees that these siblings are unlike any he's seen before. He notices them sleeping together in the same bed naked and that they shower together. He also learns that they love to re-enact scenes from their favorite movies for kicks and he is pretty much egged on to join them in fear of them turning on him. However, he also notices that they play explicit games of dare that involve humiliation when someone fails to guess the movie scene being acted out. At one point, Matthew loses a game of dare and is forced to have sex with Isabelle and that's where the three of them start spending a week of debauchery while the 1968 French Student Riots rage on.The movie shows people who use cinema as a means of escape; a place where they can get away from the realities of life. They re-enact their favorite moments from films to be able to fulfill their fantasies as they get off on it. However, they are left ill-equipped to understand the nuances of the real world and are forced to live in isolation.The movie is pretty good in the first half but it slows to a crawl in the second and becomes very convoluted and excessive. Still, the acting is very good with Pitt, Green, and Garrel delivering good performances. I would be remiss if I didn't say that Green looks beautiful; her mother is Marlene Joubert and her sexiness was passed down very well apparently. You've got to love that scene where she is hand-cuffed to the building and asks Matthew to remove her cigarette from her lips. When he does, she lets out a cute little yelp as if it hurt her.

A high-five to the art director.The sprint through Le Grand Louvre was fun but too short. And I enjoyed the old film references. The soundtrack rocked but those same great songs have pitched too many films and products by now because they are so successful.

Highlights for the leading trio, that skilfully dominate the 'spicy' moments, but specially Eva Green, embodying a dissimilar 'femme fatale'.An outstanding movie with wide cinematographic influences and references, that are in a certain way, a bit of what Bernardo Bertolucci is as a film-maker."}, {"id": 130, "text": "The last film by Italian director Bernardo Beltolucci is set in the late 60s in France, when young film buffs revolt against the government, causing riots and scandals. Matthew (Michael Pitt) is an American student, studying French and going to cinemas to watch old films. At a protest rally he meets the beautiful French girl, Isabelle and her brother Theo. All three immediately become friends and they talk and share their thoughts on cinema and life. Throughout the movie, Matthew becomes suspicious that Theo and Isabelle are carrying out an incestuous affair when he sees them naked in bed together. Things get crazier and crazier as they reenact scenes from movies and Isabelle and Matthew start a sexual relationship. The m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, already turbulent because of Theo and Isabelle's obsessive and unbreakable relationship, comes to an end when the events of 1960s France finally comes to them, whether they're hidden or not from them.This movie features a lot of explicit nude scenes that should leave a real sensual feeling for the audience, despite the dysfunctional relationships, and a good description in the way certain people view the world. Matthew is a pacifist, against violence and thirsty for knowledge while Theo and Isabelle are ready to fight the oppression of the brutal police and government (at one point, Theo declares proudly that he would rather go to jail than fight in the Vietnam war) and unwilling to let go of each other."}, {"id": 131, "text": "Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers is a film that breathes, eats, and sleeps cinema; a film about life in the extremes, about sex, about love, about food and wine. It's a sophisticate's film about the dangers of self-indulgence and the disassociations (from reality) that can happen when these things go too far. It's certainly not a film for everyone, with plenty of graphic sex and nudity to steer away the average moviegoer (especially in America), but it certainly grabs the viewer's attention and never lets go until the very end. One has to hand it to the actors for taken on such a bold and often taboo story and characters.The film is a cinema lover's dessert. It's filled with references to the French New Wave, and clips and homages to old Hollywood song and dance pictures. I'm glad it took me this long to see it, otherwise I would have never recognized these references, as I just recently started exploring French New Wave cinema within the past couple of years.The Dreamers is also a film about what is hip and cool, and how such personifications often contradict or become a shallow shell of what was originally intended. However, this is also a small problem I had with the film overall. It never seemed to be quite sure of what it was trying to say or do (as were the characters, I suppose). Nonetheless, this is a small squabble in an otherwise refreshing and fascinating look at 1960s French-youth lifestyle taken to the edge."}, {"id": 132, "text": "***Spoilers*** I sometimes wonder if certain film makers like to drop some poo like this onto a plate, stride boldly out onto the streets holding the platter with both hands, and and politely present it to the world with a wan silly smile saying, Hey look I'm a genius!! That being said, it's not a terrible movie. It does have the saving grace of nudity and some interesting intellectualism. It's very character driven and goes deep into the psychology of the three young people in the movie. Also some gross out scenes are provided such as the American spitting in his room and the food scene which are supposed to make the story more realistic, (probably should have been left out.) But this is in the neo-realistic style so I guess those scenes had to be in there along with all the other mind candy (or drivel, depending how it strikes you) to tickle (or nauseate) your intellect. Still they tried to make something with a cut above the average in smarts for this film and succeeded on some levels.

He has a love of film and it was a cinematheque linked to a museum. When the cinematheque was forced to close he befriends twins Isabelle and Theo (Eva Green and Louis Garrel). As the film goes on Matthew discovers that Isabelle and Theo's relationship is twisted and on the verge of being insectial. For example Isbelle and Theo share a bed together, and both play a game which the other has to guess a scene and if they can't they have do a forfeit. Matthew slowly falls in love with the twins, having a relationship with Isbelle, but also questions the twins relationship at times. He does also get involved in their activities, such as sharing a bath with the twins.Throughout the film it looks at sexual relations and politics. It also looks at a twisted relationship between the twins. However, because of the period the film is set in politics could not be avoided. Theo is a Maoist and during the film there is debates about revolution, warfare, pacifist, socialism, social issues and Vietnam. Matthew does argue with Theo over politics. There is also many cultural references throughout the film, there is debate on who's better, Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton (I personally favour Hendrix). There are also film references, such as the Freaks and Scarface (1932). A really good scene in the film is when the characters of the film try to copy a scene from Bande \u00e0 part, where they race through the Louve. During that scene it cuts from the characters from the Dreamers and the scene from Bande \u00e0 part.The film was well acted and does raise questions for the audience.

Matthew (Michael Pitt, Hedwig and the Angry Inch), an expatriate American student, bonds with a twin brother and sister, Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel), over their mutual love of film--they not only quote lines of dialog, they act out small bits and challenge each other to name the cinematic source. Matthew suspects the twins of incest, but that doesn't stop him from falling into his own intimacies with Isabelle. As the threesome becomes threatened, Paris succumbs to student riots. The Dreamers aspires to be kinky, but the results are more decorative than decadent; nonetheless, the movie's lively energy recalls the careless and vital exuberance of Godard and Truffaut."}, {"id": 135, "text": "I just caught this movie on IFC (Indie Film Channel) this week.

After I watched that movie, I witnessed another dimension and aim of the art of cinema; seeing what you want to see and not trying to judge the morality of it just for two hours. Many audiences consider the movie as an erotic one, which is close to soft porn. I do not think that Bertollucci' main purpose was to sexually satisfy the watchers by showing the CLOSE relations between three teenagers. Beyond that, the movie underlines the basic idea and aim that prevailed during the 68 period: free spirit, by using these teenagers's love of cinema and partly NAKED relationships between. The director shows his respect to this period by putting many flashbacks from some movies like Godard's Bande a Part. We all know that Bertollucci has always been close to the leftist views. Like other films of Bertollucci, this one also had its share from his political and philosophical opinions, under the combination of a deep love against the French culture. In Turkey, the name of the film translated as 'Dusler, tutkular ve suclar': 'Dreams, passion and crimes'. Although I do not like using a translated name of a movie instead of the original one, I think it successfully summarizes the movie. Our characters Matthew, Isabelle and Theo are living in a dream world. The twins constructed it maybe after birth and later Matthew involved. Everything was perfect first, and then a passion full intention starts between Matthew and Isabelle. We can think Isabel and Theo as a single being, physically separated mentally joint. This situation prepares a base for the criminal side of the story. They believe what they see and fit their opinions. The twins do not want to change in fact. After Matthew involved we may say he forced them to change rapidly in an unplanned way. I want to say that definitely this is not a popcorn movie. Do not watch it with your parents or girlfriend. However, it is a must-see and a good opportunity to have an idea of the political and cinematic atmosphere in the late 1960s."}, {"id": 139, "text": "I very much liked the scenes in which the three protagonists copy famous scenes of film history. I really thought that this had something to it and I really believe that Bertolucci loves the cinema. Like the way one of his film characters explains the Charlie Chaplin scene, in which the former blind girl touches Chaplins face for the first time and makes the audience see Chaplins face for the first time as well. That I liked. But the story itself about the incestuous siblings and their American friend was rather flawed. I really think that directors make it too easy for themselves when thinking that a good film requires nothing more than a few nude scenes, a few tits and a young boys dick to make it interesting. After half an hour or so I knew that this was a dangerous m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois but then the story just went on in those lines and developed nothing new or extraordinary. It just went on and on with little sex games, conversations becoming more and more uninteresting and a somewhat faked fatality. As to the parents of the siblings: I think that they are an accurate image of the 69 parent generation. How they just let their kids be and don't interfere with their lives at all. How they think that it is a good way of educating kids and don't realize that their kids are led astray. That was good.

The visuals (characters) are stunning, but no glitzy camera tricks or clich\u00e9d pans of the city (Paris).

The local title given to The Dreamer, `Dreaming in Paris', extends an infinite lure. I did get to see a little bit of Paris, but not much. Ironically, what I saw was something that is inside Paris but completely outside Paris. The former is physical; the latter verges on hallucination. In the apartment where young American student Matthew (Michael Pitt) is invited to stay with Parisian twins Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel), things happen and don't happen. While another wave of student movement is raging outside, the three live in a world of their own (don't think of the idyllic world in The Seekers' song). Indeed, current affairs (the Vietnam War, can you guess) and cultural differences (Americans vs French, what else) is part of their discourse. The main theme, however, is films, in the form of quizzes, for which the penalty for losing is sexual activities. The Dreamers is interesting to watch, not so much for the explicit sexual content, but for some rather funny lines and situations. There is, however, so much referencing, both direct (in those quizzes) and indirect (in everything else) that if one is not a film buff and have not seen the films referenced, one would be made to feel like a fool.The relationship between the three young people, sexual and otherwise, is neither mystifying nor even unusual, if the viewer focuses accurately on the twins. There is nothing baffling about their intimacy if one remembers that their bodies were at one time connected when they were in their mother's womb, and even a few minutes just out of it. There might have been acts of sexual overtone, but never any real sex, between them. Their mutual need is spiritual (whatever that means) rather than erotic. This focus simplifies the impact of Matthew's `intrusion' into simply the development of mutual curiosity, interest, friendship and affection among young people.In the end, Matthew is able to bring some reality back into the twins' life, but ironically, a reality that he himself shuns. So we the viewers saw the dream, and a little bit of Paris.

What it was about was seemingly not what it was about.  The characters appeared to represent super-metaphorical roles in the world of film.

The riots and strikes claiming to be the cultural revolution for the french, the love for European and American films (Bertolucci didn't show asian films here, like the works of Ozu or Satyajit Ray), the need to free oneself expressed in sexual and political freedom, it's all fresh and new again here.

Very good recordings of Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company, as well as an obscure but great Doors/Jim Morrison tune, AND a good version of Hey Joe reminiscent of Billy Roberts' original but performed by Michael Pitt.I would say Save the price of admission and apply it to getting the soundtrack.

He hooks up with fellow movie buffs Isabelle (Eva Green) &amp; Theo (JFK Jr. look-alike Louis Garrel).  This is a brother-sister combo who spend more time around each other with their clothes off than on.

Each making sense of the world through violence, through love, sex, etc.  The film is very well put together with each successive scene becoming more and more intense.  The shocker for me was late in the movie, when you've been shown all the decadence of the lives of these three characters, unconventional sex, eating from the garbage, etc.  and Bertolucci shows you Isabelle's room and it is a room of a normal, curious sweet girl, of stuffed animals, schoolbooks, old photographs and knicknacks.

Since the film is set in Paris in 1968, the radicalism naturally takes the form of perverted sexuality and extreme cinephilia. Leave it to the French to be exploring l'amour in all its myriad possibilities!In terms of plotting, 'The Dreamers' is much like an incestuous version of Truffaut's menage a trois classic 'Jules and Jim,' with the new film's subject matter as shocking today as was the earlier film's in its own time. Time and culture sure do march on, and it always seems to be the French leading the way. In 'The Dreamers,' Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) are twins who have developed a rather 'unnatural' attraction to one another, becoming 'one' in virtually every way imaginable - physically, spiritually, psychically. Matthew (Michael Pitt, who looks for all the world like Leonardo Di Caprio) is the young American in Paris whom they pull into their strange little world of sexual intrigue and emotional games. Matthew is a product of his time, a young man who is not very experienced in the ways of the world but who is willing to partake in the moral relativism that is permeating the culture. Thus, he becomes the perfect candidate for Isabelle and Theo to work their magic on. Their power of attraction proves overwhelming and irresistible for Matthew, for they are both exotically beautiful creatures, seemingly in tune with the trendy radicalism swirling around them. Yet, Mathew eventually discovers that they are really only passive observers paying little but lip service to the cause, too obsessed with their own twisted relationship to actually step out and participate in those grand social movements they talk so freely about. Isabelle and Theo are 'radicals' to be sure, yet their radicalism seems to be channeled in a self-destructive, ultimately futile direction. Only over time does Matthew awaken to this realization.Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the subject matter, Bertolucci often seems more interested in shocking than enlightening us. Isabelle, Theo and Matthew are so insulated and cut off from the outside world that the points Bertolucci seemingly wants to make about the times - as reflected in protesters marching in the streets, the references to Vietnam, Mao and Jimmy Hendrix - feel tacked on and superfluous, not particularly integral to the film as a whole. He is never quite able to bring these background elements and the foreground story together in any meaningful way. What Bertolucci does capture well is the obsessive love the French have always had for the cinema as both entertainment and art form. His characters live, breathe and think films, often acting out favorite scenes while the director intercuts snippets from the movies themselves. The beautiful thing about the French is that they have always had such an eclectic taste in film, embracing both American studio and French New Wave products with equal passion. And this artistic open-mindedness Bertolucci captures with gleeful abandon. The film, in many ways, becomes an homage to Chaplin and Keaton, Astaire and Rogers, Samuel Fuller, Truffaut, Godard, Greta Garbo and many other icons of movie history.'The Dreamers' doesn't entirely hold together and the sum of its parts is better than the whole. Still, the acting is excellent and Bertolucci has lost none of his skills as a director, making each beautifully composed shot stand for something - a real treat for audiences bored to tears by the kind of by-the-numbers film-making we get so often today. Bertolucci is a true film artist and it is a joy just to sit and watch what he does with his actors and his camera, like a master painter working wonders with his canvas.As for the much-vaunted sexual content of the film (it is rated NC-17), certainly those who are easily offended by nudity and provocative sexual themes had best avoid subjecting themselves to this film. Those, however, with a more open mind will find little that is overtly offensive about what is shown here. In fact, if Isabelle and Theo weren't brother and sister, there would be little controversy at all generated by the film. My suspicion is that Bertolucci and writer Gilbert Adair made their film about incest because an ordinary love triangle would have seemed just too commonplace in this day and age to serve as a successful plot device for a film whose very theme centers around radicalism. They really needed to shake the audience up and this was as effective a way as any to do that. Whether it repels more people than it compels is something only time will tell.As it is, 'The Dreamers' is not an entirely successful film, but those impressed by fine film-making had best not pass it up."}, {"id": 159, "text": "The decor for The Dreamers, Bertolucci's sensual and narcotic film is represented by effervescent moments that took place in Paris in 1968. In the same manner in which the house inhabited by the three main protagonists represents a character, so do the Parisian streets, with their trepidation and demonstrations. Contrary to other films directed by this director - who has promised much and delivered even more throughout his career - The Dreamers opens in a fast-paced and provocative manner. The director establishes the cinematic convention precisely, eloquently, and elegantly. It becomes clear that the film deals with furious and beautiful young people who live through the films they devour. In the first five minutes, the heroine of the picture (played impeccably by Eva Green, a theatre actress reminiscent of Isabella Rossellini) announces that she was born in 1959. Logically, it is impossible, seeing that the year is 1968 and she seems to be at least 19 years old. Therefore, she explains further: 1959, Champs-Elysee, where she yelled New York Herald Tribune! Suddenly the film cuts to a scene from the classic Breathless (A bout de souffl\u00e9) by Godard, where Belmondo's feminine partner sells American newspapers on Champs-Elysee. Consequently, Bertolucci's feminine character believes that she has not been alive until seeing the afore-mentioned film, considered by many the beginning of the New Wave. The idea of interposing images and references to classic films is augmented in The Dreamers. It becomes a means of communication between the characters and in fact it ignites the entire action of the film.As in The Last Tango in Paris or Stealing Beauty, sex and sensuality also represent means of expression on which the director relies heavily. Yet The Dreamers rejects the desperation of The Last Tango through a seductive irreverence that indeed characterizes the so-called enfants terrible of 1968 Paris. It should be noted that The Dreamers contains various sexual and nude scenes, but that these are by no means as shocking as the sex scenes in The Last Tango were, when that film was released in the 1960s. Since then, video and Internet pornography have occurred and shocking audiences through nudity has become something of a moot point. It is only the MPAA that hasn't grown up. It gave The Dreamers basically the same rating that The Last Tango got, 30 years ago.Undoubtedly, the angles of the shots in The Dreamers are what impresses the most. As in other films by Bertolucci, practically every shot could be cut out and studied hours at an end for its elegance. The three main characters (all played beyond reproach) live their menage-a-trois through concrete gestures and attitudes, as well as through emotions that are suggested by the sublime cinematography.The ending of the film, considered by some critics a weak point, is in fact quite accomplished. American viewers (including some critics) are used to American films, in which the build-up leading to the climax is essentially dynamic, suspenseful or tragic. But the European cinema is different. It often shows how feelings are condensed in a quiet but explosive mixture. This description fits The Dreamers like a glove.Finally, a note for film buffs. In the initial scenes, at the demonstration in front of the Cinematheque, Bertolucci used news reel footage from the '60s with Jean-Pierre Leaud si Jean-Pierre Kalfon (known actors of the New Wave). They are seen giving speeches and throwing paper leaflets to the crowd. In 2003, when shooting the film, Bertolucci got Leaud and Kalfon, now aged, to reenact the images from the news reels. The end result is a mixture of new and old images, the former in color, the latter black and white. It is such tricks that Bertolucci uses throughout this nostalgic film that celebrates a certain period, during which the young generation had more meaningful things to fight than computer-simulated monsters."}, {"id": 160, "text": "My rating:  6/10There are two types of dreamers in `The Dreamers':  the three main characters, who create their own interior world and prefer to view the outside world by watching classic 1930s cinema; and the socialist street revolutionaries of riot-torn 1968 Paris, who attempt to overthrow the political and economic power structure.  `The Dreamers' focuses more on the former than the latter, and Bernardo Bertolucci is careful to leave his film open to interpretation, but ultimately the dream world of the three main characters is shattered by the realities of life.  The film ends before resolving the outcome of the second set of dreamers, but we all know our history.  Some may think it a shame that the dreamers fail, but others like myself will view it as something that has to happen, if the dream is unrealistic and unsustainable.The relationship between the three main characters is unlike anything that I've ever seen portrayed on film.  The twins, Isabelle and Theo, are almost as close to each other in young adulthood as they were during the nine months they spent together in their mother's womb.  Matthew, a U.S. student studying abroad in Paris, inserts himself into the middle, and when he receives early indications that portend the depth of the relationship between the twins, he does not run away.  To me, this required too much suspension of disbelief, but I'm certainly aware that others have different proclivities.  If Bertolucci's intent was to show a high degree of separation between his three dreamers and the rest of society, he certainly succeeded.The three dreamers have some, but ultimately too little, awareness of their separation from reality and the unsustainable nature of the world they create.  While sympathizing with the revolutionaries in the street, they actually are the ultimate materialistic consumers:  they produce nothing that they consume (neither food nor art), and when the money their parents provide runs out, and they've drained most of the wine cellar, the harsh realities of life set in.  Rooting through trash heaps isn't the answer, and the choices that they leave themselves in the end (self-annihilation or nihilism), I believe, show just how flawed their ideal world is.  My interpretation is that this lesson also applies to the other set of dreamers, the street revolutionaries, but those who even today sympathize with the views of those revolutionaries will reject this interpretation.`The Dreamers' is very voyeuristic, and Bertolucci puts his three leads through some incredibly intimate moments.  All three leads are quite good, with Eva Green in particular deserving special notice for a completely uninhibited performance (at least the two male leads had each other's example to follow).  It's hard to come up with an accurate overall rating for this film, because I think there will be a widespread variance in how different people react to both the storyline and the images.  Read the reviews carefully, and if it sounds like something that interests and won't shock you, then give it a try.  My middle-of-the-road rating is mainly due to my not being terribly interested in the type of relationship formed by the three main characters."}, {"id": 161, "text": "Paris, May 1968. Revolution breaks out and the world seems to be in a critical turning point, but inside the four walls of an apartment, three youngsters experience their very own revolution.Yes, it's true. In the year 2004, one of the best cinematic experiences is offered by Bertolucci. Many are those who'd thought that he had nothing more to give, but with THE DREAMERS, the creator is reborn and next to his heroes he witnesses again the passage from adolescence and innocence to the age of responsibilities. A great fan of cinema himself, he doesn't hesitate to pay a number of tributes, just like Godard used to do in the past and Tarantino very recently. As he puts his view into the eyes of his protagonists, the girl and the boys seem to live inside the movies they adore. They're playing with lines from known films, they imitate characters, they put themselves into the sequences they love.Despite their young age, all three actors not only do they show that they're worth of starring in a Bertolucci film, but they also go even further giving in every scene the necessary vividness and realistic tension. Ignoring the cosmogony taking place in the streets, they surrender to their own cosmogonic changes, to the wild sexual awakening, to the game between friendship and love, pleasure and pain. Eventually they commit themselves to the struggle between the game itself and real life. And that's where the heroes violently return in the thrilling final sequences in order to face their duty towards history.THE DREAMERS is by far one the best motion pictures of the year, so daring but at the same time so energetic that seems able to touch anyone as a pure and romantic confession of a great filmmaker."}, {"id": 162, "text": "The Dreamers is one of Bernardo Bertolucci's most underrated films. A mesmerizing love declaration for The Cinema, this unforgettable film must be discovered.In 1968, 19-year-old American Matthew (Michael Pitt), while settling in Paris for studying French, meets two equally young, beautiful and liberal film buffs: the twins Isabelle (Eva Green, another Bertolucci's luminous discovery, like he did with Liv Tyler in Stealing Beauty) and Theo (Louis Garrel, son of French director Philippe Garrel and the best of the cast). The twins' parents travel, and Matthew is invited to join the attractive duo in their apartment. He accepts the invitation, of course, and the threesome starts a bizarre game of seduction with a charming leitmotiv: riddles about classic films. Who doesn't know the right answer, has to do what he/she is asked to.

Bertolucci is top-notch, the soundtrack is overwhelming (with songs by Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and \u00c9dith Piaf, among others), and the cinematography (by Fabio Cianchetti) is one of the best, if not the best, I've seen recently. Gilbert Adair, we can't forget, did an excellent job adapting his novel, The Holy Innocents, to the big screens. The sex/full frontal scenes and amorality can shock some people, this is definitely not a film for all tastes (as almost all masterpieces), but those who are open-minded and admire good cinema, will be entranced. The ending is one of the most surprising, original and brilliant I've ever seen, but, unfortunately, not everyone will get it. That's a crying shame, but original films tend to be misunderstood.

It disturbs you, sometimes so deeply that you want to run away. But it is so real that you can't stop watching. And as you watch it, your view of the world changes a little.This is not an easy movie. It starts out lighthearted, innocent, and 2-dimensional. But as it progresses, it gets deeper and deeper and the characters get more and more complex. Uncomfortable aspects of the people are brought to the forefront. While it doesn't bask in hedonism like most Hollywood films, it doesn't shy away from any controversial subjects as long as they're the reality of the people.You don't have to be in an open relationship to identify with the situations the characters find themselves in. Taking place almost entirely with three people in one large house, it's amazingly acted, wonderfully heartfelt... If you are strong enough to watch it, The Dreamers is well worth the effort."}, {"id": 165, "text": "Matthew is a young american student in france, his passion for movies leads him into Theo and Isabelle, two twins that shares his passion, they quickly build a deep friendship and Matthew gets invited to stay with them while their parents are gone. However once he gets settled with them he discovers sides of both that he had not expected. While they spend their time talking and playing, the riots of Paris 1968 goes on in the real world.This is a very brave film in the way it has been build, but it is also a complicated movie that will leave you both confused and thinking, it's beautiful and it can almost be described as cinematic poetry, however this poetry also makes it a difficult one to relate too.After seeing this film i am confused in what i feel about it, the movie feels very divided, and some times it is an extraordinary brave and experimental film, other times it is confuing, and at some times boring too. It's really a hard movie to understand because of the poetic feeling it gives, it's like reading a poem where some of the lines doesn't make sense, but i guess that could be an advantage as it can be seen more than once. I feel the strength of the movie is the way it challenges and explores like no american or typical mainstream movie would do, the often use of nudity and raw sex scenes would never be seen elsewhere, and even though it may annoy many people, Bertolucci portrays the scenes very beautiful and they never seem like dirty scenes, the most impressive scene is the one where Matthew and Isabelle have sex, never have a full sex scene been portrayed in such a beautiful and realistic way on screen. And there are many examples of this.What brings the movie is first of all the very slow storyline, it barely moves at all, the whole 2 hours are pretty much circulating around one thing, which is the way these 3 youngsters spend their sparetime, it's an mysterious movie that really brings up interesting situations a lot of times, but other times it simply gets too slow and gets a little boring. Another partly negative thing is the understanding of the movie, as I earlier mentioned the movie is like a poem, if you have problems with a few lines the whole deeper meaning may fall apart. I wouldn't say i did not understand the fully deeper meaning of the movie, but i think each individual will understand this movie differently, due to the complex way it has been made. But i honestly think Bertolucci wanted it to be like that, a movie that will leave you thinking about many things, but i think what it really is about is finding yourself in a world where there are 6 billion people looking like you on the outside.The movie is very well directed, a solid directing and you can clearly see the trademarks of the director, one thing i noticed was the floating camera. The floating camera gives a feeling of being there, it is mostly used in the first part of the movie where Matthew learns more about his mysterious new friends, it gives us a feeling of curiousity towards these two new persons. Two persons whom we soon discover have more to them than showing on the outside.The acting in the movie is solid. I usually don't expect much from new and coming actors and actresses that i have not heard about before, this was also the case for this movie. But the acting is really good, Michael Pitt and Louis Garrel really gives an above average performance, great to see that there are still new actors who can take over when the old ones will be gone. But the star of this movie is Eva Green, what a mysteriously and unique performance, and what a brilliant casting, she is unique, beautiful and most importantly interesting, erotic and challenging. Also i give props to all the three main characters for their brave and realistic portray of nudity and the complications of sex among unexperienced youngsters.As i said earlier this movie is very complex, it's hard to understand, and i could probably talk about it forever, but i got to stop somewhere. I think the movie is definetely worth watching, it's very artistic and does indeed stand on its own feet, it takes chances you don't see many movies take, and it's all done very well. On the negative side i think the movie sometimes get too complex and slow, but overall i don't regret seeing it, and i think that i will be seeing it again due to the complex story, it will probably bring me new thoughts when i see it next time.6/10"}, {"id": 166, "text": "THE DREAMERS (3 outta 5 stars) Interesting project by the renowned director Bernardo Bertolucci... dealing with the events of 1968 in France... a time of great social upheaval, as rioting students took to the streets to shut down the French government.

All three are obsessed by film (as many young people were in 1968... the glory days of the avant garde)... and also with the concept of breaking rules and societal taboos.

Now three decades later Bernardo returns to scene of his great triumphs to see if he can't turn one more cinematic trick.  His new film The Dreamers shouldhave had a lot going for it. What couldn't you do with a three way sexualencounter staged in Paris in the midst of May '68?  And the fact the story's three young `dreamers' are also cinema buffs should provide for an interesting twist or two, plot or otherwise.  But my God, what on Earth was the great Italiandirector thinking?  This movie is singularly awful.  Two hours of pointlesspretentious masturbatory (literally) drivel!  The film's underlying problem is not technical; it's not the acting, staging, or even the directing.  Some of the sets, like the kids' tent, are actually quite beautiful.  The problem of the movie isconceptual!  Bertolucci thirty years along has absolutely nothing original to say about people or politics, music or art, sex or life. Which is ironic given that the historical setting of The Dreamers is May '68, probably the greatest revolutionary moment of the past fifty years.  May '68 is the historical moment out of which the notion that the authority of the state had so ingrained itself into the conscious and unconscious discourse of the culture that our modern way of life, which prides itself on being `democratic and free, is now mired in a horrible situation of unfreedom.  More than anything else this modern state of unfreedom, this end of the `Enlightenment', has been THEproblem for critical thinkers of the past half-century.  But you won't find anything than more than a wisp of that historic problem here.  For the Dreamers May '68 is a time to remember the way we were, a sentimental education, in which thecharacters argue in the most uninteresting and almost banal terms aboutmovies and music (Hendrix was better than Clapton!), while exploring theiradolescent sexuality.  And I really didn't think it was possible to make sex seem so boring.  But there it is.

Sometimes they become casualties of the expectation generated by their reputations; a case in point the fiasco of Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Others creative juices have sadly run dry as with Woody Allen shamelessly reprising his shtick (Anything Else), without realizing just how irrelevant and out of touch he has become in his depiction of a young generation of which he clearly has little understanding.It's been a while since Berltolucci has made anything with any real impact. Longing for the fame and notoriety that came with Last Tango he chooses to return to Paris and to prove just how daring he still is in dealing with sexual taboos and on screen teenage nudity. It's genuinely pathetic. He is an artist gone bankrupt.Bertolucci was once capable of creating complex and compelling movies such as The Conformist and intense melodramas (La Luna - my personal favorite). It's inconceivable that he could turn out a film so completely bogus. There is not one frame that rings true. The screenplay is filled with the most appalling lines. It would take three far better young actors to make any sense of this garbage. That Michael Pitt almost gets by is in itself a miracle. Louis Garrell and Eva Green are totally inept. But the fault is hardly theirs.So much is wrong with The Dreamers that one hardly knows where to begin. The ridiculously spruced up Parisian streets look more like MGM back lot and even the costumes look silly. As far as characterization goes, well it simply non existent. There's not much acting either, just endless posturing.There is something very disturbing in the on screen nudity of the three young actors. The question of nudity or on screen sex is totally dependant on context. While a film like Ken Park is no example of fine cinema, one cannot argue that the sex and nudity is out of context. In the context of this non story peopled with non characters; watching the nudity one feels tainted in being coerced to participate in a dirty old man type of voyeurism.There is no redeeming feature to The Dreamers.

Director Bernardo Bertolucci attempts a (winking) correlation between cinema and real life, but a juxtaposition of the two might have been the more thoughtful approach (especially since reality to these children represents nothing more than facile desires).

The chaos in ordered family relationships mirrors the chaos on the streets outsides as France experiences the turbulent May 1968 days of the student revolt.As for Bertolucci, the phrase that comes to mind, in regard to him, is dirty old man.

The Isabelle/Mouchette comparison exposes how weak the use of these flashbacks really are. Mouchette is profoundly human, we rarely see more than her face or her hands. She seeks redemption, has inexplicable outbursts of anger, but also moments of spontaneous compassion. Isabelle is none of these things. But she isn't de-personalised enough to make this an apt antithetical comparison. It's lazy film-making, name-dropping for the sake of name-dropping.

His First Tango is as shocking as Last one \u0096 it received NC-17 rating for very open scenes of nudity, masturbation, sex, and the hints to incest. But it is not just about sex \u0096 it is about film itself. It was the time when Pauline Kael said, Bertolucci and Brando have altered the face of an art form. It was the time when a crowd in Chicago would line up under umbrellas on the sidewalk, waiting in the rain to get into the next screening of Godard's Weekend.

The Dreamers is Bertolucci's love letter to cinema, and his irony toward people taking it so seriously that the real world is ignored.When Matthew moves in with the twins, the result closely resembles Last Tango in Paris. Much of the film's second half occurs in that apartment, as insular as Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider's more than thirty years ago. Flirting becomes passion becomes dark and dangerous games to see how far someone will go. The difference is that the kids of The Dreamers are not as complicated and interesting as Paul or Jeanne (especially Paul, one of the greatest performances by genius Brando).With this wistful ode to sex, cinema, and the heated atmosphere of the '60s, Bertolucci has proved that he is still on the top of his game.

In fact, the three bear all in this content-less, mind-numbing film about the sixties counterculture in Paris.Reading official critics' reviews of the piece, I was expecting a fascinating, dreamlike portrayal of the era with deep emotions running through intelligent political discussion, passionate love-making, and heart-warming growth of relationships.What I got out of the film was much to the contrary. All political discussion is pointless (the main character's answer to the Vietnam War is that soldiers should listen to Jimmy Hendrix, not Clapton). Fabulous. The intimate scenes were so un-poetic that they were not even gratuitous - but meaningless. There was no passion, no anticipation, no emotion - it was like cupboard doors swinging against the pantry walls in every love scene- which were shot seemingly for shock value alone (My goodness! those people are nude!). And furthermore, there is no character development. You are thrown into a movie where the main characters divulge into sex and we are given no real explanation nor desire to watch any of those scenes.In the end, Dreamers is like a bad horror movie sequel that is centered around showing the nude human form through incestuous and dysfunctional relationships. The story is weaker than weak, and the movie only exists for its controversial imagery. Definitely not a Mark Twain-worthy movie, where controversy meets poetry and the two yield a marvelous piece of artwork.No - in actuality, I just finished watching it for the first time and I have a sick taste in my mouth, and an odd feeling in my gut. With the unholy brother-sister romance, the would-be philosophies, and the abrupt conclusion clouding this film, I am left disgusted. Bored and unimpressed after the first third of the movie, I can't give it a higher rating than just that - 3/10.Better luck next time Bertolucci, but movie goers want content.As for Eva Green - I will now consider Heaven to be your first real movie, definitely not Dreamers..."}, {"id": 180, "text": "Dreamers is a film about an American exchange student in France who is caught up in the cinema of the time (1960's). He meets two French siblings who share his knowledge and passion for cinema. They wallow in their decadent and misguided lives while Paris is lashing out at the artistic community.Michael Pitt plays a look-alike Leonardo DiCaprio as the American exchange student (Matthew) in France. His awkwardness seems genuine for his age and feelings of separation as an American in Europe. Eva Green and Louis Garrel play Isabelle and Theo, the two French siblings. Their relationship is something of a disgusting oddity, where incestuous themes float throughout the film. Their openness (sexually, etc.) make be acceptable for the French, but is sure to make any American crawl. In fact, this film pushes the envelope with American audiences in some of the sexual portrayals, especially of Isabelle losing her virginity on a kitchen floor. Amongst the trio's intoxicated conversations, there is some insight and truth to be found, most particularly with Matthew. But his inadequacy keeps him subdued and timid most of the film. The ending is probably the only time at which he appears to take a side or stand up for himself, although it's evident early in the film that his perspective on life is different from majority.I asked myself at the end of the film what the point was. Other than showing the interactions of a bunch of young people in odd scenarios, I was unsure of the purpose. If think it did a good job of making me feel like I was actually witnessing the three main characters' lives. It even took me back at times to how young I once was. But ultimately, the genesis of the film has a stranger meeting two locals, becoming an intimate part of the lives, and then fading back into the crowd to become a stranger again. Their very youth must be what the director was trying to impart with the title. Although, I saw less dreaming and more chaos of a bunch of insecure individuals living on apartmental island in Paris. 4/10"}, {"id": 181, "text": "It's really fascinating to see that this kind of movies are possible - we just follow the three dreamers around, there's no actual storyline, there's no heroes and villains, there's no drama or car chases or whatever, and yet i never felt bored. On the contrary - i felt more immersed and thrilled than almost ever. Thank you senor Bertollucci.This film has everything it takes to grab me immediately and make me watch it numerous times afterwords. There's Paris amidst my favorite time in history - the late 60's (the time for Change). The actors are really great too, especially Michael Pitt and even above him Eva Green. The numerous homages to the great classics, I find the Bande a part segment to be the best. The cinematography is very atmospheric and really right in its mood. And the thing that thrills me the most is the representation of sex, it's sincerity and the way it's photographed and orchestrated.I don't know if it's offensive or not. I don't find it dirty or distasteful. Actually the relationship between the three lead characters seems really natural and pure, even though two of them are brother and sister. When sex finally happen, it seems as the most logical thing. Eva Green is gorgeous as Isabelle. Sometimes she looks very sweet and vulnerable and sometimes she is very cocky and self-confident. I find her Isabelle the richest of the characters and the most realistic one. I like Michael Pitt too, but Louis Garrel is not on the same level or at least i find him not really likable(not only his character in the film). As a whole it's really a non-conformist relationship between the three of them. I mean it's free of any constrains and role-playing and the whole men-women usual relationship pattern. Free Love - The Spirit of the 60's.For those who are easily insulted by nudity - avoid this film. Personally i find it kind of refreshing. Not that i'm dying for it, but i really don't understand why is that in mainstream cinema male nudity is really a rare case. I was quite shocked when a saw Michael Pitt's penis but afterwords i asked myself why is that. After all it's a perfectly normal thing. That's what i meant when i said that sex is presented really sincerely. There was no Nine and a half Weeks kind of crap. Just perfectly normal sex. And it helped. It felt refreshing and liberating. You can't say it's like in the movies.As a whole the film also felt really liberating. You should watch it with an open mind. But if you are one of those conservative and narrow-minded viewers who would see it only to be able to criticize it later, don't bother."}, {"id": 182, "text": "A claustrophobic study of sexual and cinematic obsession, Gilbert Adair's novel The Holy Innocents seems tailor-made for a film by Bernardo Bertolucci. I mean, it has everything - androgyny, incest, bisexuality, Maoist revolution and old movies. It even has a bit of anal sex, which was so memorably brought to the screen by Bertolucci in Last Tango in Paris.So we go in expecting a classic Bertolucci film - no, not prettified schmaltz like Stealing Beauty or Little Buddha, but the real thing! What do we get? A bland and vacuous teen romance with just a hint of polymorphous perversity round the edges. As if, some time back in the 80s, Brat Pack auteur John Hughes had said to Andrew McCarthy and Molly Ringwald - Hey, kids! Let's go to Paris and make a REAL DIRTY movie! Neat, huh?Working hand in hand with author Adair, Bertolucci has systematically stripped his story of everything that made it dark, dangerous and compelling in the first place. Gone is the incest between French nymphet Isabelle (Eva Green) and her brother Theo (Louis Garrel). Ditto the homosexual love between Theo and the naive American hero (Michael Pitt) Psychologically, The Dreamers is a study of a bisexual menage a trois. Physically, it shows almost nothing that couldn't happen at a Mormon church summer camp.As for the clips from old movies (Blonde Venus, Queen Christina, Top Hat) that punctuate the trio's cine-sexual games, their brilliance serves only to remind us just how mediocre a film-maker Bertolucci has become. Almost uniquely among his oeuvre, The Dreamers doesn't even LOOK gorgeous! Back in the 70s, Bertolucci used to buoy up his fragile talent with cameraman Vittorio Storaro, designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti. They're both gone now, and it's not a pretty sight.Similarly, he used to populate his films with gorgeous otherworldly beings like Dominique Sanda, Pierre Clementi, Stefania Sandrelli. As for the pretty young leads in The Dreamers, they have almost enough talent and charisma for a VERY short role in a sequel to some teen slasher movie. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID IN PARIS LAST SUMMER!! But frankly, I just don't care."}, {"id": 183, "text": "The year 1968 is generally considered as the tumultuous apex of the turbulent 1960s. It was a time of intense experimentation and cultural change. In The Dreamers, set in Paris in 1968, Director Bernardo Bertolucci recreates this era from the perspective of three fictional young people: Matthew (Michael Pitt), Isabelle (Eva Green), and Theo (Louis Garrel).Matthew is the protagonist, a rather innocent and naive American university student who has come to Paris to study French (though in the film he rarely speaks any French). Tutored by the presumably more worldly Isabelle and Theo, Matthew learns about sex and intimacy, after he moves in with the two. He also learns that a first impression can be deceiving. And as the plot twists and turns, Matthew is the one who does the tutoring.The Dreamers is mostly a character study of these three people, isolated for most of the plot in the apartment of Isabelle and Theo. Politics is merely a backdrop to their personal stories. The three talk poetry and politics; they tease each other with sex games; in one of their few excursions outside the apartment they run through the Louvre Museum; but mostly they explore intimacy within the context of the 1960s' sexual revolution.The film's overall tone varies from romantic and erotic to intellectual and angry. And the ending is at one point humorous, but mostly it is poignant.Most of the cinematography is in color. But old B&amp;W film clips are scattered throughout the film, as the three young people have a fascination with cinema history. The film clips and references to them in the script's dialogue places the story in a proper historical context. Indoor camera shots are in real rooms, not built sets, which makes the story more realistic and textured.The film's casting and acting are quite adequate. There is no actual score. Background music runs the gamut from 60s pop songs of Janice Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Bob Dylan to more traditional 1940s and 50s songs.Viewers' response to this film will depend largely on their perception of the 1960s' sexual revolution, and on the degree to which they like Matthew, Isabelle, and Theo. Although The Dreamers may have limited thematic value, I found it mildly entertaining and worthy of a mildly positive recommendation."}, {"id": 184, "text": "The Dreamers, Bernardo Bertolucci's NC-17 rated movie about sex, riots and film in 1968 Paris is a meaningful and worthwhile film. In fact, parts of it are so good that when it loses a lot of steam in the second hour, it hurts. Matthew (Michael Pitt, from Bully and Hedwig and the Angry Inch) is an American student in Paris, a film-lover at a time and place where being one (and seeing films by controversial New Wave directors like Jean-Luc Godard) was actually a political and revolutionary gesture. He meets attractive French twins Isabelle (Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel) who are also young and have similar interests. Matthew is staying in a hotel but his new friends Isabelle and Theo invite him to stay in their large house while their parents are away. In this house over the next few weeks, with a student riot brewing in the streets outside, the three of them engage in various sexual games with one another, pushing each other further and further. Matthew is highly put off at first by the creepy, nearly-sexual intimacy between the twins, but at a time in history where ANYTHING outside of the norm feels like a revolutionary gesture, he is swept along, exhilarated by any opportunity to push the boundaries. The first hour of The Dreamers is excellent. The period detail, soundtrack (including lots of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin), cinematography, acting...all is nearly perfect. So it's a shame when it becomes repetitive and flat for much of the second half. Unlike a lot of reviewers, I don't have any problems with Michael Pitt's performance. I think he portrays the initially blank, impressionable Matthew quite well. The film is pretentious and sometimes slow-going in that second hour, but when it works, it's gripping and damn good. A story of three students, emotionally adrift at a time of swift social change, eagerly pushing cultural and sexual boundaries but perhaps unprepared for the consequences, this is not a story you get at the movies very often. One thing is for sure, it's for adults only. The NC-17 rating is well-earned, and the sex scenes here will take all but the most mentally prepared art film aficionados quickly out of their comfort zone.It's disappointing in the end, but has enough powerful moments to be well worth taking notice of."}, {"id": 185, "text": "The Dreamers, a name to signify that the dreams are different from reality. Agreed well and also that this movie is cohesive cozy and captive film making (for....). But I wonder the need.The movie is a complete alternative of p*rn but still the director has descended it in the mainstream cinema. Well and good for the crew. Now many prestigious critics and portals praised the film for its great cinematic and directorial technicality, which anyone can do if he understand the technicality. But the thought that captures me is what was the point of making something different.Whenever one wishes to say 'hello' he will usually wave his hand or shake but what if he says 'hello' with one hand over 'his @' and other hand making a puppet face of any animal like a Deer. The thing is why wasn't some other alternative script chosen as a theme for the actual moral. This film depicts extremely filthy sections of a dirty mind which I think has lost its creativity. Whenever something different is to be done, being a responsible artist, it should be done in such a way that it can elevate the mental virtues and ideas of the viewer rather than just hypnotizing him in fantasy of life and logics too.Can't judge the film myself, didn't appreciate the movie at all, but just wonder.

The American and the siblings get along famously, and next thing you know, the American has moved in with him, getting into some rather interesting situations. This whole thing takes place in Paris in 1968, during a protest of the Cinematheque Francais and the catastrophic general strike that followed it. All of which Bertolucci replicates beautifully in the film. The cast, which is led by Michael Pitt in a role originally thought for Leonardo DiCaprio and Jake Gyllenhal. Yeah, right.. Dream on. Let me tell you one thing, this movie wouldn't be half the movie it is without the risks Michael Pitt takes in this. He's laying it all out (literally) in the movie for us to see. His sometimes tricky relationship with the two Frenchies and his quest to understand them is sometimes painful to watch, and Pitt is quite surprisingly excellent in the role, the two French actors playing the siblings, Louis Garrel and Eva Green, are quite believable as the siblings, and their relationship with each other is quite detailed in this. OK, as you can tell, I have tried not to reveal, you know, the naughty bits about the movie.. (eg, this film GLORIFIES INCEST! IT HAS MALE NUDE SCENES!) There. I've covered the topic.

This film is a prime example. Innocence corrupted? No way. In spite of Pitt's wide blue eyes and bee-stung lips, his character is probably more corrupt from the beginning than that of either of his friends, given that he takes advantage of them relentlessly and plays into their weaknesses with relish.As I have not read the novel on which the film is based, I can only guess something vital that might have redeemed the film version is missing. Nothing seems fully developed or believable. Rien de rien. Perhaps dreaming is mere nostalgia on the part of the film's creators for all those things they wish they had done, or done better, in 1968. I can certainly identify with that.Incidentally, I viewed a cut that was definitely NC-17 and found its sexual bits as pandering and dull as those in Tango. Maybe what would be really cool is a porn flick with a dramatic punch rather than this kind of melodrama that minces and teases around the edges of porn.Half a mark for production values."}, {"id": 189, "text": "The first ten minutes of THE DREAMERS is extraordinarily compelling for anyone who experienced the Langlois era and the peak years of his Cinemath\u00e8que - Who but the French would put a cinema in a palace?, the spectacle of today's sixty year old Jean Pierre L\u00e9aud throwing leaflets that fall forty year back in stock footage, the information that Marcel Carn\u00e9 is in the crowd or a line of May '68 gendarmes beating the stuffing out of film buffs.This was a time when movies mattered, at least to enough people to not leave you feeling isolated.Even here you can't help feeling they could have taken more trouble. Would it have been so hard to put back the ENFANT DU CARNIVAL poster that used to be visible through those doors? The film is pretty bad on film freaks (even calling them buffs rings false.) Serious Parisian movie enthusiasts were much more likely to get into a discussion about the merits if Domenic Paolella than match Chaplin and Buster Keaton.Even if those stencilled protestor agit-prop posters that fly postered the city have been replaced by graffiti obviously lettered by the art department, as films go however, accuracy is not really the shortfall. Good looking girls who can quote lines from your favourite movies actually exist only in movies (there's another one in THE MAJESTIC) but the team have picked up on the division between the enthusiasts in the front row of Le MacMahon come for the films and the couples in the back. The superficiality of the Marxist - movies axis of the day is remarked here for the first time.The real problem is that this is a terrible movie. Bertolucci got to be big time by getting people to take their clothes off in main stream features and he thinks the audience will be scandalised at the sight of menstrual blood, male sex organs and sperm. Too bad that we've already seen bodily fluids on screen and he would have too if he'd watched more movies than the familiar titles he clips for us here.You've got to worry when naked, well built young people are doing a variety of sex acts in the picture and you're starting to doze off. The cast, who have been selected on the basis that they can take get starkers and still remember the awful dialogue, do their best but even the genuine American sounds like someone for whom English is not a first language.The romantic couple don't notice a pile of rubbish the size of a tenement on the other side of the street till the camera pans to it. The disgusting looking black banana proves to be fresh and white inside. The filming is poor.  The revelation that we hope may finally emerge never does.

The Dreamers is a must see.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any."}, {"id": 191, "text": "The first time I saw this film, I really felt like it was made for me. You can probably understand why. First of all, Paris, May 1968, you know what goes down. Second, three people brought together by their love of film in the '60s. I was at the edge of my seat slack jawed. It's the kind of movie I wish everyone could appreciate and made me desperate to find someone to talk to that could understand this movie the same way I did.The story follows Michael Pitt though your identifying with him as a main character comes and goes. He is a young student studying for the year in Paris in 1968. He meets two fairly affluent twins, Theo and Isabelle, whose poet father and British mother are going away for a while. They meet at Cinematheque Francaise, which was the most important place at the time for film lovers. It's where Truffaut, Chabrol and Godard and others would come to discuss film. It was the essentially the birthplace of Cahiers Du Cinema. The first time we see Michael there, they are showing Sock Corridor and we get to see some of the key moments of one of Sam Fuller's greatest works.With their parents away, they invite Michael to move in with them. They are intrigued by his intellect and his encyclopedic knowledge of film. From there they live a life half in and half out of film constantly quoting and referring to films such as Breathless, Freaks, Blonde Venus and one of my all time favorites Mouchette while the director encourages them by switching from the three characters to the actual film footage seamlessly. In one amazing sequence, the trio reenacts the classic scene of Anna Karina and friends racing through the Louvre in Band of Outsiders. The three are determined to break the films record of nine minutes and 45 seconds. Bertolucci switches back and forth between the original Godard film and his recreation to dizzying effect. For fans of the film, it's titillating and decadent far beyond any of the sex the film (as well as director) is known for.Sex is a big part of the film as the twins try to be aloof, but are as ultimately affected as Michael. During one of their many film quizzes, Michael is drawn into having sex with Isabelle. Only when they're done does he realize that for all her freeness and sophistication, she was a virgin. It is one of the few moments when she is completely emotional and not playing a part as she cries in his arms.The twins themselves are trapped in what can best be described a Platonic incest. This is where Bertolucci starts mining in familiar areas. His exploration of sexuality and un-discussed areas of possibility have been a theme in most of his twenty or so films. I first remember being fascinated by Luna when I was a kid. I had been in love Jill Clayburgh for some, probably Oedipal reason. In that 1979 film, she has an affair with her teen son. While moody and erotic, the film was dealing with such a taboo subject; it seemed like know one knew how to describe it other than surreal. It really wasn't. It was very real only dealing with an area of sexuality in a mostly objective manner.The backdrop of the film is Paris in 1968. I've probably written too much about this already. The student over-population in Nanterre mixed with their isolation outside of Paris mixed with the boredom of being a student while the world was erupting lead to massive political upheaval. By May, the students and workers were together having brought the entire country to a standstill. It was the closest thing to revolution in Europe since the Spanish Revolution. The three characters in this film don't represent what was really happening in the streets and that is probably a good thing because a lot of the film's success is its hands off attitude towards politics. Mathew is smug in his bourgeois ideas of non-violence and his fear of collectivization. Theo is completely dogmatic in his ill-informed Mao-ism ignorant to the fact that he is from the bourgeois and has totally alienated himself from the street battles happening daily. Isabelle lives for her brother and is ultimately un-phased by the world outside of their apartment.Bertolucci, for me anyway, is sort of hit or miss. It's fascinating to me that a man that can make The Conformist and Last Tango In Paris could also make Besieged. It's hard to separate analysis and my deeper feelings about this movie. It's a love letter to May '68 and it's beautiful."}, {"id": 192, "text": "1968 was an important year in my life, and one of the most important in the 20th century history. I was 15 then, and I was living the events of that year with the intensity of a teenager. That was the year of the young people in West taking the streets in a fight against the post WWII establishment, a fight that failed momentarily, but led to the change in Europe history and institutions that is felt until today. That was the year Dubcek tried to reform Communism from inside in Prague - he failed too, but the Iron Curtain fell two decades later. America was fighting a war in Vietnam that much of the world opposed, this does not seem to have changed! Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King were assassinated that spring - it looks like half of the history of the 20th century was concentrated in one year. That was the time of the Beatles, of the hippies,  Jimmy Hendrix and Janis Joplin were at their finest hour. Looking back this was one of the best years of my life, and this is one reason for me to love this film. It is  a good film by itself I believe - it has sophistication in describing the relationship between the three young people, it makes important points about the relationship between cinema and life, between  the revolution in theory, or in the bedroom and the revolution in the street, between American and European cultures, between violence and pacifism. It is wonderfully acted, well developed, and with very little overhead.  It has a lot of cinema quotes from other movies, and at least one scene (the bathroom tube scene) that will surely become a quote for the decades to come. Thanks Bertolucci, for the best film about that amazing year and the young people of that time.

Utter garbage, disguised as art. I truly want the hours of my life wasted in that theater back.The film begins interestingly enough with the shared passion of film by French teens and their American interloper, Matthew. But somewhere along the line the movie trades that appreciation for a sadly lacking and twisted amalgam of liasons dangeroux and mindgames for dummies. This film insults your intelligence, presumes that disaffected teens in Vietnam era Europe have anything to say; and had the gall to bill itself as art. In the interest of balance, Michael Pitt is not a half bad actor. While his attempts at intense emotion were pained, his middle range was convincing. But that is not enough to redeem the picture. Please don't see this film."}, {"id": 194, "text": "(Possible spoilers ahead)Bernardo Bertolucci's latest work, The Dreamers, displays his brilliant knack at creating an enticing character study (and, like Last Tango in Paris, an underlying theme is that of American ideals vs. Parisian) and with the mis en scene skills of an artist not losing his touch. He tells the story- or less a story than an observation- of a young American named Matthew (Michael Pitt, proving he can pull off a lead performance), who is off in Paris to study, but is head over heels for cinema. He meets twins Theo and Isabelle (Louis Garrel and Eva Green), with free-spirited personalities who are also rabid cine-philes. Matthew is invited to stay in their house, where they live with their parents, and while they are off on vacation, the three get to know one another more, both with movies and with sex.The sex which is in the film is considerably more graphic than other films out now in theaters, but it's no more or less explicit or terrible than that in Last Tango. What's highly of interest is how Bertolucci films scenes involving release through the almighty orgasm- one scene, for example, in which Matthew has a 'forfeit' in a movie question and is to have sex with Isabelle, is handled (without sounding clich\u00e9) beautifully. There's a sense of realism in every sense, both in Matthew and Isabelle, and with Theo, who barely seems to mind as he cooks eggs. The end of the scene is a shocker, but not an absurd or offensive one- it'll certainly wake a viewer up, if they aren't already. There's a lot of talk besides the sex, but it is definitely not boring- and it holds minor parallels to modern times (staying indoors and inside the escapist wonderland while there is real danger in the outside).Along with the characters- who are delivered vividly by the three leads (who call back to the French films they mention, like the wonderful Band of Outsiders or Jules and Jim)- there's Bertolucci, who interweaves their situation inside an apartment through most of the film with that of the riots of 1968 in Paris (involving films and/or communism) and with other films, like Breathless, Scarface, and even Top Hat. And, as I mentioned, the camera work is, basically, without a flaw - with Fabio Chianchetti by his side, Bertolucci captures his actors in shots that are psychologically perfected. His sensibilities with the techniques are in the mind-set of a new-wave filmmaker (since, of course, he came out of that era), but since it's a nostalgia piece it gains a higher level. There are a number of ways Bertolucci could've made The Dreamers boring, but none of them happen. Add a soundtrack that pulses with the times (if you like classic rock you'll love it), and it's an impressive feat. And what a fine opening, by the way."}, {"id": 195, "text": "If you're not shocked to see an anesthetized audience of young people watching Sam Fuller's 1963 `Shock Corridor' during the student revolts of 1968, then you may understand why Bernardo Bertolucci's (`Last Tango in Paris') `The Dreamers' is no shock despite it NC-17 rating. The students of this film are voyeurs looking for the ultimate experience: playing in a cinematic reality of their own making. Until that moment they mimic old movies like ghosts inhabiting a faded whorehouse: not much going on, not very sexy, not very interesting except for their guessing lines from movies while dropping trash around the house, getting trashed, and getting it on.Matthew (Michael Pitt), a na\u00efve American film freak with an annoying resemblance to Leo DiCaprio, meets at the Paris Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que a brother and sister, darkly sensual Isabelle (Eva Green) and darkly sensual Theo (Louis Garrell), both film buffs who sleep together in the buff. Not surprisingly the three share a case of cinephilia interruptus where the unreal images of Marlene Dietrich in her gorilla dance of `Blonde Venus' lead to a very long scene of autoeroticism in front of her famous `Blue Angel' photo and a kitchen coupling between Matthew and Isabelle overshadowed by Theo loving a frying pan of eggs.Around this detached self-love swirls the revolution, real action by contrast, reminding me that Benjamin in `The Graduate' (1967) was also out of the activist loop and becoming a slave to sexuality. Like Mike Nichols, this director can edit with the best of them: Nichols has Benjamin imaginatively springing between pool and bed; Bertolucci has his three lovers running through the Louvre while he intercuts three characters from `Bande a parte' (1964) doing exactly that. Yet it's not all the director's expert cutting or the characters' pretentious imitating.  When Isabelle and Matt do some heavy kissing in a theatre, `The Girl Can't help It' is playing on the screen-Bertolucci has a sense of humor.When mom and dad return to find the three asleep in the same bed, the illusion is essentially over.  However the multiple cuts to Mao-related kitsch throughout `The Dreamers' point out another revolution besides the sexual to which our characters can commit. Edith Piaf singing Non, Je ne regrette rien lets us know there will be no regrets.  Listening to Matt and Theo argue the merits of Chaplin over Keaton, I regret there is too little of this wit and too much dreaming."}, {"id": 196, "text": "In 67-68 there was a day I will always recall. In the morning, I encountered a professor to whom I had submitted a paper. He started off by telling me that it was psychotic. He then explained that he meant that as a compliment. People are either psychotic or neurotic, he explained and the only worthwhile things come from the psychotic, even though the best come from the other.That if you were neurotic, life wouldn't be worth living, so one might as well kill himself, as he then contemplated. But only a psychotic would do so.That same evening I had an argument about then popular music, much like some of these depicted here. One fellow was enchanted by the perfection of the Byrds' 'Tambourine Man.' Another was blown away by the ambition of The Doors' 'Light My Fire.' The latter was a failure, but a spectacular attempt at godhood. And yes, Hendricks versus Eric, John/George, Janis/everyone else, Miles/Ellington and so on.The next day, there were riots. More intelligently motivated than those in Paris, but silly and deadly all the same. I've since developed a more folded cosmology, but I still often run into these dichotomies and am convinced that the only people who consider them important are those trapped on the dead side, the neurotic.That's what we have here, a neurotic obsessed with psychosis. The levels are: a filmmaker imagines himself as a young man imagining he is an old man making a movie about his youth in which he imagines the world in the form of twins. Each level reams the next, pulling from the films he feels reflect the sort of artistic psychosis he yearns for. Each potential breach is virginal.And the other way around, films as dreams too. The best part of this is when the poet returns and finds the three nude, expensively drunk, entwined. They are careful not to wake the dreams and tiptoe out, leaving a 'poem' to keep them going.It is no surprise that he was able to do this with interest when he was able to rely on that master, Brando. And no surprise that he fails here.Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements."}, {"id": 197, "text": "Self-indulgent, fascile, meaningless..... That just about sums up this movie. I think it was attempting to be profound, but succeeded in being as I have already described it. It is about three teens who become involved in the Paris riots of 1968. That is a great story and the acting is not bad. However, It just did not work at the deeper level. I did not identify with the characters and most of the time I just found them silly and pointless. I also think we were supposed to be shocked by the naked scenes, but we've seen them all before, and if we've seen Baise Moi then we've seen much, much more. The three main actors were okay but nothing to write home about, these being, Louis Garrel, Michael Pitt and Eve Green. Anna Chancellor was a non-event. It was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci so it should have been better I suppose.I wanted to really like this filmm as I love the films from this era, Klute, etc. I also love the Piaf, Joplin and Hendrix soundtrack. However, whilst Fonda, et al, seemed as if they were really angry and attempting to say something, the actors in this film felt, to me, like spoilt kids from the 2000's who were part of the rave and drug scene. Self-indulgent sums it up."}, {"id": 198, "text": "Based on Gilbert Adair's novel The Holy Innocents, Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Dreamers' is a weird film about violence, sex &amp; incest relationships. As my summary says, this one caters to a niche audience.'The Dreamers' is a boring film, and it does want it to be. Bertolucci has made remarkable films, his work is truly amazing. but 'The Dreamers' is amongst his weak efforts, he does bring in a lot of SEX &amp; Nudity, but fails to leaves you awe-struck, which he mostly does in all of his films. Plus, due to the strong sexual content, it limits it's audience completely.Coming to the acting department, Eva Green steals the show with a fantastic performance. She's so natural, She's so much at ease from start to end. Michael Pitt is terrific. Louis Garrel is excellent, he matches up-to Green and Pitt in each frame.On the whole 'The Dreamers' disappoints, re-visit some other film from this prolific filmmaker!"}, {"id": 199, "text": "I watched this movie without really knowing what to expect. The previews were rather vaguely on what the story was about and what the movie its overall style was. I'll admit that the only reason that made me see this movie were the two actors Michael Pitt and Eva Green, who are two great young new rising stars.What I got to eventually see did not disappointed me. It's a greatly told and intriguing original story about three young film buffs, of which two are twins, in Paris who are drawn toward each other and start to develop an unusual relationship, of which the love for cinema forms the basis. The undertone of the movie is sensual and erotic. Often the images themselves say more than a thousand words. The story is told with mixed old movie classic footage, that the three of them try to impersonate. They breath, eat and think movies. Yes, the movie sounds definitely 'art house' like and it also is an art house movie but its way more accessible than I make it sound.Guess you still have to be a movie lover your self to appreciate the movie and its story and all of its art but then again I don't think that any 'normal' 'regular' movie watchers would decide to watch this movie in the first place. At least I can't think of any reason why. In essence it's a movie about movie lovers for movie lovers.The movie is beautifully directed and it chooses to tell its story really from the view point of the three main characters. It provides us a view in their lifestyle and helps us to understand them, without ever really literally explaining anything. Like I said before, often the images themselves say more than a thousand words. The style of directing gives the actors a lot of room and opportunity to shine. That also happens in this movie, for Michael Pitt, Eva Green, Louis Garrel all deliver a very powerful and heavy performance, plus the three of them work great and very naturally together, especially in the nude sequences.Yes, the movie is filled with lots of explicit nudity from the three main actors and I'm not just talking about a couple of chest shots. So be aware of that before watching this movie, if you know you can't handle it or feel uncomfortable with it. Big kudos to the three main actors for having the guts to appear in the movie that way. You want see anything like this in an Hollywood movie, I can assure you that. But the nudity in the movie also serves a purpose and it's used as a tool to tell the story with and show the bonding and relationship the three of them start to develop over the days.There are times that the movie goes a bit too over-the-top. After all, it remains an independent art house movie. It doesn't make all of the sequences work out as effective or understandable. Some moments make a redundant impression and other moments are not developed well enough, such as the homo-erotic references about the growing relationship between the two male main characters. I think it's a missed opportunity that this wasn't developed any further in the movie. It remains shallow and only features some vague references. It could had provided the movie and its main plot with some intriguing and original sensual layers.Visually the movie is great and it knows how to capture the mood and atmosphere of '60's Paris. The sets are nice and the cinematography effective.It's not really a that relevant or thought provoking movie to watch, so by no means its an essential viewing in my opinion but when you do decide to watch it, you most certainly will not be disappointed. The movie is definitely original and movie buffs will surely know to appreciate it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"}, {"id": 200, "text": "The release of The Dreamers was noisy, reviews focusing on parallel with Last Tango in Paris, the steamy love scenes, and the supposedly outrageous and nearly revolutionary side of it all.Does Michael Pitt try to mimic Leo de Caprio or is it just the fashion of his hair cut that gives the impression that Mr Titanic refused the part and the nearest lookalike had to fit? Brilliant soundtrack but hey it was not written by Bertolucci, just picked by him. And then of course Eva Green's birthday suit splashed all over your screen. Not that it's unpleasant to look at, but it does not turn this pretentious, pedantic film into a good one. Claiming - no less - to change your outlook on life forever, this ultra realistic work focuses on a game of the characters who live for and by cinema, and have the superficial and shallow approach to life that two characters, the father and the son also share... happily living a life of luxury where a poem is a petition and a petition is a poem while keeping away from the riots of 68 and indulging in pleasures that in themselves are in contradiction with the views they have on life and politics. A particularly successful image of what the film is and claims no to be. And this was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. Some of you may remember that name. Let me refresh your memory: he used to be a good director."}, {"id": 201, "text": "Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers is a gorgeously filmed ode to cinema that captures the pulse of Paris in the late 1960s, its bravery and idealism as well as its ambiguities. Based on The Holy Innocents, a novel by Gilbert Adair, The Dreamers joyously recreates the time of burgeoning student political awareness, sexual liberation, and heightened interest in world cinema. Interspersing clips from films such as Shock Corridor, Freaks, Breathless, Top Hat, and Mouchette with movie scenes reenacted by the characters, Bertolucci conveys a passion for cinema that allows a new generation to experience the glory days of the movies and the feeling of revolution in the air. Bertolucci is not intimidated by taboos and there is a lot of simulated sex and full frontal nudity that has resulted in an NC-17 rating but, beyond the squirm factor, none of it seems very shocking anymore. The film begins as a large protest is gathering over the firing of Henri Langlois as director of Cinematheque Francaise by Minister of Culture Andre Malraux. During the protest, Matthew (Michael Pitt), a blond twenty-year old Californian studying in Paris meets twins Theo (Louis Garrel), a young French student and his sister Isabelle (Eva Green). Isabelle, wearing a red beret, has chained herself to the Cinematheque gate but it is soon apparent that she is only playing at protest. Theo and Isabelle invite Matthew home to meet their father, a famous poet and mother, a British intellectual. When the parents go on vacation, Matthew moves from his hotel to share their elegant Paris apartment and the group embarks on a voyage of self-discovery that includes every variety of experimentation you can imagine and even some you cannot.Most of the film takes place inside the apartment. They drink vintage wine, smoke herbs, talk about revolution, have sex, talk about movies, then have more sex, all to an ingratiating soundtrack featuring artists such as Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and The Doors. The twins, who Matthew discovers sleep together, express their erotic fixation, playing mind games seeking to discover who has the most knowledge of cinema with the loser having to undergo a forfeit, a form of sexual punishment. Theo and Isabelle play the role of sophisticate to na\u00efve Matthew. You Americans don't understand your own culture, Theo says to Matt. No wonder you never got the point of Jerry Lewis. Matthew is awed by his friends' seeming worldliness but is shocked when he discovers that, for all her posing, Isabelle is a virgin, a dreamer playing the role of sophisticate. There are scenes to warm the heart of every cinephile. In one exhilarating sequence, the three friends try to beat the record from Godard's Band of Outsiders by running through the Louvre. In another, Isabelle imitates the memory scene from Queen Christina as Bertolucci brings in the soundtrack. They argue the merits of great performers from the past such as Keaton and Chaplin, but for them cinema seems to be divorced from real life, and they appear unaware of the increasing politicization of the films of the French New Wave. Consistent with its title, The Dreamers is about young people who would rather dream than act. Afraid of being committed to anything outside of themselves, desperate to feel important, they are in love with the world in their head not the one outside their window. Theo talks about Mao and the Red Guard and is all for revolution except when it means taking some form of action. They try to exclude everything outside of their comfort zone, but life has a way of objecting. It is only when the world intrudes in the form of a political demonstration that comes crashing through their window do they get a powerful wake up call that may just have saved their life."}, {"id": 202, "text": "In Paris for the spring of 1968, cute California exchange student Michael Pitt (as Matthew) meets magnetically sexy twins Eva Green and Louis Garrel (as Isabelle and Theo). The young threesome come together via their love for old movies, and mutual attractiveness. Call them sexy cinephiles. When the twins' parents take a month-long holiday, Mr. Pitt is invited to stay over. The trio discuss old movies, as director Bernardo Bertolucci expertly initiates star cameos with Garbo (as Queen Christina) and Ms. Green memorizing bedrooms. While well-stacked Green puts on a Big Brother record (an advance copy?), the guys debate Chaplin versus Keaton. Pitt picks Buster, while Mr. Garrel favors Charlie. They run Godard's Bande a part (1964).The three drink a lot of wine and walk sexily around the house, undressing, while student protesters gather outside\u0085 Mr. Bertolucci's visually beautiful film misses the mark in a couple of crucial areas. The Parisian place is perfect, but the 1968 appearance isn't; led by Pitt's long-in-the-front modern hairstyle and Green's untimely make-up, the players never really look like they have much to do with the heavily evoked setting. You can't dig it. Only Garrel looks like he could've been there. With supplies so low on bell bottoms, chain belts, and Nehru jackets, The Dreamers should have used a more modern setting; but, looks aren't everything. Most importantly not too groovy was the decision to cut writer Gilbert Adair's sexual experimenting between Pitt and Garrel, while leaving in the tease; this is the critical blow, and it hurts the intertwined trio's relationship considerably.****** The Dreamers (9/1/03) Bernardo Bertolucci ~ Michael Pitt, Eva Green, Louis Garrel, Robin Renucci"}, {"id": 203, "text": "Movies such as The Last Emperor, The Conformist or Last Tango in Paris have remained as classics of contemporary European cinema. Although it may seem too soon to declare The Dreamers as a classic, it contains enough credits to assume that it will possibly stay in the mind and heart of contemporary audiences. What seems most interesting in this movie is the fact that you can tell it's a Bertolucci's movie. Through characters, situations, use of music, shots, photography and - most of all - the main thematic concerns, this movie is part of Bertolucci's universe. The story sets in Paris in the agitated days of the Cultural Revolution and talks about the intellectual and emotional relation between a couple of twins and a young American, the three of them being movie buffs. The movie reminds some other movies by Bertolucci, specially Luna, in which he also tells a story of incest. I wouldn't recommend this movie to very sensible audiences since it is sexually explicit and too aggressive for conservative minds. Movie fans, however, will love it. There are plenty of references to great cinema classics that will drive movie goers crazy. Bertolucci's followers will be the most satisfied since it offers opportunities to relate it to his previous movies. The DVD version contains a most interesting making-off, with interviews and comments from the producer, technicians, actors and Bertolucci himself."}, {"id": 204, "text": "The Dreamers explores a confluence of history and aesthetics in the summer of 1968 that came together in the sexual revolution.  For us in the States we may think of politics and music at that moment, but Bernardo Bertolucci posits that in Paris it was politics and film, that when the cineastes who usually spent their hours isolated in the dark watching old American and New Wave films ventured out together to protest the firing of the head of the Cinemateque, it sparked a revolution in the streets. This backdrop is symbolically narrowed down to focus on one hothouse household.  Two college student siblings of intellectual parents spend most of their time at the Cinemateque, where they pick up an American in Paris, Michael Pitt as the naive student Matthew.  First they act out their shared love of movies, and I didn't get many of the Godard or other French movie references and even the American movie references were pretty obscure.  But when the parents leave the kids' alone, they stop even going to the movies and the increasingly isolated threesome breaks down the barriers between fantasy and reality, between the voyeurism of watching the movies and the Kesey-ianness of being in their own movie, before the real world intrudes again, literally through their window. The siblings announce that they need Matthew to get past a boundary they can't do together -- explore their sexuality, though they've sure come close, or perhaps to reenact Jules and Jim.  What's amusing is ultimately how coy Bertolucci actually is about sex (and somehow I haven't seen Last Tango in Paris for comparison).  While the beauteous and bodacious Eva Green prances around nude so much that it took me awhile to realize that one scene was making the point her Isabelle was a virgin, except for one very effective full frontal male nudity close-up, the males are actually allowed to be quite modest in front of the camera.  Stressing the men's heterosexuality, there's only two tiny whiffs, hinted in a brief camera angle, of potential homo-erotica within a three-some.  Pitt said in an interview that he realized he was embarrassed in front of the camera crew in one scene in strategically placing his towel, but Bertolucci didn't re-shoot that as he doubtless would have with Green.  There is one nicely sexy after-play in Matthew's slinky appreciation of Isabelle's body, but she doesn't really interact with him, which makes it less erotic and helps to shake him into reality. That leads to his trenchant denunciation of the pair that sums up the movie as well, but the film swiftly swings into symbolic territory again.  I'll have to presume that the parents' reaction to the wreckage of their doings is saying something about French society at the time that I don't get as the siblings' wake up to the revolution outside. All in all, Bertolucci's movie of repressed and uncommunicated desire Besieged  was more erotic without an NC-17 rating."}, {"id": 205, "text": "This is a fantastic movie for cinephiles, and if you didn't know it was directed by Bertolucci you would think it was the work of some young turk eager to impress. The references to movies of the past are many, and it is to Bertolucci's credit that he gives a nod to some of the great directors of the French Nouvelle Vague, Truffaut and Godard in particular. The movie begins with the protests over the sacking of the head of the Cinemateque, and there is Jean-Pierre Leaud playing himself but 35 years later. You are introduced to the eternal love triangle Truffaut was so fond of in movies like Jules et Jim and Silken Skin. The three main characters - Matthew, the American, is De Caprio, Theo is Belmondo and Isabelle is Anna Karina. The story revolves around the inability of Theo and Isabelle to break away from their incestuous relationship, excused by, they say, the fact that they were conjoined twins. You are left asking whether they are, Bertolucci continuously alludes to the matching marks on their upper arms, or to the fact that they do not appear to be. Theo and Isabelle are truelly dislikable, vain and self-obsessed, and as Matthew is increasingly drawn into their world you pity him for his inability to stand up against their pompous self-importance instilled in them by their parents liberal intellectualism. Including the clips of movies is as much for the name-that-movie parlour game addicts as is including the sixties sound track, but they do strengthen the direction the movie follows as all three characters main point of reference is movie history. Excellent little vignettes concerning such things as who is the greatest clown? Chaplin or Keaton, are included. And Theo's assertion that the Chinese revolution is just like a movie is shot down in flames by Matthew - these soldiers have but one book and seem to be nothing more than extras on a film set. The sex, although fairly strong, is never gratuitous, and is seen more as a way for Isabelle to break free from the relationship she has with her brother. The ersatz revolutionary Theo plays out the revolution in his head while drinking red wine and talking movies. In the end Matthew begins to see him and Isabelle for what they really are, vainglorious do-nothings. When Matthew argues with them that violence is not the way forward as they man the baracades, Isabelle has to choose between the two of them, and chooses her brother, yet you are still left with the feeling that this is merely a badge of honour for the pseudo communists.Whiffs of Band a Part, Les Enfants Terrible, even Repulsion are there. This is a fantastic movie, and all credit to Bertolucci for giving us an insight into the movies and time that made him the director he was and is."}, {"id": 206, "text": "Translation: big stinkbomb.This movie is best described as pseudo-intellectual and pseudo-erotic crapola. Set in Paris in 1968, it is the story of an American exchange student who gets into a love affair with an eccentric brother and sister at the time of the Free Speech Riots. Although the main characters are all supposed to be passionate film buffs, The Dreamers gives no hint of the kind of intellectual or artistic movement that was behind the unrest of 1968. This is really just an incongruous backdrop. The main characters like to recite movie lines and ask each other trivia questions, but that is the extent of what we learn about their passion for film. So, that is the pseudo-intellectual part.When I say pseudo-erotic, I guess it is a matter of opinion. The French brother and sister have an incestuous love going on that is the movie's real focus. If incest is an exciting concept to you, then this film may strike you as highly erotic. The starlet is naked throughout the entire film, too, and that's erotic to most people who are into girls. However, for me it went no farther than any old skin flick. To sum it up, The Dreamers is like a bad imitation of The Unbearable Lightness of Being: an attempt to make the same kind of sexy love story set in the backdrop of political unrest. Unlike the earlier film, nothing of substance happens to the characters in The Dreamers, so it is just a whole lot less engaging."}, {"id": 207, "text": "Why don't they make original movies anymore? Finally, the movie about incest we've all been waiting for! Sure the world and film have become mechanical, and when anything different shows up we call it art, and are relieved. Just as the rarity of diamonds bestows them their value, originality and anything daring gets an applause. Still, you don't see the culinaries of France suddenly turning to cannibalism. What a stupid movie.In short, I hate this movie so much I can't even comment on it. A political message? More like, Bertolucci is so down and out that he needs to find young actors to exploit and get attention, because nobody is interested. One can only hope that these potentially talented people don't end up with the same fate that struck the heroine of Last Tango, which for years later children threw blobs of butter at in the street in mockery, whenever they saw that poor actress who once dreamed of greatness but instead got bathed in dripping wads of cholesterol buy cruel little children-herods. Last tango, was also deemed a masterpiece, but its just a porno too.And oh yeah, this is supposed to be about the sixties and revolutions. Notice the use of Jimmy Hendrix in the trailer, and the black turtle necks. What a degrading experience it was to see this. Just because its different (not Ben Affleck) don't believe its art.

In 1968 Paris, intriguing film buff twins Theo and Isabelle meet fellow movie fanatic and somewhat naive American exchange student Matthew at the Cinematheque Francaise and invite him to stay with them in their parents' apartment whilst the parents are away on holiday. Over the next few weeks, the twins open Matthew's eyes to a new, closeted, decadent way of life whilst Matthew forces Theo and Isabelle to examine their own shortcomings with a view to change. The Dreamers is one of those movies where nothing much really happens for long stretches but the film held my interest throughout and I did care about the three lead characters and what would become of them, something very much to the director's credit. The use of actual footage from old movies intercut with shots of the main characters acting out the same scenes was inspired and a joy to watch, particularly the run through the Louvre from Bande a Part. The only disappointing aspect of the film was the ending which I thought was too abrupt. I was also unconvinced by the decision of the twins at the end to join the rioters; it was a surprise to find that they cared so much or even at all. For the vast majority of the film Theo and Isabelle live with Matthew in a very isolated menage-a-trois, seemingly blissfully unconcerned about the unrest on the streets outside. That aside, this is an absorbing, well acted film, benefiting from a carefully chosen and very apt soundtrack, a good mixture of American rock of the period and French standards."}, {"id": 209, "text": "The history repeats itself? I don't believe it. It's rather that we, the people, repeat the mistakes of our ancestors. The film is a series of scenes charged with sexuality, drugs and egoistic love.

It's been many, many times that we tried to save the world by means of physical love, being the most familiar one to us all and the easiest one to get to it. However, this path has already been trodden. How many times so far and how many times it needs to be trodden yet? The path from the greatest union, i.e. physical love, to the biggest retreat form the man and mankind - fear, hatred, violence. As if the hatred would increase by the act of making love and release by real love. Each war is getting worse, and in consequence it leads only to the doom of civilization. In times of freedom the differences between people grow, while in war times they diminish - at least, or unfortunately, mostly due to the number of the dead. Thus, we build on the mistrust, on the humanity as a whole, we build on illness; we build on all that what in fact nobody wants. In other words, we pull down our world. The Creator made me big, humankind makes me small. I was created a man, not the humankind. I am a brick in his foundation, not in the global religion.

The friendship rapidly becomes deep and disturbing; the twins seemingly enjoying an incestuous relationship and Theo a bi-sexual disposition towards their new friend. But all is not quite as it appears. These seemingly sophisticated intellectuals live in a bizarre enclosed little world of their own, indulged by wealthy parents and more child-like than the American first assumes. In a film that is bursting with movie in-jokes and references,the trio join in protests at the Cinemateque, replicate the 'Louvre record' from BANDE A PARTE in a scene inter-cut with shots from the original movie and develop a parlour game of Name the film or pay the forfeit ,that soon stretches the bounds of taste and decency, once the parents have left for the country.The trio spend most of their time in the large rambling apartment, which begins as charmingly shabby-chic and descends into student-squat squalor, indulging in ever more lurid sexually charged games. Nudity increases as they become insular and the world outside becomes more distant in a way that evokes a cult film of this era,PERFORMANCE. But THE DREAMERS, being a 21st century film,goes further and among several intimate and unsettling scenes that many might find offensive, the trio take a candle-lit bath in a haze of 'exotic cigarette' smoke which lulls them into unconsciousness, to find on awakening that Isabelle has started her menstruation while they have been asleep...and the bathwater has turned red.If the subject matter is an acquired taste then without doubt the film looks wonderful. Paris in 1968 is lovingly recreated; the cars and backgrounds are right, the music includes Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Bob Dylan, there is much talk of Mao and revolution. The acting is very good, naturalistic and engaging. The leading trio all fit their rolls to perfection and Eva Green as the pretty, pouting, full-busted,long haired Isabelle is the perfect image (cliche?)of a freethinking 1960s femme fatale. THE DREAMERS is a significant movie for me. Watching it for the first time I became intrigued by the homage it paid to Jean-Luc Godard's BANDE A PART, a film of which I previously knew nothing. I sought out the DVD, was entranced by this great movie(and Anna Karina in particular!)and have been hooked on French New Wave movies ever since. Re-watching it two years later I 'get' more of the filmic references, the haunting use of the theme from PIERROT LE FOU and the cameo of Jean-Pierre Leaud among others, but most of all I am struck by how intimate and graphic the relationships are portrayed.

So father is a dreamer with his dreams flowing out of his pen- for him, poem is petition.Dreams being cut off from reality are always comforting and so the father withe his poetry.Dreamy poetry makes him a renowned poet. Isabella and Theo, twin brother and sister, in a living example of Yam and Yami the Indian mythological figure where sister Yami courts her brother Yam to acqisce to her yearning for physical relation with her,her argument being they were in coupulating position for nine months-are living a life which borders on general accepted standard of immorality as found by their American friendwho enters their lives.

Her brother, Theo, is also dreamer - dreamer of revolution which will come just by mental exercises like reading and discussion with her sisters and father, by quoting famous lines- a sort of mental masturbation which can be self fulfilling but can not be reproductive.

This is one dream which Mathew shares with Isabella and Theo. The Riots of Paris - students revolt, Molotov cocktails are also a part of larger dream cherished by the student community who without any ideologically organized movement are driven by dream of some kind of revolution they will usher in, which they themselves know not. Isabella after knowing that their relationship has become known to the parents and after failed suicide attempt joins her brother in Molotov cocktail ceremony who all of sudden realizing that to fulfill dreams in to reality requires some kind of action, goes out full throttle and makes himself a part of larger crowd of dreamers. Acting wise, Isabella tops them all as her role is quite difficult to play, involving interplay of innocence due to her under exposure of the world reality and on the other hand, an awakening especially the sexual one which comes by the ageing process. Dominating Greyish hue in the movie reinforces the dreamy ambiance of the house. A very good movie to watch but one should not expect much intellectual problematizing- after all dreams are void."}, {"id": 212, "text": "It is wonderful that people like Bertolucci can continue to make works of art in this magic medium called the cinema.That, in the midst of a nobrainer era, he continues to work is also magical.As someone who was living in Paris as a student and later as one of the many young copyeditors of the paper so importantly a part of the plots of Breathless and The Dreamers, let me first congratulate those of you reader reviewers who got the name right: It was the International Edition of the New York Herald Tribune, one of the many predecessors of the present International Herald Tribune, now fully owned and operated by The New York Times.Other than a faint link with the two names, there is absolutely no other connection between the two papers, though the IHT still runs Buchwald's very popular if corny version of Thanksgiving once a year, or did the last time i checked. Le jour de merci donnant, you can take it from there. And yes, Both Eva Green and Jean Seberg are Breathless.And yes, there are links between those two films that easily span the time differences.One small trivial point: The film got an indifferent press here in Paris... yes, i still live here ..... so i watched it on TPS television, a sort of Cinematheque times one hundred or one thousand if you can afford the monthly subscription cost. Not that expensive, really. It is just that you can never get time to watch all the films that are programmed.So when i turned it on, the American boy character was relieving himself in a sink and his facial closeup in the mirror, a Bertolucci trademark, grabbed me: What is Di Caprio doing in this film? Now, thanks to IMDb i found out just now that The Leonardo turned down the role. It is eery: I wonder if he knows he has a twin brother."}, {"id": 213, "text": "I just saw this movie and when i got out of the cinema i was thrilled, for me this movie is great, but i have my reasons.One could describe it just by saying: A french brother and sister couple meet an American boy in the middle of the Paris student movement and discover their sexuality...sounds kinda boring to me.But...First of all, it does not show Paris '68 as a full, it is not a documentary on the political movement of the time, but it shows how students where not just involved but they were captivated, by the movement, it is not just about being in the streets, it is a mental state. Shows the cultural differences on Americans (always pleasing and showing a nice attitude) and french (always fighting and being nihilists and argumentative) which is a very fun side. I have to say that the soundtrack is all about my taste, Janis Joplin, The Doors... wow.Acting is good, i cant say great but let me tell you that the story has a force in itself, all the sexual tension going around in every direction keeps your attention full time. The nude scenes are part of it but what goes around them and the way the twins play this strange games it's so interesting.As it is usual on Bertolucci's films photography is great and lighting functions very neat. Check out the scene in the bathtub and the 3piece-mirror.IT is a movie one should see as a document of an era, sexual libertine was part of what was set in movement in the sixties, it is a parallelism between political idealism and moral positions towards sexuality."}, {"id": 214, "text": "Anyone who has been moved - or who has at least conscientiously taken the trouble - to research 'Le Nouvelle Vague' must, quite simply, be forever in debt to Bertolucci's wonderful nostalgia-trip for the way films were, and the way film culture was for an historical moment.     For one of those not fortunate to have been in any sense intellectually or emotionally 'there' during the sixties, this meditation by one of those who were part of that ferment on the formative experiences of their early life (one must notice the injunction to the Matthew/Bertolucci character to recognise Mao Tze-tung as a great film director, and reflect how this would issue many years later in 'The last Emperor') acts like an implanted memory: Retrospectively, we find ourselves protesting at Henri Langlois' politically-motivated sacking from the Cinematheque, and see the image of the young Truffaut flickering from Jean Pierre Leaud's face to Truffaut's documented own and back again in a seamless transformation between the actor of Truffaut's alter ego, Antoine Doinel, and his great directorial and life mentor.   From then on, the New Wave rolls again as the film unfolds. It is a document of the spirit, and a love letter to the cinema which ignited the young Bertolucci. That there is such a commanding talent still working in film in today's shallow culture is a miracle. This is a film to convince audiences that statements of freedom should still be possible, and even to inspire honest and wholly original careers.    The complexity of this at once fresh and passionate and intensely intellectual experience is exhilerating, and not to be briefly summed-up: First one feels one must immediately renew one's acquaintance with so many great films of this movement - or get to know them for the first time, indeed.    It seems the New Wave is forever young! It is obviously designed to inspire a whole new generation of filmgoers with just the idealism that so entranced the young of the sixties, and led them to see the life-affirming, life-changing possibilities of film.    Here was an age when the mercurial surface of film seemed a portal to our innermost desires ..."}, {"id": 215, "text": "(some spoilers) It's not a masterpiece but it certainly is good. Quite good, actually. The theme behind the film revolves around the idea of the relationship of a person to the world and the place love has in that relationship. The presentation of the idea was pretty much standard: it began at the dinner table directly following the character introduction portion of the film. The topic there was that, from the macro point of view that God may have of the world, it is beautiful and orderly regardless of how chaotic it may seem on the inside. The main characters proceed to live in a fantasy world where everything is beautiful and there main focus is cinema and sexuality. But that eventually breaks down. The story articulates that people cannot see things through the eyes of God and chaos, pain and loss will always be part of your life. Any attempt at concerning one's self solely with art and love is terminal and will end with a return to the confusion of reality. The character Matthew foreshadowed this idea in the beginning when his voice-over said, as he and his newfound friends strolled lakeside, that he never wanted that evening to end. The whole philosophy of the film is expressed predictably but very nicely and is packaged in an attractive box of beautiful editing and cinematography and succeeded in subtly, almost as a light aside, putting art on a divine pedestal. I think there may be important commentary channeled through the history presented that I did not pick up on because I didn't live through the events to understand the nuances. And that would only add to the depth of the film. Although I feel Bertolucci is purposely making his films racy for the sake of shock and his own amusement, it was a very enjoyable movie to see (not the raciness; the movie). 8/10."}, {"id": 216, "text": "Here is an example of a film that Hollywood would not be able to make, artistically and poetically it oozes the European flavor of an independent film. Set in 1960's France during the French riots, a young American student is befriended by a brother and sister who happen to be Siamese twins. They are all linked by the common interest in old movies which they act out during outtakes of the actually films they are impersonating. It looks like Bernardo Bertolucci is paying an tribute to the by gone day of early film. This however is not the point of this film or is it? The story unfolds where by the young American is invited to join the twins at their home while their parents are away .Here they make their own rules as they experiment with their emotions and sexuality while playing a series of increasingly demanding mind games. The sexual content in this film will not appeal to everyone involving incest and long scenes of male and female nudity.To try and understand this film can be very confusing nor is it easy to see what Bernardo Bertolucci is trying to explore other than innocence and sexual freedom mingled together. He takes you for a ride that is slow and uneventful leaving you with a bitter sweet feeling of asking yourself what was the point of sitting through 2 hours of this film."}, {"id": 217, "text": "Bernardo Bertolucci's obsession with France and sex continues in his new film The Dreamers, not likely to make it to a theatre near you.  The film takes place in 1968 Paris and at press time, the director and the studio were not backing down from their final cut of the film, and therefore, The Dreamers will be released with the kiss of death NC-17 rating for its strong sexual content. The Dreamers follows the lives of three young adults with a love for cinema and a distinct and insatiable sexual appetite.  Louis Garrel and Eva Green play Theo and Isabelle, a brother and sister who meet American Mathew, played by Michael Pitt (Murder by Numbers).  Together, they embark on a sexual journey of borderline incest and peer pressure brought by various movie trivia games.  There is no denying that Bertolucci likes his sexual content.  Go through his filmography, and you will see film titles like Last Tango in Paris, Stealing Beauty and Il Conformista.  All may be films you have heard of or even seen, but their original cuts are harder to find this side of the Atlantic.  The Dreamers therefore, falls nicely into his niche.  After Mathew moves in with Theo and Isabelle, it is not long before we see the three engaging in voyeurism, and eventually explicit sexual acts. Bertolucci does not shy from the nudity, and audiences are subjected to every body part that can possibly be exposed, in full frame close ups for extended scenes.  There is not much meat to the overall story.  The three begin a journey that eventually leads to nowhere and with each group not learning or growing despite their exposure to each others ideals.  But I guess that was the point.  To show the differences between American and European views on sex, and the stubbornness of each culture to accept the norms or values of the other.Like Last Tango, The Dreamers does not have a huge supporting cast.  The characters spend almost all their time inside the Paris apartment vacated by their parents, telling stories, taking baths and drinking wine.  Lots of wine.  The act like children, and it is because of this that you may find it hard to connect with any of the characters.The Dreamers is mostly a forgettable film.  Although the cast does some charming work and the visuals are as stunning as any Bertolucci film, it is not a film that you will long remember once you leave the theatre, and although there is plenty of nudity, Bertolucci has a knack of throwing it at you so often that you become numb to the fact that the costume designer got a free ride.   It's hard to believe that this was the same director that swept through the Academy Awards with The Last Emperor 15 years ago.Michael Pitt is the lone standout and I suppose he thought The Dreamers would be for him what Stealing Beauty was for Liv Tyler, that being a talked about, but little seen title that must wait for late night cable before there is an audience.  For his sake, I hope that he is correct and his scenes are not for the internet x-rated sites alone."}, {"id": 218, "text": "The DreamersIt was the May and June of 1968 in France. Student uprisings were occurring in many countries, frequently in response to the U.S. war in VietNam, but in France the situation was more complex and more embracing. Amongst those taking to the streets were cinephiles, protesting over the way film was distributed and also its political content. French New Wave cinema was born, led by such people as Godard and Truffaut. Riots broke out and strikes ensued. Godard and Truffaut both received a beating in the mayhem and fights (which involved tear gas and Molotov cocktails).The film's story starts just before all this. A Californian youth (Matthew) meets up with two fellow film buffs (Theo and Isabelle, who are brother and sister) and they become close friends, united by youthful hedonism, a bohemian, revolutionary spirit, and a love of cinema that spills over into elaborate games and dares, testing each other's knowledge of movies. The film's elements include the developing sexual challenges between the three main characters, the atmosphere of political unrest and uprising, and a detailed questioning of various cinematic trends. A backdrop of some of the best sound recordings of the time (Hendrix, Pink Floyd, The Doors) uses analogous developments and confrontations in music, characteristic of that period. Director Bertolucci (of Last Tango in Paris), also pushes at the boundaries of censorship with the sexual themes and degree of full frontal nudity (censorship was a major issue in French cinema in the late sixties \u0096 today it is U.S. distributors that are complaining about the nudity in The Dreamers). There are also political dilemmas represented by the pacifist Matthew (who feels he has been lucky to dodge the draft) and the French siblings who preach love but allow their left-wing sympathies to not rule out violence. In an interesting debate about film, or viewing one's life as a film, Theo expresses admiration for Mao's red army and what a wonderful film that would make \u0096 but Matthew points out that in such a film \u0091everyone would be extras, no-one would be special'.The final mix in The Dreamers is a heady cocktail for serious film lovers, but not mainstream by any standards.

Or maybe I do not want to try, fearing that by analyzing I could spoil my love for this movie. A strong story, perfect atmosphere, great music and a very good feeling for details. The Dreamers is full of references to many famous movies and, as my movie experience grows with years, every time I watch it the experience is getting stronger. Eva Green is fantastic and it's hard to believe that this is her first movie role. I'd be lying if I said that her nudity and sex scenes had no influence, but mostly I was fascinated by her overall appearance and a powerful presence on the screen, and this fascination holds me for fifteen years.

That was a time of change in which culture was still strong enough to get people out to the streets to demonstrate. Beyond all this, Bertolucci focuses on how young people are discovering each other, with a capacity of wonder, freshness, intelligence, ingenuity, sensuality that adults usually do not have.\u00a0 The movie has that unmistakable flavor of the experience of youth which leaves its mark and is never forget.9,5/10"}, {"id": 222, "text": "This is clever stuff, but still a small film. I blame Bertollucci, whom I never liked.See what he does. The setting is '68 Paris at the grip of sex, film, and politics. The twins are really cool when we first meet them by the steps of the Cinematheque, feisty, flippant, casually magnetic personalities like the movie people of 60's Godard. We see them through the eyes of a shy American kid whom they open up to the world of sexual discovery, movie dreams conflated with nudity as freedom from convention.We soon find out the twins are into some pretty weird habits of it seems a sexual nature, which they shrug off as being 'connected' in mind. This is a ploy by Bertollucci. They are twins only so we can feel as uncomfortable as 'normal', conservative parents of the time felt about their hippie kids, their nakedness, promiscuity, and likely 'spiritual' endeavors.The love letter to cinema interspersed throughout in the form of excerpts from films is both parochial and grating, as usually it is in these films. Really, so far the film is mostly grating. It seems to flaunt itself, wanting you to feel provoked, think it edgy and cinema a wonderful escape from banality. Isn't this what Godard was all about? But, all of it serves another purpose, apparent in the end.The games, the movie and politics talk, the drinking of expensive wine and aimless hedonism, it's all, according to Bertollucci, the neurotic fantasy of a juvenile , sheltered imagination. It was stuff that took them through the night, like crawling into a tent you have pitched in your parents' living-room. In the end, it takes nothing short of a revolution crashing through their window to wake them up.But see, they have no reason to revolt, their parents are well off. They do what they do, because 'thinking' and 'loving', as alternatives pointed out to them by the kid to throwing a molotov cocktail, have become meaningless and suffocating by repetition. The only desirable course left is any action that can jolt you out of your slumber, which is why intellectuals so passionately commit to 'causes', Godard included - they realize only the doing of it purifies.This isn't a love letter to cinema and the era, folks. It is a scathing deconstruction, on par with Powell's Peeping Tom which is indirectly referenced during a nude bath before mirrors. It is small though, because of small insight for what is sacrificed. Bertollucci's excess is precocious prettiness, without real spontaneity, the blood smeared from the outside. I hate this stuff, old men making films about wild youth. It never feels genuine. I would trade Bertollucci's cautionary wisdom for the sincere superficiality of Gummo.And as far as multilayered counterculture narrative goes, you will have to go back to when the times were still pulsing with discord and confusion, the experience still fresh. Three films that capture both the giddiness and rupture of it, like Bertollucci aims to. Cammell+Roeg's Performance. And from Japan, Funeral Parade of Roses and Eros+Massacre. This has all the blood drawn out of it."}, {"id": 223, "text": "It was Peter Greenaway's film entitled 8 \u00bd Women in which he had his characters observe, whilst watching the Fellini film from whence the title took its inspiration, indeed ask, as to whether film-makers actually formulate works of art within the medium of cinema, or merely recreate their fantasies and put it all up there on screen when it comes to producing their latest piece. If the two slimy and shady, but disturbingly cultured in their own right, characters from said 1999 film in said scene were latching onto something then 2003's The Dreamers is a pure and unadulterated examples of Bernardo Bertolucci's fantasy made flesh; a fantasy splashed across the screen for all to observe. The film, about similarly cultured and European-based people whom are unable to control their sexual urges but do enjoy a good talk about high-art, is a quite infuriating and quietly grotesque piece about characters we either do not particularly like nor particularly pity flitting about in a hotbed of politics; love-making and cultural studies. The film unfolds in late 1960s Paris, a lone male American in Michael Pitt's Matthew is a child in a sweet shop; an exchange student living out in France with its capital city as his back garden venturing to and from anywhere he pleases. The scenario carries with it a sense of the fanciful, a lone young male old enough to be where he is by himself but most probably not yet really old enough to know any better; he's miles from home with nary an individual to keep an eye on him, his love for films quenched by a Parisian cinema showing everything that he likes and that sense of being caught up in something political or thoroughly important, what with numerous riots at the state's system, seemingly flanking him wherever he goes. Young Matthew's situation appears to get better before it even hints at getting any worse, even if he doesn't necessarily mind when everything comes off the rails around him, when he meets a stern-faced and quite adventurous young French woman named Isabelle, played by Eva Green in her screen debut. They meet through a battling of censorship or ill-advised government intervention when business linked to the cinema they all frequent faces some serious sanctions; Isabelle dragging him back to her home during which time he meets her brother Theo (Garrel) and the parents. Thence begins Matthew's ever excitement escalating, ever morally decaying Parisian misadventure with these people; people whom are typically French because they're cultured, frank in their attitudes to sex and nudity, philosophical and have the ability to garner frequent access to cheese-boards; thence begins Bernardo Bertolucci's fantasy of being a much younger man in a city such as Paris and into the sorts of things he's into; doing the sorts of things he's doing and meeting the sorts of people he's meeting. In an earlier draft of the screenplay, Theo may very well have been Isabelle's live-in lover; the manoeuvring of Matthew into a firmer relationship with her made easier by transforming him into a conjoined twin rendering everything a much less tasking exercise and allowing the disturbing nature of the frank relationship they all share to resonate more than it might. The three come to hang out with one another, bizarre games and challenges outside of the apartment lending equal time to indoor dares further-still leading onto some rather stark relations; their dialogue coming to form unrealistic exchanges more broadly linked to that of disagreements on certain film directors and accomplished musicians, unrealistic in the sense young adults with such immature attitudes to the world around them would be unable to engage in such conversations. Any statements here on young adults whom are seemingly yet to have completely move away from any adolescent tendencies still being of a 'smarter' ilk back in the day not ringing particularly true, contemporary garbage in the form of whatever you like not being around to pollute or distract them around or not. In the long run, the overwhelming sense of Pitt's character a nondescript template for a young man's dream to be pleasantly lost amidst a foreign culture; able to hold a conversation and having access to the sorts of people within the film, is simply too much to banish. This, with numerous and grating instances of the film's use of stock-footage as characters inexplicably speak of cinema; philosophy; Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma journals and various philosophical ideas whilst managing to worm in what appeared to be a mite of Andr\u00e9 Bazin's writing, not to mention a spin on a famous Sir Winston Churchill quote, is just annoying in its self-gratuity. The whole thing somewhat reeks of pomposity, its daring attitude in regards to its sexual content and frank nudity that ironically bare all but only serve to cover up most of its short-comings; its overall ambiance having it more often than not resemble barely much more than a series of lusty fabrications, the film's title may well be The Dreamers but the piece is mere fantasy."}, {"id": 224, "text": "Bertolucci picks a volatile time and place - Paris in the late sixties - and follows three young, bohemian and idealistic characters in its midst. There's a lot of potential for romantic and political intrigue. The problem is, these characters choose remain aloof to their milieu for almost the entire film, preferring to hole up in a labyrinthine apartment to pursue a unique brand of hedonism.The best scene of the film is when Matthew is first invited to dinner with the family. The political position of each of the characters becomes very clear, and Bertolucci subtly undercuts each of them, driving home the point of the film. But after that, the bulk of the plot revolves around the threesome's erotic diversions and petty jealousies, inter-cut with scenes of the street protests in a seemingly arbitrary fashion.The film deserves credit for a nostalgic portrayal of Paris in the sixties, as well as delightful camera-work, intimate and voyeuristic, peering around corner after corner in the apartment to find new eye candy for the viewer.Overall, however, the film fell short for me; it fails to properly situate its characters in their context, and deprives them of enough emotional depth to make their trysts more than surface entertainment. 6/10"}, {"id": 225, "text": "The Dreamers, based on a novel by Gilbert Adair, takes place in Paris in 1968, before and during the May-June upheavals, which culminated in a general strike of 10 million French workers.

He is caught up in French cinema and becomes entwined with twins, Eva Green (Casino Royale, Kingdom of Heaven), in her first film appearance, and one that will not be topped for full disclosure; and Louis Garrel (Ma m\u00e8re, Regular Lovers).Despite the fact that Theo (Garrel) imagines himself a Marxist, he obviously is not committed, and is consumed with his twin sister. Sex and cinema are linked in the games they all play, and even Matthew becomes disgusted with their acts. It is only when the brick comes through the window that their dream world is shattered and they truly come of age and act.An excellent performance by all three in this worthy film."}, {"id": 226, "text": "It isn't surprising that many people have been thrown off or wierded out by Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers. This is the man who directed the great 1972 film, Last Tango in Paris, which threw out the rule book concerning what could be talked about and shown regarding sex in a non-pornographic film. The Dreamers isn't as revolutionary or shocking for it's day as Last Tango in Paris was, but it's every bit as daring and provocative. It is Bertolucci's homage to the movies themselves and the people that spend an infinite amount of hours in darkened rooms watching them. For us psychopaths out there where movies are more than a religion, myself included, The Dreamers lets us know we are not alone, however it also informs us just how alone we might be. Film is the greatest art form because it can be the most collaborative with many people's vision or the most individual. It combines music, sound, photography, acting, politics, religion, entertainment, fun, and everything into one package. What else other than the movies allows the beauty of a person who's been dead for a hundred years to shine forever? Long after all the Presidents are dead and long after the frescos of Michaelangelo have tarnished away, and long after the pyramids have eroded, we'll still have film. We'll still be able to watch Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Audrey Hepburn, and James Dean as though they were still alive. In fact as long as people watch their movies, they are alive. It's this sory of mentality and obsession that Bertolucci both praises but also warns the dangers of in his film The Dreamers. Michael Pitt (Matthew), presumably summoning up Leonardo DiCaprio with his performance, plays an American exchange student in Paris in 1968 during the student riots. He is pretty much a loner, an outcast, and misfit - both free and restrained by his undying love for film. In Paris he meets a pair of French siblings, a brother and sister played by Eva Green (Isabelle) and Louis Garrel (Theo), who share his affections towards the cinema and immediately befriend him and adopt him as one of their own. It's ironic that they choose to coronate him with the lyrical quote He's one of us! He's one of us! from Freaks. Perhaps they see themselves as freaks. It's a deep movie and it throws many curves at the audience which will push people's ideas of what is morally correct and incorrect to the extreme. The Dreamers breaks many taboos. Mostly the incestuous relationship between a brother and sister, who feel as though one another are their only true companions in life. It doesn't shy away from nudity, both male and female. Together the three of them, Matthew, Isabelle, and Theo form an emotional and sexual bond through their love of movies and their common feelings of being misplaced in the world. The Dreamers is a damn fine movie that might be difficult to appreciate because of its content. Something I really enjoyed was seeing the clips of the different movies in the film when the characters talked about them and played games revolving around the films. Breathless, Top Hat, City Lights, and Scarface are a few of the movies that are featured in The Dreamers."}, {"id": 227, "text": "From the wonderful opening title shot that immediately transports the viewer back to 1960's France, one quickly realizes that Bertolucci's latest is a celebration of youth, sex and politics as well as a powerful argument that there is a marked distinction between an NC-17 rated film and pornography.Set against the backdrop of the 1968 Paris student uprising which occurred when the government threatened a local cinematheque, The Dreamers is often a playful, poetic love song to a specific time in French and film history. When Matthew, an American played by Michael Pitt meets fellow demonstrators Isabelle (Eva Green) and her brother Theo (Louis Garrel, son of French director Phillipe Garrel) they immediately hit it off based on their encyclopedic knowledge of film, referencing them in childish games the way anyone else might reference the Simpsons. It's important to admit that some of the film's initial charm is dependent on the viewer's own knowledge of film history, though Bertolucci makes it easy to keep up by using actual footage from various films as a guide. When the trio attempt to recreate a scene from Godard's Bande a Part, Bertolucci films it using similar setups intercut with the original.Among debates over who's the funnier filmmaker (Chaplin or Keaton) or who's the greater guitar player (Clapton or Hendrix), the characters slowly reveal a dark side to their innocent games and slip into a bohemian lifestyle borne of despair. The characters use the riots as an excuse to express their ennui and to rebel. The brother and sister duo involve Matthew in their explicit, often cruel, sexual games not just as experimentation but as a way of establishing power over each other. It becomes apparent early on that there is also a powerful incestuous core to their relationship, one that is not lost on Matthew who quickly becomes more interested in liberating his friends from each other than in rioting with other film geeks.The film stumbles only in a few clunky dialog transitions and in some of its acting. Michael Pitt is nice enough as a polite, reserved American, but is unable to take control of the film the way his character demands it once he decides to confront the siblings. Garrel does a nice job with Theo, but isn't given enough. Only Eva Green makes a true impact with a double-edged performance. She's a free-spirit held hostage by an unhealthy relationship.The Dreamers unravels as slowly as it builds up, with relationships slowly fraying until they suddenly tear during the film's climax, and it ends as abruptly as many life experiences do. All at once, you realize it needed to end, but can't help but reminisce and wonder if the characters are okay."}, {"id": 228, "text": "Whilst on a trip to London I went to the cinema to see Mystic River and caught a trailer of The Dreamers before hand and it got me excited for the wrong film.

I managed to get my hands on a copy of The Dreamers and expected great things from it and that's what I feel I got.   Films like these are not always appreciated by your average film buff but they are by your average artistic fan.    Matthew is an American in Paris exploring the depths of movie making and getting to know the French Culture and along the way he meets Theo and Isabelle, two siblings that are different to every brother and sister in the entire world.   Matthew inhabits into the life of Theo and Isabelle and slowly becomes intrigued and scared of what he wants and knows. The more the film goes on the more the story unfolds and become stranger and stranger.  Matthew I find to be a very human character.  He starts off very shy and when meeting people for the first time he does his best not to step out of line so he can fit in but the more you get to know him the more his personality opens and his concerns on how Theo and Isabelle live their with one another.The film is almost perfect in every way and is very mellow to watch.  I couldn't find a flaw throughout the entire film and I found myself wanting to drink wine afterwards.  I didn't though but because of what they show and what they do it makes you curious to try thongs even though drinking wine is not a spontaneous thing to do but I am making an example of it.   Michael Pitt looks more like Leo Dicaprio the more he gets older and in long shots of Matthew you can't tell either apart, but Pitt is an excellent actor and shows that in The Dreamers.  Eva Green is perfect and more perfect.  She has to be one the rarest beauties in films at the moment as she is just so beautiful especially when she is naked.   Louis Garrel is somebody I have never heard of before but will look out for him in the near future as he has the gift to very far especially in French cinema.  The soundtrack makes the film all the more watch able as the likes of Dylan, Joplin, Hendrix and The Doors ring out in the back drop of the movie with even a Michael Pitt's own version of `Hey Joe' in the bath scene.    I wouldn't take much notice of people who dislike The Dreamers.  I think they just can't handle that there must be lot's of nudity and shock value to make a film like this and this is a Bertolucci film and as much as he tries to out do his own movies he has just added to it.  A Great film."}, {"id": 229, "text": "So much expectation could only lead to disappointment. What happened to the talent of Bertolucci? Is he the same director that made The Spider Stratagem, The Conformist or Last Tango? It is sad to see someone that represented a vision of liberation, of creativity, of intellectual rigour to have lost the touch of genius. Even his trademark directing style, the composition of the shots, the brillant camera movements and the sophistication of the editing seems to have been totally lost and replaced by middle of the road Americanised blandness. It is understandable in all creative artists to reach its peak and to gradually lower that very level of groundbreaking work. But to get this low? The Dreamers feels fake, forced, opportunistic, poorly acted, it doesn't flow naturally, using and appropriating itself of every cinematographic detail that would give it a feel for authenticity and credibility in the name of an homage to the Nouvelle Vague.A cocktail of Goddard, Truffaut et al that in spite of its attractive packaging fails to delivered the goods. It is not only the very essence of what the cinema d'auter was trying to achieve in'68 that is missing but also the real spirit of the Paris revolution, the search for a better order, idealistic as it might have been.The central characters and the context in which they live never seem to mix. They are like two different systems running in parallel but separately. The political and social context becomes a backdrop, a place and a moment but nothing more than that. The characters motivations, neither their political or sexual rebellion never brought into the surface of the story. They seem to be spectators and not participant of what it is happening outside, an audience in many ways similar to that of the Cinemateque film buffs they are. There is no holly innocence in these enfants terribles but mere stupidity.Perhaps Bertolucci had this in mind and it was his intention to show this light commitment of the petit bourgeoisie and the futility of their social and political pretensions.Also the role of their parents seems false. Their attitude when coming back to find a kind of domestic Jules et Jim scene in their living room seems more appropriate to post-liberated people brought up after the '60s that real French middle class parents at the time, even accepting the characters intellectual aspirations.In spite of these comments and quite a few longueurs in the script the film is still enjoyable to watch. There is an aesthetic voyeuristic eye in Bertolucci's film and who can not but enjoy being inside a rather grand Haussmanian Paris apartment with three beautiful young things inside shockingly walking around in the nude. If this was the intention of its possible commercial appeal the success de scandal is guaranteed."}, {"id": 230, "text": "First of all, I saw the movie in Spain with an announced duration of 130 minutes, but the movie barely lasted 120 minutes.  It could be a printing error or somebody forgot a reel.  I am not really sure, but it is worth noting.The Dreamers starts as a nostalgic and respectful look at the times where everyone of us were thinking on  rebellion and revolution, but how little we went pass our theoretical idealism.  It is also an homage to the power of movies and cinema as real media or instrument for the twenty century culture. How better, deeper and daring where thirty five years ago, without the need of digital FX.But, be careful. This is not a romantic movie from Gary Marshall or Disney. It was made by Bernardo Bertolucci, who was almost imprisoned for obscenity in Italy, 30 years ago, for `The Last Tango in Paris' (he lost his civil rights for 10 years instead). This one is not in the same league but is not for kids either.It is the year 1968.  A couple of French brothers (Isabelle and Theo) befriend an American student (Mathew) of about their same age.  As the brothers' parents go on vacation,  Mathew moves to their house and realize that their relation looks somewhat incestuous (they sleep and bath together).  He stays with them and a sexual and ideological game develops between the three, creating their own nest without communication with the exterior world.  Meanwhile the French revolution of 1968 (who forced Charles De Gaulle to leave the country and gave power to the Communist party) grows everywhere, forcing the characters to leave their shelter and confront their own idealism (or not).The Dreamers could only be made by Europeans, even when one of the main protagonist is an American.  It is easy to notice that while Eva Green (Isabelle) and Louis Garrel (Theo), both French actors,  spend and are shown most of the time naked (frontal and any other angle imaginable), Michael Pitt (Mathew), the only American of the cast, is  in the same scenes almost always strategically covered and when it is not it seems to be a body double.Even worse; in my opinion Michael Pitt was the biggest mistake of the otherwise almost perfect movie.  His character is quite bland but it seems his real personality is too.  As he is obviously uncomfortable with nudity, it is also with many parliaments he delivers during crucial scenes. The message I got from him was that French's could be communist but at least were fighters, but American's were completely lost in their own reality (Vietnam). In one key scene, Mathew (who was not going to Vietnam because of his university student status), express that people going to war did not care for studying, thus they were expendable. I do not think Bertolucci intended to go this far. I am sure he was pointing to the cultural difference, but choosed the wrong actor to deliver the message. The other two leads Evan Green and particularly Louis Garrel are superb. Their characters are very complex,  full of demons and contradictions, but they perfectly know where they are going.  And by the end when they choose to fight for their ideals, it is perfectly believable. It was mentioned that the movie has been trimmed for the American release. You must see this movie, but you must also fight to stop the MPAA censorship in our culture."}, {"id": 231, "text": "Set against the backdrop of the 1968 student riots in Paris, The Dreamers is a film of political and sexual awakening during a time when a spirit of revolution was in the air. Matthew is an American exchange student who meets two siblings, Theo and Isabelle, shortly after arriving in Paris. The trio bonds over a shared love for cinema, and the film is laced with numerous references to film classics and the French New Wave, making it in some ways a film about film. But it's also a film about revolution and breaking established social boundaries. Living in a large house while the sibling's parents are away, the three central characters engage in ideological struggle that reflects the social turmoil going on outside. Theo is a Maoist who supports the student's radical demonstrations while Matthew believes their efforts are futile. Simultaneously Matthew and Isabelle develop a sexual relationship that Theo must come to terms with. In the end, the varying ideologies of the characters come to a head and they are each forced to make a choice about the direction of their lives. The film is passionate and alive with a revolutionary spirit, and at the decisive moment, it upholds a radical approach. Michael Pitt, Eva Green, and Louis Garrel each turn in exceptional and brave performances in this film that is directed with subtly and nuance by Bernardo Bertolucci."}, {"id": 232, "text": "NOTE: This review is constructed based on the NC-17 version of the film. I'm not sure how the R-rated DVD cut differs.The Dreamers is an exercise in something I like to call, cinetimacy. Cinetimacy is the act of blending cinephilia and eroticism into one film, naturally. I obviously made that up on the spot, but it's truly what I was thinking about during almost the entire film. Blending the love and passion for two things, film and sex, so nonchalantly and engagingly that, after a while, you forget you're watching people's fantasies.Some films exploit sex and some make it indulgent, like ones' particular fantasy (cough, cough, Paul Verhoenen's Showgirls). The Dreamers make the act strangely classy, and doesn't overcompensate its importance. It is a well-acted, intensely written French piece, directed by acclaimed director, Bernardo Bertolucci. His applied elegance quickly turns The Dreamers from possible exploitative fodder to a wonderful, sensuous work of art.We are greeted with Michael Pitt's, who appears to be a cross between Leonardo DiCaprio and Emile Hirsch, character Matt, a young, naive American foreign exchange student who is touring France during the time of heavy economic rebellions in 1968. A young cinephile, Matt finds he spends most of his time in the movie theater, immersed in a screen projecting high-art to its patrons, while they sit back in their lush red seats and smoke up a few. Matt soon meets Isabelle (played by the beautiful Eva Green) and her brother Theo (Louis Garrel), both of them, also, into very artistic French pictures. In their spare time, they like to intensely act out movie sequences for each other and then ask what it is from. If they get it wrong, they will take the prophet, but to them, that options doesn't always seem like such a bad thing.They hang out, become closer, until Matt realizes that Isabelle and Theo like to have sex with each other. They enjoy the pleasure and the sensation that comes out of it, and their incestuous desires aren't for what viewers might believe. Not instant gratification, but for the simple excitement and escapism behind it. Matt becomes one with them, choosing to move in with Isabelle and Theo, and embracing this life of difference, wrongness, yet rightness.The picture is photographed with luxurious takes, extremely beautiful cinematography, and some of the most enhancing colors this side of a Wes Anderson film. With repeated viewings, I can see nuances becoming more prominent, events becoming more significant, and minor little details, such as things found scattered around the film, to be more apparent and lively. This is the kind of luscious Italian film I've been searching for, sort of like the Suspiria of a different genre. A film that can tamper with a genre so much so that it could be labeled as transgressive, and you feel that you've witnessed something miraculous for reasons you can't decipher.Pitt, Green, and Garrel ignite remarkable on-screen chemistry, and the things they had to commit to in the film are astonishing and real. The sex isn't as hardcore as some are embellishing. They are rather, should I say, detailed, but there's nothing here that should shock the most optimistic and open-minded viewer. Especially one familiar with Italian cinema. I can easily see why it merited the NC-17 rating; the MPAA has always had an uncomfortable time with intimacy conveyed cinematically, yet let so much go unnoticed and undisturbed. At least Bertolucci didn't cop out to an R-rating.Perhaps the title references the idea that these three teenagers are living in their own world, outside of the violence, chaos, and catastrophe going on right on their doorstep. Perhaps it tries to inform us what could possibly happen if we go down the wrong road of rightness, yet feel so entranced as we do it. Or maybe it is just showcasing how intimacy can really effect judgment. Whatever it's doing, The Dreamers does a damn fine job doing it. The more you love cinema, the more you love nuances, and the more you love craft, the more desires the film will fulfill.Starring: Michael Pitt, Eva Green, and Louis Garrel.

C'est la langue du cinema! - Bernardo BertolucciIn the Parisian Spring of 1968, protest and and political unrest was in the air. The same was true in many parts of the world at that time, but Paris was very much the center of change... politically, culturally, artistically and sexually. Bernardo Bertolucci vividly recreates this time and place in his latest film, an erotic, sensual and hedonistic dream immersed in the heart of this revolution. 'The Dreamers' is a gorgeous film about three idealistic young students who while away the hours and days in their vast Parisian apartment talking about love and sex, war and politics, morality and films. And just outside their windows the world is changing.Matthew (Michael Pitt) is quiet, bordering on shy. He is a polite and unassuming nineteen year-old American studying in Paris who spends most of his time at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, which was the center of artistic passion at the time. The devoted patrons of the cin\u00e9math\u00e8que were cinephiles of the highest order and were utterly devoted to their favorite films and directors. He makes friends with Th\u00e9o and Isabelle, some real Parisians as he tells his Mother on the phone. Th\u00e9o (Louis Garrel) is an elegant rebel who feels passionately about almost everything. He doesn't get along with his father but still accepts monthly checks from him to support himself. His twin sister Isabelle (Eva Green) is a romantic idealist and an intellectual, overflowing with cinematic drama, as when she mimics Greta Garbo in 'Queen Christina'.The three of them stimulate and inspire one another. Th\u00e9o broods about everything and challenges Matthew on various topics. They get into heated debates about Chaplin versus Keaton, Clapton versus Hendrix, and war versus pacifism. Matthew is a pacifist who truly believes his mind is more powerful than his fists. He is more accepting of turmoil than Th\u00e9o, who feels a more urgent need to be noticed and heard.Isabelle is a sensualist... Wanting to touch, taste and feel everything she can, sometimes all at once. Her sensual inhibitions lead her and her brother into very unusual territory. They sleep in the same bed every night. They kiss each other softly, the way lovers do. It is as if they've known only each other before they met Matthew. And they are oblivious to the oddity of the nature of their relationship.In one early scene, we discover that Isabelle and Th\u00e9o challenge each other in a little cinematic trivia game where one has to pay the forfeit if the answer is not provided. When Th\u00e9o misses a question, Isabelle makes him masturbate in front of her and Matthew. A while later, they involve Matthew in their games, and when he is unable to deliver the correct response, they order him to make love to Isabelle. Their group dynamic is fascinating, if somewhat bizarre.To some degree, these three characters are living in a dream world while holed up in their apartment. But the inevitable intrusion of the outside turmoil always lingers. And in one scene, late in the film, that intrusion is a shocking wake-up call to both them and us. And in a very real way, that outside turmoil saves their lives. The reality of their situation overpowers the romanticism and they are forced to grow up and confront the real issues of the world.At first, one suspects that these three friends will face the world together. However, it is the differences between Matthew and Th\u00e9o that lead to the destruction of their threesome. And it is only then that we see Isabelle's loyalty was never really in question at all.Perhaps it all sounds rather cryptic. But that is the nature of Bertolucci's work... Maybe that is true of all great directors. There are always layers peeling away to reveal new layers.Bertolucci's direction is masterful. He is able to tell a very basic story of three friends being sexually playful and intertwine it with questions of morality and political intrigue. He weaves in some lovely references to classic films, some overt and some very subtle. There is a lovely scene where the three of them race through The Louvre in exactly the same way as was done in Jean-Luc Godard's 'Bande \u00e0 part'. He intercuts his film with footage from Godard's classic. He does the same when Isabelle mimics Garbo. He also gives subtle nods to 'The Third Man', 'Breathless', 'Mouchette' and 'Blonde Venus'. I also love the inclusion of footage from Chaplin's 'City Lights' as they debate Chaplin and Keaton.There is one truly magnificent scene in 'The Dreamers' that I must make special note of. Our three main characters are all squeezed into a bathtub, soaking away, as they debate the merits of war versus the consequences of going to jail for desertion. As their debate fizzles, Bertolucci uses a tri-fold mirror to capture all three faces in a way that would be logistically impossible otherwise. Many directors have used mirrors to great effect throughout the history of film-making, but this was brilliantly original. The scene continues as they all doze off into a lazy deep sleep.The performances are delicate and finely tuned. Michael Pitt, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Leonardo di Caprio, balances his role carefully between wide-eyed naivet\u00e9 and intellectual pretension. In essence, he plays the blank slate for the two engines of the story, Theo and Isabelle. It is a breakthrough role that will hopefully lead to more great choices. Louis Garrel delivers a nice turn but seems to be overshadowed a little. The screenplay never really requires him to break out of his shell. Perhaps his role is slightly underwritten.The standout is Eva Green. She announces herself as a new star with this brave role. It is a brilliant performance that requires her to bear more than just her naked body for the bulk of the running time. One gets the feeling she was rubbed emotionally raw by this film. Her character is the type who feels deeper, loves deeper and hurts deeper than the others. If she chooses, Eva Green will be a huge star over the next decade or two.This glorious film is definitely intended for cinephiles. It is for all those who are often labeled pretentious by the hoards of average moviegoers who only seem to describe movies in two ways, 'kicks ass' or 'sucks'. 'The Dreamers' is intellectually stimulating, artistically intriguing, politically relevant, sexually charged and subtly profound. I recommend it strictly for those who already know the way to the local art-house theatre without having to look up directions on the internet.Unfortunately, this type of film doesn't merit must-see viewing for most moviegoers anymore. But it is the type of film that would have had ticket lines around the block in the streets of Paris in 1968. Times have changed and more people are eager to see 'Matrix' sequels these days. It's kind of sad really. But there are still a few million of us in this world who are eager for this more weighty material. It's just that we aren't as likely to run into someone else who is willing to discuss it with us.'The Dreamers' is not a film designed strictly for entertainment, although there is a lot of fun to be had. More than anything though, it leaves me steeped in thought about so many things and it has me wistful and nostalgic for a time when this type of film was more the talk-of-town than the latest CGI action-fest or teen-queen high-school fairytale. 'The Dreamers' represents real cinema."}, {"id": 236, "text": "In so many ways a disappointing filmic experience. Despite the complex interplay between characters and some intriguing script lines and memorable set, the film simply fails on multiple counts. The characters fail to develop and their eventual actions remain an unexplored mystery. The ending appears as abruptly transplanted - one of the few time the dream is punctured by the momentous struggle outside and yet casually splintered in like an edit from another movie.The revolutionary feeling isn't portrayed as anything but an alien phenomenon, but at least the Mao busts are redolent. Arguments about film and Hendrix go nowhere. The sexual and interpersonal hangups of the proponents, around which the film's meaning hinges, remain totally unresolved and fragmented. A few beautifully lit outside scenes, lots of old cars, the vibrance of youthful acting innocence and tokenistic nudity with an overworked obsession with Isobel's natural vaginal bleeding on not one but two occasions cannot mask the banality of both structure and and absence of pace. Even the playful and pleasing old movie links, appear casually adopted and arbitrarilly abandoned mid-stream.Indeed, most elements appear to be casually portrayed and simply tossed aside.Why was it important to show Mathew peeing on the toothbrush, why did Isobel try to kill them all, why did the shocked parents leave, why did Theo and Isobel join the throng - was it crassly existential mimicry???? Why did Mathew simply walk away? Despite the appearance of psychological complexity we are left with partially developed ideas, a handful of voyeuristic taboos and shallow characterisations.So many questions and yet the liberal and indulgent reminiscences of Bertolucci in recapturing intimate coupling elements from Last Tango rather than exploring the Paris of 68 leave one sad. Like Mathew, I walked away from the film feeling rather vacant and disappointed that there was little more than a void to place my own reminiscences of the period in, simply dreamlike images which rendered them and the plot as having so little consequence. For this, thanks Bernardo for such a thin chimera and vacuous veneer - or was I simply dreaming to lose myself in something which did more than appear a little deeper than film stock?"}, {"id": 237, "text": "The Dreamers tries early on to capture the nostalgia of Cinema Paridisimo and Last Tango, but as it is forced out of the streets and movie theaters of Paris and into the apartment of twins Isabelle and Theo sharing a room with Matthew (Michael Pitt) the film slowly treads into dull territory of exploring the relationships and personalities of its leads which just can't compete and leaves a shallow feeling with the viewer.  The tempo is offset by the frequent, sometimes stylish, nudity, but combined with the lackluster of the characters involved seems more shock than art.This film is very visually stunning with a few notable scenes attributed to the director's influence.  One in particular has the two men in a tub with Matthew looking through a soap framed picture, another takes a voyeuristic view of Theo (Louis Garrel) as he walks down the outside stair and digs through garbage for a meal.  Unfortunately they seem misplaced with the script which lingers too long in places and never fully connects with the revolutionary backdrop to which the movie is set against.  This makes some of the later scenes come up particularly flat.Michael Pitt is certainly at his best and probably the highest profile role he has taken in a film.  The bland, modest, yet naive demeanor to which he plays his role is certainly one aspect that keeps the film together.  The fact that he exposes every part of himself is true to the role and adds an honesty and believability to the character.  Eva Green seems like Angelina Jolie crossed with Katherine Hepburn.  She is remarkable and holds the screen, storming through scenes and even when completely nude, commands you to look her in the eye and listen.The components of this movie will seem familiar to fans of Larry Flint and movies like Y Tu Mama Tambien.  Sex and Style take precedence over substance of Script.  But what is lacking here is any thread to tie those three components together and instead they run their separate paths.A decent film for the fan of stylish, sex laden art fare, but be prepared to walk away feeling unfulfilled.Maddis 3/10"}, {"id": 238, "text": "First and foremost, 'The Dreamers' is not based on those optimistic Miami Dolfans who are somehow convinced that the Fins will make the playoffs this year.

Their lives revolve and are controlled by it. However, what I found to be nightmarish of 'The Dreamers' was that these characters at times tended to be displayed as ignorant play puppets except in the scenes where they expressed cinematic analogies &amp; inquiries.

The whole story is about three young students who are in Paris: two are French and are brothers, the third is an American and is doing an exchange to learn the country's language. Chemistry between them is intensified by their interest by cinema. From then on, the film beggins a series of debates (a little insipid to normal public but curious to the experts and movie-goers) about cinema, with cameos and tributes to several films and actors. Here, sometimes, its necessary to know cinema and to have some cinematic culture in order to follow everything. Then, as the events of May '68 take place, the three are getting more and more intimately involved. Sex is a structural part of the story from the beginning, its introduced very well by the sensuality and eroticism of Eva Green and isn't ugly or sinful, as in many films usually ends up becoming. However, full nudity scenes are many, can hurt sensibilities of more modest audiences and advise discretion before watch the movie.This film is about revolutions, hopes, yearnings, dreams, sex and cinema. Everything is mixed, everything is a vehicle for dreaming, for the estrangement of reality.

That's best of all!Bernardo Bertolucci gave the world LAST TANGO IN Paris, and if they had stuck to the original novel, I hear it would have been just exactly that, a last tango in Paris, as the original story ended in tragedy. He also made not only STEALING BEAUTY, but made a star out of Liv Tyler. To this day, I cannot thank him enough. The great man just needs better scripts.

Now that I was ahead of the hetro erectus phase, I watched The Dreamers again, this time whole of it, and I swear, I didn't have any interest in watching those scenes while I was just in the initial stages. This implies that the movie was made for a whole lot of reasons, but nudity was not one of them. Audacity and explicitness might be. The Dreamers dreams high. It talks about world at a small-scale and minuscule level, it talks about the every-day interaction patterns, and what these patterns symbolize. It talks about the cognitive confusions, dilemmas, predicaments, and everything baffling about this world. It talks about how not every individual agrees with the norm, in fact, doesn't even agree to them being norm. Such individuals consider their lives resembling superficiality, and consider themselves agents of it. They associate every move and variation of their life with the one elsewhere. The Dreamers bring such people to reality. I'm an authority because I'm too, on so many levels, exhibiting the same views of myself. The script isn't something that only true movie and media lovers will understand and like. For others, it's just three beautiful people in France talking and doing crap for ninety-something minutes. The Dreamers talks about incest, because for the people it talks about, it is one of the sexual relationships that have gone awry from the main course of socialization; it's not considered a norm, while it should be. Incest is just like any other physical bond. You see, the movie uses sexuality, and nudity as agents of vision, not pleasure, which fags of modern-day drama do. The Dreamers uses ordinary people in ordinary circumstances with extraordinary personalities. These personalities are not the tycoon, magnate ones; they're only commonly uncommon, if that makes any sense. The Dreamers elucidates what's the figment of my imagination (reality while I'm fully submerged into that phase) when I'm listening to Marriage of Figaro or Mozart in general. I'm stuck by the same gust of dreaming and Lego-making when I listen to him, or watch a sentimental movie (not just romance, I mean even Interstellar hit me pretty badly.) The Dreamers provides several links, connections, references, causations and correlations to movies, behave in certain ways reminiscent to those performed in the movies (that's when I started loving Eva Green. Still do.) Eva Green was out of all three, much better in reflecting the theme of the movie. The others just played their part I'd say. Verdict: Don't watch it if you're even a mild-philistine. You'll know if you're because all philistines don't know what philistine means.

Firstly, thanks to my friend Raghuveer who let me know of this film and since that happened nearly 5 years ago, I watched it multiple times. When I revisited this film yesterday, I loved the whole of it again. A film buff (Mathew) in Paris meets friends, a brother (Theo) and a sister (Isabelle) and they talk films, make out and face reality.It's a movie that makes a comment on how different is life from movies, we just can't be dreaming for a better world, dreaming about movies, living movies. Reality is a choice while in movies, the actors have choice. The last scene is all about that is what I believe.Set in 1968 and mostly shot indoors, the art direction is good nevertheless and the cinematography sets the mood perfectly. Camera takes it's time for making us settle to the characters which are idiosyncratic and Matthew seems to be trying in touch with reality while Isabelle (Eva Green) claims herself to be purist and thus, does not even watch TV. Theo is another film buff and he is an introvert as it seems, he rarely gets out and is stuck with his sister most of the time. The music plays it's part in bringing the sound of 1968 alive, and though this si set in Paris, we hear to English songs more than the French. Now, on the whole this movie seems to be actually more about the sexual tension between the three characters than about their passion for films, as I figured out. It can also be termed as incestuous as brother and sister have fun too. There are lot many scenes, not one that point out their tension and what they desire from each other, yes there are scenes about their favourite movies, like who is good, Keaton or Chaplin and glimpses of few very old good movies, even French movies and about Truffaut too, but all are just leads to what happens between the three. Surprisingly, when their parents find out that the three have 'made out' they stick to silence and that surprised me each time I saw this and has now made me realise that it's the best thing they can do.All in all, it's a great film by Bernardo Bertolucci and a 4/5 would be apt for the sexiest tribute to films, just wish it was more about films than sex."}, {"id": 247, "text": "Desperation.

The three form a tight circle and almost forget the world outside while dunk on booze, sexuality, and each other. But by the end, the maelstrom outside is too powerful to simply be ignored. This is a very good film, but for me, not quite a great one. The depths of these characters aren't explored the way Bertolucci does in, say 'The Conformist', and there are even some places where it feels like he pulls his punches (not a director one thinks of doing so.) But the homosexual attraction between the brother and the American is reduced to an occasional ambiguous smoldering glance. That aspect, among others, was far more explicit in the novel. None-the-less, the film is beautifully made (some terrific editing that inserts images from other films that relate to and comment on the story), and the acting is solid (and bold.

The only thing I basically found to be interesting is how the characters are movie buffs and live in there own world and the way they view the world with there own ideology. I also found some of the movie trivia parts and how the characters try to relive some of the movie scenes to be of some interest but not much. Also the main big thing that might be going for most viewers or the payoff for some is probably the full frontal nude scenes that feature Eva Green. The relationship between the three characters is very odd and out of the ordinary, you will just have to watch it to see what I am saying. One thing that I could understand in this movie was how so many people talk about there ideology and making a difference but go in a different direction without noticing it.

As tales of foreign dislocation go, this runs circles around Lost in Translation, and ups the erotic ante to a place so casual that some mentalities may be downright uncomfortable with the lack of sensationalism present. In what is essentially a scaled-down variation on Truffaut's Jules and Jim, director Bernardo Bertolucci places American student Matthew (Michael Pitt, full of marquee-icon beauty) in Paris, where he meets up with Isabelle (the luscious Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel), whose ambiguous relationship runs the gamut from siblings to twins to lovers; the trio become enmeshed in a love triangle that extends for a month, in the midst of the escalation of military operations in Vietnam and a Communist uprising in France. Bertolucci opens with images of outcry against a blacklisted filmmaker, and concludes with a less-than-convincing paralleling of political protest (the axiom that all art is political given an overly literal connotation). The at-times distracting political aspect, however, is a minor complaint in what is, at heart, a hypnotically engaging account of three mysterious teens in the midst of their sexual awakening.

'The Dreamers' is a rather critical assessment of the French students of that era, and of their political efforts.One does not expect so controversial a film with so much edgy content to have such a conservative heart, but the erotic and edgy content in 'The Dreamers' is like a piece of exotic lingerie, designed to titillate, but ultimately fated to be draped on a very prosaic bourgeois frame. While the film does not condemn its characters for transgressing (a term much favored by the director Bernardo Bertolucci) the behavioral standards of society, it dismisses the broadly revolutionary activity of 1968 as immature and ultimately dangerous, and dismisses the events of 1968 as only being useful as a youthful transgressive excursion; sowing your wild oats in effect.All this leaves three basic problems with this film. First, even the liberally minded may well be disgusted by the moral tone of the film. Second, the film cannot be fully understood without extensive knowledge of the events of 1968, and for so important an event, France 1968 is obscure. Many, although not all, people will find the film to be lacking in purpose without understanding the underlying meaning. Third, if you do understand the film, and understand the events of 1968, there is an excellent chance that you will not favor this particular interpretation of the era, generation, or movement.On the other hand, there is no question but that 'The Dreamers' is a masterful piece of film-making, skillfully shot, with astounding direction and acting. While an amazing amount of dialog and activity is sly commentary on the revolutionaries of the day, such subtle propaganda is enough to make one question the forceful and bombastic tone of more commercial and mainstream films, and the criticism is subtle enough that it is not disruptive.This is certainly a complex film to evaluate, but I can give some advice on how, or whether to watch it. This is a film that will appeal to film-buffs more than it will appeal to a general audience (indeed it is ABOUT film buffs, and contains many tribute scenes). Anyone who would be disturbed by the controversial moral tone for which this film is famous, should be advised that the sophisticated nature of the film does not obliterate the matter.If you do wish to see this film, the DVD version of the film has special features that contain useful background information that helps to explain the film, although in keeping with the French New Wave film movement, the background information does not force this meaning explicitly upon you."}, {"id": 253, "text": "It is safe to say you're not going to see many movies like The Dreamers. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is somewhat hard to say. This movie certainly has a lot going for it but it never quite seems to come together. It's undeniably interesting, at times bordering on downright fascinating. There are enough moments of brilliance to make you think this movie could be something truly special. But in the end The Dreamers falls just short of greatness. Good, certainly worth seeing and discussing, but not great.The Dreamers is set in Paris in 1968, a very interesting time in a very interesting place. The seeds of revolt were being sown, demonstrators taking the city by storm. Surrounded by this maelstrom of activity are the three main characters this film will follow. Michael Pitt plays Matthew, a young American ostensibly studying in Paris who actually spends most of his time watching films at the Cinematheque Francais. There is where he will first encounter fellow film buffs Isabelle, played by Eva Green, and Theo, played by Louis Garrel. Isabelle and Theo are twins who are very close. Disturbingly close as Matthew will soon find out when the twins invite him to move into their apartment while their parents are away. As Matthew is drawn into Isabelle and Theo's world he can't help but feel a little uncomfortable and the viewer may well feel a little uncomfortable as well. Suffice to say this is not what one would call a normal relationship and just how unusual this relationship is will be depicted rather explicitly.The Dreamers is certainly not for the prudish but if you can get past the explicit portrayal of this rather unusual relationship there is much to recommend the film. The three lead actors, who basically have to carry the entire film, all do a fine job. Especially noteworthy is newcomer Green who tackles a role in which all inhibitions must be tossed aside. A unique plot device in which these three film buffs act out scenes from great films while the original scenes themselves are inter-cut adds a rather unique and enjoyable touch. So there are some very good pieces to work with here but in the end it leaves you wanting more. With all that is going on outside in the streets of Paris the somewhat bizarre story unfolding inside the apartment doesn't quite hold up. It was a time of great change in Paris but for much of the film the main characters seem oblivious to that, stuck in their own little world. These three characters have an interesting and certainly unique story to tell.

It is directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, set in Paris in 1968 against the backdrop of the cultural revolution. It has explicit sex scenes, great performances and beautiful images. It is about sex, politics and cinema, and for me most of the joy came from the parts about cinema.Michael Pitt plays Matthew, an American student in Paris, who spends most of his time with going to the movies.

He is invited to their place, has dinner with their family (their father is a famous French poet) and when the parents leave for a month he is invited to stay with the two.

Theo has to masturbate in front of a Marlene Dietrich poster and later Isabelle has to make love to Matthew, who must play along as well.In between we get images from what is happening outside, and it is not strange that the film has its crucial moments right there. But for me the most interesting moments really are when Bertolucci intercuts between his characters who replay scenes from films and the real film they are dealing with. We see Jean-Luc Godard's '\u00c0 Bout de Souffl\u00e9', Tod Browning's 'Freaks', and Rogers/Astaire musical 'Top Hat'. Then we go back to the characters in their dream world, their movie world, with only Matthew who seems to realize they have to wake up at one point.I loved these moments. I loved the images I saw, I admired the performances very much, but I never really felt anything for them. Sometimes I was reminded of Bertolucci and his 'Last Tango in Paris', another film with graphic sex scenes set in Paris. That film also had characters I did not like very much, but they were well acted and it looked very good.

Yep, another film possibly ending up being a sequel to Cruel Intentions but worry not, as Bernardo Bertolucci has a new approach on sexuality. One could say he is dwelling in sensational imagery but I say that this film doesn't glorify sex but granted, goes further than any Hollywood director ever would or could have.The story is about three people living together in Paris, two of them whom are siblings, Isabelle and Theo, and an American exchange student, Matthew, trying to learn some French. They are all film buffs (even buffer than me) but one day in the heat of summer in 1968, the local theater is closed and the threesome have nothing to do. Isabelle (Green) and Theo (Garrel) invite Matthew (Pitt) to eat dinner with them. Matthew is rather shy but always polite but soon his walls of subtlety crumble, when he discovers his sexual desires, or should I say, gives in to them.There is more than meets the eye, as Isabelle and Theo are sexually so much more advanced than Matthew, who can't even change clothes in front of anyone. But Isabelle and Theo want to play games and Matthew is up for the challenge. You could think that this all about sex, and in a way it is but Bertolucci isn't telling a story about the mistakes of the youth and growth, but simply depicting the immature side of sexuality, that so many other artitst take as a sign of maturity. This little detail is what makes this film so fascinating.Other captivating detail must be Eva Green, who has both the wilderness and elegance of a Parisian lady with some madness to the mix. The bond between Isabelle and Theo has some sexual elements but really it is about a bond built to disable growing up. This bond even Matthew can not break, and he will learn that in time. Too bad though that Michael Pitt can't rise to the same level with Green and Garrel, as he fails to star in his key scenes. But luckily we can observe the crazy siblings. I haven't seen such a great film about immaturity in a while and The Dreamers took me by surprise. Being an exploration of adolescence, Bertolucci ties the lives and events of the youth with several famous films, so this is a trip to film history at the same time. This film is rebellious and daring and certainly worth seeing to anyone who is tired of moralists, who can only judge but not reason.

Well that's fine. However, it can be the most artful movie created, however if it doesn't hold the attention, then it has nothing.My main problem with this film is that it went NOWHERE. Michael Pitt meets up with two Parisians, befriends and moves in with them. From there, a bit of character growth occurs between the trio of actors, however the plot of the film never takes off. It felt more like the plane stalled in the hangar. After a bit of sexual intimacy and growth between the three, the director seemed like he was out of options and opted for a bit of moral conflict. Well this would've been fine had he intertwined it with the character growth. This was not the case as he basically threw the three into the apartment the first half - then for the second half had them debate beliefs and moral standards, all while making it seem as uninteresting as possible.I wasn't watching for the mis-en-scene or the camera angles, so I'm willing to concede whatever it is you believe about it to be true.

I am not sure, however, whether the message, if message there is, is sufficiently clear. The plot was definitely not a love story, not between Matthew and Isabelle anyway; it was not about decadence either, since even if their behavior was scandalous, neither of the three young people could be accused of depravity or falling into vice, on the contrary, all three of them were progressive and surprisingly innocent in many ways; it was not about overwhelming eroticism since none of the three appeared in any way to have succumbed to the call of the flesh and change his/her way of life; it was not even about going beyond in a Jim Morrison-ish or Jimi Hendrix-ish way (even if the Doors and Hendrix were mighty present throughout the whole movie). So what was the movie all about? To me the whole story makes sense only in a strictly French context: against the background of the famous book by Jean Cocteau, Les enfants terribles, which ends in a glorious apotheosis of a menage a trois including a brother and a sister, or possibly that of Michel Tournier's Les Meteores discussing the life-long love relationship between twins... In fact, through the mouth of the Californian Matthew who eventually refuses to fall into the inertia of his two friends' self-complacence and self-sufficience, Bertolucci apparently disagrees with Cocteau. But then, possibly in an attempt to make the movie more appealing, and more comprehensible to people who have never read Cocteau, he shifts the emphasis to the conflict between violence (the Parisian twins) and non-violence (the American boy). What do these have to do with the forbidden love between brother and sister? I am obviously missing the point."}, {"id": 260, "text": "Bertolucci MADE LOVE to this subject!

It is a film about film, about youth, dreaming, about growing from dream to reality, about sex, about love, about the adventures of youth, their distinct smells, tastes and feel, about death; metaphoric death as children die into adulthood, as the world forced us all to do in that glorious, infamous time in history.On a more personal note, I can't consider my life truly complete until Mme. Eva Green consents to one supremely long and complicated kiss.ciao.gui gui"}, {"id": 261, "text": "saw The Dreamers last nite, &amp; after thinking about the movie, &amp; reading ALL the wonderful comments/reviews here, i decided to add one additional comment.the movie itself, unfortunately shows the public how untalented the director is, but for some mysterious reason, there are those who embrace his work? this appears to be bernardo's heaven's gate, but only time will tell.the previous comments do an excellent job in dissecting the movie. the 1 scene that was remotely interesting was the one in which the sister's virginity is broken as her twin brother is breaking the eggs! how's that for brother/sister connectivity?HOWEVER, I will be curious as to the future of eva green, of whom i believe is both a beautiful woman as well as having that elusive screen presence. in the hands of the right director, &amp; with some decent projects, we may well be gazing upon a future star, in my opinion. the movie is worth seeing only to view her performance, &amp; I AM NOT REFERRING TO THE SEX OR THE NUDITY!!!!"}, {"id": 262, "text": "WARNING:  NEWSPAPER STYLE MOVIE REVIEW INCLUDING PLOT DISCUSSIONThe Dreamers is a new, primarily English-language film from the Italian king of cinematic controversy, Bernardo Bertolucci. If you've seen his past works, including 1900 and Last Tango in Paris, they provide a fairly clear idea of what to expect in this NC-17 foray into 1960's youth culture in France. The film is an extended analysis, really, of radicalism and some of the hypocrisies seemingly inherent in it. It forces us to confront the question of what truly is revolutionary, or conservative for that matter. The film answers that question in a way many of us will find unexpected.Matthew (Michael Pitt) is an American student spending time abroad in France. He takes in the student protests with wide eyes, gazing in awe at the pure passion igniting these young people. Though the period is the '60s, Matthew still reflects the tucked-in conservatism of a decade past, wearing a jacket and tie almost as a shield from the craziness surrounding him. He soon meets two French siblings, Isabelle and Theo (Eva Green and Louis Garrel), both of whom are full of the revolutionary spirit. They are new and therefore attractive to Matthew, who shares a mutual love of movies with both. Not long after, he moves into the home of his two new friends, whose parents have gone away on an extended trip.Now is the time audience members may begin to squirm. In between quoting movies to one another and acting out favorite scenes, Matthew begins to notice an unnaturally clingy relationship exists between Isa and Theo--they sleep and bathe together, and play sexually-laced games that often leave one in some state of undress. But this quasi-incest has a strange effect on Matthew, as slowly, the jacket and tie disappear, he begins to walk around barely dressed, and he starts to take part in the sex games, at first begrudgingly and then yearningly.But as intoxicated as Matthew becomes with the lifestyle, he also is disturbed when Isa confides in him that she's never been on a date before. Harboring some genuine feelings for the young beauty, Matthew tries to lead her away from a life entirely dependent upon Theo and toward one of independence. In this way, the film draws a very interesting parallel. It really is conservatism--a resistance change--that is keeping so-called radicals Isa and Theo in their exclusive relationship. The young innocent, Matthew, has become the revolutionary in trying to shatter what has become the comfortable tradition.The film boasts three good, but not great performances. With stronger leading work, a good film could possibly have reached the next level. Gilbert Adair's screenplay, based on his own novel, is wonderfully subtle in weaving its critique of the radical movement, but is in fact so subtle that in some ways the film feels small. Nevertheless, the film raises probing questions, particularly in the last scene, as a throng of protesters march down a street, all chanting in unison, not a single one distinguishable from the next. It begs the old question, If a group of anarchists organize an anarchists' meeting, are they really anarchists anymore?Finally, credit must be heaped upon Fox Searchlight for not yielding to any suggestion that Bertolucci's vision be compromised by editing the film to achieve an R rating. Even without such censorship, it is disturbing enough that film footage of bare genitals and some sex is considered more damaging by the MPAA than, for example, the wholesale slaughter of recent horror offerings. In any case, when going to see The Dreamers, leave any prudish tendencies (or family members) at home.Final Grade: B"}, {"id": 263, "text": "Set against the vibrant background of Paris in the Spring of 1968, The Dreamers tells the story of three young film students; their lives and (not surprisingly) their dreams. Despite the tumult and ferment taking-place on the streets, the movie's narrative centres around the complicated relationships between brother Theo (Louis Garrel), sister Isabelle (Eva Green) and their newfound American friend Matthew (Michael Pitt).When their English mother (Anna Chancellor) and rich poet father (Robin Renucci) leave them in charge of their comfortable middle-class home, the siblings invite Matthew to stay with them. Sensing a kindred spirit, they involve him in their re-enactments of classic film scripts, and increasingly bizarre mind games. Cocooned in their own little world, they are for the most part oblivious to the social upheaval going-on around them. Police sirens wail outside, whilst inside the self-styled cultural revolutionaries mouth slogans like they've been plucked from the script of a really cool film. Eventually they come to a realization of sorts, but.well I won't spoil it.The Dreamers mixes many of the distinctive Bertolucci trademarks. The unabashed censor-baiting of Last Tango in Paris meets the sumptuous cinematography seen in Besieged. But for all its flashy camerawork, often slick scripting and some fine performances (especially Garrel), it somehow manages to disappoint, because the viewer is left wondering what the point of the exercise is. Maybe the lack of a point is the point, but I really can't be bothered trying to work it out."}, {"id": 264, "text": "Well crafted. The movie connections are a delight for movie lovers, especially fans of the French New Wave, such as myself. What I most dislike with the film is the American boy. Seen in many Hollywood films all the way back to Capra's days, focus is on a very shy (especially for his age, if he would be in his early teens I would find it more plausible) and insecure boy over 20 years of age, satisfied with his state of life - undesperate despite the fact that he has no friends, with a golden heart - the angel of good moral himself who has the right answers for everything, and then comes this beautiful girl and falls in love with him (the girl taking initiative and leading him all the steps to sex of course - well doesn't happen every day, I doubt it ever happens in real life), suddenly everyone starts to like him and he's a 'winner' in the end. Sort of a 'the kind nerd wins'. I just can't buy that anymore. But ok; this isn't a typical 'kind nerd wins' movie, but the those annoying elements were obvious, from the initial beginning to the end, when Matthew speaks about that they should fight with brains - not guns.Otherwise, we have a few pretty beautiful scenes photoed with colorful and sharp film, and the text intro and the last scene, that fades to black and white during Piaff's song (which fitted extremely well there), stand out. Apart from that the cinematography doesn't impress too much. The sound fits well. Garrel managed to satisfy my view of a typical Paris-1960 young man, frequently smoking. Could have been without the incest, made the movie aim for a little too much perhaps, although the combination of two men and a girl was successful. Eva Green was pretty good as well, I particularly liked her imitation from the Dietrich film. Also the Louvre-race is a treat.I feel that Bertolucci missed something about Godard's highly intellectualism. This film is definitely on a lower level than Godard's films, regardless of epoque in his life. Very little classical music, art, quotes, philosophical material, poems...but on the other hand I guess that's not the intention of the film. The script is ok but not by any means impressive. A caleidoscope and nice treat for film buffs rather than a perfectly-framed masterpiece. Hopefully, it might also help introducing the New Wave to the modern audience.7"}, {"id": 265, "text": "Make no mistake, The Dreamers is better than a not bad film. Its pretty OK but still something of a disappointment. The film is supposedly set in Paris in the Spring of 1968 and begins with footage of the battle for the Cinematheque Francaise both original and recreated. Instead of staying in the streets the film retreats to the interior of a grand apartment where the three principals spend most of the following film. It reminds me of the film 1969 (1988) in which while the world around is exploding in crazy ways the principals can only watch from afar as they work out their own personal what used to be called hang-ups.The story concerns a pair of Anglo-French twins and a fresh faced American who moves in with them when the parents go away for a months vacation.There is some strong resemblances to Cocteau's (and Melville's) Les Enfants Terrible (1950). The real disappointment is that once again the cinema has failed to tackle head on the situation of the sixties and the cultural revolution. It is a topic assiduously avoided by mainstream cinema and here, again, merely toyed with by the art cinema.I remember during the summer of '68 Godard sent, with a huge amount of fanfare, a film purporting to be straight from the streets of Paris. It was shown at Lincoln Center and turned out to be one long un-subtitled shot of some students at Nanterre University discussing who knows what. Just to show the audience that he, Godard, knew just what the audience had come for there were occasional flashes of almost subliminal cuts of Parisian Street Action. The audience revolted and someone shut down the film by turning on the lights and causing the screen to ascend to the flies. (The leader of the revolt and stopper of the film was your correspondent.) The theoretical idea might have been that this is what Godard had planned all along- to get people away from the passivity of being an audience and into the streets.Unfortunately most of the audience had already been struggling in the streets of New York and wanted to see what had happened in the streets of Paris. Again, if there are any young people genuinely curious about what it was like in 1968 THE DREAMERS will let them know in only the most oblique way. Cineasts (presumably among the older generations) will enjoy themselves whatever. I still want to see an honest delineation of what it was like in that terrible and wonderful year of 1968. This is just more prevarication and obscuration. Then again if I had found myself in a huge Paris apartment with two young, attractive and willing playmates maybe I would have let the revolution go to hell too.Another great disappointment with the film is the way it get right up close and personal to the subject of bi-sexuality and then criminally, timidly, avoids the whole topic. Apparently it was part of the original story in the book as well as in life. This might be due to commercial considerations, the objection by the management of the star Michael Pitt, or else Bertolucci felt uncomfortable with the parallel which might be drawn with his private life, assumptions caused by drawing attention to his collaborations with his wife Claire Peploe and her brother Mark. Whatever the speculations might be, taking us right up to the edge and not going past was something of an anti-climax. That might be a fitting eulogy for Berolucci's career, so often getting closer to a really important idea than anybody else but then suffering a crisis of either the heart or pocketbook and pulling away leaving the finished product somehow incomplete. BTW: It seems awfully warm for April in Paris but I'd go for it in an instant."}, {"id": 266, "text": "I went to see The Dreamers last night in Islington in London with a Q&amp;A by the writer Gilbert Adair afterwards. I came out feeling I'd watched the rather fragmented fantasies of Bertolucci and Adair (the writer) pining for their youth. The former's fantasies being that of first experiences of young women (deflowering virgins!) and the latter's of the awakening of young men to homosexual feeling and experiences (though Bertolucci seems to win out on the content front as the homoerotic element is only alluded to). That is as maybe - many an arthouse film can thrive on this but unfortunately they seem so in tune with what is going through the characters' heads that they seem to think anyone watching should instinctively know too. As a consequence it left plenty of questions to pretty much most of the audience it seemed. I felt lucky to have had the writer there to give a bit of illumination on the story though he seemed to prefer us to buy the accompanying book to go with it that was on sale in the foyer!  (it apparently gives us insights to the inner thoughts of the characters plus swathes of cut script) Why do the parents leave without a word after finding the protagonists sleeping naked in their trashed apartment?' `What is going on at the end? From the sound of it Bertolucci's creative process of no storyboard and on-the-hoof script rewrites and improvs mean that we are going to be presented with something a bit hit and miss in places though with undoubtedly areas of inspiration. In summary.. I enjoyed it despite some rather threadbare storyline in places - I guess getting the mood right was almost more important than anything for the creators. Perhaps I should just buy the book..."}, {"id": 267, "text": "Tomorrow I have to write my review for my university newspaper, and I have to figure out how to tell a young American audience why they should see this film. And now that I think about it, why should they? They're not all film buffs, they haven't all traveled alone to foreign countries by themselves, they don't live in a revolutionary climate, and they don't have open minds regarding many aspects of sexuality. So why should they see it?Roger Waters once said, The only thing that matters is weather or not it moves you... Well if that's true, then it doesn't matter why they should see The Dreamers, because they will all either love it or hate it, depending on how thoroughly indoctrinated by American culture they are. Personally, this film moved me for similar reasons that High Fidelity moved me... for similar reasons that Lost in Translation moved me... for similar reasons that Punchdrunk Love moved me... You have a media-obsessed American putting his life in perspective during the culture-clash shock of his lifetime, and navigating his emotions the best he can, albeit awkwardly. This film spoke to me as a recent first-time traveler to Europe, as a film buff, as a person who is dealing with the philosophical implications of relationships and politics, and most importantly, as a 20 year old. I found this film hypnotizing, despite the awkward, and far-more-graphic-than-I'm-used-to nude scenes. It wasn't perfect... There were moments that seemed very contrived, as well as an ending that was a little more abrupt than I was hoping for. But mentioning the ending just goes to remind me to mention that this movie was very well shot. The camera shots, at times, get just as intimidating as being in a completely foreign country. The acting was top notch, especially by Louis Garrel, playing Theo (the brother). The soundtrack was groovy, featuring a quality mix of American rock from the late 1960s. All things considered, this study of ideological contrast is worth seeing. You might want to make sure you know an thing or two about French history during the late sixties (not essential, you can still figure out basically what's going on if you--like myself--happen to reek of world-history ignorance). One last note: this film seems to have potential to be a big conversation piece, at least from an American's point of view. I, unfortunately, happened to not have any peers with me at this screening and now feel a slight deficit of the banter that this movie is likely to produce. Feel free to email me if you saw The Dreamers, and want to chat about it."}, {"id": 268, "text": "Let me pitch an idea for a movie.  A group, say three people, are living unreal situations whilst outside in the streets a REAL revolution is going down.  Oh, gee; you're ahead of me on this one, right; been there, seen that, got the tee shirt.  Stand up all those who think I mean Jean Genet's 'The Balcony'.  Yeah, well, okay how about if we change it a tad.  Genet used a FICTIONAL country so how about we set ours in a REAL city (Paris) at a REAL moment in history (1968), not bad, huh, NOW we're cooking with gas and how's this for a switcheroo, throw in a little Jean Cocteau in one of his outr\u00e9 moods (then did he have any non-outr\u00e9 moods) say, Les Enfants Terribles, you know the sort of thing, precocious brother and sister in an unhealthy relationship, then have them come up against a real rube like Longfellow Deeds but go one further than Capra and really CORRUPT him. Englishman Gilbert Adair, who's so precious he probably pronounces his first name Jillbear, thought this one up all by himself based on the one solid fact that he himself was in Paris in May, 1968. I consider myself pretty hip and a film buff but these kids can give me cards and spades.  Consider: It's 1968 and these cats are in their teens which means they had to be born around 1950, but shucks, just quote a speech from 'Queen Christina', made almost twenty years before they were born and they'll come back with the whole megilla - writer, director, stars, even the name of the janitor who swept the Lot. Ask for the name of a film where someone annoys someone else and BAM, ask me something HARD, answer: Fred Astaire, whose dancing in his hotel room bugged Ginger Rogers in the room below.  This stuff is duck soup to these kids so when the brother FAILS to solve sister's charade - she was making vague animal sounds and carrying a faux club - what, YOU didn't get it either?  Shame on you, it was Marlene Dietrich in 'Blonde Venus', EVERYBODY and his Uncle Max knows THAT.  The point is, brother didn't and for a forfeit he has to jack off to Dietrich's portrait as sister and the naive American watch.  See, folks, THIS is how you draw someone into an evil web and begin to corrupt them.  I guess I don't need to tell you the NEXT forfeit ... oh, I DO.  Gee, you looked like an older group.  Well, the brother's idea of a forfeit is to watch his sister making out with their new friend.  That's right, folks, it IS a Doris Day movie - and it might as well be when it comes to a screen near Decatur cos the spoilsport American censors are INSISTING on radical cuts. So, there you have it.  Now the choice is yours.  4/10"}], "reviews_amount": 269}
