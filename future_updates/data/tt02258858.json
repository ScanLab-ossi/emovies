{"name": "Wadjda", "titleId": "tt02258858", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "This film gives us a unique glimpse into a society we know very little about. The story might seem simple at first but as we are witnessing the events unfolding we notice that the story is a lot deeper than that. Underneath the surface of a standard modern society we see how women have to cope in this patriarchal restrictive society. Despite the absurdities that women face every day we can still relate to the characters and the themes in this film. What makes this film so good is how it tells us a story of how people live their lives through the experiences of a little girl. Where dreams can still be realized despite how oppressive things can be. While a sense of optimism always lingering in the background with a healthy dose of humour. A rare but curious journey into a society that seems so different than ours. The director did a great job at telling the everyday story about the Saudi Arabian people without any bias or obvious political agenda. All through the perspective of a charismatic young little girl who just wants a green bicycle.It is good to see films use similar themes but from a different perspective. The film industry is too clouded with uncreativity. I hope this film experience is not the last great adventure from Saudi Arabia."}, {"id": 1, "text": "10-year-old Wadjda lives in Saudi Arabia. She's a bit rebellious, which means she wears basket shoes in school, listens to Western rock at home and has befriended a boy her own age. But she mustn't sing too loud, because the men can hear her and get offended.Wadjda wants to go further and have her own bicycle, which invites trouble in her country. The story is told in a very warm way and you learn one thing. People in cultures totally different from yours are very much like you.Realism here. Everyday people having everyday problems, but not the problems you have. A humanistic film, which makes it concerning everybody."}, {"id": 2, "text": "In a year where Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis became one of youngest Oscar nominees of all time, there's still at least 2 other lead performances by very young girls that deserve an equal amount of recognition. One is Onata Aprile in What Maisie Knew. The other is Waad Mohammed in Wadjda. The existence and quality of the latter film is quite a miracle. It premiered in Venice last year, where the director and lead actress had a bike with them on the red carpet, and, since then won quite an impressive collection of honors from festivals all over the planet. The movie industry in Saudi-Arabia is practically non-existent to this day, so the creation and shooting of the film ran permanently into obstacles, especially as it's the first Saudi-Arabian movie ever filmed by a woman, but the final result is definitely worth all the hassle. I'm happy to see that just a day ago or two, this film got the honor of being the very first film from Saudi-Arabia that got submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and will compete for the foreign language Oscar in about 6 months from now.In the center of it, we have Waad Mohammed playing a headstrong little girl named Wadjda. We see her everyday-life at an all-girls school and at home with her mother, whose approach to life clearly seems to have rubbed off on her. Haifaa Al-Mansour depicts the life of females in Saudi-Arabia in a very compelling manner. The best thing about the film is that all the examples of discrimination and misogyny are either very subtle or in a manner that isn't remotely instigative or in the viewer's face at all, for example in the scene where those girls that are on their period have to cover their hands before touching their Korans. But they are not shocked as a reaction, they're giggling just like kids would in this scenario. The director went for realism and quiet convincibility throughout the whole film, such as when Wadjda has her dream crushed towards the end we don't get to see a huge breakdown or tears, but instead she stands there suffering quietly, which is as least as sad to watch.In addition to those parts relevant to current society issues in Saudi-Arabia, the film is also genuinely funny on lots of parts. The ways in which Wadjda tries to get together the money in order to realize her dream of getting that beautiful green bike are a riot and so are her conversations with her mother and her friend Abdullah. It's simply impossible to resist her and her highly-infectious smile and that goes for everybody in the cinema audience as well as everybody she interacts with in the film. I recommend this film very much. It's an impressive result looking at the struggles during its shooting and the fact that literally none of the actors had any previous experience in the profession at all. Beyond Mohammed in the lead, we also get convincing portrayals of grown women by those actresses who play the mother and the headmistress."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I was eager to see Wadjda, often publicized as the first Saudi Arabian film, which is not exactly the case but it is the first that got such recognition and is the first by a female director. I thought it would be an interesting experience to witness. The fact that it was a female director made me even more curious as women rights in Saudi Arabia are known to be a controversial issue and is mostly what the outside world is exposed to about Saudi Arabia.Wadjda is a young girl who doesn't like school that much and is often reprimanded by the teachers for her rebellious behavior. Things aren't much better at home as her mom struggles with driver issues and her father is seeking a second wife. Wadjda doesn't seem to have many friends at school, but she has a friend who lives in the neighborhood, young boy named Abdullah. He has a bicycle which becomes Wadjda's obsession and decides to get one for herself, despite this not being tolerated in the Kingdom. Nevertheless, Wadjda starts saving up her money to buy one. The nearest shop owner has one and after some discussion she manages to have him keep it for her until she gathers the money. In the meantime, she allows Abdullah to put up lamps from their house, for his uncle's political party's gathering. In exchange, he lets her ride his bicycle. When her school launches a Quran reciting contest, Wadjda works hard to win the prize money which would allow her to finally buy the bicycle.I really enjoyed Wadjda. It was fresh, with a colorful dose of rebellion and the sweetness of a child's dream. In many aspects, it reminded me of the Iranian film Children of Heaven (1997). It seems to portray a good look at life in Saudi Arabia. The acting was really good and it made me enjoy the film more because I ended up rooting for Wadjda. Some moments will feel tender, some will be really cringe-worthy and some will feel real. It is probably the strength of the movie that the viewer will go through such a range of emotions. It also shows things that will feel strange to foreign eyes without ever seeming judgmental or preachy.The film is not flawless by any means, and I found it to have some down times and some scenes that did not quite fit in as fluidly in the movie as others. But it didn't prevent me from enjoying it as a whole. I found it clever, thoughtful and most of all, it made me think and feel. On top of that, it always feels good to see what could be a pioneering movie.I liked: Playful, clever. A story line that pulls you in. Good children actors.I disliked: Some scenes do not fit in as well, I felt they were put to highlight the local colors.79/100 I'd recommend it to anyone into foreign film. Hopefully, Wadjda is only the first of many.Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com"}, {"id": 4, "text": "Wadjda is a beautiful movie that speaks of female victimization in a culture that uses false notions of truth and propriety to achieve its purpose of subverting and controlling women. The question that follows is by whom and for whose benefit? Interestingly, the suggested answer is that subversion is performed by women for men's benefit. The movie reveals the intricacies of the process of subversion where no male figure in particular is brought to the forefront to do the job but a culture of women who internalized masculine values take over and start subverting the younger generation of women in their world, the world that the movie takes interest in and represents. The biggest advocate of such subversion is the school headmistress, who mercilessly condemns and labels young innocent girls with indecency and sin. If they play in the schoolyard while men workers are structuring a building at a distance, then the girls are described as indecent. If girls are painting stars and figures on their legs and are afraid of the soiling practice, they are suspected and wrongly accused of committing a larger sin, lesbianism. The stiff headmistress does not hesitate in announcing their names to the school community without verifying the accusation. The mild defense of the falsely accused students is swept aside by the mistress adamant condemnation. Her ultimatum is that holding hands is forbidden between girls in the school.The headmistress' distorted notion of right and wrong is also evident her retrieval of the monetary prize she gave Wadjda, the protagonist of the movie. Wadjda worked hard to win this prize but lost it to charity upon innocently declaring she wanted to use it to get a bike. The headmistress accused Wadjda of violating decency for harboring such an intention and denied her the prize. Under the claim that any girl who fears for her honor should never ride a bike, the headmistress sends the money to charity without waiting for the consent of the prize winner.The culture of women that internalize masculine teachings and parrot false notions of what a woman can and cannot do includes Wadjda's mother who allows herself to be victimized by such culture and constantly attempts to impose its values on her daughter. The mother's victimization is evident in her acceptance of a harsh life with a husband who is absent most of the time. She takes care of herself, her daughter and the house. She pays for expenses while he grudges small things for his daughter. He entertains guests and she cooks for them. In addition to all responsibilities, Wadjda's mother has a job to which she makes a daily trip of an hour and a half drive with a bad-tempered driver in an unconditioned car in hot weather. A more convenient job in a nearby hospital offers itself but she cannot take it because men mix with women in such work sites. She interprets her husband's jealous possessiveness as love and accepts her lot because she loves him. He is the first and last man in her life. Wadjda is the only promise in a culture of victimized women that are constantly on the go to victimize the next generation of younger women for masculine benefit. Her attitude is marked by her insistence to achieve her dream of getting a bike in order to compete with a neighboring boy who is brought up into man's superiority over women but gradually converts into admiring his female friend by deciding to marry her when he grows up.A more significant support comes from Wadjda's mother who buys her the bike she dreams of at the end. But under what conditions does this occur, for the mother has always echoed the culture by telling Wadjda that she can't get one; girls are not supposed to ride bikes or else they will never conceive? The mother actually receives a blow that becomes an eye opener. Her husband, Wadjda's father, marries another woman to bear him a male son that Wadjda's mother could not get him following complications in her first pregnancy and baby delivery. The mother finally realizes her own victimization and her wrong parroting of false cultural values. There and then she decides to give her daughter the longed for bike, the key to freedom. A beautiful movie that objectively and subtly exposes and condemns cultural victimization of women and rewards a young girl's quest for freedom. The bike becomes a symbol of such freedom as Wadjda rides it fearlessly and boldly to the main road."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Its not often i find foreign movies that touch me deeply. I loved this movie and was surprised how well this movie was made. Waad Mohammed played her part extraordinary where she took us viewers on her journey. I both laughed, cried, got angry and got happy when i saw this movie. I am so happy the movie ended the way it did, i don't want to give away any spoilers here but during the whole movie i was scared something would happen hehehe. Thankfully it ended as it ended. This movie also show a sense of determination. Doesn't matter what country you are from or the age, we all have a dream. And how far a determination, patience and hope can take you. I love the fact we saw a raw view of Saudi and i truly enjoyed watching this movie. Well done for the incredible director for by Haifaa Al-Mansour! Such a joy to have seen this movie"}, {"id": 6, "text": "In Wadjda writer/director Haifaa Al Mansour parallels the stories of 10-year-old Wadjda and her mother. Both play the system by the rules and are betrayed. The mother serves her husband perfectly except in denying him a son. That's because she almost died giving birth to Wadjda so won't bear again. He's proud of the food she prepares for his friends. He loves her still. Nonetheless he still burns her heart by taking a second wife. Wadjda works hard enough on the Koran competition to win the money for the bike she wants but the school principal denies her the prize.Both are courageous enough to go their own way, in the face of convention or decorum. When her husband takes a second wife the first one goes her own way and cuts her hair, which he'd preferred long and smooth. She will live for herself now not for him. When she tells Wadjda that from now on It's just the two of us, she seems primed to join her cousin working in the hospital, with men, without the burka. By buying the bike she's enabling Wadjda to be her own self too, instead of submitting to the prejudice against girls riding bikes.Our last view of Wadjda is on her bike, at an intersection, open roads before her, as she warily looks for what's coming. That describes her mother's new position as well. That could be the situation for women throughout the Arab world \u2014 or not, if the traditionalists have their regressive way. Of the two men who watch Wadjda cycle by, one smiles at her appreciatively but the older one shakes his head rueful.Though the film seems critical of the society's hidebound sexism it is not critical of Islam. The recited sections of the Koran express values of justice, citizenship and humanity that we all should find amenable. If there are faults they are in the officials' abuses of that faith and in the citizens' unexamined prejudices.

Seeing how the limitations placed on women in Saudi Arabia play out in everyday life was of great interest to all of us. The story line depicted not only Wadjda's efforts to break free from her circumscribed world, but also how adult women struggle to survive. The effort to simply support oneself without a man when one can't even drive or wear clothes that allow for mobility reflects how rules ostensibly meant to protect women keep them dependent on men for the most rudimentary basics.I suspect that even this film does not depict the lives of women in Saudi Arabia completely accurately. Some concessions seem to have been made to the government. No religious police are to be seen, for example. Nonetheless, it is well worth seeing, and we applaud Haifaa al-Mansour for making it. We look forward to her future work."}, {"id": 8, "text": "In short, this is your typical, stereotypical movie designed to appease a Western audience. Nothing more than mainstream media propaganda.If you are a Westerner looking for a movie that fits your preconceptions about the 'Other' (here being the orient, the Arab/Muslim world or more specifically Saudi Arabia) then this is your movie! You are guaranteed to return home feeling good about yourself and what you have long thought about that part of the world through your mainstream media.In Wadjda you've got it all: oppression, polygamy, dictatorship, child abuse, labour abuse, early marriage, hypocrisy, gender discrimination and even terrorism (that part about the young man who blew himself up to win 70 virgins in heaven was so artificially and forcefully pushed into the script)! All your stereotypes packed in 98 minutes.Wadjda offers absolutely nothing new. I may have seen it tens of times before. Sadly, it is a cheap, pathetic start for a director.It lacks a great deal of authenticity and does not give an honest picture of that part of the world. It undermines both the intellect and intent of genuine viewers.I give it two scores for the performance of children, in particular that of Abdullah, the little boy who played the role of Wadjda's friend."}, {"id": 9, "text": "So, with no budget, no celebrities, no digital effects, no gunfights, it's must be a crap if we call for the standards in actual entertainment. Wrong, emotion is such that it's the best movie of the year so far. Not bad for a country that has apparently no public theaters!Saudi Arabia is a paradox for me: a holy land, doted with gold but where life can be as harsh as in the Dark Ages. In that way, this movie lifts indeed the veil (!) of this oppression: the feminine is really viewed as aggressive thus leading to its confinement: no right to drive, rules for shopping, schools, polygamy. Thus, as soon as the movie begun, I became tense and anxious as I was in constant fear to see those courageous mother and daughter crushed by the society. Now that I know that they are finally safe and victorious, I think that the movie would be worthy new visions to enjoy it freely. In a way, I lived the societal pressure that exists over there and it's a proof of the talent of the director. The movie is subtle, filled with compassion and not rage. I can't really say if a society turns bad because of bad people, or are people become mean because of society? So, a big surprise here is to meet that even women can believe in that segregation. The school director is an interesting character because her depiction shows that we are all humans after all and that we can say a thing and do another.Besides this, another appeal of this movie was to discover Riyadh. I expected to see a shining capital whereas the town looks dusty and a bit derelict: the stores are empty, the cars are old and the buildings are poorly furnished. Finally, Wadjda is a truly sweet kid and Waad, a fine actress as she can shows her inner feelings in a simple and delicate way. Torn by her familial roots and societal rules, she can only find peace with her dreams, her loving mother and a true friend. I think they would be a happy couple or will she face the fate described in the book Girls of Riyhad that makes the same fuss in this country that this movie !"}, {"id": 10, "text": "I am so very late to interact with such a good story from a place under the veil.To me that little bi-cycle is the main protagonist ... It silently removed the sarcastic veil from the society of Saudi-Arabia .. I can tell it would create a great impact and be a milestone to change not only the language of Saudi Arabian film industry but also for the Saudi women .Wadjda's cute little play-mate Abdullah represents the perspective of the changing views towards woman in the society. although they are little in number but they are growing ....From a film student point of view it is a story illustrated very harmonically..and endeavors as the first woman film maker are great. I invite everyone to watch it"}, {"id": 11, "text": "The movie was kind boring. the production design, cinematography, and acting was bad comparing to some Saudi Short Films Spoilers Ahed... There is lots of things aren't true and presented in a wrong way. First of all,Riding a bike isn't a boy thing, it a girl thing too in fact I have five sisters and they all had bikes when they were young, which makes the movie fantasy story.2- Wjda's mom understand why her husband is getting married so her smoking doesn't make sense. if this is why she smoking3- Shown a 13 year old getting married at this time is wrong, If this movie set 40 years ago I would be OK with it, but its not happening any more4-, the school taking off the prize because she chooses to buy a bike and not donating is the biggest WTF moment for all the people who were watching with me. THAT never happened anywhere in KSA! Donation is an option it always has been and it always will be.Please Ignore any mistakes. English is my second language"}, {"id": 12, "text": "First, let it be said that Wadjda is well worth watching because you never see feature films coming out of Saudi Arabia. But let it be admitted, too, that it is pretty short on dramatic effect. Not much holds you from one scene to the next, and there are stretches that might leave you nodding off to sleep.But what stood out for me especially was the social context, which baffled me at a number of places. The girl's father returns home from ... I didn't understand quite where. Why had he left? Why was he returning? Was he returning as a normal father, to the home where he lives with his wife and daughter, or was it going to be a just a flying visit? Saudis may have an instinctive understanding of what was going on, but I didn't. Later there is a man playing a video game in the living room. I couldn't make out who he was. Nothing in the dialogue seemed to help. He didn't look like the father. Why he was there and why he left was a mystery. The father apparently was thinking of taking a second wife, but his plan didn't seem to be to keep both wives in one house. I then thought he would be planning to split his time between two households. But at the end of the story he announces (not even to his wife's face, the dirty coward) that he is getting married, and this turns out to mean he's completely abandoning Wadjda and her mother. Is that acceptable in Saudi Arabia? He tells the girl to tell her mother that he loves her. What? He loves her, but he throws her away because the first child she bore for him was only a girl, and now she is unable to have another. What good is a woman who can't bear boy children? Love her or not, she is worthless, a well that has run dry. Another puzzle for me had to do with two girls in trouble at school for committing a sin. All I could see was that one of them was drawing with a black marker on her ankle, like a tattoo, which the school principal didn't even see. Their sin was a mystery to me, as was why that episode was included in the story. It's all very bizarre.I'm all for trying to understand each other's culture, but I have to say that I've never seen a more disgusting culture than the one portrayed in this movie. There are just no words for the treatment of women. Keep your voices down, girls. You don't want the men in the other room to hear you. Girls, why are you here? The men working on the building next door can see you. Get inside! And on and on. The system seems to set women and girls up as breeding cattle, penned in and at the service of their men. Wadjda's mother's only interest in her future seems to be to marry her off to somebody. I have to say that the overall obsession with sex in society is horrible, worse than Western pornography, not because it is too open about sex, but because most of life seems to revolve around sex, and in particular keeping it in chains -- for the female half of the population. Another repulsive feature of Saudi life is how religion of the very worst kind dominates, the mere memorizing of passages from scripture, passages that have no inherent appeal, not a shred of enlightenment, humanity or poetry, only straightforward instructions about obedience and punishment. And on the edges of official religion we get glimpses of superstition, such as Don't leave your Koran open, or the devil will spit in it. Ycchh!Be prepared to like the little girl, who is very appealing. Don't expect, though, to see a girl of great courage calling into question important issues in the Saudi way of life. Her rebellion (too strong a word) is pathetically modest. She doesn't really understand what she is doing. You'll enjoy seeing her male friend, too, who is generous and truly likes her, although I did find it a little weird when he asked, Wadjda, you know I want to marry you when we get older. There was nothing timid or tentative about it. He wasn't making a request, not asking for her consent; it seemed like simply making a claim, and that she would have very little to say about it when the time comes for him to get what he wants. So even though the boy is likable, the seeds of an ugly dominance are there and, as someone else has commented here, in a few years he will be a typical Saudi man with his foot on the neck of all the women in his circle. So enjoy her, enjoy him, enjoy their friendship, but be prepared to loathe pretty much all of what you see of Saudi society."}, {"id": 13, "text": "First of all i have seen so many movies from different countries with different budgets so i can tell this one is the worst on every level. I was curious about Wadjda because it is the first movie that made entirely in Saudia by Saudi director and actors. I think the biggest problem of Wadjda is the same with all other TV Shows around here which is the writing, The second fail is the poor acting, as usual the actors don't feel the words they say like they are reading it directly from the script papers. I think that little boy is the only one can actually act and that's why i rated it 2/10 instead of 1/10.I watched on my laptop and i couldn't believe it when i finished watching that one and a half boring hour unfortunately can't get back and i am so shocked that they submitted it to be in race for best foreign language Oscar . In short, the movie will give a very wrong ideas about (Marriage-Hejab-School-Jobs-Islam) So don't waste your time on a movie full of lies.This is my first review of the first Saudi film from a Saudi guy, I hope you find it helpful not spoiling and take my word for it."}, {"id": 14, "text": "i am a Saudi filmmaker and i saw the film was fairly produced and proud of the saudi cast and there performing , i hoped we had more Saudis in the production process but its fine with me , \\my note is i guess haifaa al-mansoor has exaggerated somehow to create a dramatic issues , and with this i mean the ending you will never ever find any school that will donate a student prize to whomever its totally not connected to Saudi reality , i do agree with some of the problems that Haifa put through the scenes but i totally disagree with some also overall , thanks guys its kinda good start .."}, {"id": 15, "text": "'Wadjda' is an important and sensitively observed film from Saudi Arabia that gently reveals the individual humanity that exists under the blanket of draconian oppression. The denunciations of the conservative and repressive Islamic revival movement resulted in the closure of cinemas throughout the country during the 1970s and 80s. When last I heard, there was but one cinema in Saudi Arabia and its programming was limited to the screening of documentaries. Against the constraining backdrop of such institutionalised theocratic illiberality was produced this insightful portrait of relationships in a society segregated based upon gender.Made with Western support, 'Wadjda' is a pioneering film in many ways and the first feature length Saudi production to be filmed in the country. Written and directed by a woman, Haifaa Al-Mansour, it successfully balances the youthful rebelliousness of its charming and joyful young protagonist with an involving and thought-provoking examination of the issues faced by women in such a deeply patriarchal society. Al-Mansour has, in interviews, drawn attention to some small and gradual changes in Saudi culture that reflect a societal awareness of a world beyond the strict confines of their kingdom. ''Saudi is a different place than it was for girls of my generation, and the new generation has access to information and different cultures and ideas that we couldn't even imagine growing up'', she said. She has also touched upon censorship laws and how she met those guidelines in order to create a movie that would meet with official approval. This is not a radical or militant picture but rather a subtle exploration of societal dynamics and the gradual change that might be achieved by working within the system.At the centre of the film is the titular heroine, a spirited 10 year-old girl who wishes to own her own bicycle. Waad Mohammed, in a delightfully touching, exuberant and idiosyncratic performance, portrays this young girl who refuses to have her spirit quashed by repression. She wears Western style shoes and ribbons in her hair and is resourceful, quick-witted and clever. She forms a friendship with a local boy and sells her ribbons to raise money. She enters a Koran recitation contest with youthful irreverence and the sole motive of putting the prize money towards realising her dream of owning her own bicycle and taking her friend on in a race. These scenes offer terrific examples of the director working within official guidelines yet managing at the same time to imbue a dash of nuanced impudence to her characters and observations.The delicacy and gentle subversion of long-time strictures makes 'Wadjda' an immensely heartwarming, uplifting and beautiful viewing experience. The interactions between mother (Reem Abdullah) and daughter contain great compassion and gentleness and the quiet understanding that is evident in the scenes between the two actresses radiates an enchanting, if sometimes melancholic, warmth. The soaring yet simple imagery of the concluding scenes that show the extent of the love between mother and daughter is inspired and powerful yet full of a gentle, mellow appreciation of the tenderness and closeness of their bond and their shared awareness and understanding of the female experience in Saudi society. 'Wadjda' is a stirring and wonderfully acted tribute to the inherent beauty of humanity and the irrepressible nature of the human spirit. It is a cinematic milestone and it is also a gem of a film."}, {"id": 16, "text": "The movie was shot in 2012 by a director Haifaa Al-Mansour. Interesting fact is that Haifaa Al-Mansour is the first woman movie director in Saudi Arabia history. She is director and in same time writer of the movie. The film was shown in many countries and different festivals. The main plot of this movie is about little girl Wadjda. She lives usual life as all other Saudi girls. She studies at school where only girls study, learns how woman should behave in Saudi society. She lives with mother. Her father comes to home at times, then it comes that her father marries to another woman, because wife could not give him a boy. The dream of Wadjda to ride a bicycle with her friend leads her to participate in Quran recitation competition, because winner of competition gets money which she can buy a bicycle. She is a rebel as she doesn't listen other's opinion and wants to do what she wants. For example, when two girls get caught painting nails which was forbidden in that society, she helped them. Moreover, the dream of riding a bike itself is not accessible in Saudi society. Anyways, she wants to get a bike. She prepared for the competition and successfully wins. But, when she is asked where she wants to spend this money, she answered to buy a bike. Director of the school doesn't give her money because riding a bike for girl is not accessible and politely forces her to donate money for help in Palestine. Even though, she does all the criteria of competition and fairly wins it, she doesn't get the prize. I mean she wins the money but spends it without own will. However, in the end her mother buys long-waited bicycle. However, movie gives such an impression that not only Wadjda is suffering under strict rules of the society. Two girls can't paint nails as they want, little girl marries to a man who is far older than she without her will, her mother as being needless when she can't give a birth and etc. All of it show the repressive role of Saudi women in society. Director did very good job by showing all these problems by a simple story of Wadjda. My argument is that such movies are very important as it makes others to think about women in conservative society and influences people's opinion about women's role. Men in conservative society might think that their wife, daughters are living good, happy life, because they always see them smiling but it's because girls have to smile and obey men. In a lot of cases men don't know the true feelings of women and hurts their feelings. For example, in movie, father of Wadjda never tries to understand what's going on with his daughter. When she comes home with winning certificate and crying, he asked her why she is crying, however after the call he forgets about it and just leaves. It shows father's attitude toward own daughter. In my opinion, if Wadjda was a boy, father would help to him to solve his problem. As men are more respectful rather than women. Movies have a power of showing the real feelings of people, with good actors and cinematography, and this movie accomplished own aim. This movie illustrates true life of a women in Saudi society. The actors played their character very well, and more importantly the colors of movie are like in real life without any exaggeration and extra color. While watching you really feel the atmosphere of Saudi life. Nowadays it's very difficult to make a good movie without colors, action and other graphics. However, this movie was good with its plot, atmosphere and message. All these elements of cinematography play very important role in people's acceptance of movie. If it's done very good, it really helps to see the problem and leads to solution. As I said before movie shows not only the story of Wadjda but all women in Saudi society. Her dream of riding a bike is a metaphor of freedom. Even though, people say that girl doesn't ride a bike because after she can't give a birth, Wadjda bravely stays to her own position. All girls have a dream of doing something or getting something, but because of old conservative tradition they can't get what they want and living unhappy life. Socially constructed opinion which took its background from religion prohibits a lot of simple things to do for women without any logical justification. Religion portrays women and men differently, giving dominance for men and women as their helpers. For instance, it's not logical to believe that girls can't give a birth if she rides a bike, and director indicates that such socially constructed taboos should be stopped. In my opinion, character Abdullah, Wadjda's friend and neighbor is a good example of man before absorbing all socially constructed conservative opinion, as in the end movie he says to Wadjda that when he gets older, he wants to marry Wadjda. He doesn't see any problem of riding a bike with girl. It seems like director wants to show that hope is in the hand of young generation and adults' role is to give them right upbringing. In conclusion, this movie illustration of how religion can shape the society and the movies play very important role in showing such problems and influence on people especially for children. We should notice that Saudi Arabia is moving toward more tolerant society, as they allowed to drive for women. I think that if women are allowed to drive a car, it's not a big deal with bicycle right now. It's a product of such movies, activists and movements."}, {"id": 17, "text": "What it's like to be a Saudi girl? Interestingly, this film is the first movie directed by a woman from Saudi Arabia whose name is Haifa al-Mansoor. Moreover, it was one of the first movies produced in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and that intrigues you even more. What to expect from it? The movie provides a proper insight into the cultural life of Arabic women in KSA and raises many social issues occurring there. But the main focus is a story about a little brave girl, Wadjda, and her way in achieving her goal - buying a bike. I find this film suitable for all ages and traditions, and some of you may even find yourselves in this delightful movie.While you are watching the film, you gain a lot of understanding of how women live in traditional Saudi families and what difficulties they face. The major striking fact that immediately catches attention is the obligation to wear black long loose clothes, called hijabs, abayas or nikabs, from the very young age. For example, while being at school, Wadjda was admonished by the school principal to cover her face as it was one of the school rules, even though it was against her own will. Another fact is that all girls study at schools separate from boys where they receive and sharpen religious knowledge. This can be considered an evidence of gender segregation. Girls are not allowed to talk to boys and are obliged to avoid being seen by men. For instance, when men were working near the school campus at a distance so that they can accidently see girls, these girls had to enter the building. And those who did not do so received a rebuke from a teacher. One more issue is a burden carried by women whose husbands are willing to take another wives and an emphasis on preference for sons. Wadjda's mother could not bear a boy and despite the love between her and her husband, and all efforts she made to please him, he finally decides on marrying another woman. Overall, there were many other issues behind the plot that could be considered.However, to my view it is not simply a representation of women's life, but a story about courage and purposefulness. The movie tries to remind its viewers how ambitious we were at the young age and that in spite of all the cultural or religious obstacles, and doubts heard from the people around, you can pass your way and become the winner! Wadjda experienced hardships at school, in the family and was forbidden to chat with her male friend named Abdullah (or any boys). In addition, riding bikes which Wadjda sincerely dreamed off were prohibited for Saudi girls. But she was passionate about buying it despite the lack of money in order to beat Abdullah in the race and make her dream come true. After all, she did not only pursue her dream but also gained a close friend, won a Quran recitation competition and hardened the spirit. Another role enjoyed by me is Wadjda's mother. Her soft nature and sincere efforts made to keep her family unit deserve respect. Moreover, in the end the movie shows supportive attitude towards the child and softness of mother's heart. This story gives hope for the brighter future and reminds of truly important things as mother's love and care, friendship and ambitiousness.The actress's role played by Waad Mohammed was pretty dignified... I thought at first. But when I found out that she had no previous acting experience, I was amazed even more! She could perfectly use gestures and convey Wadjda's temper and individualism. What for the accompanying music, there were none except Quranic recitation which was calming and sounded really well. There I want to mention another catchy moment which is the prohibition of music in Saudi Arabia. An evidence of this is seen when Wadjda listens to the music in her room and her mom responds saying that she had better not to do so. Regarding the cinematography, I think the movie was quite successfully filmed and could convey the atmosphere of the suburb areas of Saudi Arabia. Taking into account the fact that it was filmed in 2012 and was the first movie which was completely produced in KSA, the movie leaves a profound impression. Along the film, you see the village which was built on the desert, women and men dressed distinctively in black and white and many other scenes that altogether bring the arabic atmosphere.To sum up, the film is worth watching and gives a lot to think about. It not only covers the cultural aspects of Arabic women's lives, but also gives a motivation and leaves the viewer in a pleased and satisfied condition. Definitely recommended for watching!"}, {"id": 18, "text": "My opinion about Islam as a religion was grim. I viewed muslims, especially women, as people who consciously limited what other people tend to enjoy: diet, clothes and life. Enjoyment of life was limited because of the terrorists who sacrifice their life to kill and frighten society. Diet and clothes were limited because of dietary law and rule of wearing black clothes for women. However, Wadjida has depicted these elements as the ones that are present in the life of muslims. Wadjida is a paradigm shifting movie, whose compelling message was corroborated by plot, visuals and conclusions. Wadjida is the name of the main protagonist who is studying in the medrese. She is a young girl who lives with her married mother. Her father is occasionally visiting them giving money to sustain their life. Since his current spouse is unable to bear a son for him, he wants to marry another woman, second wife. To secure her role as the only wife Wadjida's mother uses every mean at her disposal: she cooks a delicious dishes, when her husband brings a company to the house, and plans to buy a beautiful red dress for the next celebration. During this uneasy time Wadjida is studying in medrese, saving up money by selling home weaved bracelets and listening to remarks of headmistress about her improper behavior. Exhausting last means of earning money (headmistress had found illegal merchant), she is left with only one way - recital competition of Qur'an with first prize in 1000 riyals. Wadjida enters religion club and begins diligent practice. Because of her hard work she successfully recites Qur'an before the whole school and wins first prize. However, when asked how she will utilize the money, Wadjida said that she will buy a bicycle, headmistress forcefully donated 1000 riyals, around 270 USD. At home she learns that across the road her father is marrying a second wife and because of that her mother gives her bicycle that she bought on money that were saved for red dress. There is no skyscrapers In this city. The environment resembles a desert. Despite streets being desolated Wadjida is enjoying life by playing with the neighbour kid. Such scenes show that the life is in the full swing there. Sand colored road, cars and houses are main ingredients in the scenery that are diluted by the variegated colors of inner house, proposing that true colors are inside. For instance, the red dress that Wadjida's mother wants to buy is vivid red. It would be strange to wear it on the streets, but it harmonizes with inner ambiance of the house. Another example is juxtaposition of gaming console that her father uses to play games and Wadjida using radio recorder to record music and then selling it to girls in medrese. It shows how modernity is invading this conservative environment. There are messages in the movie that compete with each other: follow Islamic law, that regulates how women should behave - if you want to break existing norms do not openly announce it. Medrese headmistress is deeply concerned with Wadjida's not womenly behavior - selling of accessories, recordings of foreign music for young girls. On the other hand, her mother is more concerned with public opinion: she does not like how her friend does not wear black clothes in public place or how neighbor boy was alone with Wadjida (she mentions that is her father discovered them he would kill her). But she does not notice polish on her nails and even buys a bicycle that Wadjida craved, instructing her that she should not be announcing that she wants a bicycle in front of whole school. Being flexible is an attribute of her mother, that can be seen during attempts to attract her husband back. Another illustrative episode is when driver who takes her to work stops transporting her due to her unpunctuality, she attempts to bargain his service back. Wadjida approaches it differently. She with her friend directly threaten him. Movie Wadjida has altered my mindset about the Islam. Before watching the movie I had a few prejudices towards muslims who was following Islamic law, but now I am once again feeling that we should not have strong opinion about things that we have not experienced. This movie has demonstrated that muslims, especially, women, can have all the things that we do not attribute them. While women have lifestyle, restricted by religion, they still have same desires that non-muslims have. The plot presented in the movie would be common in Western movie, but the direction infused it with Islam romanticism and placed into Islam setting. I would like to show this movie to my family so that they would discover the life of people in Arab Emirates. So I definitely recommend it to watching everyone who wants to widen the horizon."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I don't think that guys from regions other than the middle east, would really appreciate the revolution this movie represents. A revolution on everything we have been taught as kids, and have taken for granted as it is  the ultimate truth  . A revolution on every certainty that turned out not to necessarily be a certainty.It's like u've always been watching Hollywood movies, and all of a sudden u find out about the European cinema with all the differences between the two in presenting the ideas,handling them and what not. This movie also provides,for those who are from other regions, a very cultural overview of the life style of most middle eastern families, on what basis they get married and how they treat their children, for the most part."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I enjoy watching this movie every now and then for both the negative and positive aspects of it. I think the movie is very well done and the acting is superb. The plot is simple and delightful. The journey to get there, however, is filled with...religious BS, which is part of their culture.If you didn't understand the culture and religious zealots of middle easterners then this should be an eye opener. You get everything,1. Women treated below men 2. Women's right non-existent 3. Division of the various region/tribe or what have you 4. The constant barrage of the Koran and its teaching everywhere, especially in the school. 5. The many ridiculous behaviors people have towards and in regards to the Koran (don't leave the Koran open or the devil will spit in it). 6. The brainwash of the people and kids with this religious stuff.Don't get me wrong, this is their culture. This is how they are. Whether I like it or not bears little to change. I'll leave that up to more distinguish people to tackle.The above is what makes this movie more real and in a sense enjoyable for me. It doesn't try to hide any of it but rather subtly injects them every now and then with the exception of religion. The religion prevalent throughout the movie.There's also the part of the old culture mixed in with the modern world era. Things like giant flat screens, games, cell phones and all that is part of their lives. It is very interesting to see the adoption of some modern advances alongside the strict and unyielding religious dogma that Islam is."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Just got out from the cinema I was watching Wadjda the first feature-length movie to be shot entirely in Saudi Arabia and made by a female Saudi director, Haifaa Al-Mansour. It won numerous awards at film festival around the world.Wadjda showed a realistic suffer which was always covered and hidden. It rises a voice against the oppression that Saudi women face. Also it shows how women are the real enemy for themselves once they support each other and stand against the male suppression they can do something.Simply, it is wonderful, I loved it. It is unmissable, it is MUST to see film.

Women in the Middle East often lead double lives, keeping one foot in tradition and another in the modern world. It's a difficult and blurred line to hold. I applaud this film for bringing that reality to light.I hope what people take away from this film, more than anything, is how similar we all are.

She makes bracelets and sells them to classmates in order to raise the money to buy the bike. Her school has a Koran reading contest with prize money for her dream to come true. Waad Mohammed is perfect as Wadjda, as she appears in virtually every scene without missing a beat. The message is universal, and I can remember how much my two older brothers and I craved new Schwinn bicycles to ride the streets of Ossining, New York in the 1960s; a different time and a different place, but it doesn't really matter; kids around the world are all the same inside. From start to finish, a wonderful film."}, {"id": 24, "text": "When it comes to women in Saudi Arabia, don't expect any gargantuan steps. Of course this is a society where women are not allowed to drive. So the release of Haifaa Al-Mansour's 'Wadjda', the first feature by a Saudi female director, should be considered groundbreaking. Given the constraints placed on women, it's amazing 'Wadja' was made at all; at times, director Al-Mansour was forced to direct the film via walkie-talkie from a van, as she was not permitted to mingle with men, while filming.But it's better to look at the film objectively and evaluate it like any other film as opposed to admiring it simply because it also represents a first-time, pioneering effort. The story is simple: Wadjda is a young girl who lives with her mother and attends an all-girls state-run school. The father is usually not at home, having given up on his wife who has not produced a son, and now may be searching for a second wife, much to Wadjda's mother's chagrin.Wadjda befriends a bicycle-riding boy, Abdullah, and her goal is to best him in a bicycle race. All she has to do is come up with the cash to purchase a bicycle at a local store. She finally has a chance of realizing her dream by earning the top prize in a Koran-reading contest at school. 'Wadjda' is on solid ground as a critique of Saudi society's treatment of women. Reem Abdullah as Wadjda's mother steals the show as a woman constantly placed in untenable situations. When we're first introduced to her, she is dependent on a male driver, who she depends on to drive her a long distance to her job. The driver eventually declines to transport her anymore as he claims the mother is always late, and it takes a little trickery on the part of Wadjda and Abdullah to get him to change his mind (Abdullah pretends that he has an 'uncle' who can get him deported as apparently the driver is not a Saudi citizen).Much worse than the situation with the driver, is Wadjda's mother's status in the home. When faced with the prospect of her husband taking a second wife, she pleads, I'm the original brand, why are you leaving for an imitation? The mother is a nuanced character as she also has a conservative, insular outlook, typical of most people in Saudi society. She criticizes a friend who has taken a job at a hospital, where she greets people without wearing a scarf to hide her face. And when Wadjda asks whether it's okay that Abdullah use their roof to hang up some wire across a courtyard to promote his uncle's election campaign, she refuses with the close-minded retort that Abdullah's relatives did not belong to their family's 'tribe'. Wadjda's school is also a hotbed of sedition amongst the young girl and teenagers who attend there. Wadjda's protest takes the form of wearing sneakers as opposed to the standard issue shoes the girls are supposed to wear. Wadjda keeps quiet when two older girls are accused of forbidden activities including reading women's magazines, putting on makeup and drawing tattoos on their ankles as well as some chaste meetings with boys and even fraternizing among themselves in too friendly a manner. The school is run with an iron hand by the hypocritical Miss Hussa, who is rumored to have had an affair with a man but warms up to Wadjda when she decides to enter the Koran-reading contest.When Wadjda wins the contest, it didn't make a lot of sense that she confesses she's planning to buy the bicycle with the prize money as the end result is that Miss Hussa reneges on the offer and instead, donates the money for Palestinian aid (in reality, Wadjda's smart enough not to act so dumb if she wants to get what she wants).As a symbol of revolt against a strict patriarchal society, Wadjda fits the bill as a spunky mouthpiece. But as a fully realized character, Kenneth Tynan of the LA Times gets it right when he questions the character's credibility: It also doesn't help that Wadjda herself is a clich\u00e9 rebel, a headstrong, borderline bratty type whose smart-mouth attitude is supposed to charm us with its spunk but can also irritate by its rudeness. A little of this goes a long way, especially in a film that has such a leisurely pace.The climax to 'Wadjda' is heartfelt, as Wadjda's mom finally decides to join the 'revolution' and purchases the wonderful present for her daughter. But what exactly has the 'revolution' accomplished? Wadjda leaves Abdullah in the dust when they race one another, but what will become of Wadjda in a few years? Married off to a man and perhaps cast off for a second wife, just like her mother? Wadjda's defiance may be tempered in the future, but at least her actions represent a triumph over complacency. I guess in Saudi Arabia, we should be happy for baby steps and thankful that the film was made at all!"}, {"id": 25, "text": "This is the type of film that a certain public will sing praises over, simply because it gives us a peak into daily life in Saudi Arabia, and because a female citizen of that country made this film. Sure, it intrigued me too, even though the script and acting are at best average. But to me its main flaw is the manner in which unlikeable children are presented as innocent little darlings.The protagonist of the film, a 10 year old girl, is excruciatingly rude to all the people she encounters. Is this supposed to be endearing? Then again almost everyone is rude to each other here. If this film is a reflection of the manner in which people in Saudi Arabia co-exist then it is a rather odious society. What really takes the cake is the scene where the little girl persecutes and threatens an illegal immigrant that she will call the cops on him, if he doesn't continue working as a driver for her mother. A child that already feels so entitled at such a young age, capable of blackmail, can only turn into an utter bitch when adult. I wonder if the female director of this film is like that girl that she covets so much; it speaks volumes of the type of person that this woman must be.I have no sympathy for the little girl being thwarted in her pursuit for a bike, or that she is repressed as a female in her country, because if the shoe was on the other foot, she would have no problem with it at all to oppress people whom she deems below herself. If she's forced to live cloaked under a a veil, it might teach her some humble pie, learn to feel empathy with those less fortunate than herself. She's a little psychopath in the making, and so is her friend Abdullah, they'll make a great couple, they can ride off into the sunset on their bikes, and be married. He'll become the typical abusive husband, and in turn she will torment their imported Filipino slave servant to vent her sadistic streak. No wonder that a nation of psychopaths rely on their Koran to keep themselves in check, and nevertheless somehow end up using it to impose their heartless evil onto others, and feeling justified in doing so, without giving it another thought. The girl is no exception, she's simply replicating that exact formula. And my sympathy goes out to all those people in Saudi Arabia who are not like that and are suffering and fighting to change this regime, but no evidence of that in this film.The little girl might adorn her life with modern Western gadgets, shoes, and music, but that doesn't amount to being a good human being. It's an incredibly infantile turn of logic of the director of the film. The girl child is a nasty, backward, perversely degenerate soul; this is utterly transparent to me. If you're fooled by this cutesy pre- teen bossy boots, then you need to wipe the crust from your eyes, and see this reprehensible creature for what she really is: only fit to play the possessed girl in The Exorcist. If only she had turned round on her Koran recital teacher, and told her: your mother suck **** in hell. that would have been totally worth watching this movie for."}, {"id": 26, "text": "The PR surrounding this movie and the music playing during the trailer are definitely geared towards a Western audience. This is not an underground film dealing with ideas that needed to be hidden from censorship review boards. When watching WADJDA, I didn't feel like a Westerner looking in on a society that I didn't understand.All the work was done for us. The movie was packaged, marketed and stamped with a big house American cinema feel. Watching this film as audience members, we leave with a happy feeling because our heroine overcame her odds. We simply consume and walk away with the movie's message loud and clear: women do not have to buy into the repressive system that has been forced upon them for centuries. They can choose to make their own way, just as the director, Haifaa Al Mansour, has done by making this movie.This message somewhat mirrors the non-violent protests Saudi women have enacted by driving cars despite women being banned from doing so.Without much depth, the film simplified a complex social system based on centuries of baggage. And it failed to offer any new ideas or cinematic language on how to break free of the system. It was simply a peek into the daily life of a young girl growing up in Saudi Arabia and learning what is expected of her.Perhaps this is all Haifaa Al Mansour set out to do. I'm sure I don't understand the complexities behind shooting a film that is a symbol of hope and representative of her home country, a country where many do not approve of her venturing to do such a task.Some positive notes\u0085 I enjoyed seeing the Saudi landscape, storefronts, and home d\u00e9cor in the movie. I appreciated that this movie did not highlight a war-torn country or portray Saudi Arabia as housing terrorist starter cells around every corner, which is probably the impression that I had before this film. And, I liked that the bad guys in the movie were women; women who bought into and perpetuated the system that oppressed them. And, of course, ending with a message of hope is not so bad.Read more at aMovieaCountryaJourney.com."}, {"id": 27, "text": "This film is significant for the glimpse it offers of Saudi life, and not just from a woman's but also a child's perspective. Quite a bit is also implied regarding the attitude of Saudi men towards the women in their lives.

The thing which bothered me most is all her hard work to win the prize went to Palastine which is basically spent on nothing."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Wadjda is the first film directed by a woman in Saudi Arabia. The plot of the film tells us the story of a small, but very brave and purposeful girl, who dreams of having her own bike. According to Islamic traditions, girls should not ride bicycles, but Wadjda is so eager with her desire, so that she starts saving money for her small child dream. To achieve her goal, she decides to participate in the school competition for the knowledge of the Quran and during the film she constantly faces various problems often associated with religion Islam. From this film, I would like to highlight three aspects and discuss them in this review. The first aspect is the fact that in Saudi Arabia, as we see, Islam is not just a religion of most of the population, but also a lifestyle that Muslims adhere. The second aspect is how strongly the Quran is worshiped and respected by Muslims. And the third important aspect is how strong the difference in rights between men and women is in Islam. At the lectures, we observed how crucial is a role of Islam in the politics of many Islamic countries. As we see, people in such countries live based on the rules of Islam, its traditions and customs. They often adhere to the rules of Islam and Islamic law very strongly. The reason is that, for Muslims, Islam is not just a religion, but a way of life or lifestyle, according to the traditions of which they are obliged to live in order for Allah to be pleased with them. For instance, in Quran it is written that an adult woman must hide her face from men who are strangers to her. If the man is not her husband or any other relative, she must be covered. We see the same thing in the film: for example, all the women in the film, when leaving their houses and going to the street, were always completely covered, even their faces were hidden by the dark veil; working together in the same workplace for men and women was considered wrong and even shameful (especially, for women); little boys and girls go to different schools. From all these examples, we clearly see that Islam participates not only in the religious life of people, but in any aspect of their life. As it was already mentioned, the Holy Book of Islam is the Quran. It was revealed by Allah to all Muslims through the Prophet Muhammad. This book is highly respected by Muslims, they pray for it, they live according to the rules that are written in it, and even solve judicial cases through the Islamic Law. Moreover, in the film every Muslim person knows the Quran. We observed how hard Wadjda tried to learn the Quran to win the competition and also saw her mother's help in this. Wadjda's mother is a woman whose profession has nothing to do with religion or teaching the Quran, but she knows how to pronounce and read the Quran correctly. Also, on one of the scenes, Wadjda's mother tells her: Why do you leave the Quran open? You need to close it if you do not read it. Otherwise the Shaitan will enter it! Moreover, the correct and beautiful reading of the Quran which is considered as a separate school subject for children and the existence of a special contests for the knowledge of the Quran indicate how much people in such Islamic countries honor and respect this Book. As a third aspect, I would like to highlight the gender inequality, which, in my opinion, exists in Islam and in the countries, where Islam is strongly supported/adhered by the population. In many definitions of Islam regarding the rights of men and women that I have read, for Muslims this religion is considered equal in terms of gender relations, but in my own opinion it is not so. For me, in Islam male rights always dominate. I, personally, see very clear evidence not only of the predominance of patriarchy and existence of gender inequality in the Islamic world, but also that even in those cases where women's opinion must be taken into account, it is actually undermined. For example, from the plot of the film, we understand that Wadjda's mother can no longer give birth to a child, and therefore can no longer give a birth to a boy, which is so important for families in Islam. Therefore, Wadjda's father decides to marry the second time in order to have a boy and an heir. Since woman cannot give birth to a son, man must take a new wife; this shows how unimportant and low women's rights are in this case. Finally, I want to assert that I indeed liked this film in general. It showed me a picture of an ordinary middle-class Saudi Arabian family; how such simple families of the Islamic world live, their main challenges, problems and difficulties."}, {"id": 31, "text": "Saudi Arabian movie Wadjda tells the story of a little girl, who tries to earn money to buy a bicycle in a Muslim society. The movie portrays the everyday life of the girl named Wadjda, and the people surrounding her. The film displays many Muslim traditions and rules, especially regarding Women in Saudi Arabia. The film clearly tried to show that these rules are discriminatory, but none of the characters does not directly disagree with them. Thus, it leaves the viewer to decide whether the women in Muslim society are discriminated against or not. The review will examine the two main topics which were shown in the movie. First, is the importance of Quran recitation in Islam, which is shown in the competition. Secondly, the life of women in Muslim society. In the second half of the movie, the madrasa school where the Wadjda studies, introduces a Quran recitation competition. The girl sees this as an opportunity to earn money for a bicycle. Nevertheless, the preparation scenes and the competition itself show the importance of oral recitation and memorization of the Quran in Islam. In early Islam, memorization was key to preserving the Quran texts, since if many people memorized the Quran correctly, then it would not be possible to forge it. Moreover, oral recitation was a primal method of transmission of Islamic knowledge. The movie shows how it is important to memorize the Quran, even in modern society. The winner of the competition is made as an example of a successful student, and the teachers praise the courage of the girl who is trying her best to learn the texts. The movie also shows the significance of the pronunciation of Quran text. Wadjda was criticized for reading the texts without the melody and without the passion of her teachers. The scene, where Wadjda tells the teacher If learning Quran is difficult for you, God will reward you doubly, shows that in Muslim society people are encouraged to study the Quran. Thus, further showing how essential it is to preserve the original text of the Quran. However, the main focus of the movie is on the lives of women in Saudi Arabia. There are several characters that are shown to be the victims of strict rules on Muslim women. Such as Wadjda's mother, who is told to try the dress from the store in the bathroom, not in the dressing room like in other societies. Moreover, the mother eventually has to comply with the fact that her husband is marrying another wife since she is not able to bear a child anymore. The movie is filled with this kind of scene that shows different rules and restrictions against women in Saudi Arabia, thus criticizing them. However, it does not criticize Islam or Quran. According to professor Fazlur Rahman, it is believed that there was a permission for polygamy since, it was not possible to remove it at one stroke. In the Quran, you should not marry more women, if it is not fair to your wife. But, in the movie the father of Wadjda, secretly marries against the will of her first wife. Thus, showing that some Saudi Arabia traditions are not supported by the Quran. The movie also displays a clear inequality between men and women in Muslim countries. The premise of the movie circles around the fact that Wadjda desires something that is considered not for girls by many people. The scenes, where Wadjda asks her male friend to escort her in public, where girls are asked to hide their faces around men, where a girl is punished for having a secret relationship show that there are a lot of unnecessary rules in this particular Muslim culture, which are discriminative against women. Even though there are clear criticisms, the movie is not directly against Muslims or Islam. It is clear that the main character still has faith in God, even though she is not satisfied with most of the rules and restrictions. By showing Wadjda's methods of earning money movie tries to explain to Arab society, that women are also allowed to make business and be successful and equal to men. By showing the girl's interest in western culture and technology, the film states that there might be something to learn from western culture. To sum up, Wadjda is a Saudi Arabian movie by a women director, who tried to show the everyday struggles of women in this Muslim society. The movie is realistic. Thus, the film is created to make a statement and to criticize some traditions and rules in Saudi Arabia. Even though, on the surface, it is a simple story of a girl working on her dream. Surrounding characters, and distinct scenes, which were not necessary for the main plot, portray different strict rules and restrictions against women which are set by Muslim society."}, {"id": 32, "text": "After watching the film Wadjda I was full of different feelings starting from feelings of injustice and empathy to feelings of lightness and warmth. The film describes the way people live in a conservative Islamic society through the story of one very intelligent, combative, and ambitious girl. The action takes place in the capital of Saudi Arabia - the city of Riyadh. A ten-year-old girl named Wadjda lives with her parents and, according to Islamic law, studies at a local girls' school. The events unfold around Wadjda, who really wanted to buy a bike to compete in cycling with her friend Abdullah. The girl's desire to ride a bike reveals the whole idea of the film. It is clearly felt and seen from the film that traditions and laws of Islam suppress the rights and freedom of women in Arab countries. Wadjda's dream to ride a bike was not approved by anyone from her surroundings except her friend Abdullah. Even her mother and father were against this idea since such behavior does not suit for girls of the Islamic society. Despite the refusals of her parents to buy a bicycle, she persistently pursues her goal trying to save money to buy a bicycle. To achieve this goal she participates in a competition that checks the reading skills and knowledge of Quran. Despite the gaps in her knowledge, eventually, she wins the competition getting a sufficient amount of money to buy a bicycle (that was spent on charity as school administration did not approve her desire to buy a bicycle). This competition in a special way emphasized the importance and necessity of knowing Quran even for children of such a small age. Her irresistible desire to do and achieve what she wants is a kind of root and hope that the voice of women in Saudi Arabia will be heard some day and that their rights to freedom of dressing, movement and living in general will become less restricted. It is also clearly proven in the film that Islamic women are directly and completely dependent on men and that their opinions or desires are not heard causing a bitter sense of injustice, despair and deep regret among the film viewers. Despite the fact that events of the film take place in a relatively modern Islamic world where, for example, it is allowed to listen to Western music at home, the atmosphere of women's lives still seem to be stuck in a very conservative outdated world. It is seen that women and girls experience strong features of inequality compared to men. According to Islamic traditions, women should hide their bodies from men's eyes, thus, not causing their possible obscene thoughts. Especially in the episode where Wadjda's mother tries on a beautiful red dress in the shop but is forced to hide this beauty from everyone evokes in me (as a person not from such conservative Islamic world) feelings of sympathy and injustice. Moreover, an episode where girls, being within their school, were forced to run and hide when they noticed that men were spying on them shows that girls are more likely to be accused as being shameless and sinful. Instead nobody could not say a word against these men accusing them of dishonor. The question arises why girls should be embarrassed and hide, while men a priori should not have secretly watched after those girls. The tendency that women in the Islamic world got used to be suppressed is also shown in an episode when girls were not surprised or outraged when they were told that it is prohibited for them to touch Quran without a napkin during menstruation periods. After watching the film one gets an impression that too many prohibitions and pressure are put on women and girls in the Islamic world; husbands have rights to marry a second wife, despite the fact that the first wife is against this marriage, not to mention the fact that girls and women are prohibited from living a free life even in terms of driving a bike. The whole purpose and meaning of women's life seems to be a marriage and childbearing. The film highlights the inequalities and hardships faced by women in conservative Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia in a light and soulful way. The end of the film where despite of everything Wadjda received a bicycle, and even more she received it as a gift from her mother, is a hope for Islamic women for more equality in their lives. The film was released in 2013, and finally in 2018 women were allowed to drive a car in Saudi Arabia meaning that in general the country is moving towards moderate Islam, which I consider to be a very desirable and long-awaited event for millions of women in such Islamic world."}, {"id": 33, "text": "The Wadjda is an excellent film about a girl who is brave enough to rebel against the conservative thoughts of a Muslim community. Her struggle is depicted not only through the main plot of the film, that she wants to ride a bicycle, but also in such details as wearing jeans and baseball boots, listening to western music, and making a business in school. However, besides this idea, some important religious traditions are illustrated in this film. In this review, I want to examine some scenes of the film which depict the Islamic conceptions and to investigate to what extent they correspond to reality. Firstly, I will discuss polygamy and how this concept is presented in the Quran. Secondly, I will consider the importance of the Quran. Thirdly, I will examine Islamic rules concerning women. And lastly, I will express my general feelings about this film.Someone can claim that for the Islamic family it is normal for men to have more than one wife. And indeed according to Sharia polygamy is allowed. However, the Quran says, If you fear that you cannot do justice to orphans, then marry (orphaned) women such as you like, two, three, or four. But if you fear you will not be fair (to your wives), then (marry) only one; that is the safest course. In the movie father of Wadjda marry another woman, because his first wife could not give birth to the son. However, we can see that this is not a reason that allows having a second wife. Furthermore, he also said that he is not able to have a second wife financially, therefore he cannot be fair to his wives. It can be seen in a scene when he rejected to pay for his first wife's driver. Also, he spent out of the house for several weeks, which is already not fair toward his wife. Even in Quran itself, there is a statement You shall never be able to do justice among women, no matter how much you desire to do so. Therefore, according to the Quran, he should not have a second wife. Although the purpose of the film is not to encourage people to follow the rules of Islam, but rather oppositely is about breaking some conservative beliefs, the significance of the Quran as a central religious text of Islam is clearly represented in the movie. Starting with the very first scene, when Wadjda read aloud the part of the Quran with her classmates, and the teacher is strict scolds Wadjda when she disrespectfully laughs while reading. Another example is the Quran competition. The fact that ten-year-old girls have to memorize a whole book is to emphasize the importance of the Quran. Further, the teacher in a religious club states that girls should not directly touch the Quran while they have their periods. And the mother of Wadjda says that the Quran should not remain opened otherwise the devil can get inside it. All these scenes clearly demonstrate the significance of the Quran in Islam and as we know the Quran is indeed the holy text that was orally revealed by God to the prophet Muhammad. There were some scenes that depicted Islamic rules concerning women only. First of all the hijab. According to Ahmad Zaki Yamani, From the Islamic point of view, a woman's beauty is not meant for display or sale. It is not something to be placed 'on the show' so as to give pleasure to the audience. A woman's beauty is her own asset which she gives only to the man she chooses as her husband. She only reveals in public what does not excite desire or cause temptation. And we can see it in the movie clearly. The women had to wear a hijab even on a hot bus trip. Also, we can see that there are a lot of restrictions on women. One of them is that women do not eat with men, Wadjda and her mother ate what left after the men finished. Also, they are not allowed to even laugh loudly, schoolmaster said that the women's voice is taboo. And definitely, the fact that women are not allowed to ride a bicycle. However, according to Ahmad Zaki Yamani, With his message, Prophet Muhammad raised women to full equality with men, except where financial conditions dictated otherwise. In no respect are women inferior to men; indeed, both are equal. Therefore those restrictions are not originally meant to be.Summing up, the movie Wadjda is a good adaptation of how modern Islamic society lives in such countries as Saudi Arabia. It shows how teenagers were influences by western culture and desire to struggle against restrictive Islamic rules. Since we were born in a secular state, we do not care about such things and always complain about any kind of restrictions that we encounter. However, after watching this film, I realized how much more freedom we have and started to appreciate it."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Wadjda, a 2012 Saudi Arabian drama film, provides a story about a rebellious teenage girl, who dreams about buying a bicycle and thus, decides to take part in a Qur'an recitation contest at her school in order to win money for it. While highlighting various aspects and problems connected to the role of women in the Saudi Arabian society, the film succeeds to emphasize another significant problem that is not entirely unique to the Saudi Arabian society, but rather can be examined in a broader context of any Muslim community. More precisely, the problem of defining what makes someone Muslim as film shows is still in fact a relevant question even after centuries of existing of Islam. To begin with, the film often emphasizes the existence of double standards among Muslim community that was shown in the film. Whether it was a personal exaggerating decision of a director or the reality of the modern Muslim community still the question entirely fits in the debates that have been existing since the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Although there is no doubt in the fact that represented people in the film are Muslims, one still can argue that some of their actions contradicted to the nature of Islam as a whole. The first problem that was shown is connected to the debate over conversion to Islam and islamization. And it is clear that the main character, Wadjda, has not gone through individual decision of converting to Islam as well as many other people represented in the film. Wadjda clearly lacks the sincere belief in what she does on a daily basis. She constantly ignores the rules that require her to cover her face while being outside or being looked at by males, she ignores the rules of her teachers, who also act as teachers of morality, etc. These actions represent how young children do not really understand the importance and reasons why they are taught to behave in a certain way. Although it should be noted that some of them do realize the importance of religion, as film highlights, some of the girls at her school passionately believed in what they were doing. Moreover, the whole point of Wadjda of becoming contestant in a Qur'an recitation contest at her school in order to win money for bicycle also shows that her actions are dictated by material goods rather than by true belief. Thus, the film clearly underlines the problem of sincerity that was discussed during the lecture (Dr. Daniel Beben, 2020) Therefore, it shows that some of the Muslims especially at the young age although being called as Muslims lack the sincere belief in God and his sayings. Another example of the lack of sincerity can be seen from the controversial behavior of some adult individuals in the Muslim community represented in the film. While the lack of sincerity among young Muslims can be explained by their age and lack of experience and extensive knowledge, the film clearly emphasizes the lack of sincerity of the belief among the adults as well. For example, the mother of the main character is depicted as someone who smokes and who does not follow all of the rules of Islam either. Moreover, as the film progresses there are many cases when male adults behave in a controversial way towards young girls including Wadjda herself. Even though the concept of Muslim brotherhood and sense of community is strong in Islam, the film several times emphasizes the opposite. Therefore, the directors of the film highlighted the lack not only of the true belief among some individuals but also the lack of the appropriate behavior among them. Overall, the film indirectly leaves a viewer to a problem of belief and unbelief in the modern day Islam. As it was shown in the film, all of the people in the film are believers, they are ahl al-kitab meaning that they are the people of the book (Dr. Daniel Beben, 2020) However, de facto the behavior of some of them shows that they could be defined as kuffar, or non-believers, too. In my opinion, such a conclusion can be made based on the definition of the word kufr, which means to be ungrateful. Therefore, some of the people and their belief represented in the film are subject to a larger debate. To conclude, the film raises a very important question about true believers and non-believers in Islam. Although according to the Murji'a school of thought no one should be judged or tested on the basis of his or her belief in God, and ho one has to prove it, the film leaves no other choice than questioning and analyzing the modern Muslim community in terms of the strength of one's belief in God that can be challenged by his or her actions."}, {"id": 35, "text": "The Wadjda is the first Saudi feature film written and directed by a woman. The film tells the story of a spirited 10-year-old girl Wadjda, who lives in the suburbs of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Although she lives in a conservative world, Wajda is direct and straightforward; she cannot live according to social rules strictly formed by religion. Her, as it might seem at first glance, a simple dream is to have a green bicycle, but in a society where women cannot laugh and talk loudly, because a woman's voice is taboo, this dream becomes something forbidden and rebellious. Despite public bans on girls riding bicycles, the protagonist pursues her dream, works hard, decides to enter a Quran reading competition, and eventually wins her cash prize. Observing the girl's life, her environment, and social principles, we see a reflection of the influence of the religion of Islam on the norms of Saudi society and the emerging from it both social problems and values. Thus, the film, depicting the daily life of Wajda in modern Saudi Arabia, highlights concepts such as the importance of the Quran to society, gender inequality in relation to women, as well as the rights and responsibilities of men and women. One of the key moments in the film was Wadjda's participation in a Quran reading competition held at the school where she studied. We see the significance of the Quran, the first source of Islamic law, when people begin to study it from childhood. The girls who participated in the competition, as well as Wajda herself, took it seriously. Thus, Wadjda's mother was very glad to hear that her daughter decided to participate in it, and thereby helped to prepare for the competition, explaining how to sing the chapters of the Koran. Moreover, the prize for winning had a large amount. Therefore, the film demonstrates the importance of the Quran in the life of the Muslim society in Saudi Arabia. The concept of social order plays a significant role in Islam. The Major Themes of The Qur'an stated that the goal of the Quran is an ethical and egalitarian social order (Rahman, 38). The moment in the film, when Wadjda told her mom that she wanted a bicycle to ride with her friend Abdullah, she got an angry face from her mom and a ban because girls are not allowed to ride a bike. So, just on the example of a bicycle, we see a significant difference in capabilities between a man and a woman. As it is written in the Qur'an, and for women, there are rights (over against men) commensurate with the duties (they owe men) - but men are one degree higher (2:228) (Rahman, p.49). According to Rahman (p.49), men have a functional, not inherent, superiority over women, for they are charged with earning money and spending it on women... the Qur'an speaks often of the superiority of some men in wealth, power, etc. and also of the superiority of some Messengers over others, but that this superiority is not inherent but purely functional. If a woman becomes economically sufficient, says by inheritance or earning wealth, and contributes to the household expenditure, the male's superiority would to that extent be reduced since as a human, he has no superiority over his wife (p.49). This means that, in theory, men are not necessarily functionally superior to women. However, the picture we see in the film is completely different. The director of the madrasa where Wadjda is studying, always tells the girls to talk and laugh quietly so that the men outside cannot hear them because the girl's voice is her nakedness . When forbidden items were found in Wadjda's bag, they turned out to be bracelets, love songs, etc. Also, the fact that girls are not allowed to ride bicycles. These examples can show how society discriminates against women in everyday life. And the main character, her desires, and principles certainly do not fall within this social framework created by a religious society. Moreover, we observe the social norm, accepted by society, that polygamy is not prohibited in Islam, and Muslims can marry up to four women if they can support everyone financially and treat all four equally (Khalid, 48). As we can see in the film, Wadjda's father marries the second woman, while not forgetting about his first wife. He worries and waits for Wadjda's mother on his wedding day, and tells Wadjda that he loves her mother. However, even if these are norms accepted by the religious society, the fact that clear discrimination of women is visible in simple daily routines makes these moments serious problems. As stated earlier, discrimination against women contradicts the Qur'an verses on equality. This may be due to the fact that different readings of the same religious texts can yield fundamentally different Islams (The Cambridge Companion to the Quran, p.257). Thus, as said in the lecture on Colonialism and Fragmentation of Religious Authority in Islam, some Islamic communities are being modernized and liberalized. And Wadjda, the main character, in my vision, is a kind of the beginning of a gradual modernization and rethinking of social religious norms so that no one person is discriminated against."}, {"id": 36, "text": "What this movie does incredibly well is how it tackles the problem with the complexity of the religion, Islam in particular.One of the basic concepts of Quran is to guide the believer along the way. In fact, the very first chapter of Quran tells: Guide us along the straight path. Throughout the whole film Wadjda shows to the audience how incredibly determined she is. In the religion study club the teacher praises Wadjda's tenacity in studying the Quran despite her occasional mistakes and not very melodic pronunciation. We also see how her mother slightly teases her when Wadjda talks about how she is going to win the contest to win the bicycle: When your mind is set on something, you never let it go, I give you that. However, as much as the audience roots for Wadjda, we are still baffled by the materialistic aspect of her interest in Islam. Is it that materialistic after all? On the roof, the night before the contest, Wadjda's mother teaches her how to read Quran: The words should come from the heart. And when the finest hour finally comes, Wadjda cites the Quran perfectly. It is not Wadjda's fault that bicycle is expensive, and to earn the money she has to cut corners. Wadjda may not be a perfect obedient student people want her to be. Here and there she show her temperament: she openly criticizes her mother's personal driver Iqbal to the point that she and Abdullah come to his house and tell him off, she attaches the note with her name to the painting with the family tree, she wears Converse sneakers to madrasa and does not properly cover her face with the cloth. And yet, all of the things people say she does wrong or inappropriate or out of line, essentially she does it from the heart. She is not a rebel without a cause, she does not gossip for the sake of gossip like her classmates. Even when she tracks down the driver's house to persuade him to work for her mother again, she does it because she wants justice for her. When Wadjda lies to Ms Hussa in the office, she does it not for herself but for two girls that were caught reading magazines. Later one, these girls are alienated from other students but not Wadjda. When Wadjda wins the Quran reading contest, she answers honestly when Ms Hussa asks her what will she buy with her prize.Wadjda deeply wants to be treated as she is. It is astonishing how much women are expected not to be seen. Everything revolves around men: a man is arbitrary in Islam; a woman always has to be mentioned as a woman no matter what the subject is. When Wadjda goes to the mall with her mother, there is not dressing room for women and the only available place to change clothes is the bathroom stall. Even in the all female spaces there is no freedom. In this restroom we see an ad with a woman whose supposedly exposed arms, legs and chest are covered with the black tape. We see girls playing outside the madrasa, noticing men from the other building looking at them, so the quickly gather and leave out of their sight.Wadjda's mother throughout the whole film tries to find solace in serving her husband: in all scenes she talks about him, she tries on a red dress to win him over, she feels happy when her husband compliments her cooking. However, it does not persuade him to stay in the family, and by the end of the film, she realizes that she can be happy when she makes a choice herself, just like her daughter. We can see pure joy on the mother's face when she gives Wadjda's a new bicycle, the only one person who can truly appreciate her effort, a heartfelt present, a symbol of true love."}, {"id": 37, "text": "The film was shot by Haifaa Al-Mansour in 2012. It is important to note that Haifaa is the first woman film director in the history of Saudi Arabia. Consequently, she is a director and, at the same time, the writer of the film. The movie was illustrated in many parts of the world and various festivals. The major story is about the little girl Wadjida. The heroine lives a typical life as all other Saudi girls. She goes to school, where only girls study and know-how women have to behave in Saudi society. Living with her mother, her father comes home rarely; therefore, he marries another female since his wife cannot give birth to a boy. The desire of Wadjida to ride a bicycle with a friend of her results in the participation in a Quran recitation competition since the winner of the competition is awarded money using which she could purchase a bicycle. She is a rebel as she does not consider others' opinions and wants to do what she desires. For example, when two girls get caught painting nails that were forbidden in that society, she helped them. Furthermore, the dream of riding a bike itself is not feasible in the Saudi community. Notwithstanding that, the desire to purchase a bike. Consequently, she prepared for the competition and successfully won. However, when they asked for what she wants to spend this financial resource, she replied to get a bike. The school's principle does not give money since riding a bike for a girl is not feasible and politely forces her to contribute money for help in Palestine. However, she does all the competition criteria and fairly wins; she doe not get the award. Thus, she won the money, yet she spends it without her own will; nevertheless, Wadjida's mother purchases a long-waited bicycle at the end of the story. Nevertheless, the film gives such an impression that Wadjida is suffering under the community's strict rules. Two young girls cannot paint nails as they desire; a little girl marries an older man than she without her will, her mother as being needless when she cannot give birth. All the abovementioned factors illustrate the repressive role of Saudi females in the community. The principle did a great job indicating all these problems by a story of Wadjida. Therefore, my argument is that such films are very significant as it makes others think about females in the conservative community and impacts an individual's opinion about females' role. Males in the conservative community may think that their wives and daughters live good, happy lives since they always see them smiling; however, girls should smile and obey males. In many cases, males do not know the true feelings of females and hurt their feelings. For instance, in the film, father Wadjida never understands what is going on with his daughter. When she returns home with the winning certificate and crying, he asks her why she is crying; nevertheless, she forgets about it and leaves after the call. It illustrates the father's position towards his daughter. If Wadjida were a boy, probably the father would help him solve his issue as males have more respect than females in their society. The film shows the real-life of women in the Saudi community. The actors played their role and heroes at a high level, and more significantly, the film's flavor has no exaggeration and extra color. While watching the movie, you feel the atmosphere of Saudi life. Nowadays, it's challenging to make a qualitative movie without colors, action, and other graphics. Nevertheless, this film was good with its storyline, atmosphere, and message. All factors above cinematography play a very significant role in individuals' acceptance of cinema. If it's done very well, it influences to open the problem's gap and results in a solution. As it was mentioned before, the film illustrates not only the story of Wadjda but also females in Saudi society. Her desire to ride a bike is a parallel of freedom. Although individuals say that females do not ride a bike after she cannot give birth, Wadjda bravely stays in her position. Most girls dream of doing so or getting something; however, because of the old conservative tradition, they cannot get what they desire and live unhappy lives. The socially constructed attitude that took its background from religion inhibits many simple things for females without any logical justification. Religion portrays females and males variously, giving dominance for males and females as their helpers. For example, it's not logical to believe that females cannot provide a birth if she rides a bike, and the director indicates that such socially constructed taboos should be stopped. From my point of view, character Abdullah, Wadjda's friend, and neighbor is an excellent example of a man before absorbing all socially constructed conservative attitude, as at the end of the film, he says to Wadjida that when he gets older, he wants to marry Wadjda. He does not see any problem with riding a bike with a girl. The director of the movie wants to illustrate that hope is in the hands of the young generation, and adults' role is to give them the right upbringing. To conclude, this film is a sketch of how religion can shape society. The movies play a significant role in illustrating such issues and impacting individuals, especially children, and the young generation. We should notice that Saudi Arabia is moving towards a more tolerant community as it is allowed to drive females. To my mind, that if women are allowed to drive a car, it's not a big deal with a bicycle right now. It's a product of such movies, activists, and movements."}, {"id": 38, "text": "This movie depicts the story of a 10-year old girl named Wadjda who lives in the capital city of Saudi Arabia. She, as a girl, prohibited to do many things, and yet she does not comply with the given limits. Instead, she is the one who always pushes the boundaries of her limitations. One day she promises to buy a bike to beat her neighbor friend in a race. After mom's prohibition, she decides to raise money by herself. A Quran recitation competition at her school with a money reward becomes a perfect opportunity for her and she joins a religious club to learn the first five parts of the Quran - a literal transcript of God's speech, revealed to Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel.The directors of the film could depict a real society and life in Saudi Arabia and gave access to see a big part of Saudi culture, where religion is presented in every aspect of individuals' lives. For example, every house has a portrait of the president of Saudi Arabia, schools are divided by gender, and all girls and boys are taught what females can do and what can not from an early age. And there is religious police that monitors and controls gender segregation in public spaces and dress code.The patriarchal society the main character resides in is full of restrictions that are considered normal. For instance, her mother always restricts her to speak loud when men are around. Her teachers and school principal do not allow to be outside when there are men, saying respectable women should go inside of school where men can not see them with uncovered head. There are many rules at school: girls can not bring pictures to school, share a letter of love and admiration, and are prohibited to hold each other's hands. And, girls can not ride a bicycle because they will be infertile. Also, they are married off at a very early age. Gender discriminative taboos also present in society: men believe that women can not be smart, play video games as good as they can, and be a part of a family tree only because of gender.In contrast to generally accepted norms, Wadjda runs her own business by selling handmade bracelets, listens to rock, sings songs, wears sneakers, and rides a bike. Other girls from her school like to wear nail polish and sometimes go out with boys. This shows how females are cut off their freedom to do what they would like to, but somehow break rules. There are also contradictions that make you question the norms. For instance, all women wear an 'abaya' robe-like dress that covers every part of the body except the eyes. Contrastingly, shopping malls sell Western-styled dresses that open shoulders. In my opinion, this signifies double standards that exist in such society.The film also effectively explains how Muslims' beliefs and religious traditions are practiced in Saudi Arabia. All people do rituals like praying 5 times a day as it is should be. Every student brings her own Quran to school. Females are not allowed to touch the Quran - the sacred scripture of Islam - when they are on their period but, allowed to touch it with the issue. They also believe that the Quran should not be left open because the devil might spit into it. It is also believed that if someone dies for God, he goes to heaven where 70 brides await him. This shows how Muslims believe in the idea of heaven and hell and reward for dedication to the belief to only one God - monotheism, which is the main feature of Islam. And, the whole film presents the importance of recitation of the Quran and the reasons behind the revelation of verses in it are put in the focus. Recitation of the Quran was said to be done out of heart, with conscious mind and soul - important teaching that the mother explains to Wadjda. So, it can be recognized that the messages in the Quran for Muslims are not only for informing people in the ordinary sense of the world but moral and psychological impact.The directors raise some other popular issues connected with Islam today except gender discrimination too. The issue of polygamy is at the center of it. The film criticizes patriarchal Islamic society through the mother of Wadjda who lives with a lack of attention from her husband. As young girls and boys are not allowed to talk to each other, there is a problem of secret dates that are not allowed in society and considered a shame as well. Another issue that was quickly mentioned in one scene is the radicalization of Islam: people hear news of a martyr who was an acquaintance to the neighboring family. Talking about martyrdom with calmness shows that people are used to such news. These are the problems that the director probably wants to gather our attention: something that went out of order in society where order must be followed everywhere.Finishing watching this film, I experienced two opposite emotions - happiness and sadness at the same time. On the one hand, there is a mother in sorrow being replaced by a new bride. Sadness, because I hoped until the end that in a film like this, there is no place for injustice. On the other hand, you see a happy child, who finally achieves her goal. So, this film shows the current hardships that female has to experience throughout her life in Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia. However, there is a huge hope for the brighter future that the main character presents here. Wadjda is a symbol of the modern new generation of Saudi girls and a little spark for women empowerment in Islamic countries.What was interesting to know is that Wadjda is the first film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia and the first female-directed Saudi film. Being amazed by the conveyed message and plot of the film, not saying of perfect actors play, I totally recommend watching this amazing film, which gives you mixed after-taste with a pinch of hope."}, {"id": 39, "text": "In several Muslim countries, the position of women in the family and social life, as well as the status of women's rights in general, is viewed through the mirror of religion. In other words, the setting of women's rights is determined based on Sharia, interpreted by traditional Muslim divines through legislation. The impact of such religious doctrine often has serious negative consequences for the social and legal status of women in some Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia. As Jane McAuliffe states in The Cambridge Companion to the Quran, different readings of the same religious texts can yield 'fundamentally different Islams' (p. 257), which means that after the conquests and Islamization, Islam developed differently in each area. So, there are a lot of movies and books which show injustice, discrimination in some Muslim countries towards females. One of such films is Wadjda, which shows injustice in the World through the eyes of a ten years old little girl. In the case of this movie by Haifaa al-Mansour, the first woman who filmed a movie in Saudi Arabia, the injustice was shown by Saudi Arabia's male-centric culture. The movie tells about a girl living in a closed traditional society where women are second-class people. The main character, girl, despite her young age, is hopeful of breaking out of the vicious circle of her community. Wadjda sees a bicycle as the only possible path to happiness, restoration of justice and equality of gender scales, for which she is ready to do anything. In this review, I want to discuss critical aspects of Islam such as the role of the Quran, the conception of Satan and the state of a woman in specific Islamic World which I have noted while watching this movie. Firstly, in the lecture on Quran and Tafsir, it is said that the Quran is an eternal source for Muslims to regulate their lives and the very first chapter of the Quran says, Guide us along the straight path. So, this means that Muslims respect the Quran and follow all its guidance: the Quran' human history consists of a constant process of the making and unmaking of societies and civilizations according to certain norms (Rahman, The Major Themes of the Quran, p. 51). In the movie, the importance of the Quran is shown when girls were studying the Quran and learning Suras by heart. There was even Quran recitation competition among students which illustrates the importance of being familiar with Quran and Islamic laws from the childhood. In the film, Wadjda's mother taught her daughter to recite the Quran in a melodic chant so that the words would come from the heart: Familiarity with the Quranic text and its values, as well as an appreciation for its melodic recitation, have been the signs of Muslim faith... the course of learning the Quran is culturally regarded as an integral part of socialization (McAuliffe, Cambridge Companion to the Quran, p. 122). Also, there is a moment which shows that it is forbidden to touch the Quran without an obstacle if the person is in a state of desecration, in that moment, menstrual period of a young girl. The teacher said that girl could touch the Quran only with napkins as she was unclean. Moreover, there was Miss Hussa, school director, who enforces the Sharia laws on the schoolgirls and usually criticizes Wadjda because of her some behaviors. Secondly, there was also illustrated conception of Satan in the given movie. In Islam, according to Major Themes of the Quran by Rahman, Satan is a creature that seeks to lead people astray: An anti-man force, perpetually trying to seduce man away from his natural 'straight' path into deviant behavior (p.18). So the filmmaker showed that people do not want to be caught by Satan and follow all instruction of God to preserve themselves from evil spirits. The first moment was when Wadjda accidentally left the Quran open after she had finished reading it. Her mother saw it and said that it was not allowed to leave the Quran with open pages because Satan can enter, and there will be dire consequences. Next scene was when students and teachers were praying in the assembly hall. The director said to Wadjda to stay closer to her because Muslims believe that Satan can walk between the worshipers during praying if the Muslims do not align the rows or do leave at least a little gap between themselves. From this, we see their belief about the appearance of Satan, and that they think whoever can save himself from the schemes of Satan will remain faithful to the highest moral ideals of religion. Thirdly, this movie represents the kind of injustice towards females in Saudi Arabia. Women were forbidden to leave the house without a hijab, talk to other men, color their nails, ride a bicycle, get behind the wheel of a car and many more. This was demonstrated when two girls from Wadjda's school who just wanted to color their nails and read girlish magazines, were almost expelled from the school for their actions. Moreover, women were even not allowed to talk, laugh or sing loudly because other men would be able to hear their voices. When Wadjda's schoolmates were talking and laughing at the school, the school director was mad about their behavior and asked if they would like to be heard by men. Furthermore, in this movie, one of the main characters is Wadjda's mother, a comprehensive and compassionate woman who realizes what a sad position she stands, because she cannot give birth a son to her husband, but at the same time, trying with all her might to get him back before the temptation to take a second wife. This shows that women have no voice against their husbands and that the male occupies a position higher than the woman Men have a functional, not inherent, superiority over a woman (Rahman, Major Themes of the Quran, p. 49) since even in the family tree there is no place for women. That is why Wadjda's grandma wants his son to marry another woman who can give birth a son so that the lineage can continue. However, according to Rahman, even if polygamy is permitted in Islam, man has to be in charge of the state of his previous wives. Man has to provide fair opportunities to his wives, and women should be treated equally. So, these scenes show us how can be the life of woman be different compared to the state of man in some Arabic countries. Overall, Wadjda is a movie about freedom where a girl's dream of buying a bicycle becomes not just a story engine, but a metaphor for overcoming social prejudices, where girls are not allowed to ride bikes, color their nails and many more. I see this film as an attempt to convey the state, or rather the discrimination of women in Saudi Arabia, since, throughout the film, Wadjda overcomes several difficulties, openly opposing herself to the established rules. This film also perfectly describes different religious beliefs, linking them to various life situations. I liked the movie, and I looked with great curiosity at their religious rituals, how they gather for morning prayer, how they become close to each other so that Satan will not slip through, how they treat the Quran and sing Suras. I recommend this movie to people who would like to know how religious practices may differ in different parts of the World."}, {"id": 40, "text": "Wadjda is the first full-length movie from Saudi Arabia. It is important to note that despite the difficulties in a country where women's rights are limited, the film was directed by a female director, Haifa Al-Mansour in 2012. The film shows the problems of women in a patriarchal society and makes it clear that women have a lot of limitations and feel oppressed on a daily basis. The main character of the film is a 10-year-old little girl Wadjda who faces gender inequality and social pressure because of her gender, but still wants her own bike that women cannot have there. In the film, she faces a variety of difficulties and prohibitions in a patriarchal community. This review will discuss the features of society and culture in Saudi Arabia and its influence on women's lives that were shown in the film. As I mentioned before, the Wadjda was filmed in Saudi Arabia, in-country where the Basic law (like Constitution) is based on Islamic law - Sharia. Sharia is the path that God intends for human beings to follow in the world, and which is the path, ultimately, to salvation. (Lecture on Islamic Law and Hadith). Shariah prescriptions are enshrined in the Quran and regulate almost all areas of Muslim daily life. In a Sharia-based society, the responsibilities and position of men and women in society are different. The problem of equality between men and women was discussed by Fazlur Rahman in his work Major Themes of the Quran. According to him, the Quran says: And for women, there are rights (over against men) commensurate with the duties (they owe men)-but men are one degree higher (Rahman 49). In this statement, it could be said that men and women are not equally treated in Islam. This trend we can see in several moments in the film. For example, girls and boys study in separate schools where they gain education and moral values. At the moment when Wadjda went to school, we see that girls have strict regulations. As it was said in the film A Woman's Voice is Taboo, girls are forbidden to laugh and talk loudly, as men should not hear women's voices. Girls should always be covered in the street, and it means that they should wear a hijab. Also, girls are forbidden to paint their nails or paint their bodies, as this is considered a sin. Older girls are watched by the morality police, as they cannot secretly communicate with young guys. Because of such strict rules, girls are highly oppressed in that society. In the case of Wadjda, she wants a green bicycle in order to compete with her friend-boy. Even though riding a bike by girls is not prohibited by law, it is unacceptable in the community of Saudi Arabia. As it was mentioned by Wadjda's mother, riding a bicycle is a shame for a girl because it could lead to negative consequences such as inability to give birth and as a result nobody will marry her. Nevertheless, her desire is so strong that all these statements about prohibition do not affect her aspiration. The next issue that was shown in the film and, I think is important to discuss, is polygamy. According to Rahman (47), in the case of polygamy Quran says: ...If you fear that you cannot do justice to orphans, then marry among (orphaned) women such as you like, two, three, or four. But if you fear you will not be fair (to your wives), then (marry) only one; that is the safest course.... By this statement, we can understand that Islam supports polygamy. In the film, there is the tragical example of polygamy by Wadjda's father. Because of the problem that Wadjda's mother cannot give birth anymore, her husband decides to marry for the second time in order to have a son. This situation demonstrates another issue of the patriarchy - the importance of having a boy in the family as the successor of offspring and family tree. In the case of the family tree, we have an important episode in the film that has a significant meaning. When Wadjda looks at the family tree, her mother says that only man's names are written on the tree and there is no place for her. However, Wadjda writes her name and attaches it to the family tree. This episode demonstrates hope for Wadjda to be equally treated by her father and the whole society she lives in. To sum up, the film Wadjda describes Saudi Arabian society and culture. The director demonstrates most of the issues that women face in the Sharia-based community. Many restrictions and prohibitions cause the oppression of women and gender inequality that experience every female in this country. Even Wadjda's desire to ride a bike leads to difficulties and shows how many social limitations girls experience in Saudi Arabia. Thus, the movie describes the important and recent problems that women have in a patriarchal society and makes one think about changing the rules and attitudes towards women in the community."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Wadjda: Rebel against patriarch society or Hope for all Saudi Women?Imagine Saudi Arabia in 2012: a way long time until a woman's permission to drive or to leave the country without written permission of the husband, guardian, brother, or son. A tiny in scope of the country and very meaningful at the same time for all women of Saudi Arabia happens in the cinema industry the same year - first-ever female Saudi film director Haifaa al-Mansour releases a movie about a young girl who stands up for her own dreams against deep-rooted social norms that are closely intertwined with religion. The film raises important issues to think of such as an attitude towards the women and their rights, and inequality, which all are found to be explained by Islam. Despite an absolute patriarch based on Sharia resulting in the systematic oppression of females in Saudi Arabia, a Wadjda gives a little piece of hope that sometime soon women would be able to have their rights broader at the level of a male at least. Considering the reasons for woman's rights violation in current Saudi Arabia social life, the Quranic exegesis and interpretations might be seen as responsible for it as the Sharia is regarded as one of the fundamentals of the country's legal system. To begin with, Hassan and al-Hibri were among the first initiators of discussion on female inequality in Islam by denying the general beliefs or even assumptions in the Quran that Muslims tend to take for granted and think true. According to one of these assumptions, one of the premises, why males are ranked higher in every life aspect, is that woman is just a derivative which is being made of a male's rib (Mcauliffe, 259). The same attitude towards females is also seen in the thought that a woman, a derivative, is also created to serve a man or, in other words, she does not represent any key role but a secondary (Mcauliffe, 259). On the contrary, Hassan argues that, firstly, in most translations, 'Adam' in the Quran refers to the universal meaning of human rather than a man or a woman, then she claims that as said in the Quran both man and women are created to live together in harmony and rejects the auxiliary role of a woman (Mcauliffe, 259), especially the wrong interpretation of females commonly used. Another example of the Quran interpretation that also played a role in catalyzing the understanding of woman position in the Muslim community is from the history of the Abbasid dynasty. During their rule, woman slavery was permitted and institutionalized along with the popularization of harems what resulted in more misogynistic perception and attitude towards women (Mcauliffe, 257). Moreover, we can't deny the presence of other factors affected and led to this (oppressing) social structure since we know the heritage of the Prophet Muhammad left about women's rights in Islam highlighting their value. It should be also noticed that his first wife was a successful entrepreneur and Aisha contributed substantially to the Islam teaching by promoting Muhammad's messages and knowledge on pilgrimage, marriage, and others. We might only assume how deeply and how long those changes could remain in the minds of descendants. What we can see in the movie is a 10-years old young girl, Wadjda, from the city of Riyad with a dream of having a green bike and to compete with her friend Abdullah. The bike is demonstrated as a metaphor for freedom and equality by the eyes of a new Saudi generation since it is against the social rule, which says No one will marry you if she drives a bike. The dullness and monotonicity of the picture, lack of long dialogs, and background music make to think of the settled conservatism and views in the country, which in combination with a Wadjda's aspiration, leads to the idea of the need to reconsideration the position of woman. On the other hand, Wadjda is depicted in a distinguishable way in comparison to her classmates and the woman community - she wears Converse and listens to rock music. Despite the win in the Quran reading competition, she receives the bike her mom who sacrifices her dress and chance that her husband won't get married the second time to have a son. By showing this scene, we might assume that Haifaa al-Mansour tries to show us that for now the change towards female rights should be expected only from the women community, who also share the view of the necessity of the changes. It should be noted that the movie is not aimed at criticizing the current state of affairs, it shows to the world the lives and everyday struggles of the woman community in the Kingdom and leaves room for our own thoughts. We can only guess the reasons for deep-rooted woman inequality in the Muslim society that is inherited to the new generation of Saudi Arabia. The film dramatically highlights the presence of the violation of the rights still lasts, explanations of which are believed to be found in the religion, however, are controversial in interpretation."}, {"id": 42, "text": "The feature film 'Wadjda' is directed by, the first Saudi female moviemaker, Haifaa Al-Mansour and challenges the sociocultural status of woman in Saudi Arabia. Since Al-Mansour has completed her bachelor and master degrees abroad (American University of Cairo and University of Sydney, respectively), she conveys the view on the problem of gender segregation in Saudi Arabia from the outside. Most of the audience, who are not familiar with general history and principles of Islam, could interpret the idea of the movie 'Wadjda' as depiction of severe attitude towards women in Islam. However, the director attempted to show the contrast between Islam in Saudi Arabia and contemporary authentic Islam. This essay will analyze the major issues of gender segregation in Saudi Arabia depicted in the film from the viewpoint of genuine Islam. The movie describes a number of restrictions which infringe on the woman rights in the Kingdom and indeed these limitations are ungrounded. Starting from the central superficial message of the movie, Wadjda is a teenage girl who saves money to buy a bicycle but is not allowed to do it because the riding of bicycle is an obscene behavior according to Saudi set of beliefs about Muslim woman. However, there is no any restrictions for women regarding the bicycle or any other vehicle in authentic Shari'a. The movie also refers several secondary rules which are indeed controversial according to Islamic traditions: painting nails and loud speaking in public. The root of all these limitations are that woman should not keep man's attention. This principle actually takes place in primordial Islamic traditions to protect women from harassment. However, it does not define the deeds like painting nails and loud speaking to absolutely prohibited, but only marks them as debatable according to 'ijtihad' because there is no particular text of the Qur'an and Hadith on these specific issues. It turns out like Saudi society designed its own paradigm of woman's behavior based on Shari'a but sometimes it contradicts genuine Islam principles because strictly oppresses the rights of women. This paradigm puts all Saudi women to underprivileged and vulnerable position. The director of the movie showed this problem in the scene with family tree, when Wadjda added her name to the tree but sooner the name was removed because only men have rights to be mentioned in family tree. This issue can be connected to question of inheritance in Qur'an, as in Major Themes of the Qur'an (p.51) it is stated that share of the daughter is at half of the share of the son. So, the inequality between sons and daughters is partially in accordance. However, modernist Muslim opinion on this issue given the changed modern conditions in the world and argue for the equal share and general equality between son and daughter (Major Themes of the Qur'an, p.51). Although genuine Islam never accords woman an underprivileged status, but only tries to equalize gender rights and protected them in times of Jahaliyya. There are multiple examples of women who were deeply respected in Muslim society and play a considerable role in the history of the religion: Khadija bint Khuwaylid, Aisha bint Abu Bakr etc. (Lecture material) Therefore, the marked contrast of the sociocultural position of woman between the Saudi Kingdom and Sunni Islam is noticed. To continue with, the social segregation issue demonstrated in the movie can be approached from the opposite gender. Alongside with the strongly underprivileged status of woman in the Saudi Arabia, the position of man in the society is overprivileged. For instance, Wadjda's mother after giving the first birth is not able to be confined (give a birth), but the father wants to get an inheritor on a family tree. Henceforth, Wadjda's father tries to find himself a new wife and eventually married another woman because polygamy for men is allowed in Islam. However, there is a list of conditions when a husband can marry more than one wife. According to the Qur'an surah An-Nisa, if man fears he will not be fair his wives, then he should marry only one; that is the safest course (Major Themes of the Qur'an, p. 47). Since, the action of Wadjda's father cannot be considered as fair with respect to his primary family, it can be marked as contradictory to Shari'a. The crucial thing is that Wadjda's father was not blamed for this deed. This sign of Al-Mansour shows that the position of man in Saudi Arabia is too privileged, so that they can exhibit the behavior, which is not approved by Islamic Shari'a and stay unpunished (in this life), while women can be blamed by society for the deeds that are controversial, but not absolutely forbidden according to Islamic principles. To conclude, the divergence of Saudi Islam from the authentic one can be validated on the example of complete gender segregation. The hidden meaning of the movie is to show this gender inequality in the Kingdom, which does not match true Shari'a. The final scene, when the girl eventually gets her bicycle, can be interpreted as the symbol of freedom for all women in Saudi Arabia that they deserve."}, {"id": 43, "text": "Wadjda - is the first Saudi feature film written and directed by a woman. It tells the story of a little girl on her way to her big dream - her own bicycle. A bicycle may seem an ordinary thing, but for a girl living in a society where she is even forbidden to speak loudly, this is indeed a big, rebellious and daring dream. This film explains greatly why this is the case, and shows the real life of women in modern Saudi Arabia, shaped in accordance with Islamic norms and canons. In this review, I will demonstrate that this movie is effective in explaining the role of women in Islamic Saudi Arabia, the rights and responsibilities of men and women, and the need for modernization of religion.For decades, Islam has been criticized for the way it treats women. Even the colonialists of the 19th century used this idea to justify themselves by claiming that Islam is a bad and wrong religion (lecture Impact of colonialism). However, the question about the role of women in Islamic family and society is still debatable. Many scholars and researchers claim that the Quran itself does not explicitly entail the superiority of men. There is indeed a verse in the Quran saying that: For women there are rights (over against men) commensurate with the duties (they owe men) - but men are one degree higher (2:228) (Rahman, p.49). However, according to Rahman, men have a functional superiority over women, not inherent. It means that men are responsible for finances and have the liability of expenditure (on women) (4:36), but if women become financially independent and contribute to the family budget, men's superiority diminishes (Rahman, p.49). Moreover, one of the fundamental doctrines of Islam is equality of all human beings before God, regardless their gender. It is written in the Quran that: The believers, men and women, are awliya' of one another (9:71). According to al-Hibri, awliya means protectors, which brings us to the question of how a woman who is considered inferior can be a protector of a man (The Cambridge Companion to the Quran, p.236). The idea here is that the superiority of men over women in Islam is a controversial topic and largely depends on the interpretation of the texts and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad in different cultures.Although, theoretically, men are not necessarily superior, the reality is very different. As we see in the movie, women in Saudi Arabia are treated unequally and oppressed by the societal norms dictated by Islamic laws. For instance, all women in the movie wear black niqabs (cloth covering the whole body and head except the eyes) outside their house. They do not show their faces to men, laugh and talk loudly because woman's voice is a taboo -Obviously, girls are not allowed to ride bikes, date boys and listen to love songs. They are expected to get married and have children, preferably sons. Also, they cook, clean the house, raise children and take care of their husbands. The husbands in turn are the breadwinners who support the family. They can marry three more women if they can afford it financially, since it is allowed in the Quran. This is how a typical Saudi family looks like in the film. However, this seems to contradict the Quranic verses on equality described in the previous passage. One of the probable reasons is problems in the interpretation of existing laws and aspects not elaborated by the Prophet Muhammad. Due to cultural and social features, the application of Islamic law in the Muslim world tends to be different. As McAuliffe points, different readings of the same religious texts can yield fundamentally different Islams' (The Cambridge Companion to the Quran, p.257). Thus, after the Arabic conquest and Islamization of the conquered lands, Islam developed differently in each area. For instance, in China it went along with Confucianism and considered to be the same in terms of ethics (A selection of texts on Islam in China, p.259). In India, there was a custom that prohibited a widow to remarry, whereas the Arabs never heard of such a tradition before and after the Prophet Muhammad (A selection of texts on Islam in India, p.240). These are a few examples of how the existing cultural and social order influenced the perception of Islam in different societies. Thus, it is possible that Saudi society also interpret Islam with respect to cultural aspects and may be wrong regarding some issues.Fortunately, the movie gives hope for modernization of religion, which will bridge the gap between Islam and modernity. For me, Wadjda is the symbol of a new era that will gradually enter the Saudi society.The conclusion that can be drawn from the film is that the social order shaped by Islam in Saudi Arabia needs to be reconsidered in accordance with current reality. Because each reading of a religious text gives a different interpretation of laws and regulations, and because religious traditions can be culturally influenced, there is always room for change."}, {"id": 44, "text": "Wadjda is a thought-provoking and highly inspiring movie about a Saudi Arabian girl called Wadjda, whose dream is to have a bicycle. In pursuit of her dream, Wadjda works very hard and decides to take part in the Qur'an recitation competition which she successfully wins. The film shows social issues of the Saudi Arabian community by depicting basic problems which Wadjda and her family had. However, the movie also demonstrates the importance of religion in everyday life of that society. This review will analyse different passages of the movie, and will show that the film emphasizes the importance of the Quran, concept of equality, marriage rules and forgiveness in Islam. The movie does highlight the importance of the Qur'an in Islam. Namely, it was shown that there was organized the Qur'an recitation competition in the school where Wadjda studied. Moreover, the prize for the best recitation of the Qur'an was truly high. Although, the main character was very young, girls of her age and she herself participated in this competition and had good results. It clearly shows that the Qur'an should be studied from childhood and the ability to retell the excerpts from the Qur'an is highly encouraged in Saudi Arabian community. Not only children, but adults should be able to recite the first source of Islamic law. In one of the episodes, the mother of Wadjda helped her to prepare to the competition by explaining Wadjda how to sing surahs (chapters of the Qur'an) and singing herself. Therefore, by depicting the competition which is spread among pupils and the ability of adults to retell the Qur'an, the film demonstrates that the Qur'an is crucial in Muslims' lives. Despite the fact that film shows the gender inequality in Saudi Arabia which is a part of the society in that country, it illustrates implicitly the importance of equality among women. The concept of equality plays a key role in Islam and it was mentioned in Major Themes of The Qur'an that an ethical and egalitarian social order was the goal of the Qur'an (Rahman, 38). When Wadjda told her mother about her wish to ride and own a bicycle, her mother became angry and told that girls were not allowed to ride bicycles. Thus, it is clear that there was a big difference between men and women in Saudi Arabian community. On the other side, the viewer can, certainly, see that there is an equality among women. Namely, every woman in the city had to wear a special black coloured veil when she was outside the house. Furthermore, in one of the passages of the movie, the director of school told Wadjda to wear the same simple shoes as other girls wore instead of wearing sneakers. These passages give an impression that all women should be the same in that society because of the religious laws. The next aspect of Islam which is depicted in the film is connected with marriage. According to Rahman, polygamy is permitted in Islam and Muslims are allowed to marry up to four women. However, there is a certain condition which is required to be fulfilled if someone wants to have several wives: all four wives should be treated equally and justly (Rahman 48). In the film, the father of Wadjda did marry the other woman, but before marrying her, he told that he had to have enough money in order to support two families. Furthermore, on the day of his second wedding he was waiting for his first wife or Wadjda's mother and it was clear that he worried about her. Unfortunately, he could not find his first wife and he told Wadjda that he loved her mother. That excerpt demonstrated that Wadjda's father respected his first wife, though, he was going to marry the second wife which was an important aspect of Islam. Apart from the Qur'an, equality and concept of marriage, the movie does emphasize the importance of balancing the deeds in Islam. Some verses of the Qur'an indicate that misbehaviour of people will be forgiven, if their overall performance is good (Rahman 30). Wadjda is a strong girl, who is not afraid of sharing her viewpoints with others and acting against the rules. She was invited to the director of her school several times, and the director was very angry with Wadjda's behaviour and was against her. However, when Wadjda decided to take part in the competition of recitation of the Qur'an, the director changed her negative opinion about Wadjda and decided to give her a second chance. This positive attitude towards a person who did some mistakes and wanted to improve himself or herself by starting doing good things (learning the Qur'an by heart) is reflected in the Qur'an and highly welcomed in Islam. In conclusion, Wadjda is an emotional movie which has an implicit connection with religion, since Islam is an essential part of Saudi Arabian community. This review discussed several moments of the movie and identified that the film highlighted the significance of the Qur'an in Islam, aspect of equality among women, Islamic law regarding marriage and mercy towards those who wanted to change themselves in a positive way."}, {"id": 45, "text": "The movie Wadjda shows the main societal problem - gender inequality - of some Islamic communities, namely in Saudi Arabia in this movie. The plot of the film is constructed around a ten-year-old girl who cannot live under the societal rules strictly shaped by religion. This review will show how the movie highlights and provides a picture of the Islamic influence on society and its norms. First of all, the movie highlights all the details of how much women are discriminated against and controlled due to religious rules. From the very beginning of the movie, the girl Wadjda experiences many discriminatory treats towards her such as controlling her habits, how she dresses and what she is interested in. for instance, in the madrasa she is studying, the director of the school always tells the schoolgirls to laugh and talk quietly, so that men outside cannot hear it. The girl's voice is her nakedness, she says. Also, she requires Wadjda to cover her face fully in front of men, but Wadjda mainly wears only her scarf that covers her hair only partly. Once, the director checks Wadjda's backpack and finds here forbidden items, as she claims, such as bracelets, songs about love, and others. All of these forbidden actions described above arise from a religious perspective since it is said in the Quran that men are in charge of women since they excel them (Quran 4:34). The main thing that is forbidden for Wadjda is riding a bike, but it is desirable by her so much that she is ready to get against the whole society. She thinks about racing her friend Abdullah on the bike, and once seeing a new green bike delivered to the local shop, she starts saving money for it. Whenever she tells anyone that she wants to buy a bike, she receives their disappointments and hears that girls do not ride a bike. All of these situations show two main things: firstly, how society is totally against any disobeying of Islamic societal norms, and, secondly, how the little girl is dedicated to doing what she wants despite all the obstacles. Society here, especially men discriminate against women in various ways. Men can have several wives, as in the case of Wadjda's father, who could not have a son from his first wife, Wadjda's mother. He married another woman because of this, and Wadjda's mother could do nothing about it. As Khalid mentions, polygamy is not forbidden in Islam, and men can get married several times if he wishes (Khalid, 148). Also, girls are taken as brides at their young ages, as in the example of a schoolgirl who married a 20-year-old man at her primary school age. This is recognized normal in their society, and mostly everything is taken care of by men and their wishes. Secondly, this little girl's dedication plays a role in slight modernization's picture in this movie. In other words, even though there are thousands of forbidden by religious things to do for a woman in their society, there is little hope that all these are starting to change. We can see this gradual change in several moments of the movie. Firstly, the fact that the strictest director of the madrasa herself was told by the rumors in the movie that he had a lover. Later, even though the mother of Wadjda was against her wish of buying a bike, she buys her a bike herself, when Wadjda's prize money was donated to Palestine. Both situations show us that even though all people are obeying the societal norms without even reconsidering them, they deep in their minds understand that these rules are too strict and radical, unjust, and discriminatory. Just as Khalid claims the burden of preserving the honor of the community fell more heavily on women than on men (Khalid 2007, 103). In addition to this, Wadjda herself portrays a rebel in the society, who is and will be against all these inequalities. Even though she is a rebel, Abdullah, her friend, sees in her an equal human being, and even wants to marry her when she is older. Therefore, we can say that Wadjda, her mother, and Abdullah among others are the beginning of the graduate change in their societal norms and rules. As was discussed in the colonization lecture, some Islamic communities are being modernized and liberalized. They are not a coherent group, but rather several different communities from different parts of the world. Their main perspective on religion was that they should reinterpret Islam in such a way that it responds to the needs of the modern of the time. Similarly, in this case, the religious situation in Saudi Arabia needs some modernization and reinterpretation, so that none of the society members gets discriminated against. To conclude, the movie shows us the extent to which religion can affect society and its norms. Also, it exhibits the fact that even these radical religious norms are urged to change, but only slowly and gradually. The main idea of the movie seems to be raising awareness of gender inequality justified by religions, pictured from the perspective of women."}, {"id": 46, "text": "The director did such a good job keeping it heartwarming without ignoring the realities of girls' and women's lives in saudi. a feel good without being fluffy. the film did a great job of exposing the inequalities women and girls face without being at all heavy handed. you'll find yourself loving and rooting for wadjda!"}, {"id": 47, "text": "A sad movie about a sweet little girl who has to survive in an oppressive society governed by a sadistic religious regime that treats women like garbage."}, {"id": 48, "text": "I lived in Saudi as an expat for years but could never really see what went on in the average home there.

It is not only a cultural document giving a much needed glimpse into Saudi life, but a well acted drama.

There are numerous direct and implicit criticisms of society and religion in the movie.

However, at the same time, this could be the point of the strength of the movie from the perspective of people familiar with the middle east. There are similarities between the movie and some Iranian movies in '80s and '90s. The differences are the creators of this movie have benefited from more freedom of expression to criticize religious concepts despite the society lacking many fundamental freedoms."}, {"id": 53, "text": "The 21st century has already seen the rise of critically acclaimed auteur cinema, which is made in Islamic countries.

The directors from Turkey and Mauritania are also critically acclaimed. The movies of these authors touch on subjects of relationships between religion, government and society. They are often criticized in their homelands for unconservative, liberal views on religion's influence on everyday lives of people, and important issues which occur. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia was left on the outskirts of that wave. For a while, Saudi Arabia barely had a film industry, producing only a couple of movies and documentaries per year. One of the possible reasons for that is the strict laws of Saudi government about cinema theatres and allowed subjects for the films. The situation is still pretty unfortunate. However, the internationally acclaimed 2012 film Wadjda by Haifaa al-Mansour helped to improve the situation and made brave statements about touchy subjects of religion and freedom in Saudi Arabia. This film got a positive critique and was premiered in several Western film festivals. This is the first Saudi film, which was selected for Oscar and the first major film in the country, which was directed by a woman. Moreover, this is the first movie of this country, which touched on such a sensitive for the Islamic world themes and resonated on that level. The movie tells the story of a 10 years old girl named Wadjda, who lives in the suburbs of the country's capital city. She is a brave, active, rebel girl, always wearing a pair of Converse shoes. Her behaviour is considered as contradictory to the norms of Islamic virtue of a woman. Along with the story of a girl, we can see her family's issue. Her father, who is almost always not at home, considers to have a second wife, as Wadjda's mother fails to have a son for him. The fourth surah of Qur'an, An-Nisa, allows men to have more than one wife: If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice. (Ayah 3). Also, both Islam laws and society of Saudi Arabia expect women to behave in certain way: not to show her body to other men, walk in the streets only with husband, avoid interaction and eye contact with other men, wear a hijab. These rules go against the freedom-loving nature of Wadjda, whose behaviour is judged by surroundings. Her desire is to buy a new green bicycle. She participates in the Qur'an recitation competition in order to get money for the first place. She wins, but riding a bike is considered as impossible for the girl. Her money is shared to the charity without her permission. Following that, she discovers that her father married for the second time. However, her mother, who cut her hair short, buys her new green bike. We can see that this film reflects the changes in Saudi society. In the year of this movie premier, women were allowed to be appointed to the Shura, governmental assembly. Few years after that, women were finally allowed to drive a car. The subject of women ruling the vehicle, which symbolizes having certain control and freedom to move, is also very important in this movie. Despite some huge changes, the society's attitude towards women's place and the impact of the religion are still extremely significant, and this movie perfectly captures this conflict. However, I would like to mention that al-Mansour's attitude about women's place and religion is compromising and optimistic. She doesn not contradict these two concepts. The important aspect is that Wadjda gained her symbol of freedom with the help of knowing the Qur'an by heart. She could make money in other ways, but this aspect of true religion was important for the author. And finally, the color of the bike is the same as Saudi Arabia's flag, which also could be viewed as the symbol of optimism about Saudi future and freedom."}, {"id": 54, "text": "From the beginning of the movie, the viewer gets acquainted with a conservative world that is viewed by the modern Western world as oppressive and discriminatory towards women. Yet, at the starting scene where the girl puts herself distinct from other girls who are singing prayers in the name of Allah, one learns that the main hero - Wadjda is a mischievous child. She does not want to follow the strict rules instilled in her by people around her and by religious traditions. This can be seen from the way she sells bracelets that are prohibited in school, wears her headscarf not fully covering her face but mainly from her great desire to ride a bike. For the people living in the world that does not force women to follow uncompromising religious rules, riding a bicycle might seem as an ordinary thing that obviously does not go against the cultural norms. However, the movie tells the story of Wadjda who lives in a small town of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia among people who ardently believe that women do not have a voice. Being directed by a woman named Haifaa al-Mansour, the movie Wadjda openly presents the state of women who live in strongly conservative countries and not only in Saudi Arabia. The movie touches on many topics regarding women, including the fact that the family trees have only men's names written on them. As Wadjda sees the family tree of Wadjda's father, she gets interested in it and that's probably because it has only men's names written. Being a spunky child, she then sticks a note with her name written on it to the family tree. Yet, we know that it cannot change the tradition of men's names appearing in the family tree. The viewer also sees Wadjda as a girl who differentiates herself from others in a way that she strongly desires to buy a green bike. Throughout the movie, she goes against people like her mother, school teacher and does many things that are prohibited in her culture in order to earn money to get the bike. This shows how dedicated she is to her beliefs and that she is ready to stand until the end for them even if it will require her to go against the social norms telling what girls must do and are not allowed to do. And that's what she does. The theme of oppressive behavior towards women and their acceptance of it to fit into the created male-dominated community is fully shown in the movie. One can see it through the example of Wadjda's parents as despite the fact that Wajdja's father has a wife and daughter, his mother is looking for a new bride. Later, one knows that the reason for this is that his wife cannot give birth to a boy. So, it can be assumed that if the family doesn't have a boy, then it is natural for a man to get a new bride. In this way, it is done until one of the wives is successful in performing one of the main duties of women - giving birth to a male. This shows that men are allowed and maybe even encouraged to have a few wives. While women live in order to become a good exemplary wife that gives birth to children and does all the housework. Besides this duty, women cannot have dreams and strivings. This is a taboo which goes against the cultural and religious norms created in the movie. For these reasons, her mother and other women are also hugely dependent on a driver Iqbal who takes them to work. Without him, her mother can no longer attend work. Returning to the topic of the bike, for Wadjda it's not a simple bike but a chance for a freedom from the strict social rules that prohibit a girl from riding a bike as it is a sin and may decrease the value of a female. It is a chance to show that in equal conditions, a girl can beat a boy in a race. Yet, in the movie, Abdulla says that the girls do not ride a bike meaning that it is prohibited. Her mom adds that if Wadjda rides a bike, she will not be able to have children which is the main function that females must fulfill. In addition to this restriction, the movie shows that women must not show their faces to stranger men and must not make their voices heard by men. This is seen in the scene where all the girls go to hide when men are looking while a rebellious Wadjda who continues playing is told by the woman to also enter the building. This means that women are not allowed to be seen by stranger men. From the scene where Miss Hassa says that the religious police came on a school girl - Abir in the company of a man, the viewer learns that there is a religious police. They seem to serve a regulatory function, that is, controlling women from doing actions contradictory to religion. The next one where the two girls get scolded by Miss Hassa for laughing, the latter explains it by saying that the girls' voice must not be heard by men outside and it, therefore, is a taboo. The same phrase is repeated in the later scene by Wadjda's mother who says that she must not sing as men might hear her voice. Her school teacher also reprimands Wadjda for coming to school without a scarf properly covering her hair calling it a head offense. On the other hand, I think that Wadjda is ready to follow what is said in the Quran and lead a religious life. Although she decides to take part in a religious club competition in the Quran knowledge in order to win the money prize that she can use to buy a bike, she still wins it by her dedication and belief from the heart. She follows what her mother told her that she must ignore everyone around her and just focus on reciting the verses from the Quran that must come from the heart. Wadjda frankly confesses to her teacher that the competition is difficult for her. She hears from the Quran radio that Allah will reward that person twice for whom learning the Quran is a difficult task. After that, the teacher calls her an exemplary student who endeavors and is committed to God and His Prophet. She is committed to do the prayers and be a slave of one God only but she also stands ardently for her beliefs that are considered to be a taboo in the male-dominated society. She is able to withstand all the reprimands, down-looks by her classmates and older people because of her strong willpower for acquiring a bike and proving that male and female can be equally put together and compete under the same conditions. Therefore, the movie Wadjda shows severe restrictions that are put on women because of their gender by the oppressive culture. And if one tries to break them, she is considered to be a sinner. However, by bringing the tomboy, rebellious and smart character like Wadjda, the director puts a hope on girls like her who might one day break through the strictly conservative society to a free world while also adhering to their religious beliefs."}, {"id": 55, "text": "Wadjda is a drama film about a young girl living in Saudi Arabia who enters the Qur'an recitation competition to afford a bike. In this review, I would argue that the main theme of the movie gently touches upon an important problem of women's oppression through the eyes of the young girl enhanced by its realistic and simple style. All the characters are well-written and believable reinforcing the authenticity of the story. It is a spectacular movie being the first feature film shot completely in Saudi Arabia the country where only recently women were allowed to drive and cinema theatres reopened. Moreover, it was written and directed by a woman and she had to often monitor everything from the van due to gender segregation which was highly inconvenient for her as a director but which did not affect her movie at slightest. The movie follows a young girl named Wadjda. She is a lovely, smart, and courageous character and I think the actress, Waad Mohammed, did an excellent job delivering this amazing character to life despite her young age. The emotions were played out well, not exaggerated or underdone. My favorite lines of the character include: Double loss if it is against the girl, It shows. You cannot behave yourself. She understands that boys and girls are not equal in her society but she does not let herself down and instead chooses to be a fighter. From the very first shots, she stands out among other girls wearing sneakers and enjoying the song while others stay still. Even when asked to change her shoes to black one every girl is wearing she does not refuse what she likes and simply paints the sneakers into black. She is clever and knows that she is just as capable as boys. Because she understands that, she envies boys freely riding their bikes. So when she saw on her way home a green bike on the hoot of the vehicle, she instantly liked it and ran after. Her bored face filled with joy and fast-paces music started playing. The bike becomes a symbol of belief in her freedom and bravery. Wadjda does not play a hero, but she is not reluctant to stand for her thoughts. To earn money, she decides to participate in the Qur'an recitation competition. Towards the end, the competition starts and continues without any accompanying music and we see the nervous face of Wadjda. Silence just adds tension to the scene highlighting the importance of the event to the main character. When she finally wins the competition, she announces her decision to buy a bike for that money. All her dreams crash when it is decided to donate that money to fellow people in Palestine by Ms. Hussa. The headmaster was utterly shaken angrily gazing at Wadjda who did not give up her wrong ideas and is still as rebellious as she was. The reason may be that she hoped Wadjda would become just like other girls now being more immersed in Islam. This may hint that part of the problem of gender segregation comes from strict religious devotion. It is an interesting point but the movie does not elaborate on the cause of the issue merely demonstrating the devastating impact of the Saudi Arabian culture on women. The issue of equality between two genders has been a prevalent and important topic in discussions of the last decade. However many still lack understanding of the seriousness of the situation. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this subject matter. The movie provides unique insight into the lives of women in Saudi Arabia. It is a rare opportunity to observe the culture within. The movie does not seek whom to blame nor does it scream on equality, but it manages to communicate how much women are restrained and isolated in the country. Most of the movie is quiet and does not point out directly at the problems, but the viewer still gets its message though contrasting scenes. It captured everyday struggles of ordinary women such as covering face completely when outside, being quiet around men, and even not being able to ride a bike. There is a clear line between men and women in the society of Saudi Arabia. It is most evident visually from the color of their clothes - women wear black or gray and men wear white clothing. Boys and girls attend different schools. Women talk freely only with their families. The director openly demonstrates this gender segregation through the contrasts between how women behave indoors and around men. At home, Wadjda and her mother wear ordinary western clothes, chat and laugh together, prepare food, and enjoy singing. In comparison to how the mother covers even her eyes when talking to a man. At one point, the headmaster of the school, Ms. Hussa, tells the girls that Women's voice a taboo. Moreover, throughout the film, Wadjda is the only girl who plays with the boy otherwise boys always play with each other. The ending is touching, beautiful, and puts a smile onto your face. Although the money from the competition will be donated, Wadjda still gets the bike thanks to her mother's decision to spend money on the bike, not on the beautiful dress. This highlights another theme of the movie which is the relationship between mother and daughter. The mother often scolding Wadjda for her actions and behavior shows that she values her daughter even if their views contradict. Wadjda joyfully rides the bike looking around with a smile on her face. It ends on an optimistic note showing that there is hope for a brighter future. Overall, despite being light and simple, the film did a great job at uncovering the real struggles women face in Saudi Arabia."}, {"id": 56, "text": "The movie Wadjda demonstrates female discrimination in Saudi Arabia. It shows how religion is closely integrated into people's everyday lives as Muslim religion shapes people's behavior, their lifestyle, and social norms. The main character of the movie is a young girl who finds it difficult to follow all the rules in their society and seeks more freedom. Due to her actions and circumstances that she faces, the viewers can get more acquainted with the mentality in her country. From the very beginning, we see many scenes of discrimination that women go through in Muslim culture. A lot of effort is paid to women's upbringing. The society shapes them starting from the way they dress ending with how they behave. First off, women should cover their bodies and wear a hijab. If the little girls cover only their hair aside from their bodies, the young and older women cover their whole face leaving their eyes open or sometimes they are also closed. This should the strictly followed as throughout the movie Wadjda was notified for that as well as the woman doctor who did not cover her face and eyes while being around a man. We also notice that young girls cannot express themselves by painting their nails or drawing on their bodies. In the movie, such inappropriate actions of two girls brought to their discrimination as well as stricter rules inside the school. Secondly, the norms also touch their behavior. We see that certain behaviors and actions are seen as shameful and even sinful. Girls should be humble while males can allow silliness. For example, when two girls were loudly discussing and laughing at something at school. Riding a bike is also considered to be wrong and not appropriate for girls. From the beginning, the main character was told that she cannot buy a bicycle as it is restricted for women. However, when she finally won some money to buy it, they were sent for a good cause so that she could not get it. Thirdly, there is standardized women's behavior around men. Even though all of the above touched women's actions that could bring men's attention, there are separate rules of how they should act around them. It can be seen that women are not allowed to be present among men unless they are their husbands or relatives. Wadjda and her mother were cooking and doing the housework in the separate room where men guests could not see them. Even when her father opens the door we see that her mother moves to the side to make sure no one sees her. Secondly, women cannot look into the eyes of other men. When the main character and her mother were in hospital, the viewers see that her mother does not look at the eyes of the medical worker and closes her face with the part of her hijab. However, women can show their hair and open some parts of their skin at home while wearing hijab outside. Another interesting aspect is that women are not allowed to stay alone with men. This is seen at the moment when Wadjda stays alone with her friend on the roof and gets told off when her mother noticed it. One more moment is when she was passing a building alone and some construction workers were catcalling her. This moment does not only demonstrate the weakness of women under these circumstances but, moreover, shows that they are objectified as something sexual in spite of their young age. Aside from the moments of discrimination, there are aspects that show important traditions, rituals and rules. The movie demonstrates the importance of hygiene. We see it in two scenes: first, when girls are washing their faces and feet at school, another is the moment when Wadjda's mother does it before the Morning Prayer. Second, we notice women are not able to touch pages of the Holy book during their period directly. Plus, while students were reading Qu'ran, we see that there is an appropriate way to do that. The pronunciation, the correctness of intonation, and voice timbre play an important role in this. Thirdly, women's early marriage. Even though Wadjda is a small girl and still studies at school, one of her classmates brought the pictures of her marriage ceremony. However, the viewers also notice the problem with marriage. Women should have perfect image to be able to successfully marry. During some of the inappropriate actions young girls were notified that they should behave so if they want get marries. Forth, men can have more than one woman as their wife. According to Rahman (32), men are allowed to do so by Qu'ran. However, If you fear that you cannot do justice to orphans, then marry from among (orphaned) women such as you like, two, three, or four. But if you fear you will not be fair (to your wives), then (marry) only one; that is the safest course (32). It means that husbands should treat them equally. Despite, this aspect also shows the discrimination towards the first wives. As shown, the husbands can marry more than once, even if their wives are against it. Finally, the tradition of the family tree. This is close to Kazakh culture where people also have a family tree 7 ata or 7 grandfathers, which consists only of men. To sum up, the movie most importantly represents the life of women in the countries where Muslim religion plays big part in people's lives. It tries to raise awareness of the issues. We can see that Wadjda's getting a bicycle at the end of the movie does not only demonstrate the fulfillment of her dreams but it rather shows that women seek more rights and freedom in their life. The movie demonstrates the patriarchal standards in Saudi Arabia which not all women agree with and which need to be less strict towards them. Works Cited: Rahman, Fazlur. Major Themes Of The Qur'an."}, {"id": 57, "text": "Wadjda is a movie about gender inequality mostly justified by Islamic considerations in Saudi Arabia. The credibility of the film about the society's attitude to women's rights can be proved because this film is the first which is directed by a woman, Haifaa Al-Mansour and entirely based in Saudi Arabia. The story revolves around a teenage girl Wadjda, studying in madrasa - a religious school for girls. In this movie the life of a child protagonist represents the whole society. A little girl, whose dream is just to buy a bicycle, so that she could ride it with her friend Abdullah, should withstand all the foundations of her religious society. Wadjda is very joyful, uplifting story, that leaves a positive thought after, even though it has a refusal to accept the limitations set up for women in Islamic country. The idea of the film is conveyed gradually, without any sharp turns of events. Such a course of events can describe the modernization of Islam in Saudi Arabia, also happening gradually. The message of freedom and equality in this film is clear. Director used a method of childish innocence to bring the message to the patriarchal society softer. The equal friendship of two innocent Wadjda and Abdullah are the image of how society should change for their generation. However, the world around them is description of the society as it is: the madrasa with so many restrictions for girls: do not laugh loud, so that men won't hear your voices, cover your faces in the society in front of men, respectable girls cannot stand on the place where men could see them, and, eventually bikes are not for girls. Even her parents, who had clean and pure love in their youth could not withstand the society's requirements to have a son, whose name could be written on the 'family tree'. Hardly noticeable for the environment attempts of Wadjda to change the society: her boldly written name on the family tree, her wish to beat Abdullah in the bike race or her loud statement that despite all adults told her about the bike restrictions, she wants to buy a bike for the money she won at the contest - all these are the quiet protest in the society, where women's voices are taboo. Just as Adeeb Khalid (2007) described in his book, the burden of ... preserving the honor of the community ... fell more heavily on women than on men. (Khalid 2007, 103 pp.) However, Islam, as many other notions like science, culture, mentality, is changing dependant on the time, which can be said after studying about Early Islam, comparing it to Islam that we follow nowadays. For example, after Soviet communism, women were liberated and unveiled, some of the Islamic limitations were cancelled and it demodernized. (Khalid 2007,115 pp.) A teenage girl shows her spirit, and eventually beats Abdullah on the race, wins the contest, showing that she can pray for God standing in one line with the strict principal and at the same time she can listen to modern radio songs, she can also be an entrepreneur making bracelets, and all of this describes a women empowerment in line with keeping the religious traditions. There were many losses in her way - her father destroyed their family, Abdullah said cute and at the same time strange thing that he wants to marry her, but the things at the end changed for Wadjda by help of her caring mother and toy store seller, just like they will be changed for the whole society some time. To conclude, the whole irony of the film is that the main characters are mostly women and it was directed by woman in the Saudi Arabia, where there are not any studio and movie theatre, means that the society is changing for the better and giving women a voice. Haifaa Al-Mansour portrayed the society very realistically, but showed that rebel of Wadjda, a hero of this society, can worth some changes - she eventually rides a bicycle and listens to her lovely music in her jeans and sneakers. The bicycle is a symbol of freedom and the friendship between Abdullah and Wadjda, which does not have any gender inequalities, as Abdullah considers Wadjda as an equal person, is the symbol of hope to possible gender equality in the future. This movie is released and tells us a story about women's role in Saudi Arabian society despite the stereotypes of an Islamic country, which means that changes are yet to come. I would conclude my thoughts after watching this incredible film by the statement that change is not just possible, but they are inevitable."}, {"id": 58, "text": "Wadjda is Saudi Arabian drama film, which tells a heartful story of 10-year-old girl, Wadjda through including some major issues of society. It is the first full-length film, which was shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, where public theaters were illegal at that time. In addition, movie was written and directed by the first female Saudi Arabian director, Haifaa Al-Mansour, who managed to engage the audience into regular and yet unusual lives of women in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, film is special in many aspects and shows the social problems of limitations and possibilities, that women have in probably one of the strictest religious country such as Saudi Arabia. At first glance, the movie seems like telling a simple story of one young girl, who just wants green bicycle and get to race against her caring friend, however, this story touches heart of the audience, since it demonstrates number of issues of mostly unseen and unknown society. The main character of the drama, Wadjda is Saudi girl, who goes to madrasa, where religious teaching is on the first priority and dreams of having bicycle. From the very first scene, where she was wearing converse shoes and was scolded because of her distraction while singing with group of girls, it can be seen that Wadjda is not just an ordinary girl. She is a little rebel, full of energy and enthusiasm, who is brave to do everything to pursue her dreams. Film demonstrates many limitations in lives of women in Saudi Arabia, with which girls struggle from the childhood. For example, school is place of learning and morality, however, there are strict rules, that girls should follow. They should wear head scarf and cover their faces all the time, girls are not allowed to laugh or speak loud to not be heard by men, since women's voice is taboo. Moreover, they even cannot be in view of men, film says respectable girls stop and avoid situations, when they can be seen by stranger men. There are also many prohibited things, that you should not bring or have at school such as photos. Furthermore, if you are caught committing sin, you will be punished in front of all students, so that all will know about the consequences. Riding bicycle is also one of the forbidden things for girls. Every time when Wadjda was telling her mom about wanting bike and asked money for that, her mother told her that girls cannot ride bikes and if they do so, they will not be able to have children. But it did not stop Wadjda, she started saving money by braiding and selling bracelets, mixed tapes and doing requests of older students. Even if some of them got her into trouble, she did not give up. She even decided to participate in Quran recital competition at school to win prize for which she can afford bike. So, she learned the Quran by heart and made huge efforts to win, that she impressed all her schoolmates and teachers. She won, but when teachers and girls heard that she was going to buy bicycle, they all laughed, and head teacher decided to donate money in the name of her, for which Wadjda got upset. Another problem, that was illustrated throughout the film is related to family values and male domination. Wadjda's mother was often oppressed by her rude driver, but she couldn't do anything, since she was dependent on him to have transportation. Moreover, she did not want greater job in order to be respectful for her husband, while he was going to marry another woman just because she couldn't have children anymore. Wadjda feels and sees how her mother is sad and angry and acknowledges that boys and girls are not equally treated after seeing that only boys' names are written on the family tree. Movie illustrates well how the desperation for a male heir and existence of more patriarchal system take place in Saudi Arabia. Throughout the whole movie I was fully captivated by how Wadjda is getting through all the obstacles and oppressions not only from boys, but also from other girls to buy a bike of her dream. In the world, where girls are ashamed of many things, Wadjda wants to show that there is a still place to change those social norms. There were many scenes, which touched my emotions and stayed on my mind even after I have finished watching. One of them is lovable friendship of Wadjda and her friend from neighborhood, Abdullah. Although they are not allowed to meet, they help and care about each other, he teaches her how to ride a bike and helps to solve the problem related to her mother's driver. Next scene is when Wadjda learns how to recite the Quran. Film shows how right recitation and pronunciation are important in Islam. Wadjda's mother helps her to recite correctly, she tells her that words should come from the heart, and to ignore those around you and read from the heart. The drama also explains a few of Islamic regulations such as why Quran should not be open, when it is not used and why all should stand right next to each other during the praying. The most heart-piercing moment in my opinion is the last scene, when Wadjda and her mother are standing together and watching her father's wedding and understanding that now only two of them are left. And finally, Wadjda gets her green bike as a present from her mother and races against Abdulla and wins the race. Overall, I enjoyed watching this film and was emphatic along Wadjda on her journey of pursuing dream. Director was able to demonstrate if not all but some of the major struggles of religious society through eyes of little girl and deliver strong message to the audience. I have already recommended this film to others and I am sure I will watch it again. Impressions after the movie are so great, that it leaves you in a state of appreciating and being grateful for what you have and striving for freedom in despite of all the difficulties of the life. Hope everyone will be able to enjoy the movie."}, {"id": 59, "text": "Wadjda is the first full-length Saudi-Arabian feature film that was created by woman director Haifaa al-Mansour in 2012. The protagonist of the movie is a ten years old girl named Wadjda who along the way of her growing up faces different social restrictions that exist in the community. The main concept of the film is based on the desire of the girl to buy a green bicycle and overtake her friend Abdulla, however, in her society, cycling is perceived as a shame for women. The development of the plot reveals the harsh realities of gender relations in Saudi Arabia which live according to Sharia law. Actual issues of the place of women in Arab society unfold through the experience of the people who surround her: in particular, through her principal and mother. However, despite the fact that people in Saudi Arabia live following the norms of Islam, a significant influence on the restriction of the rights and opportunities of women in society are caused by folk customs and traditions that existed before the advent of Islam, and their consequent fusion has complicated the understanding of true Islam.Before the origin of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula, the relations between men and women in the tribes that inhabited this territory were strictly built on patriarchy. Men were the main carrier of political power and moral authority, exercised control over property, and fathers in families had a leading position. The dominance of men in society was so great that the birth of a girl, not a boy, was ending in tragedy, and even led to the murder of baby girls. The birth of Islam in the 7th century led to strengthening women's rights in the society of that time. The Prophet Muhammad has established the first rights of women in Arab culture. The first wife of the prophet Khadija was an entrepreneur who faithfully followed him, and the other wife, Aisha, commanded the army at the Battle of Basra and became the author of many hadiths. In this way, the power and significance of women were highlighted by the relation of the Prophet to his wives since he said: You have rights over your women, and your women have rights over you. The concept of the relationship of the prophet with women laid the foundation for respectful gender relations in Islam. However, after the death of Muhammad, his teachings on Islam began to be interpreted in different ways, which led to confusion and misinterpretation by the followers. But most importantly, Islam, like other religions, had the property of adapting to local culture as it was in Central Asia and other regions. Thus, in cases when social disputes could not be solved according to the Islamic norms since not all issues are discussed in Qu'ran, people started to solve problems according to cultural and traditional norms. In this way, the fusion of culture and religion took place and over time the borders between them were blurred and the influence of national mentality occurred.This issue is clearly presented in the plot of the Wadjda by the director of the film. The girl's desire to have a bicycle and ride it like her friend-boy was ridiculed and faced prohibitions by others who surrounded her. The main obstacle was the belief that the girl would lose her honor and dignity in the face of men since her mother said that in case she would ride a bicycle: Nobody will marry you and you will not have children. Again, this kind of fear arises from the traditional structure of Arab society, where a man acts as a representative of his family in the public and the woman as the guardian of the hearth in the house. In other words, when the dignity is the priority for males, the shame from the public can adversely affect the family well-being of the girl and deprive her of the opportunity to fulfill the basic traditional function of women in a society where she should give birth to children. The main problem is that despite the absence of violations of religious norms, non-observance of informal cultural principles can subject the girl to severe punishment by the state due to different subjective interpretations of the religion. If in the film where school to some extent is an epitome of the state, the girl is softly punished by her desire for a bicycle by not being awarded a prize for winning the competition, then in real adulthood, a girl may be severely punished for desires and actions that are inconsistent with social standards. This punishment is cruelly performed by the Saudi Arabian religious police. Very often, in the Arabian state, women can be punished for actions that do not correspond to their national traditions by the religious police while it does not concern religion. Such kind of regulations is not legally fixed in the state and informal standards should not be controlled in this way, because it violates the rights of women who are subject to numerous restrictions by Arabian society.So, from the one side of the story about a little girl Haifaa al-Mansour has shown that the main obstacle to strengthening women's rights in Saudi Arabia is the interpretation of Islam through the perspective of traditions and cultural norms. But most importantly, the close connection of culture with religion has led to an unfair assessment of women in Arab society. The main character Wadjda became a symbol and impulse of small but critically important changes for the society since in the end she still got a bicycle and fulfilled her dream despite many fears. It shows us that the main limitations that surround us are always started in our heads."}, {"id": 60, "text": "Wadjda is the first movie that was shot entirely in Saudi Arabia by a female Saudi director Haifaa al-Mansour (Wikipedia). She wanted to represent the real life of women in Saudi Arabia. While filming Wadjda, Haifaa al-Mansour faced many problems due to strict limitations that women face there (Tobias 2013, 14). She made her outdoor shots from the car using a walkie-talkie because in Saudi Arabia it is prohibited for women to work with men in public (Tobias 2013, 14). However, despite all faced limitations and difficulties, Haifaa al-Mansour created a beautiful, heart touching movie that addresses many issues of Saudi women, and that offers hope for the changes in society. The film tells a story about a little girl Wadjda who lives with her mother in the capital of Saudi Arabia- Riyadh following the sharia law. She attends Madrasa, where she should follow strict rules. Although Wadjda obeys almost all the rules and respects her teachers in school, she is a rebel who listens to rock music, wears Converse shoes, jeans, has secret meets with a boy Abdulla. Furthermore, she has a dream to buy a bicycle but according to the rules, women in Saudi Arabia are prohibited to ride a bicycle. However, Wadjda does not stop to dream about it and make efforts to buy this green bicycle. Her spirit is full of big dreams, she is brave and powerful, and does not give up in achieving her goal. The prohibition for women to ride a bicycle is not only one that shown in the film. The director shows the everyday challenges that women face. For instance, women are not allowed to drive, thus, Wadjda's mother has to hire a driver and to endure his endless complaints and criticisms. Women are not allowed and criticized for work with men, they should hide all the body except their eyes. The film depicts patriarchal society living by sharia law, where woman's value is counted as half of the man's and controversial religious traditions. However, despite all these limitations and impositions, Wadjda a little 10 years old girl seems to be unstoppable and inspirational for other girls in Saudi Arabia. The bicycle about which Wadjda dreamed serves as a metaphor in this film. Here, a bicycle can be interpreted as a symbol of freedom. Everyone in her surroundings believes and tells her that bicycles are only for boys, even her mother after hearing Wadjda's dream, tells her that, in the future, she will never marry and have children and will disgrace their family. However, by riding a bike, Wadjda breaks the frames of society in which he lives and proves that women are equal to men. The film shows how a great power and strength can fit in a little girl. To achieve her goal, and to obtain the bicycle of her dreams, Wadjda put a lot of effort. Initially, she makes bracelets and sells them, she passes secret messages and manipulates Abdullah. These means seem to be hopeless to collect 800 riyals, and Wadjda chooses another path, which is more truthful and correct. Wadjda participates in a religious contest. To win it, she makes hard work to learn the Quran. These scenes, also, show the diligence of the girl and her willingness to make her dream come true. Moreover, the scenes of recitations of the text show the beauty and magic of Quranic texts and the Arabic language. Also, it is seen the careful and respectful attitude to the Quran which is considered as a holy book, a revelation from Allah. Although the director of the film passes a critical view of patriarchic traditions, it does not seem like a film intends to pass a political agenda or to pass the provocateur message. On the contrary, the film shows all the problems and challenges of a woman through the story of one typical family, it's everyday life and through the relationships of simple people. Although it is shown that women in Saudi Arabia take limitations and challenges of life for granted, at the same time, the director shows quite free behavior of women in their private life. For instance, girls color their nails, the mother of Wadjda wears beautiful clothes and even smokes secretly, which is completely against the rules. However, director Haifaa al-Mansour represents not only the limitations and difficulties of the life of women. She also shows the beauty of Islam. For instance, when Wadjda starts to learn the text of the Quran, she shows her diligence and develops her self-confidence. Faith in God helps to develop faith in each other. Although the film seems to be simple and uncomplicated, it passes serious messages. I found this film to be very powerful. It touched me and made me think about many issues. I am sure that this film and the power of Wadjda could affect girls and women who saw it, to inspire and to move them towards changes and towards an equal, fair, and happy life."}, {"id": 61, "text": "The synopsis of the film does not help much in making someone watch it, but when you do it captures you immediately, the main point becomes clear and comes across as very convincing. The story is about a little, but witty and brave way above her age girl, living in suburbs of Saudi Arabia, where the life is hard for you just because you were born girl. A little similar to Christianity where you didn't even manage to do anything, but are still responsible for the sins of older generations, and have to suffer for that. The film shows the struggles of this girl on the way of buying herself a bicycle, which is deemed as dangerous for the girls' virtue, and even her mom is scared of the consequences that the purchase would bring. Her plans seem to be doomed when the schemes she go to don't work, until the new competition arrives, the competition in reciting Quran. The bike just plays a role of a superficial goal, which girl wants to reach against all odds, when the whole world seems to go against her. Looking at the year it was made it is surprising how this message is still relevant today but was pointed out that early. In fact, it is a miracle that it was even made, and published, since even driving is prohibited for women and they have no rights to vote, let alone pursue cinematography. This is a first movie that was directed by a woman in Saudi Arabia, she, similarly to the character in the film wanted to be heard and wanted other women from there to be heard, showing everyday life of regular women in that country, subtly through Wadjda's story and goals. The fact that this is a first official submission to the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film from Saudi Arabia shows the effect it had, this is no fantasy or the depiction of some novel, it is a reality. Even the colors are plain, which is unusual for cinematography where post-processing takes one of the major aspects. From different interviews we can see that the plot was clearly taken from Haifaa Al-Mansour's own life, of course with a little bit of flavor added. The main goal of Wadjda - green glossy bike is not important in itself, but is a symbol to lots of things that girls want, but cannot afford, and likely will not ever have. Extreme effort and bad look from people in the street are to be expected to reach these kinds of goals. Wadjda gets this goal in mind after a little fight with her neighbour friend, after that she's always looking at the green bike across the street, even making friends with the shopkeeper there. She doesn't have enough time since every day there is a greater chance that someone else would buy that bike. That's where her thought out friendship with the shopkeeper comes into play, she asks him not to sell a bicycle to anyone and gifts him a mix of songs on the cassette. The songs she listens to are also pretty much prohibited and her mother calls them Devil's music and tells her to turn it off. Since she's 10 years old, she's obviously going to the scholl, but since it is an Islamic country, she goes to madrasa, where the rules are harsh, and her headteacher is strict too, telling her to cover her face, or not play when there are men around. The mother is not much of a help too for she is also preoccupied dealing with her husband's willingness to take a second wife, which shows other problems of Saudi Arabia. The problem is that being a good wife is not enough, every demand should be met. Wadjda's mother was not capable of carrying new children, most importantly a heir for the husband, so he decides to have a second wife. Right after she finds out about the competition, and that the prize will be even higher than the cost of bike she starts to prepare very hard. First of all, she buys an electronic course of Quran, money for which she earns by herself and her own wit. At first she's not that good, but with her strong will and evening talks and studies with mother she wins the competition. But even then, after the teacher finds out that Wadjda wanted to buy a bike, they strip her of the prize and direct it into Palestine on her behalf. This once again emphasizes the infinite obstacles that encircle women. Of course the film should better end in a good note and it turns out that her mother eventually buys her a bicycle, overcoming all the strain that the public might put on her, choosing her daughter over crowd's opinion. Even then, she could afford that only by letting her husband have a second wife."}, {"id": 62, "text": "There are many movies about Saudi Arabia, but what makes movie Wadjda unique is woman director Haifaa Al Mansour. It is already becoming clear that the theme of the movie is more about moral and civil restrictions rathe rather and feminism and women's rights.The story describes a 10 years girl Wadjda living in a small city. Wadjda wears sneakers, listening to rock music, goes to school, and wondering about a bicycle. At first glance, Wadjda is a normal child with interests, hobbies, sports, and friends, she is the only child in the family and both parents raised her in love. The picture that the director shows to the audience looks common and ordinary and predicts the story of an ordinary girl's life. However, with every ordinary scene, the audience can see the discrimination towards women. For example, Wadjda cannot wear sneakers, she should always make sure that her scarf is on her head, cannot ride a bicycle to school, has to always hide from the eyes of men. Accordingly, all these scenes cause a storm of emotions and encourage people to turn to the history and politics of the country.In Muslim countries, the people's rights, policy, education, labor and seem to be everything is based on the Quran that directs every part of humans life. And as it comes to the right of women, the Quran (Quran 4:34) makes a point that men are responsible for the maintenance of women as they have the excellence over them. This excerpt from the Quran had a lot of debates among scholars and the understanding of this by Muslim countries is seen in the example of the ordinary life of Islamic women in the movie.Haifaa Al Mansour showed the position of Wadjda's mother and other women as well. From the beginning, it is seen that a woman has trouble with transport to her work and was seeking ways of improving the situation. However, it is not easy for a woman to find out work with a high salary where she will not meet any representatives of males. Therefore, she continues to work on the same job and thinking about the financial situation of her family because her husband is preparing for the new wedding by referring to the reason for not having a son. Other examples mentioned in the movie are early marriage, because of the fear of being caught in a romantic relationship with a man; a ban on cycling, because of the fear of inability to have children, hiding in houses to hide from the eyes of men. The director shows the inability of women to make decisions in imposing their lives. However, revealing the women's rights discrimination is not the only theme that Haifaa Al Mansour demonstrates to the audience.Another theme in the movie is the moral of recognizing good and evil. Despite the fact that women have to humble to the existing rules in society, they remain to choose these rules as established to be as good. The reason could be the upbringing of fathers and grandfathers, a platform of morality and choice, deeply established in people's subconscious mind. The director showed the mindset of women and the whole society unchangeable, but they do not rebel, but calmly resign themselves to the situation, considering this the most correct decision. Therefore, Wadjda's mother who proposes the infallible character grieves but accepts the husband's departure from the family. Wadjda, despite the indestructible desire of having a bicycle that motivated her to break her own record, resigned herself to the rule of society. Both mother and daughter accept fate and the world as it is with all its flaws. But it seems that they would like to understand for themselves that being good means being good for themselves as well. They allow themselves to maintain their individuality. The mother cuts her hair, decides to take the financial responsibility for the daughter, and buys her a bicycle to prolong a little bit of childish carelessness and happiness. Women represent the attitude towards the world as the attitude towards Quran Words must come from the heart. With their pious attitude, they remain to stay morally good, gentle, not creating problems.This is the most difficult in the movie: to understand and accept the women's position in this story. On the one hand, their basic human needs, desires, ambitions are ignored and not welcomed. On the other, it is hard to renounce from the traditions and go against their upbringing. The movie softly shows the reality based on one family and pictures the pain points of present-day women in Muslim countries. The simple language and ordinary scenes help to deeply understand and feel the emotions and deep sadness of the main characters. Maybe this is because the story of Wadjda is the collective story of someone's nostalgic memories."}, {"id": 63, "text": "It's not often that you see a movie from Saudi Arabia, a country with the motto: There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger, where religion is at such a level that it is extremely deeply intertwined with culture and traditions. Film Wadjda from such films is distinguished by the presence of three awards of the Cannes Film Festival, and a woman as a director, which is extremely rare for this country. It is easy to guess that the film will focus on women's rights in Muslim countries. And even not so much about civil rights, but about moral restrictions, vowels and unspoken.Wadjda is a little girl, the only child in the family. He wears sneakers with the stars, makes friends with the boy, dreams of a bicycle. A rebel, one might say. In any more or less liberal country, they would give a couple of dolls, and even left it as it is, if it didn't help. Wadjda, on the other hand, is forced to paint stars on sneakers with a black felt-tip pen and put up with her parents' refusal to buy her a bicycle. Officially, girls are not forbidden to ride a bicycle, but in fact it is not welcomed - it's not accepted; girls should not behave like boys and do men's business. For Wadjda's mother, it's rather not about fear that society will condemn them. First of all, she thinks about her future daughter: not so long the child has to go without a hijab, some of the same age are already married, older girls are under the special attention of the morals police. You need to get used to the role of a woman and her lifestyle. You need to be careful about your honor. The film very sensitively shows how all this whirls in the warm Arabian air around the still small, bold and cheerful Wadjda. And flies to her scraps of phrases, the scents of male perfumes, secretly seen situations.As before Wadjda, the secret of life in that world where all women are in black and men in white is revealed to the viewer. With smooth movements of the camera, the picture shows what exactly distinguishes Muslim women from the rest. One can easily guess the director's disagreement with such conditions. But there is no accusatory pressure in the film, they do not rush with forks at cruel oppressors. Here, the mother teaches her daughter to read the Quran in chant so that the words come from the heart. And no one has to doubt the innocence and purity of the heart of this child.In the Haifaa Al-Mansour's picture of religious morality, quite a lot of space is reserved. And sometimes it is directly violated and this does not always have consequences. Just the creators put morality of a completely different type at the forefront. For them, it is much more important that a person understands the concepts of good and evil, rather than strictly following a set of religious rules. There is no condemnation of the canons of religion in the film, there is disagreement with them. So mother Wadjda is the most infallible of adult heroines both in practice and in thoughts. She has to give her beloved husband to her second wife. She meekly accepts her fate, although she is grieving. But after this loss, a woman still allows her daughter to be a child for a little longer: happy, carefree, open. And maybe the girl will grow up and refuse to follow the laws of her ancestors. After all, she is considered unworthy of even a small leaf on a family tree. Or maybe she will grow up and accept her world as it is. After all, the neighbor boy had already promised to marry her.This is the most pleasant thing in the film: without unnecessary complications, he makes it clear that everyone has his own view of things. It is not easy to go against the traditions of the fathers, to leave your family, your country. After all, people live like this and many live happily ever after. Feminine softly, almost gently, the picture touches one of the painful points of modern society. Straightness is smoothed out by the kindness and love with which the main character is surrounded. The simplicity and openness of the picture helps to better understand the complexity of the problem. And that Wadjda's story is also someone's gaze, collected from nostalgic memories, facts and personal protest."}, {"id": 64, "text": "The movie Wadjda, directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour, is the story of schoolgirl Wadjda, who studies in the religious school for girls in Saudi Arabia. In the movie at a first glance you might think that she was depicted as a person who has small deviant behavior, because in the movie she wears sport shoes, speaks loudly at school, sells different bracelets, uses different postcards for football players, helps his friend date with guy, hides the secrets of other girls in front of the headmaster, has a friendship with boy, listens to western music and does not afraid of to say what she things. Even if she breaks numerous social norms, it does not mean that she is anti-protagonist, in contrast, she is a girl who wants equality and freedom. She just wants to have bicycle and be a friend with Abdullah. The movie covers several important social topics: inequality, friendship, motivation, love, family problems, polygamous relationships and social norms in Saudi Arabia. Social inequality. It is seen from the beginning of the movie that women should always wear clothes that totally cover their body and face, except their eyes. They should not talk loudly, because men could listen their words and it would be a shame. Women can not speak and have friendly relationships with boys. Women are not allowed to ride even bicycles, and this action is showed as an action which is not intended for girls. Whereas, I did not see such restrictions for men, they could wear whatever they want, they could speak how loud they want, they even could get married second and third times without any permission and consent with their wife. Friendship. I liked the story of friendship between Wadjda and Abdullah. There was nothing shameful, just a story of friendship between two school children. Despite social norms about the friendship between boys and girls, those two became very good friends. Abdullah always was ready to help her. Abdullah went with her to look for the driver in faraway areas and gave her his own bicycle to teach her how to ride it. It was a really cute story. Motivation. I think the motivation is one of the most important and well-disclosed topics in the movie. The film shows the importance and challenges of having motivation and dream. The dream of Wadjda was to buy a bicycle to ride on it with his friend, but all people, his mother, headmaster said to her that bicycles are not for girls. Despite that, she started to earn and collect money to buy the bicycle for herself. She decided to take part in the Quran reading and knowledge competition. In the beginning, she could not read properly and did not have right pronunciation. She decided to be the part of religious club to practice her skills. Wadjda spent her own money to buy video quiz game to learn numerous concepts about Quran. One of the problems that she faced during the learning process is her shyness in front of the huge auditoria, because she could not cite the words of Quran melodiously. She could memorize all the words of Quran but could not cite them melodiously. However, at the end, she was able to overcome her fears and win the contest. I was very offended when the headmaster decided to not give Wadjda her winnings, because Wadjda wanted to buy the bicycle. On the other hand, this moment shows the honesty of Wadjda, because she could just lie and receive her money, but she said the truth, for which, unfortunately, she was punished. Love. Despite the problems in the family, her mother and father tried to not to show it to their daughter. Even if their marriage broke up in front of her eyes, her mother could support her daughter, who was unjustly deprived from her winning. Instead of buying beautiful dress, her mother decided to buy new bicycle for daughter to cheer her up. In my opinion, this moment illustrates that in spite of your personal problems it should not affect to your love and relationships with other people, especially with children. The movie did not have any technical mistakes, or some kind of cinematic miracle, but its content was unique, its soundtrack was marvelous, and its acting was great. The movie could show several important social problems, like inequality, love, and motivation, but, more important it showed that how it is important for people to feel the warmth and love of people close to you. The movie also emphasized an interesting point that people who do something that somehow violates social norms are not always bad people. I think this is what the director really wanted to show in her movie that there is nothing wrong with being different from others or having other desires and dreams, at least until it does not hurt others; that you should always work hard and follow your dreams, even if you are just small girl living in the society which strictly follow social norms."}, {"id": 65, "text": "Wadjda is a Saudi-Arabian movie about a ten years old girl who grows up in an extremely strict society, which is quite unfair to women. Starting from the first seconds of the movie when viewers can see school madrasa and rules which girls have to follow it becomes very obvious that they are programmed to be patient, silent, humble and always hide from other men. This review will argue that the movie's main idea was to demonstrate the inferior place of woman in Arabian society and importance of Islam in the life of every person in the state. The suppression of girls' individualities and willingness to become slightly independent from their very childhood can be seen from the school's rules and teachers' attitudes. Girls are forced to wear hijab and even cover their faces even though they are still very young children. They are even not allowed to wear comfortable sneakers, as it is not feminine and stands out in comparison to majority girls' black standard shoes. Our main heroine Wadjda is a brave and sporty girl who most of all appreciates comfort of the clothes rather than standard beauty, she wants to stand out and be creative, to express her individuality. She tries to do so by coloring her sneakers but then the school's director calls them ugly, and makes her wear black shoes. In the same manner two girls who just wanted to follow modern fashion trends and color their nails and read girlish magazines were almost expelled from the school for this. It might seem quite absurd for female viewers from western countries where these actions are kind of must do of every teenager girl with her friends on sleepover. Even photos are prohibited in the schools, so that when Salima, a classmate of Wadjda from Religious club, brings photos from her wedding teacher says that it is not good. Moreover, the little girl, who is not even a teenager, was forced to marry an adult twenty-year old man. From the calm reaction of girls on her wedding, it can be understood that this is a common practice in the state. Even Wadjda's mother always repeats that they will not force her to marry now, when she is a child, so that she is not supposed to worry about this. Women are even not allowed to talk, sing or laugh so that other men can hear their voice. When girls were talking and laughing in the school but the director was mad about their behavior and said, do you want men to hear you? In addition, when Wadjda was in a good mood and wanted to sing but her mother replied in the same manner as the director that her father's friends would hear her voice. This is a direct evidence that women literally do not have their own voice. Just because Wadjda's mother could not give birth to a son, her husband decided to take a second wife and he did not think about his daughter's or wife's feelings. When Wadjda sticked her name on her father's family tree he took it off, showing that he does not value her as much as if she was a boy. Such a toxic environment where a girl had to live and grow shows that in our modern and civilized world there are still a lot of prejudices and unfairness. Also we can notice that Islam plays a vital role in community's life. For example girls have special classes and Religious club where they learn to read the Quran in the right way and even have a competition based on their knowledge of the Quran. Moreover, Wadjda and her mother wake up early for Prayer, and at school, all people also pray together. Regarding the quality of the movie, it was a bit challenging to read the poorly made subtitles, which I am sure, did not convey the whole meaning of the conversations. Also from my point of view, there were too little sound effects there, so they could improve the film by adding relatable background music to make viewers feel particular emotions. However, despite all of these, it was quite fascinating and intriguing to listen to Arabic language, particularly I liked scenes where girls sang parts from the Quran, showing that Arabic language is melodic and beautiful. Moreover, it seems to me that a movie director could successfully deliver us how traditions and religion get along with the modern world. For instance, Wadjda's mother as all women has to cover her face and wear hijab but when she is at home, she makes beautiful hairstyling by using hair straightener or she also goes shopping to the mall to buy imported dress. I also like the ending of the movie when Wadjda finally gets her bicycle and rides it being happy. It makes viewers feel that despite all the restrictions and taboos for women there they still do not lose their faith in the bright future and chance to be happy."}, {"id": 66, "text": "This film starts with the story of a girl named Wadjda. She was one of the unique students at a madrasa in Saudi Arabia. She was around 12-13 years old. Her story at this film began at a madrasa. Before going to madrasa she was waiting for her dad. Her mother was going to work and her dad was coming from work. Every day on the way to school she was playing with one small boy named Abdulla. This boy had a bicycle which was become a dream of Wadjda. Wadjda had a very energetic personality she was following her dreams and was accomplishing her aims step by step. On the way to home, she saw a truck with a bicycle which was going to a toy shop. She followed the truck and found a bicycle and asked the price of it. It was too expensive about 800 riyals. This was her dream to buy this bicycle. She started to make some bracelets and was selling to the girls at a madrasa. She was helping some girl to transfer the letter to one young man outside of a madrasa by getting some money from them. When Wadjda was playing outside and when a man was looking at them it was so shameful because it was a sin. But Wadjda didn't care too much because she had a young man who was playing with her. The director of the madrasa was kept saying that it was a big sin when a man can hear the voice of women from the outside. Girls were wearing full body cover such as burka. This was designed to hide their body from a man outside of the home. The girl who was dating a boy outside of madras was caught by religious police. She probably needed to marry this boy afterwards. This shows us the great example of some strict Sharia rules in Saudi Arabia. Wadjda heard that there will be a knowledge of Koran competition. Madrasa was giving some prize for the winner. The prize was 1000 riyals. She signed up for a competition to win the money and to buy this bicycle. She started to learn Koran and was very successful. She was receiving good feedback from her teachers. However, at that time she had some problems with her family. Her grandmother wanted to find a bride for her dad. As we know Saudi Arabia open for polygamy marriages. Her dad was also interested in finding another woman because her mom almost died when Wadjda was born. Her mom had a risk of dying if she would be pregnant. This was a huge problem in her family because her dad wanted a son to be born. This shows us the male dominance makes the circumstance very different from the western world. According to Sharia law, each man should ask permission of his wife to marry. Wadjda's mom was against the second bride of her husband. Two girls at school caught by making some drawings at their body and they were judged by the director of a madrasa in front of all students. The director of madrasa said that they committed sin. This shows how schools in Saudi Arabia follow some strict sharia rules. At that time Wadjda was highly involved in learning Koran to win the competition. At home, she saw a family tree where names all the males from her linage were drawn. Her dad did not have any continuing linage and Wadjda wrote her name on paper and pasted there. On the next day, she saw this paper on the ground because her dad ripped the paper off from the family tree. This was a message of male dominance and there was no place for women even in the family tree. Women were considered as the last option. Although in Kazakh society we can see the female dominance has a very influential role. According to Khalid's article (2007), we can see that because of the Soviet Union women were taking a more important place in Islam and this dominance survived till today. We can see that Saudi Arabia is much more different than Kazakhstan by looking at female dominance in the family. Kazakh pays more respect for women because Kazakhstan does not rule under Sharia law. Wadjda won the competition but she did receive the award for it because madrasa director said that she will send it to Palestine. This shows that there is no freedom of choice. Her dreams were crushed in a moment. On the way when she was going home she saw Abdulla and he told her that he wants to marry her when he will grow. She went home and her mom said that her dad marries other women. At that time, she was totally upset because of the situation she ended up. Her mom told that they are alone after that day. I think that Wadjda's father was going against the sharia law because his first wife needed to ratify his second marriage. This shows that some Saudis does not really follow the Islamic rule. Although the movie ended in a very happy way because her mom bought her a bicycle that she was dreaming for a long time. She was driving and racing with her friend Abdulla. This was the end of the movie."}, {"id": 67, "text": "The place of women in Muslim society always raised questions regarding their hierarchical position and liberty that they possess or perhaps, do not possess. Haifaa al-Mansour being a first Saudi-Arabian female director opened the curtain to the everyday-life of girls in Saudi-Arabia and how their dreams are met in such a conservative community. The country where the movie industry has been all but silenced, this movie challenged well-established rules where it is all dictated by the patriarchy. The director succeeds in showing a girl who is trying to reach their dreams but is being forbidden because she is not supposed to have such dreams, as only certain dreams that include being married and having kids are accepted. In other words, women are allowed to behave and even think by the standards, and all deviations are strictly prohibited. Such revealing film deserves to be spoken and to be taken into account when the lives of women are thought out by Islam laws and therefore, has to be adjusted in the modern world. The movie centers on a girl named Wadjda whose dream is to be able to buy a bike. Throughout the movie, we witness that adults prohibit riding a bike as it is not for girls. And the only person who supports her is a boy who wants to marry her someday. Interestingly, the relationship between Wadjda and Abdullah juxtaposes with adults' relationships. For example, Wadjda's mother suffers from her marriage because she cannot give a son to her husband that eventually results in the second marriage of her husband. Or the principal's rumored thief who happens to be her lover, and even a little girl's marriage to a 20-year-old man. All these examples showed how little can woman decide in their own lives. Women are treated poorly if they dare to love on their own and if they cannot labor a baby with accepted gender. The women's place in Muslim society was seen in the family tree of Wadjda's father as well. Only men's names were written in this tree and when Wadjda tried to pin her name, it was ripped off possibly by her mother, so that the husband would not see such action. Mostly, women are the ones who influence other women to know their place and to behave in a certain way. Family and school are institutes where girls study how they should avoid being the center of attention or something that endangers their ability to give birth. It can be seen in the scene where the girls were outside of the school and some men were able to see them. Wadjda was the only one who stayed and continued playing, but when the principal emphasized that men are watching, she left the playground. Even constant mentions from other women, that woman's voice should not be heard by other men showed us how women in Saudi-Arabia should keep their head down and mouth shut. Wadjda's strength and rebel nature manifests itself with her entrepreneurial ability and winning a competition. But the limitations conferred by her gender result of giving her honestly earned money to charity as that what was expected from her. But the failure to be financially independent in a conservative patriarchal society was not the only challenge. And the even greater danger was imposed on the little girl when the building-site worker harasses her while she was walking from school. The movie shows constant threats that follow women. In the country, where women cannot drive, Wadjda's mother loses her job because the driver lets her down and she became even more dependent on her elusive husband who demands a male heir. Haifaa al-Mansour does a great job of portraying a true rebel in Saudi-Arabia by showing Wadjda's influence from the Western world. Her stubborn wearing of baseball boots that she wears underneath her abaya and listening to western music reveals how independently-thought she is. Such interpretation challenges the women's role and the power of western influence on the conservative Islamic country. Wadjda's father's second wedding triggers her mother and makes her develop as an independent personality. Such a twist results in getting the precious bike and realization that the only support they have is each other. The little presence of men also made a mark on the message of the whole movie. Thus, even if there were not many main male characters, the actions of all women in this movie were influenced by the patriarchy. Women are squeezed by the laws that are dictated by men where they are not even allowed to drive themselves. At the end, where she gets her desired bicycle and when Abdullah shares that he wants to marry her when they get older cause conflicting feelings. On the one hand, it shows his true feelings toward her. On the other hand, by adding that line it shows how arranged Wadjda's life would be after all. All the challenges faced and efforts made she still has to follow the Islamic laws, where the men play a crucial role in determining every woman's further life."}, {"id": 68, "text": "My opinion on the movie and its musical score: The movie Wadjda does not give you an urge to watch it when reading the synopsis, it brings this desire to know how the story will end just when you start watching it. I believe its a strong movie with a strong message for anybody who would decide to watch it, as well as I did thoroughly enjoy its musical score and editing made by the veteran of feature film industry's musical editing, Suzana Peric. Her work in this film is impressive, leading to effects that leave the viewer emotionally attached to the scene, projecting emotions through not-so-frequent scores of feeling cheering and upbeat, or at times emphatic and little bit sad for the character's situation. The sound is never forcing itself on the viewer, instead it accompanies the scene on the screen, just slightly pushing those emotions further. That is best seen in iconic scenes for this film, as when the green bycicle is flowing through the streets in the beginning parts of the movie, possibly also being symbolic of freedom that women in the Arabic society are lacking; As well as when her mother in the end shows Wadjda the purchase she made, finally breaking, again symbolically, the stigma of woman's place in that society. Suzana's previous list of works also include such prominent movies as Lord of the Rings (2001), Little Women (2019), etc.The story and main character: The story of the movie Wadjda is the story of a 11-year-old girl Wadjda that just wants to let her voice be heard, while the society is either trying to suppress her will or bend her to comply to the rules and customs of that same surroundings. Her parents are on a brink of divorce, her mother is struggling to keep her work together, while she pushes on and is working her hardest to earn money for that green bycicle dream, that is sold by the shopkeeper, and finally beat Abdalla in their race. Even though she never rode a bike before, even though the people around her say that girls should not ride bikes, she still pursues that dream. She is a strong willed character, a brave little girl, that will not back down. As her mom later phrased it, when she goes in for something, nobody can stop her.About the filming: Both the movie and its script were directed and written by the efforts of one of the first, if not the first female filmmaker in Saudi Arabia, namely Haifaa Al-Mansour. In her filmographic history she has shot three feature films in total, each focusing on topics that are widely thought of as being taboo for the discussion in UAE's society. In this movie she depicts the hardships that women in general have to face when being born and raised in Arabian Kingdom, as well as the way in which society reacts to the opinion that differs from standard, where the women's voice is not to be heard, as it is TABOO.The theme of Woman's Voice = TABOO: This theme is unraveled in the film throughout the story, showing the place that women are accustomed to, showing the inacceptance of society of woman's active position as well as inequality of women's position as compared to men, and even if inside women (characters) do protest against it, they still do everything to abide by the rules imposed by the socium, at least publicly. This is strongly seen in cases with the principal of the school, Miss Hussa as well as Abir. Both act, or were acting as the sovereigns of obedience, but as the movie has shown, both also disagree with the strictness of rules placed on them and their inability to change things. In this sense, principal is later seen to call Wadjda resembling herself in youth, at the time when Ms. Hussa calls her to her office the second time.Movie's position on the matter as well as my opinion: The movie itself, however wide and clearly it states the position of women in the society, does not focus on the permanence of that. It is quite opposite, as seen in many cases throughtout the entire film as well as in its final closing scenes. It was never an immutable opinion to begin with, it is just that society is hard to change in a blink of an eye and every woman that thinks actively must understand that. The change that has its roots so deep that women have to try on dresses in restroom cubicles instead of normal dressing rooms has to start with family, first and foremost. Only those that are close to the characters are able to understand them; It is not the teachers or friends that need to be influenced and have their opinion on the matter changed, it is our own mothers, future husbands (Abdalla) and relatives that need to have that paradigm shift.Conclusion: The movie in itself is a great treat to watch and think about. Even better to write a review about [:)]. The sound editing as well as scene design did not leave me displeased. I personally loved the scene when the green bycicle first shows up in the movie, as it symbolically is flowing through, with the wall acting as makeshift desert. For me that scene was initially representative of that greenish, refreshing freedom to come, in the world of strict, sand-like and suffocating rules imposed on those women of UAE Kingdom. Thus, I greatly enjoyed Wadjda (2012) and hope anybody reading this will do as well."}, {"id": 69, "text": "The movie subtly and elegantly portrays the everyday life of Saudi women through the story of a common Saudi Arabian young girl called Wadjda and her path to her dreams. The movie shows the common life of women and their hardships and sacrifices as a never loosening background accompanying Wadjda's every action and social interaction she makes. Wadjda is a ten years old girl, who has a sincere child dream to ride a bike along with her best friend Abdullah. But her dream turns out to be prohibited, and nobody except his friend Abdullah understands her or tries to help her. Saudi conservative community prohibits any girl to even ride a bike, not to say something much simpler such as wearing bracelets and sports shoes at school, laughing loudly or using nail polish. At this moment, the movie shows Wadjda's persistent and courageous character to continue efforts to achieve her dream, although society and family sees these actions as rebellious and even sinful in some cases. Wadjda engaged in trading with self hand-made bracelets and contemporary music tapes, which are prohibited as something either relating to only males (taboo) or as Wadjda's mother said considered as Satan's music. But this effort gave Wadjda just 87 riyals and disciplinary misconduct in front of the school's director, whereas the bike she was striving for costs 800 riyals, and every day she loses, the higher rises the possibility of someone else buying it for his/her son. Wadjda became so obsessed with her dream of a bike that she does not pay much attention to imminent family problems arising soon as her father is planning to marry his second wife. As Wadjda's Mom can not give birth to a new child, and her husband decides to marry a new one, the movie subtly emphasizes on the husband's words If you had given me an heir, this situation would not have occurred. when he refused to give money to sustain a driver for Wadjda's Mom and rather saved them for dowry for his new future wife. Here, the movie conveys an astonishingly simple and terrific message that in Saudi traditions it is even not enough for woman to be a good wife of which husband indeed is proud of if you can not satisfy every demand of highly patriarchal society as giving heir-boy child to your husband. This approaching tough future reality of Wadjda becoming someone's wife is seen throughout the movie as when her friend 10 years old girl had an arranged marriage with 20 years old man, or when the scandal erupted with teenager girl from her school caught dating someone, or with school director ordering Wadjda to wear hijab and Mom jokily refusing to marry Wadjda for a while. Returning to Wadjda, personally, it felt like Wadjda escaped from this harsh reality by concentrating on other things such as her dream, while her adult Mom could not. So, when the Quran recitation contest with 1000 riyals prize was announced Wadjda's eyes immediately sparkled with a strong decision to win in this contest and to buy the desired bike to make her dream come true. Wadjda invested her 87 riyals in quick Quran teaching interactive cassette disks and started to learn with them, participated in religious clubs in school, despite having a hard time of lagging behind everyone else in the club in reciting Quran, and worked thoroughly with her mother at evenings. Eventually she got first place in the contest and won the prize. But the very moment when the movie showed how a young rebellious strong-willed Saudi girl succeeded in achieving her sincere dreams, movie relentlessly deprived this happy end with school director ordering to give this money to Palestinians on behalf of Wadjda when she heard that Wadjda was planning to buy the prohibited bike with this money. Here again, the movie shows that traditional taboo plays an immense role in local society so that up to these days women's dreams like Wadjda's one often got suppressed and lost. However, movie director Haifaa Al Mansour, who probably have been witnessing all these scenes throughout her upbringing, eventually decides to end this story with a mini happy end of Wadjda's Mom buying to her the very bike she wanted, albeit not stopping Wadjda's father from marrying new wife as if the director wanted to point out that in every rare moment of women's way to success there are always sacrifices and troubles, even when women manage to succeed in it. In addition to telling Wadjda's path to her dream, the director also portrays the process of how other women got against conservative taboos and limitations as in the case of Wadjda's Mom finally giving up her society imposed prejudice that Wadjda must not ride a bike and understanding that her child is much more important. To sum up, the main message of the movie in its subtle portrayal of common harsh lives of Saudi Arabian women and their not less tough ways to make their dreams happen is that despite these suppressing taboos women like Wadjda and her Mom must resist against these prejudices and make their own way to achieve their dreams and reach an ultimate human freedom."}, {"id": 70, "text": "Wadjda is a thought-provoking piece of cinematographic art that gives an adult audience the eyes of a 10-year-old girl who is dreaming about owning a green bicycle. This 2012 Saudi Arabian drama film is entitled to be called unprecedented. It is the first feature-length motion picture shot entirely in Saudi Arabia. But most importantly, it is the first feature film written and directed by a female Saudi director, Haifaa al-Mansour. The film sheds light on how an innocent curiosity clashes with the local belief system and customs. It left an impression of a film that emphasizes the story itself rather than its cinematographic features. The composition of shots, frames, and lighting was not constructed in a way that the audience would have to ponder upon for a long time. Instead, there were obvious, often screaming nudges in the frame that built the main heroine's character and of the other acting bodies. Wadjda is definitely not like the other girls, an outcast, rather, nonconformist individual, wearing converses, listening to western music, and with an inspiration to beat a boy in a bicycle race. She is not afraid to confront her mother's driver, a man in his forties. And this all happens in the first fifteen minutes of the film. The audience might have already formed an introspection about the main thematics of this piece - women's rights in an oppressive society. In lieu, it is a piece that pushes viewers like me to dig dipper into the foreign culture, step aside from presumptions and beliefs of ones', and see the world as it is. There were several shots that were rather disturbing for me. The moment when a man on a construction site asked if she wants to play with her can be interpreted as if that man was a pervert or just a man who joked about a fragile girl being on a construction site. Anyways, Wadjda seemed to dismiss this behavior, which is left upon the audience for interpretation, once again solidifying her image of a brave girl, or of a girl too young to comprehend the frames she is put in by the society she happens to be born into. The other disturbing dialogue took place between Wadjda and Abdullah about some guy sitting on explosives and then greeted by seventy chicks in heaven. Strikingly, the tone of this conversation was not led in a negative way. Rather, they were joking about it and if we recall the fact that they are still children, perhaps they simply could not comprehend the gravity of the precedent. These moments made me stop and ponder about how I interpret what was going on and what stereotypes about the Arab world I have been growing up so far. Academia and western internet space framed the feminism as a movement and ideology of the Western world and the Arab world lagging culturally. The idea of feminism and the portrayal of a young girl is engaging in this film. Once she saw the new bicycle being brought to the local shop she ran. She ran after the bicycle as if she ran after the opportunity for self-affirmation. Wadjda being told multiple times by the most authoritative figures in her life, her mother and school principal, that riding a bike is not an activity approved by society. Wadjda had her goal clearly defined and came up with venturesome ways to reach it. A risk-taker by her nature she started selling banned items in the school, providing services for which she could easily be expelled. Meanwhile, Wadjda's grandmother on her paternal side is looking for a second wife for her son, because Wadd's mother can no longer have children, and he wants a son. Wadjda's mother is frustrated and scared by this, so she tries on a beautiful red dress for her son-in-law's wedding in order to gain support and scare away any potential women who might think about marrying her husband. At the school, Wadjda decides to take part in the Quran solo concert with a cash prize of SR1000. And that was after two girls in madrassas were accused by the director of love affairs and were avoided by other students, although they only read magazines. Wadjda's efforts in Quran recitation impressed her teacher, and she won the competition. Staff and students were shocked when Wajda announced her intention to buy a bike with a prize pool. The director tells her that instead, the money will be donated to Palestine on her behalf. Without going into the plot that deeply I would have to mention that I had to pause and ponder about how I am perceiving each scene. Besides the struggle of experiencing this film as it is without any presuppositions about the Arab world I grew with, I watched this movie on YouTube with terrible subtitles, so I am pretty sure that my experience with this film could have been way better. Nevertheless, this piece still provokes questions about the stereotypes we grow up with, what is feminism and what is the role of women in western society and the Arab world. I wish I had more knowledge and experience to be able to fully contextualize what I have carried out from Wadjda, but the piece is totally worth watching.Also, I would like to note that I had to post my review on IMDb for my university assignment."}, {"id": 71, "text": "Wadjda is a Saudi Arabian drama film. It is written and directed by Haifaa al-Mansour. The film was shot in Riyadh which is the capital of Saudi Arabia. Wadjda is very unusual, and it addresses many social problems such as gender inequality and child education that can be seen in Saudi Arabia. Islam is one of the largest religions in the world. Some parts of religious actions may be changed related to social norms in a local tradition. According to al-Mansour, she wanted to make a story where people can laugh and cry a little. However, taking into account that Saudi Arabia is a conservative country and Islamic tradition in this country was formed in a mix with local traditions for many centuries, I think the film can be associated with various feelings on different people depending on the background and worldview of a person watching it. Some problems in the film related to gender inequality and child education possibly can be seen in the world while others can be found only in religious countries. In this film review, I will be writing about gender inequality and child education issues represented in the film. The film is about a 10-year-old Saudi girl who is full of energy, enthusiasm, and determination. Her name is Wadjda, and she wants to ride a bike. In addition to the money that she needs to earn to buy this bike, she faces many problems in the film. I believe the main theme of Wadjda's story is freedom, and the film shows it by considering many problems related to gender inequality and child education. In the film, Wadjda studies in madrasa. Madrasa is an Islam-centered school where the Quran and Hadiths are taught in addition to grammar, history, and calculation. Studying at madrasa is very different from studying at usual schools in terms of prohibited and allowed things. Laws regarding appearance in this school are much tougher. It can be seen in the moments where headteacher Miss Hassa strictly checks for a headscarf, forbids Wadjda to wear gym shoes, and says girls not to laugh and talk so loudly because a woman's voice is taboo. Possibly, this is right from the points of view of Islam and their local tradition, however, it may seem wrong for people grown in secular society. Even though teachers want the best for their students from their perspective that seem rational and objective for them, I think some moments are too strict for girls aged 7-13 years. The film has a fragment where Miss Hassa sees how two girls draw their legs with a felt-tip pen. After that, the use of a felt-tip pen was forbidden at that school. The two girls were punished in front of all students. Moreover, Miss Hassa said to Wadjda: Your stupid behavior will haunt you forever when she knew that Wadjda wants to buy a bike for money from the competition in the Koran knowledge. I think those situations will affect the relationship of two girls and Wadjda with other girls at school which is bad. The fact that it is forbidden by the social norms to ride a bike for little girls was truly strange for me. However, now it is allowed for women to ride a bike and a car in Saudi Arabia, and at the end of the film, Wadjda rides her bike happily. I believe this accurately represents the enormous issues that women face in this country, but it also represents that the change is possible, and it is in the process now. Other moments where those problems can be observed are related to the father's actions towards his daughter. The parents of Wadjda often swear at home. The reason for that is because the father wants to have a son. This shows that having a son is in more priority than having a daughter. It is hard to blame only the father since he is a product of the education of his parents and their social norms. However, Wadjda does not feel the attention and love of her father that she deserves as a child of that house. The film shows this by giving the fragment where the father replies to his daughter: Where is the food? when she said: I'm saving for a bike. Possibly, the child would get a new bike immediately if he was a boy. The film represents strict laws at the school where girls study, social and traditional norms that are repeated to girls throughout the film. It also represents the unhappy life of Wadjda's mother who was always behaved well in terms of local traditions. She didn't even get a good job so as not to offend her husband. I think one of the messages of the film is that any woman cannot be happy if she lives without thinking about her interests. However, women in Saudi Arabia cannot afford themselves many things including elementary ones such as riding a bike, wearing gym shoes, and choosing a job place. It clearly represents that gender inequality seen in Saudi Arabia needs to be fixed. I think a film is an effective tool in calling for social change because it shows social problems in a light way without bleak end."}, {"id": 72, "text": "A woman's voice is taboo The movie Wadjda tells us a story about a girl who has a strong will despite facing external realities of women's systematic oppression. Wadjda dreams about her own bicycle and eventually beating her dear friend Abdullah. Such a simple dream is definitely relatable to many children, but it turns to be a real struggle for the one who was born to be a woman in Saudi Arabia. This review will be focusing on an empowering message the movie has for all girls: never give up and do what makes you happy. The way how the main character and her surrounding were portrayed showed how religious societies in an example of Muslim society differentiate people basing on their genders. In the very beginning we can see how the school principle criticizes girls for laughing by saying that a woman's voice is taboo, while Wadjda's mother tells her that bicycles are not for girls and only boys are allowed to ride them. The movie from the very beginning shapes the framework of the society, where women are inferior to men, where simple things are prohibited not because of being bad but rather because of gender differences. However, being raised in such conservative society full of prohibitions upon women Wadjda is very fun loving with a strong will. She doesn't give up on her dream of having a bicycle. She starts to sell mixtapes and hand-made bracelets. When there is a possibility to win money that would be enough to buy a bicycle by participating in the competition of Quran recital, she decides to take part in it. The girl who did not know any Islam related terminology with even being not able to correctly read Quran decides to win against other girls who attend religion club and already made a huge progress in knowing Quran. Wadjda again shows her strong will and the fact that she believes in her own abilities. While preparing for the competition she learns riding a bicycle from her friend. She really tries to do everything possible for her own dream and makes an impressive progress. Wadjda's personality is truly capturing. Unfortunately, the society does not value girls for their personality, for being a human being. The scene where Wadjda was looking at their family tree her mother told her that girls are never included. It did not stop Wadjda from adding her name to the rest male members of her family tree. Here we can see that girls are not considered as an equal member of the family, generation will not remember them, it is like they have never existed before. At the same time, we can see that Wadjda is not accepting such approach, she knows her own worth and value. Even when she witnessed how her father was getting married for a second time because he wanted to have a son, she did not blame herself, instead she supported her mother. Wadjda is truly a symbol of a fighter and gives us a hope that women's position in the society can be changed. Her friend was always by her side, he was not criticizing her decision of riding a bicycle, he helped her to learn riding - all of these show that people are not born with arbitrary prohibitions and they should always decide for themselves whether such prohibitions are justified. In addition, we can see that the emergence of strong girls like Wadjda can really challenge conservative religious norms that make people unhappy: she could change her mother's opinion and make her buy a bicycle, she could make her belief in her and understand that her child's happiness is more important. I liked a strong message of the movie. It does not have great cinematography, sound, effects etc. and even do not need them. The main purpose of the movie was giving people an important message and raising awareness about systematic issues encountered by women of all ages in religious societies rather than simply entertaining them. The movie achieves its purpose, it succeeds in giving people a room for thoughts. In addition, a simple scenario with a slow development of plot is good way storytelling in such types of movies. The important target audience of the ones who live in above described societies can easily relate themselves to what is shown in the scree and understand the message. To conclude, women continue to be inferior to men, but they are able to challenge the system they are living in. Everyone deserves to be free and happy. The character of Wadjda can serve as a role model for many girls who also struggle from discrimination and find themselves in a similar situation. A woman's voice is a necessity."}, {"id": 73, "text": "The movie tells the story of 10-year-old girl named Wadjda that lives in a Saudi Arabian town. From the first glance, Wadjda lives a very normal Saudi middle-schooler life. Just like other girls at her school, she wears modest clothes, recites Qu'ran, and prays with her family. However, the viewer soon realizes that Wadjda is a sort of rebel - she plays with her male friend named Abdullah, sells homemade bracelets at school, and helps other girls to not be caught painting their nails. Wadjda's biggest dream is also rebellious - being a girl does not stop her from wanting to buy herself a bike. To make her dream come true, Wadjda decides to enter a Quran recitation competition at her school. And, to the surprise of everyone, she does get herself a bike, and now can cycle with her friend Abdulla. What first came to my mind when watching this movie is that I had never seen a Saudi movie before. Certainly, as works of art like music and films are considered sinful in Islam, there is not much of such entertainment available online. However, what is truly shocking is that Wadjda was directed by a Saudi woman. The movie then offers a rather insightful experience of the everyday lives of Sauid girls and women through the lense of a Saudi woman experience. Wadjda has a number of allusions to the principles of Islam and the how women are treated in Islam. However, the allusions appear in a subtle, non judgemental tone. For instance, the movie mentioned a few times how specific and strict clothing of Saudi women should be. For instance, Wadjda's mother, just like any other woman in the town, must cover her face and head with a headscarf at any time a stranger can see her. This corresponds to the idea in Islam that women should always appear as modest and should not be attracting attention from opposite sex. Only husbands or a close male relative like a brother can see a Muslim woman without the headscarf. However, as it is natural to want to be liked by someone you like yourself, Wadjda's mother does her hair and buys dresses to gain the attention of her husband. She understands that her marriage may break down because of her unsuccessful attempts at conceiving a boy. Here, the viewer is introduced to the concept of a polygamious relationship in Islam, with men being allowed up to four wives. It is interesting to note that polygamy existed before the emergence of Islam, and that there is a controversial argument that Islam first allowed for polygamy exactly because of this already existing social structure, and that to order otherwise would be an unpopular action. Yet, Qu'ran, the Holy Book of Muslims, itself directly allows men to marry up to four women. Qu'ran is the most legitimate source of information studied by Muslims, and hence a general consensus among scholars has been that polygamy today is also permitted. Therefore, polygamy is still popular in Saudi Arabia, and Wadjda's family is an example of such marriage structure. Although Wadjda's mother does not want her husband to marry another woman, she still does not want to divorce him. This illustrates a cultural rather than religious trait of the Saudi society. While divorce is permitted in Islam, women are often reluctant to take such route as a life of divorced woman is indeed diffcult in a Muslim society. One difficulty is gender wage gap and overall gender inequality in the workforce. Throughout the movie, almost all workers presented, ranging from construction workers to political candidates, were men. The only time we observed working women were teachers in Wadjda's all-girls school, and Wadjda's mother's friend, who encouraged her to apply for work. Wadjda's mother did not take the decision lightly, which again implies cultural prejudice towards working women. Personally, I think that Wadjda's mother decides to take the job application form because she realizes that her husband may no longer provide for their family. However, it is important to note that Islam itself does not discourage women from working, but that people who think it to be true simply follow one of the many interpretations (which are not even popularly supported). In fact, several verses in Qu'ran are interpreted to encourage education among women as well as men. Therefore, the prejudice and discrimination we see today in Muslim women's education and employment is an unfortunate historic outcome, that was amplified by different cultural beliefs. The director recognizes the above mentioned struggles of women, and she subtly but interestingly conveys them through the characters of Wadja, her mother, and her classmates. Yet, the director ends the movie on a positive note - in the end, Wadjda succeeds at making her dream come true through hard work. Receiving a bicycle from winning the Qu'ran recitation competition, though indirectly, then acts as a metaphor that Saudi women still can accomplish their career and education goals despite all the difficulties."}, {"id": 74, "text": "This film by illustrating a story of a 10-year-old girl Wadjda shows the problems of women's lives in a country with deep-rooted Islamic roots. Wadjda is a brave girl from the suburbs of Riyadh that is dreaming about a green bicycle, which is sold in a nearby shop. A girl in Saudi Arabia is not allowed to ride a green, eye-catching bicycle and go for a walk with her friend, neighbour boy Abdullah. Even ordinary bicycle there promises to result in public censure, violation of the founded rules and most likely, loneliness due to the inability for such a criminal to get married. While her mother is absorbed and concerned about the intentions of her husband to take a second wife, Wadjda is left to itself. She is not hoping for sponsorship from her parents and therefore is forced to earn the expensive pleasure of 800 riyals by herself. Unfortunately, selling of handmade bracelets does not promise a lot of money, while the prize of 1000 riyals for winning the school competition for the best knowledge of the Qoran promises to more than cover the required amount. Wajda, therefore, begins to actively attend a religious section, studying the holy book with the other applicants. The dream to buy a bike becomes not just a story engine, but also a metaphor for overcoming social prejudices.In my opinion, the main theme of this film is what effect one person has on the world around us. Although Wadjda from her very birth is at a disadvantage simply because she was born a girl, she finds the strength to go against the established norms and prohibitions of the society in which she lives. With her actions, she also changes the people around her. So, her friend Abdullah at first does not take Wadjda's actions seriously and teases her. However, after to achieve his goal, his friend takes serious and persistent steps, does everything possible and even wins the competition, his opinion changes. He not only teaches the girl to ride a bicycle but also becomes ready to give her own. Wadjda's mother, seeing her daughter's efforts buys her the long-awaited bicycle, despite her husband's objections. She did this even though for a long time she was an obedient ideal wife and did not even object to her husband's desire for a new marriage. It seems to me that it is thanks to the support of mother Wadjda will not lose hope and continue to confidently go towards achieving her goals. If a 10-year-old girl was able to influence at least a little by her actions the opinions of other people, then how much can a woman or a man do? It seems to me that it is through such efforts of each member of society that a country can come to any changes. An equally important topic is the problem of the oppression of the female population in Saudi Arabia. The everyday life of a woman in this society consists of many prohibitions: not to go out with her head uncovered, to hide her face from men, not to speak loudly among themselves, not to laugh, not to sing songs, not to transmit notes to men, not to wear bracelets and photographs to school, etc. They are taught from childhood only that they should be submissive wives and good housekeepers. But even humbly following these rules does not give you a guarantee for a safe stay. Wadjda's mother, being a wonderful and submissive wife, beautiful woman was guilty only of not being able to give birth to a boy. If you cannot give birth to an heir, then another wife will come in your place. A woman can easily be left with a child when she not only unable to get a stable job but even get there on her own without being accompanied by a driver. Viewers can notice numerous examples of gender inequality in the movie. Lack of changing rooms in women's stores which are replaced by a toilet room. A driver, without whom a Muslim woman cannot even get anywhere. Work in the hospital that became indecent since you have to work next to men. Bright nail polish that can turn into a disaster. If for me these customs are shocking, it is just a part of the routine for movie heroes. Wajda does not even think about it - while she is still a child and the privilege of feeling free was not taken away from her. And adulthood is waiting around the corner and over and over again reminds of itself, taking the form of a classmate who got married (at age 12), or the scandal that erupted due to secret meetings of a high school student with one young man. But Wajda just throws these episodes away, because her reality is a green bike, gym shoes, friendship with a boy, speed and a dusty road. This is freedom."}, {"id": 75, "text": "The Wadjda is one of the revolutionary films of Saudi Arabia due to several reasons. Firstly, it is the first film shot wholly within the borders of its country. Secondly, it is the first full-length film written and directed by a Saudi Arabian female named Haifaa al-Mansour. It must be taken into account that until 2018 there were no cinemas or theatres in the country, as the cinema industry was not developed. Therefore, it was more striking that Wadjda was the first film in the country, which was submitted for an Oscar competition. The film tells a story of a 10 years old girl from a traditional middle-class family, who faced various religious and traditional norms in her daily and school life. However, despite all the societal pressure this rebellious girl keeps fighting for her dream to own a bicycle without bending under the system. While having such a straightforward feministic and pro-freedom message, the movie atmosphere is not tense or brutal. Instead as the plot is shown from the child perspective, the film gains notes of innocence, kindness and comedy. In this review, I will initially focus on the Haifaa al-Mansour life in order to understand the context of the film and then will analyze how the director's message to the audience was delivered through the movie.I considered it significant to review the life of the female Saudi Arabian director, who is also the author of the plot, as her experience was basically a foundation of the movie and its message. In her interview for The Washington Post in 2013, she talked about her early life,her decision to master in filmmaking, the challenges during the filmmaking process and finally her hopes about this film.It was turned to be out that Al Mansour has a supportive father, who gave her different abroad books to read and watch DVD films. After bachelor degree, she worked at an oil company in the Saudi Arabia, but she faced the glass ceiling and felt invisible there. As the video shooting was the way expressing her voice, she decided to study directing.After receiving permission to shoot,Al Mansour had to direct the whole film from the van using a two-way radio, as the woman should not appear in the public place full of men, especially if the woman began to instruct men what to do, people would stop shooting and consider it as against their social conduct. With the same reasons, which hold Al Mansour back from proper directing in the conservative Muslim Kingdom,fought the main character Wadjda to own and ride bicycle. In the interview Al Mansour pointed: I hope a father buys it for his daughter or if a man watches it and, like my father did, gives more space to his daughter, to his wife. Because men control women's lives in Saudi. It takes a real man to be a little relaxed and allow women to be. According to this given interview, I interpreted that the director's intentions while filming were not just to show social problems, but rather give sense for hope in changing ultra patriarchal, religious and traditional norms to be changed to not oppress women's freedom and autonomy.In my opinion, in order to deliver her message effectively, Al Mansour uses symbolism, which is not expressed verbally, but through conceptualization of objects, leaving a mix of emotions at the end of the film. Throughout the movie a number different of issues were demonstrated: polygamy, early marriage, taboos, prejudices and hypocrisity of elders. But two things remained constant from the beginning till the end: desire to buy a bicycle and wearing prohibited vans. From the beginning of the film Wadjda wanted the bike to race with her best friend, but her mother did not buy it , claiming that no girl would ride a bike and no one would marry you after that. It was not acceptable to ride a bike in a muslim society, because girls were supposed to stay at homes and not to stand out in the public. Even her peers at school laughed at her when she announced that she will buy a bicycle. Her desire was in conflict with an already existing societal system, therefore it met such critics from authority figures around her. However, by the end of the film her mother eventually bought the bicycle for her, despite her previous prejudices about it. This moment symbolized hope that existing rules can be challenged and altered, while the last scene when Wadjda was racing with her friend symbolized the freedom of desires. However, all of this would be impossible without a girl's bravery and loyalty to herself. The first frame was the same black shoes of girls singing Quran, then when the teacher called Wadjda the frame highlighted her distinct from others blue color vans. The frame actually emphasized from the early beginning that this girl is not like others, she is going to challenge the system. Even if she was warned by the head of the school to wear regular school shoes, she kept wearing these vans as part of her identity, as a way to express herself. Therefore, throughout the film she is in the same vans. These vans can be understood as a symbol of being loyal to yourself and chasing your dreams. Thus, by using vans and bicycle as main symbols, which remain constant during the film, standing for loyalty, bravery and freedom, gives the audience hope for a better future for women.Overall, as being born and raised in Saudi Arabia and having seen drawbacks of patriarchy, traditional and religious customs on herself, Al Monsour showed that actually many women already resigned with the oppressive system, therefore a fearless, brave,free, irrepressive character like Wadjda is needed."}, {"id": 76, "text": "The drama movie Wadjda was filmed by Haifaa al-Mansour in 2012. It is a very unique film in the Saudi Arabian cinematography as it was for the first time directed and written by Saudi woman and filmed on the territory of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The movie tells the story of a girl named Wadjda. It shows the life of Wadjda and her relationships with other people in her two main habitats: home and school. In my opinion, the main purpose of the film was to show the position of women in the Islamic state, like Saudi Arabia. The influence of Islam is huge and very significant in this country. For instance, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has on its territory two main sacred cities in the religion of Islam: Mecca and Medina. The film plunges the viewer into the epicenter of the religious world. We see the life of people in Saudi Arabia, which was hidden before under the mysterious curtain. The director made a focus of the movie on women's status in Islamic state. Long story short, the plot of the film is based on the girl's desire to buy a bicycle and win on it the race with her friend Abdullah. Throughout the movie, we see how a young girl, malcontent with religious and sexual structures of the kingdom, tries to achieve her goal while being confronted with strict traditions of her nation. From the first minutes of the movie we hear the girls reciting the fragments of Quran. The focus of the image is made on girls' shoes. While everyone is wearing black shoes with white socks, Wadjda is wearing sneakers. So the Director with this technique differentiates the main character and her position from the others. At home, Wadjda likes to listen to the Western music and makes bracelets, which she sells then at school. Her interests contradict with the established behavior of girls in Islam. Wadjda is a kind of rebel whose behavior is not like the others. In the general image shown by the Director, she sharply contrasts from the others with her fearlessly strong and free character. It seems that she lives under her own principles. As a result it gets her into trouble in the form of constant comments from teachers and the school principal. The next scene that impressed and puzzled me was when the Principal of school-Miss Hussa- makes a remark on girls who were laughing and speaking loud. She told them that women's voice should not be heard by the men outside and that women's voice is taboo. It means that the voice of females does not have the same weight as the males', showing the great dominance of men over women. Viewer perceives the image of society in a Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as fully patriarchal. So, the women here live under the rules and norms established by men and Quran. Haifaa al-Mansour will show the examples of gender inequality again and again throughout the film. The desire of Wadjda to buy a bicycle itself contradicts in its nature to the established idea that women should not ride a bicycle, they explain it as if you ride a bicycle then in the future you will not have children. Another scene that shows the discrimination of girls is when Wadjda sees her father's family tree and her mom explains her that only the names of men can be placed on this tree. After she heard this, Wadjda writes her name on a piece of paper and places it on her father's family tree, but the next day she sees that paper was removed. This scene shows that females cannot be captured in the history of family and only males have a right to be presented on a family tree. Also, due to the reason that Wadjda was born as a girl and her mother did not give a birth to son, her father is going to take second wife. Turning back to the Wadjda's desire to own a bicycle, in the beginning of movie we see that she has some problems with reciting the fragments of Quran and that she is not very interested in studying it, but after she learns about the competition of Quran recitation and its prize of 1000 riyals (which will be enough to buy a bicycle) she becomes eager to win it. Wadjda spends a lot of time on learning by heart the Quran and practices in the right reading and recitation. Her main goal gives her a high boost of motivation in this journey. Despite the fact that in the beginning she had a very small chance of winning, she still wins the competition. However, she did not receive her prize (money), because the principal considered her desire to spend money on bicycle stupid and irrational, and again reminded her that girls cannot ride a bicycle. The Director wants to show us that despite the fact that Wadjda tries to fit into the general picture (in this case fit into society and social/religious structures), she still remains loyal to her own principles and life goals. It shows the strength of her character. To sum up, Haifaa al-Mansour directed an emotionally strong movie with feminist message. Wadjda is opposed not only to social pressure, but also to the pressure of religion of Islam, which has a great power on the territory of a Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}, {"id": 77, "text": "Wadjda is a film out of Saudi Arabia from a female director, so it is double special. Filming conditions were not always easy. Because of the seperation of men and women in public spaces the director sometimes had to direct from a delivery van. By the way the difference between public space (women in traditional, covering clothes) and private space (women sometimes wearing clothes according to the latest fashion) is very striking.Saudi Arabia is a country practically without a filming industry. It is interesting to compare Wadjda with films about little girls / young women from other Islamic countries with a more mature filming industry. I selected The white balloon (1995, Jafar Panahi) from Iran and Mustang (2015, Deniz Gamze Erguven) from Turkey.In The white balloon the girl is younger than Wadjda (who is around 10 years old). The story line about the green bycicle that is coveted by Wadjda (and which is seen as an expression of very unwanted tomboy like behavior) is in the sphere of White balloon. It keeps the film light and comedy like, in spite of the serious subject of the position of women in a very patriarchal society.In Mustang the girls are older than Wadjda. More in line with Mustang is the story line about the very crude way in which adolescent behavior by pupils a couple of years older than Wadjda is punished at school.Finally on the background we have the storyline of Wadjda's mother. Because she can't bear a son, her man takes a second wife. Also this storyline is not very comedy like (only the emphasis on the green bike keeps the film from becoming to heavy).I found the ending very beautiful. Wadjda's mother accepts the things as they are in Saudi Arabia, but she passes along the spark of resistance to her daughter."}, {"id": 78, "text": "Wadjda : A powerful and beautiful Saudi Arabian movie of a first lady director Haifaa al-Mansour. Movie is about a teen girl Wadjda who dreams to own a bicycle which is very uncommon as girls are forbidden for that but she keeps on trying to collect the money with making bracelets and participating in Qur'an competition. Beautiful Reem Abdullah played the role of Wadjda's sad Mother who is depressed because of the second marriage of her husband."}, {"id": 79, "text": "A movie that will make you reflect. A movie that will make you cry. A move that will make you happy. A movie that will make you angry. Struggle, patience, dedication, love, culture and religion are few of the worlds I would describe this movie. In many scenes I became angry and thought, I wish life wasn't like this for people in those countries. Even if this movie came out in year 2012, life for some Arabic families are still like this even in year 2020. Even if this movie isn't based on any true stories, this movie do reflect the lives of many in those countries. I am happy Haifaa al-Mansour wrote this story and made this movie. You get to see how other families in different cultures live. How their lives are. This is the life of some families even today. It is educational to watch movies that portray other cultures etc. Watching this movie will make you reflect over your own life. It will make you appreciate the things you took for granted. It was a beautiful yet a sad movie. I recommend this movie 100%"}, {"id": 80, "text": "What I found interesting in Vecide was how woman representation changed dramatically from the inside to the outside. Let's think of the mother. At home, she exists as a person: She has emotions, she gets jealous of her husband. She is an active participant and reacts her surrounding somehow. Out of the home or when the house is violated by some strangers, she is just one of the other anonymous women. She can no longer get angry with the driver or can have a limited participation in the economic life. Only at the very end when Vecide drives the bike, we see her voice out of the home through her present to her daughter . The other thing was that this movie lacks male characters and it is all about woman. It reminded me Almodovar's films in that sense. The only two male characters that we really see are the father and the boy. Father is represented in a repulsive way. The audience cannot really have an attachment with him. He is just a side character that helps us better understand Vecide and her mother. I think he intentionally is a passive character in this film as the women are passivated in real life. The other male character is the child. The audience has sympathy towards him. He is just a kid, anyway. Not a part of the dominant male society, yet. With all the good intentions, he is in the transitory state knowing that he is a child, but he will grow up and marry Vecide one day. Yet the only sympathetic male character is this child who is not actually a man. Other than that, we see a movie all about woman."}, {"id": 81, "text": "The story of this film revolves around a dream of a Saudi girl named Wadjda. She dreamed about getting herself a bicycle. However, in Saudi Arabia (in Riyadh), a girl riding a bike is considered as a violation of local Muslim norms. Thus, little girl tries to overcome local rules and saves money to get a bike (sells mixtapes, competes in Qur'an reciting contest). Apart from her dream, the film, interestingly enough, was able to depict all the difficulties that Saudi Muslim women are subjected to face. Sharia laws (Islamic laws) dictate the behavior and roles in society of men and women, the borderline of obligations and rules, which are set according to the Holy Qur'an and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). For example, men should be breadwinners, whereas women should perform the housework, bring up children etc. Moreover, the author could incorporate all famous sharia-based stereotypes in one film, that are notoriously known to other parts of the world, such as a marriage at early age, restrictions to drive transports (cars, bicycles) and polygyny. The major cause of strict and unique practices in Saudi Arabia come from Wahhabism and Salafiya, which is mostly based on literal understanding of the Holy Qur'an and Sunna (certain acts/actions performed by Muhammad) of the Prophet. For example, Wadjda is 10 years old, and a scene in the film shows the instance of a marriage of her classmate. Saudi people may rationalize marrying at such early age with an example of the Prophet marrying 6 or 7 years old Aisha. However, to justify this action, historians propose earlier onset of puberty in Arabic peninsula at that time and absence of conflicts regarding this marriage from opponents of the Prophet. So, Aisha was not younger than the normal aged women, mature enough to be in relationships, which means that not the age was important but puberty. A restriction to ride any kind of transport is legitimized by Islamic scholars to avoid any kind of contact between unrelated men and women. Historically, men are the first ones to use all types of transport, that is why they are very prevalent in any single one of it. Scholars argue that when a woman uses a car it may cause her to interact with men that may be out of people that could communicate with her, e.g. in a car accident. So most of the rulings are based on separation of gender and restriction of any types of unwanted relationships in the local community. Polygyny (having several wives) is also depicted in the final part of the movie. Wadjda's mother could not have kids no more and her husband decided to have a second wife, who was younger than she was. The movie does not make it clear, if infertility was the main reason, or could there be other ones. However, the fact is that it disappoints Wadjda's mother. The main misunderstanding here is that, in traditional Islam taking more wives is only allowed for certain necessities and with a guarantee of fairness and justice between them. It is difficult to know the exact intentions of Wadjda's father, but it is quite challenging to imagine a fair affair between the one, who is younger and fertile and the other, who is older and infertile. In case of the Prophet, polygamy was intended to convey the message of Islam for more people. We could argue that such depiction of Sharia laws in a movie is a warning sign that a Salafian literal understanding of Islam is not what was supposed to be in comparison with the Prophet's times. Moreover, it is complicated to argue that only Salafian direction is the cause of such societal inequality of respect shown to women. Even though in Sharia segregates the society by functions and according to their capabilities, the major sign of a problem in Saudi Arabia is that there is no respect shown for women from men's perspective. The value of women through respect is not well observed nowadays for the obligations she has to bear. To sum up, all the infamous stereotypes attributed to the position of women in Saudi Arabia were well viewed and it could be partly argued that literal interpretation of what Islam is, may cause different problems and signs of inequality. Such stereotypes may point to inequality between male and female. However, can we really judge people through the actions that they prefer? Can it be said that voluntarily made actions could be a form of discrimination in that country? In my opinion, the world should bother about this when such regime restricts the will to get education."}, {"id": 82, "text": "The Saudi Arabian film Wadjda shows us a story of the girl with the same name in the patriarchal world of Saudi Arabia. I think that the main idea of the film is that even in strictly religious community as Saudi Arabian, modern and liberalistic ideas can find their followers in young generation, the representative of which we see the main heroine and people surrounding her. The first sign of rebellious spirit of our heroine we can see even in her dressing style. We can see that everyone in the school is ought to wear black shoes in order not to be different from other students in school. However, Wadjda wears sneakers with purple shoelaces and sometimes refuses to cover her face as it is ordered to women in Islam. That is why several times she gets in trouble with school administration. Another sign of liberalistic and modern spirit of main heroine is her interests. We see that she is interested in pop music and uses modern tapes and radio, while her mother says that these songs came from hell and lead to sin. Another interest, which is the main plot creator, is her interest in bike. Wadjda sees the bike from her friend Abdallah when they play; Abdallah uses his bike to gain advantage over her. Then she sees new cycle in the store where the shop owner says the price of eight hundred Saudi reals. For Wadjda it is too expensive, and her mother refuses to buy her bike because bikes are considered to be prohibited to women, that is why she starts to earn money by different ways. First, she starts to sell bracelets for her schoolmates, and then she becomes a messenger between girls and boys. However, those things are prohibited in school and she again gets in trouble with school administration. In parallel, she tries to find another way to get the money needed, and she takes part in the Quran reading contest to get the first place, where the prize is 1000 Saudi reals. Then she starts studying the Quran very hard, she even buys the video game to learn specific terms from Quran. At last, she wins the contest, but when she says that she will spend the won money on bike everyone starts laughing at her. The school administration does not dive her money and donates them to Palestine in her name. The listed features show the modern and liberalistic notions in the behavior of Wadjda. Here I want to point that in strictly religious and patriarchal community, we can notice that Abdallah does not downplay or humiliate his friend Wadjda, but he respects her and considers her as an equal. He also gives her to practice on his bike and helps her with the angry driver. Moreover, when Wadjda finally gets her bike, he is happy for her and competes with her with pleasure. Despite the fact that Wadjda is a girl, he likes to spent time with her, and even more, he wants to marry her in the future, but he informs her about his plans, rather than arranging wedding without her consent, as we have seen several examples of such contracted weddings during the film. These features show the modern and liberalistic motives the behavior of Abdallah. Another hero that experiences modern and liberalistic ideas is Wadjda's mother. In the beginning of the film, she experiences problems with the driver, and she does not talk back, because she is a woman. Then, she experiences the rebellious nature of her daughter and tries to calm her down, because she was raised in conservative way. And finally, she experiences the behavior of her husband: because she cannot give birth to son, very important thing in Islam, her husband wants to marry another wife. At first, she tries to persuade him not to do this by buying new red dress that would impress him. However, her husband makes a final decision and maries another women. She cannot make a divorce in the Muslim world and she accepts this decision, but on her own manner. She cuts her long hair, that her husband liked very much, and then accepts the efforts of her daughter in the way of getting the bike and buys her the desired bike. Here we see the changes in the way of thinking of the character from conservative to more liberal. To conclude, all these characters show the viewer that modern and liberal ideas can grow in strict religious and patriarchal community as Saudi Arabian one."}, {"id": 83, "text": "Wadjda is the first movie by female director Haifaa al Mansour in Saudi Arabia produced in 2012. The movie describes the Saudi Arabian culture by a story of ordinary rebellious girl who is one of the new generation and who is critical to religious stereotypes about females. The movie is awarded several times with various awards and nominations. The acting of actors is also very professional and entertaining. The plot of the movie is very interesting and gains audience of elders as well as young people too. It describes the life of Saudi Arabian people especially females by prism of little girl called Wadjda who is in her school years living with her mother and rarely coming father in house. Although it showed the life of ordinary girl with ordinary lifestyle however in reality it seemed to me aiming to show more about the life of females in Saudi Arabia specifically how it is hard for females to live in such society where women and men do not have equal rights. The problem is not about scarf, their clothes or other factors coming from religion but the problem is more with people whose cultural and traditional beliefs influenced their religion and mixed so that one might think that their religion made hard to live for women in Saudi Arabia. I think the movie's main goal to tell that if significant number of females are educated as Wadjda for example, may be the issue of inequality also can be solved by females themselves. First of all, the movie tells us from the beginning about a girl who dreams about buying bike. She was enthusiastic and followed her dream working hard in different ways self-made accessories and selling them or by participating to Quran competition. It really showed how big is girl's motivation even though the common beliefs of people surrounding were against her. Not only bikes but early marriage of school girl is also shown by classmates of Wadjda. It is shown as common thing for children to be married in their early ages. In this movie we also see the polygamy and suffering of females by this from one of the main characters who is a mother of Wadjda. Her character is well described by beautiful actress who loves her daughter.However her husband and his family does not think a girl as an continuation of family and want son to be part of tree family. However her mother could not give birth to another child so that by the decision of his family and his agreement he married to another woman. Also we see the problem of narrow mindness from people especially it is seen from females. I think in the movie females themselves do not fight for their rights on the contrary they themselves limit their freedom. It is seen when Wadjda wants to buy bike and her mother and her teachers who were against her dream because of belief that women cannot ride a bike if they want to be mother. This shows that they did not even research it to prohibit it but still believes.Therefore, the narrative in the movie is very interesting and shows significant reality in it. The genre of the movie is comedy, drama and family movie. I recommend to watch it for everyone in different ages and for muslims and non muslims because the movie does not have misunderstanding of lifestyles or specific terms.The movie is also very qualitative shot with effects and well full brightness. The actors and actresses are beautiful which gains attention of audience. The points I did not like was very little. It is not about the content of the movie but more about the technical sides. The idea about subtitles was not so good because the subtitles I think are inappropriately translated so that it was not relevant in few cases. In addition, it is not so convenient to see with subtitles specially hard I can say because you need to read all time. Therefore, this movie might gain audience by translating the movie to english at least. In conclusion, the movie brings serious issues with short narrative of girl if it describes real case in Saudi Arabia. However, as I understand there is new generation who is against of the some traditional beliefs. Because there should be people who always looks critically to already existing things like traditional beliefs. Therefore, it appeared to be motivational to see such brave, ambitious and clever little girl. This movie can be one of the high rated movies containing Islamic culture nowadays. In addition to interesting and entertaining content of the movie, the quality of the movie is also takes attention of large audience. The significant difference of this movie from other Islamic movies was that it was directed by female which is the first time in Saudi Arabia. Even though it was not ideal movie and it contained some minor problems which can be distracting to audience I think it is interesting to watch for one time. I support female directors who had braveness to take this responsibility and wish them good luck in their career."}, {"id": 84, "text": "Wadjda A movie directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour in 2012 is suggested for a wide audience regardless of age, ethnicity, and believes. It represents a classical story about the purity of a child mind and strong will to attain the goal. However, what makes the film must see is that events take place on the Arabian Peninsula and shows the insides of Saudi Arabian family life. The main character is a little girl, Wadjda, who challenges herself to common mores of local culture. Moreover, being the debut of the first female Saudi Arabian film director Wadjda provides a unique opportunity to uncover the hurdles of female life in a country with deep Islamic roots. Muslims follow the laws of shariah that includes some specific rules of behavior and clothes for females. The movie touches an important issue of modern time and therefore, it has a great value to see the understand the context through an alternative prism. Haifaa Al-Mansour manages to show difficulties of early and later period in the life of a female, but still remain the beautiful shoot and educating moments. In the following work, the movie scenario will be evaluated by providing a comparison for the female live in the Arabian Peninsula to Kazakhstani families as well as giving personal comments on the meanings of episodes, if possible. From the beginning we can immediately see that high schools are separate for females and males, all girls are required to cover the heads outside, and it is highly suggested to leave the place if observed by males. Wadjda is only a primary school student and as ordinary child forgets to follow sanctions during playing with a neighbor boy, Abdullrahman Algohani. One day he teases her by riding away on a bicycle. Wadjda's mother, Moeder van Wadjda tries to convince the daughter that a girl riding a bicycle is unacceptable more due to danger for female dignity. Nevertheless, Wadjda firmly decides to save necessary amount by selling a self-made hand straps to classmates. After a while she gets caught by a school principal who prohibits such activities. Fortunately, Wadjda learns about Quran recitation competition with a cash prize enough for a brand-new bicycle. Using her savings at that moment Wadjda buys a CD with Quran teachings and spends the days to studying and memorizing the ayahs. During lessons she learns from the hadiths (comments to Quran) numerous principles that enables to follow the true Islam in the life such as The likeness of the one who reads it and tries hard to memorize it even though it is difficult for him, he will have two rewards. Moreover, these words as well as support from school supervisors strengthens her will and finally, Wadjda figures out to win the competition. Ironically, due strong social constrains on a girl riding a bicycle she couldn't get the cash reward. Another side of the film that demonstrated the Muslim female life in a suburban Riyadh is polygamy (allowed in Islam) faced by Wadjda's mother. On a certain extend related to the religion and on some point due to fixed cultural norms, the level of respect and obedience of Moeder to her husband significantly differs from those we become used to in Kazakhstan. Even though people can argue about existence of similarities in the regions with strong followers of Islamic traditions, the one aspect of the movie is never taking place in our country, the case of the man taking several wives."}, {"id": 85, "text": "Wadjda is the first full-length Saudi Arabian movie directed and written by female director. Haifaa al-Mansour's feature debut was publicly recognized and widely acclaimed acquiring positive reviews on prestigious film festivals around the globe. The Wajda is also the first movie which Saudi Arabia selected for Best Foreign Language Film by 86th academy award, albeit did not get the nomination. It is shocking that al-Mansour had to direct the movie shooting sitting in the back of a van and manage the actors' play by radio set, in order to stay unrevealed by local public which is still reluctant to women's equal treatment, not saying about woman as a director in the Arabian Peninsula. The mere fact of that illustrates the complicated environment in which the Wadjda struggled for being made and released in 5 years period. For sure, it is difficult to imagine the corner in the world where women are still oppressed and concentrate all their conscious living for the man's merit in regard with religious doctrine. Nevertheless, as this movie shows us, regardless one of the most flourishing economic prosperity accelerated by oil pump, yet the women and girls in Saudi Arabian community experience gender segregation and inequality. Even though the movie does not perform a strong and aggressive manifest on abolishment of gender inequality and does not oppose the Islamic doctrine that eventually may exhort pressure on the women in the Riyadhian society, Wajda still makes an elegant compromise on emphasizing the disapproval by such a system and acknowledging the coming change that author's nation will have to face with in order to sustain in the present globalized world. The moral narrative is suggested to be the main line in the plot, where the morality that the one who seeks and tries should be rewarded in accordance to his or her efforts, regardless the gender and status. The central plot of the movie turns around the girl whose name is Wadjda and her mother living together permanently awaiting for father's coming. Wadjda is notorious in Madrassah as a naughty and restive student, who would not be against to be engaged into bracelets' trade or employ as a courier of love letters, of course, for some Saudi Riyal. To say, Wadjda is not the most apparent prototype by which someone can imagine the Muslim disciple, still she is very strong individual with unique vision and unbreakable faith in achieving her goals. Once Wadjda is becoming very interested by bicycle to ride together with neighbor boy, Abdallaah and win him in a race. However, her mother and the school teachers prohibit Wadjda to have a bicycle since riding a bicycle, as well as speak in the street, and not covering the head in public for women are an implicit taboo. From this very moment and further, bicycle becomes a symbol for the girl's battle with outer world and external circumstances brought by Islamic reality in Saudi Arabia. Conventionally women in Saudi Arabia do not ride a bicycle, and even are not allowed to speak in the street so the males could listen to their voices. The reality where under the Islamic doctrine woman becomes a subject for total ignorance by man and ultimate oppression in everyday life. Woman in the society can not speak in their own voice to manifest the dignity in their life as was shown in the narrated story about thief. Public tend to gossip that a thief that has entered the house was supposedly Ms Hussa' lover as her husband apparently perceived it. It shows the vulnerability of women in Saudi Arabia, where the circumstances defend them in favor of sexist approach and public accusation. Furthermore, we can observe the limited female's position in the society by looking Wadjda's mother inability to go to work because she could not find the taxi driver to drive to the work. Woman is dependant on man and can not explore all her potential, everything that she has is to manage the housework and looking after the children. In a such a world, women are even deprived of a right to be the only wives of their husband. The man can marry again, just because he wants a son, or younger wife, or his mother ordered him to do so. As the story continues, Wadjda seizes brilliant opportunity to earn 1000 Saudi Riyals to buy new bicycle by reciting and learning Quran verses in a competition. Through diligent and rigorous work, she achieves the first place but prize fund will go to Palestine as was insisted by orthodox Ms Hussa. Being very upset and despaired the girl not being understood by the father, found the consolation in mother's arm who was also betrayed by the system, in particular by her husband who married the second time. However, Wadjda mother discovers the world from new perspective and allows her daughter to ride a bicycle. They both are not afraid and aspiring to changes for freedom, nonetheless the freedom is conditional and only within their own perception. I believe that this movie was an attempt of Haifaa al-Mansour to capture not merely the positive switch in traditional perspective of woman as a weak object who is merely shadow of the man into woman who strictly know who she is and what she wants despite the public ignorance, but also underscored such a transformation by moral enlightenment in individual perception. Moreover, in the movie we see the social norms and conventions which are construed by Islamic Saudi Arabian community and Madrassah but not by Quran itself, as it leaves us no choice but to believe that the love and sincerity by which the Wadjda's mother recited the Quran verses are true and not been distorted by strict rules of Madrassah. I think that director showed this scene to make viewer believe that Islamic communities can not blamed to always possess gender inequalities, but rather have great potential to be more egalitarian and open to all people, since that would correspond to universal true which is entrenched in Muslim teaching. It goes without saying, that the change in social unequal treatment is impossible unless the oppressed ones do not comprehend their position and do not accomplish any measures to identify own meaning and essence and combat with stereotypes in the sake of the only truth. Wadjda's mother during the whole movie was a representation of a diligent and faithful woman who even knowing her path as a husband's unfortunate wife incapable of giving a birth to son, still hoped to attract the husband's attention and did not approve the Wajda's wish to drive a bicycle as this will go against the social norm of Girls do not drive a bicycle, the violence of which would ultimately lead to husband's disapproval. But however, as Widjda gets closer to her green bike by earning more Saudi Riyals and learning the Quran surahs and verses for Quran recitation competition, her mother by the end would acknowledge the husband's betrayal and finally realizes that she and her daughter are alone and should act in accordance with their own intentions, just let the life goes on. It can be said that by experiencing such a simultaneous emotional abandonment (money from competition goes to Palestine and marriage to another woman) female characters, both Wadjda and her mother's morality and consciousness transcended in a way from being women without rights and future prospects into yet not fully independent women but at least recognizing their right to be alike husband's preferences and the community. For instance, by cutting the hair or riding a bicycle in a line with boys. The cut hair of Wadjda's mother and green bike as a present for the girl are the symbols for little win over the surrounding environment. I want to believe that girl like Wadjda has real heroine in real world who is struggling for own path and the fact that we can see such a movie from Islamic state which argues major social themes directed by women makes me to assert that the change is already taking place. Islam as well as another religions should not suppress people regardless their gender, race and social statuses, but rather to preach the universal truth of equality through individual self-realization. Finally, it seems to me that Widjdadoes not suggest any radical or alternative solutions to gender issue in Arabian world, but simply puts this under the main focus, maintaining the serene narrative where ardent girl with strong character clashes with society which is never going to remember her feminine name in the patriarch family tree. Nevertheless, as Wadjda rides her bicycle, the hearts of viewers are fulfilling with the hope that the world is changing and individuals like she may drive such a fortunate transformation."}, {"id": 86, "text": "A movie directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour in 2012 is suggested for a wide audience regardless of age, ethnicity, and believes. It represents a classical story about the purity of a child mind and strong will to attain the goal. However, what makes the film must see is that events take place on the Arabian Peninsula and shows the insides of Saudi Arabian family life. The main character is a little girl, Wadjda, who challenges herself to common mores of local culture. Moreover, being the debut of the first female Saudi Arabian film director Wadjda provides a unique opportunity to uncover the hurdles of female life in a country with deep Islamic roots. Muslims follow the laws of shariah that includes some specific rules of behavior and clothes for females. The movie touches an important issue of modern time and therefore, it has a great value to see the understand the context through an alternative prism. Haifaa Al-Mansour manages to show difficulties of early and later period in the life of a female, but still remain the beautiful shoot and educating moments. In the following work, the movie scenario will be evaluated by providing a comparison to the female girl live in the Arabian Peninsula and Kazakhstan as well as giving personal comments on the meanings of episodes, if possible. From the beginning we can immediately see that high schools are separate for females and males, all girls are required to cover the heads outside, and it is highly suggested to leave the place if observed by males. Wadjda is only a primary school student and as ordinary child forgets to follow sanctions during playing with a neighbor boy, Abdullrahman Algohani. One day he teases her by riding away on a bicycle. Wadjda's mother, Moeder van Wadjda tries to convince the daughter that a girl riding a bicycle is unacceptable more due to danger for female dignity. Nevertheless, Wadjda firmly decides to save necessary amount by selling a self-made hand straps to classmates. After a while she gets caught by a school principal who prohibits such activities. Fortunately, Wadjda learns about Quran recitation competition with a cash prize enough for a brand-new bicycle. Using her savings at that moment Wadjda buys a CD with Quran teachings and spends the days to studying and memorizing the ayahs. During lessons she learns from the hadiths (comments to Quran) numerous principles that enables to follow the true Islam in the life such as The likeness of the one who reads it and tries hard to memorize it even though it is difficult for him, he will have two rewards. Moreover, these words as well as support from school supervisors strengthens her will and finally, Wadjda figures out to win the competition. Ironically, due strong social constrains on girl riding a bicycle she couldn't get the cash reward."}, {"id": 87, "text": "Wadjda is the first movie directed by a Saudi Arabian woman and it is about the everyday life and struggles of women in Saudi Arabia. The plot follows the life of a 10-year old girl Wadjda with rebellious temper whose only wish is to buy and ride a bicycle just as her friend Abdullah. The only problem is that girls in Saudi Arabia are not allowed to ride bicycles. Her mother goes through her own problems and refuses to buy the bicycle, so Wadjda decides to enter the Quran competition with a cash prize. This movie raised the issue of gender inequality in Saudi Arabia and showed aspects of the real life of a Saudi Arabian woman: polygyny, harassment from men, ban on women driving, and child marriages. In my opinion, the message that the director wanted to deliver is that this community needs some changes and it is shown through the eyes of a little girl. The main characters of this movie are Wadjda, her friend Abdullah, and her mother. The friendship of Wadjda and Abdullah is very sincere and charming. Although any relationships with boys are prohibited for girls, Wadjda is just entering the age when she will take the full responsibility of being a Saudi Arabian woman; in other words, Wadjda is still a kid who wears sneakers to school, listens to western music, and does not like covering her head. Her friend Abdullah who always teases her lives in the neighborhood and owns a bicycle; Wadjda becomes obsessed with it and decides to buy herself a new green shiny bicycle. In order to purchase it she starts saving money and registers for the Quran reciting competition and puts a lot of effort to win it. Wadjda is such a strong girl; she does not give up on her wish and works hard to improve her pronunciation of surahs. On the competition she wins the cash prize, but when the school principal asks her how she is going to spend the money, surprisingly, Wadjda reveals her dream of buying a bicycle. School principal becomes completely disappointed and decides to send the money to Palestinian kids instead. This act of injustice almost made me shed a tear. The methods the school principal uses to teach the kids are very unethical; for instance, two girls who were caught reading women magazines and making tattoos using felt pens were dishonored publicly. Wadjda's mother meanwhile deals with her own problems: she is dependent on the ill-mannered driver, and she is constantly exhausted because she travels several hours every day to get to her job. However, her main trouble is her husband who is constantly away wants to marry a second wife, so Wadjda's mother will be casted out. Most of the time Wadjda's mother tries so hard to impress and appease her husband, while he does not even care about their wellbeing. I felt so sorry for her because such a beautiful woman, a good wife and mother does not deserve to be treated that way. The part which shocked me the most is when during the extra classes on reciting Quran one of the Wadjda's classmates revealed that she recently got married and her husband is 20. It is terrible that for the community of Saudi Arabia child marriages are still acceptable. Moreover, there was a scene in which Wadjda was sexually harassed by a builder. This scene reflects that in this society men are given almost absolute permissiveness, while women can't even walk outside without covering their faces. Moreover, women are not allowed to talk to men, and to talk with each other loudly because men might hear them. All of these prohibitions obviously originate from Quran; one might even say that they are part of Saudi Arabian traditions. From the movie we can see that most of the women already put up with such unfair treatment and adapted to such conditions; but still voices of women like Wadjda can be heard and they are very powerful. Honestly, I think that substitution of the word bicycle to freedom would show clearly what is wrong with this society. This movie touched me deeply; it made me both happy and sad. This story is so simple, yet so powerful. In my opinion, the movie is very realistic; it shows the life behind the closed doors of Saudi Arabian families. The prohibitions prescribed by Islamic traditions are very harsh and sometimes, in my opinion, they are misinterpreted. In Islam, men and women are equal in front of God; apparently, some people in Saudi Arabia are unaware of that. Overall, the cinematography and editing are very good, and the acting is just excellent. I enjoyed watching every moment of this movie; especially when during contest Wadjda was reciting Quran with such dedication. The scene when Wadjda's mother was smoking and watching her husband marrying the second wife was very impressive. She finally joins this small revolution started by Wadjda and purchases the green bicycle for her daughter. I think that this movie brought hope to Saudi Arabian women dreaming of freedom and equality."}, {"id": 88, "text": "Movie review Wadjda is a drama film produced in Saudi Arabia in 2012, which tells the story of a 10-year-old girl dreaming of owning the bicycle to race against her friend Abdullah. The movie is significant in terms of being the first film which was shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, and the first feature-length film produced by a female Saudi director. It was well received by broad public and earned numerous awards. Generally, critical reviews comment the risky, yet balanced amalgamation of addressing social issues that women of Saudi Arabia face every day and showing the story of innocent girl who has a big dream. In my view, there are several reasons why 'Wadjda' had received such a great worldwide acclamation and heartstrings of many viewers. The character of Wadjda is intriguing to watch. We are introduced with the main character in the very first scene that pictures the bunch of school girls singing in the class. Wadjda immediately catches viewers' attention as she stands out from her peers. Camera delicately shows us shoes of the girls: most of them wearing black shoes with white socks, and Wadjda wearing sneakers. Personally I find this a very funny peculiarity that remains unchanged throughout the movie. In a more general picture, the desires little girl has and the actions she does (disobeying school laws) are the evidences of Wadjda's unique way of thinking. She might resemble the reformer who breaks old rules and brings novelty. Wadjda is also a resemblance of children's hope and innocence. Observing the life of Wadjda revealed me that all social stigmas are conventional attributes inherited by children from parents and elders. Wadjda and her friend Abdullah who both remain innocent children with light and childish world outlook seem to ignore these social stigmas. Of course, there are moments when they are reminded of the social order that exists in Saudi Arabia and try to obey this common law, but in most of the cases they do not feel the need to pretend who they are not. Wadjda is not afraid to laugh and play with Abdullah; she is not hiding her face under headscarf - that is how we see that children do not have these ideas how to act 'respectably', but get adhered to it as they grow. Observing the world through the eyes of Wadjda reminds me of children's purity and pushes to the realization that children are the only creatures who are truly righteous. I appreciated the light format that the movie has, yet it still keeps viewers uninformed of the end of the story. Basically, 10-year old girl has a very big dream - to own a green bicycle that catches her attention some day and never leaves her mind since that time. Her aspiration to reach her goal is amazing and enjoyable to watch. Using all available resources, her intelligence and gumption she tries to earn and collect money to buy the desired bicycle. Interestingly, as film proceeds, the methods girl uses change as well. She did sell hand-made bracelets and performed some excuses people asked her to do. At some point she had a choice to steal mother's money, but she vanished off this idea, choosing righteous path of earning what she wanted by attending the Quran recital competition and earning money by her diligence. Perhaps, adult viewers have a lot to learn from these episodes: namely, the firmness of the little girl to follow her dream and the ability to do right things despite the moments of desperation and hopelessness. The story of Wadjda's mother has a special role as well. Analyzing her character, viewers my come to the conclusion that film pictures the transformation of Wadjda's mother. From the person who is tightly strict to social order, she changes to a person who follows the bravery of her daughter and tries to overcome social stigmas. Wadjda's mother has been scared of husband leaving her, and she even kept her hair long only because he liked it better that way, or had buying a new dress with if her husband liked it or not in mind. Furthermore, she abandoned a nice job opportunity being afraid of husband's jealousy and hided her face from stranger males. By the end of the story, she finally breaks free from the fetters imposed by social order and other people's opinions, and the fact that she bought bicycle to Wadjda and white medical gown on her bed made me especially delighted. Additionally, the story of the head of girls' school entailed into the general picture seems interesting for me. Having a high social position and 'power' over school girls, Ms. Hussa is the one who trains teenage girls how to be 'respectable' and 'righteous'. However, what happens is that she enforces social rules to girls accustoming them to what society believes is good or correct behavior. Interestingly, the head of the school does not have authority for girls as she is not actually 'righteous' herself. Wadjda throws at her face the comment of M. Hussa's 'thief' showing that she just like everybody else knows about it. I guess the shock that we could observe on woman's face was more than eloquent. From my perspective, it was a masterful reminder for those who pretend to be the wisest to keep in mind that before you correct or teach someone you must analyze and control your own deeds. The accuracy with which story reveals some social issues that women of Saudi Arabia face is astonishing. Haifaa al-Mansour (the director of the movie) did a great job implicitly illustrating the cases when women's rights are violated. The mention of Wadjda's classmate having been married to 20-years-old man, showing women's (even the youngest ones) to cover their faces and bodies under black cape were the vital cases of women's infringement, but it was so delicately performed that it was not 'screaming' about the problem, thus having more effect on viewers. The word choice was also masterfully chosen. When Wadjda and her mother finished their meal sitting separately from male guests, mother tells the girl to 'remove the evidence of her crime', but eating is not a crime, but existence of women in general is considered by society as something forbidden or wrong, so that women are not allowed to raise their voices or to show their faces. And, finally, the role of Quran in the story of Wadjda has touched me the most. I am not saying that she had right motives to study Quran, the prior goal of her was to get a bicycle, but the diligence and sincerity that studying Quran required from her is exactly the lesson she received after all. The remark made by Wadjda's mother that Quran Suras are read beautifully only if they come from the heart is probably the key idea. It can be reinterpreted as there is no power in what you do not believe from whole your heart, and the Sura that Wadjda had to read during the competition coincides with aforementioned conclusions. To sum up, the film 'Wadjda' has an essential underlying message as it delicately shows the existing women rights' problems of Saudi Arabia through the story of 10-years-old girl who teaches people surrounding her that there is an alternative way."}, {"id": 89, "text": "Wadjda is a movie about a Saudi girl and her liberal individualism in conservative Saudi Arabia. Generally speaking, Saudi Arabia is one of the countries with strict rules towards women and movie focuses on them by exemplifying the life of 10 years old Wadjda. The movie reflects these restrictions in Wadjda's stubborn and courageous character, who does not obey school rules and established norms. Instead, she has a male friend Abdullah and wants to ride a bike, which is weird for Saudi society. The rebellious movie successfully portrays three important social issues such as women's freedom, patriarchal dominance, and gender segregation. In addition, the movie impacts our understanding of the contemporary woman status in Saudi Arabia. The current movie review will give a feedback on it. The first social issue is women's freedom. Women have to wear abaya and be completely covered. The rule is opposed by Wadjda who undermines the importance of the abaya by mixing it up with jeans and sneakers. The next example is an early marriage. The film shows the scene when little girls are gossiping about Salma, who is Wadjda's friend on Quran recitation. According to them, 10 years old Salma is going to marry 20 years old male, whom she has not seen at all. The comments made by girls regarding the marriage imply that such arranged marriages are of common custom even though it restricts women's freedom. Another example is the trophy given to Wadjda after she wins the recitation contest. Wadjda frankly answers that she wants to buy a bike for the awarded money. Her answer shocks the school principal, who sends the money for refugees in Palestine without asking Wadja. The current scene implies that not only men suppress women's free choice but it is negotiated by other women, also. During the whole movie, school principal maltreats Wadjda for her individualism and ignorance of conservative rules such as initiating little business, arranging dates between lovers, and saving money for the bike. The final conclusion made by the movie regarding women's freedom is successfully portrayed when Wadjda's dream comes true. She finally gets a bike and rides it along with Abdullah. I think, by this scene, the movie wanted to remind women about their free choice and concept of individualism. The second social issue is patriarchal dominance. The issue is exemplified by Wadjda's mother. She is a typical Saudi woman, who unfortunately cannot conceive a son. Consequently, she has to live in a fear that one day her husband will marry another woman. She continuously makes sure everything is perfect at home and nothing angers Wadjda's father. The food is always ready for him and she diligently gets prepared for his every arrival at home. Even though she has a job, she cannot control the family income and depends on the driver's mood to get to a job. In contrast to her friend, who works in the hospital together with men, she cannot afford such freedom. During one of the conversations with Wadjda, her mother mentions that she fell in love with her husband since high school and devoted the whole life for him. Wadjda admires the dad, nevertheless she feels dismayed towards his patriarchy. The next example is Abdullah's concession that he will marry Wadjda. During one the talks, Abdullah confirms that once they are grown up, they will marry together. Childhood fantasy one may imagine, but the way how Abdullah confirmed the statement without asking Wadjda's agreement makes him dominant over her. The final conclusion about patriarchal dominance is successfully portrayed when Wadjda's mother sets her mind as an independent woman by cutting her hair as she wanted and breaking any relationship with her husband. I think the movie wanted to point out that any woman can escape from patriarchy if there is a desire. The third social issue is gender segregation. Saudi women have no right to stay with men or even speak to them. Nevertheless, Wadjda goes out with Abdullah and learns to ride a bike from him. Another example of gender segregation is riding a bike. Even though it is not restricted by government, it is still considered as an inappropriate action for women whereas it is acceptable for men. And that was the reason why Wadjda's parents refused to buy a bike for a long time. The next example is the family tree made by Wadjda's father which includes only male offsprings. The sheet with her name which Wadjda attached on the tree family was thrown away and infers that women cannot continue the trait because they are women. The movie's propaganda regarding the gender segregation is successfully portrayed by the scene when girls leave the playground in the presence of men, whereas Wadjda firmly decides to stay. In my opinion, the movie showed that old customs can be questioned and oppressed if necessary. Wadjda is a movie that shows the typical life of Saudi women and the difficulties they encounter due to the gender discrepancy. The movie raises important issues such as women's freedom, patriarchal dominance, and gender segregation. By focusing on these social issues, movie opposes conservative abandonment and brings a new view on women's status in Saudi society."}, {"id": 90, "text": "Movie Review on Wadjda Wadjda (2012) is one of the first films produced in Saudi Arabia and it is even more interesting that the plot was written and screened by woman. The film illustrates girl named Wadjda (can be pronounced as Wajda) in pursuit of green bicycle that she wants to ride and also to hang around with her friend Abdullah who had one already. The problem is that the actions are happening in suburban area of Riyadh, where as in the rest of the country society rules cease to allow women some daily activities that are normal in most of non-Muslim countries. Waad Mohammed is an young starring actress in a role of Wadjda is very different from other girls in school, from her mother who obeys and fears the rules set in society, from director of school for girls that . In her pathway towards buying green bicycle in the store, there appears many obstacles that she needs to overcome till the end of the movie. Haifaa Al-Mansour is a director of the film, she managed to illustrate many issues in one film. The movies is not only about the issues of women in the society, the movie shows that many things are stereotypes in people's mind, and that it is possible to change old state to new one. In other words, the will of people can break chains that are restricting them. All of these I will steadily open up in following paragraphs. This essay will not be concentrated on retelling the plot and giving grade to costumes, actor's play, decoration and filming, it would rather focus on discussing the issues filmed in combination with plot and characters. In the beginning of the film we see that Wadjda is not obeying, not an A-student in the school. It is shown that she differs in her clothing, in her tastes of music, in choosing her friends. She even has her own small business, she sells bracelets with various signs. She sets a goal to but her bicycle, and tries to earn money in various ways. It seems that most of students in the school for girls are oppressed with the rules and there is a little freedom. Wadjda is like a representative of people rebelling against the rules. There is a society criticizing and a little girl pursuing her goals. Director of the school punishes students for many things that are accepted in other countries. For example, she always points to Wadjda's clothing, telling that it is inappropriate to wear Abaya, black clothing, this way or wearing snickers at all. Another example, she forbids girls to talk loudly or to laugh loudly in the street in order to prevent men's attention. Wadjda listens to Western music on radio, she also has a friend Abdullah living in a neighborhood, which is also unusual and kind of shameful for girl to interact with boy, even though they are children. However, Wadjda and Abdullah managed to keep their close friendship no matter what. Abdullah mostly helps Wadjda in pursuing her goal. Family issues in the film grows more evident towards the middle and the end of the film, although at the beginning there was a picture of father, mother and daughter. Father is shown to come rarely to home, which was a little bit odd. Then it appeared that Wadjda's mother cannot give a birth to a child after Wadjda's birth. This is why grandmother of Wadjda was searching second wife for her son. Having male in a genealogical tree is important, the girl's name usually is not included. There was a moment showing Wadjda writing down her name and pinning it to genealogical tree, but after severe days she sees that it was removed. Very strong moments, illustrating inequality in rights between males and females. As these issues are growing through film, Wadjda's mother is smoking more heavily. There were many other aspects touched upon in the film. Previous paragraphs built a base to discuss these coming latter. Women are not allowed to drive a car, which brings many problems, for example, losing jobs, stress because of male drivers, the expenditures. There is probably metaphor used: Wadjda's bicycle against which many obstacles, which is unprecedented and women's right to drive a car. Women are ought to wear closed things, which brings the difficulties during their movement, Women want to wear beautiful dresses, but here it was shown that Wadjda and her mother dreamed that if they buy red dress, their father will not marry second time. So the appearance was vastly considered to be useful to influence husband. Also this is an illustration mother-daughter relationships that is heavily shown through film. Women supporting each other is emphasized. When Wadjda's father finally marries another woman, she and her mother are showing great support to each other. If to discuss how society shapes minds, next examples from the film should be used. Wadjda's mother cannot change her workplace to better one, because her husband would not accept her working with males, and she is obedient of that. Her society shaped her this ways since her childhood. Another example of this shaping is school director, who is now very strict in teaching to obey rules, but who claims to be similar to Wadjda, and also whom about where rumors that she was caught with man in her school time. One of Wadjda's classmates in religious recitations is already married to 20 years old man. Another of her friend was caught by morality police talking to man, and with a shame was married to another man. There is also a projection of political problem and how is authority executed. The driver Ikbal living in poor conditions, probably migrated from poorer areas of country. Children using the authoritative people's name in their speech could easily frighten the driver. Children looking at how problems are solved in the country, repeats this in their actions towards solving problem. In the end of the film, Wadjda reached her goal, her mother bought her bicycle. This is a message of filmmakers to audience about the possibility of changing the state of things in the country. Because we see that even though riding a bicycle for a girl is unprecedented, it was not prohibited, and it was mainly in people's mind. Also, the character development is seen, Wadjda won the tournament in reciting Quran, but before she was not good at this and she was friend with other kind of people. Even though she was motivated with money in the beginning, she gained friends in face of girls attending special event for reading Quran. This film is a good opportunity to the rest of the world to understand what is going on in Saudi Arabia in reality. If to rely on reviews (which are mostly positive according to various nominations or people's review), these film is a good representation of reality there. It seems to me so close, good people, bad people, rumors exist in all societies, no matter what strict rules you set upon people. There are shown lots of contradiction in people's behavior. It is stereotyped that women in Saudi Arabia are restricted to home, but in fact there can be seen examples of them working, interacting with man when it is needed. Young women desiring to be dressed well, to be beautiful is also a little bit interesting. At school they are prohibited to do all of beautification, but in real world they practice it. There also negative reviews on this film, such as betrayal of Saudi Arabians, critique of promotion of this film by prince, but it does not diminish the film significance. Haifaa Al-Masour filmed movie so simple and close to reality, that it seems as a documentary. For example, everyday rituals, eating pattern are very realistic. Nothing was irritating, for the debuting director it was pretty good. Although some moments might have been more clearly shown for those who are not very familiar with society there. Waad Mohammed played her role very good, although it was her first and probably last work. Many details about schools, social layers, political ballots were shown. Both the film and in the film there is an example of being first in changing old rules, stereotypes, in familiarizing people with new possibilities. It shows people of Saudi Arabia to the rest of the world, it shows the dynamic in the society, shows brave people fighting obstacles in pursuit of their dreams. Historically, this question about Muslim women rights in Saudi Arabia can be interconnected with same situation in the India and to the rest of world."}, {"id": 91, "text": "The Saudi Arabian movie 'Wadjda' is a type of movie which anyone would like. The movie tells the story of a 10 years old girl Wadjda and her little dream to buy a bicycle which then reveals very serious social topics about the life of people who live in a theocratic state. Wadjda is an ordinary girl who goes to school and gets traditional Arabic education, however, from her early ages, she notices patriarchal dominance around and unconsciously starts to rebel. It is seen from minor things that Wadjda does every day: listens to western songs, wears sneakers to school, uses nail polish and even refuses to leave school backyard not to be seen by men. Wadjda also has a friend her age, Abdullah, with whom she wants to race on bicycles and thus starts to save up her money to buy herself one no matter the fact that girls are not allowed to ride bicycles in her town. Wadjda's mother has more traditional life views and so refuses to support her daughter's idea to buy a bicycle. Wadjda's mother is very young and beautiful, tries her best not to upset her husband in any way and so has to work very far from home just because there are no men at her work. The relationship between Wadjda's parents starts to crash because of social pressure on her mother who is not able to have a son. This reveals a big issue of patriarchy, where boys are way more valued in families than girls. Wadjda realizes this fact when she looks at her family tree and sees no women's names on it. Then she takes a piece of paper with her name on it and put herself on her family tree as a sign that she is also a member of this family and that she should be valued equally with boys.For me, this movie is about braveness and hard work. From the very first day of having a dream to buy a bicycle, Wadjda becomes so motivated that she constantly visits local toys seller and convinces him not to sell the bicycle to anyone else until she will save up enough money. Wadjda even has some enterprising skills and sells handmade bracelets at school, and also tries to sell them at the local mall, however, faces a fail in both cases.When she realizes that she will not be able to earn money from selling bracelets, she decides to participate in Quran competition at school. From this part of the movie, we start to see the whole hardworking nature of Wadjda. Wadjda was never good at reading Quran, but nevertheless enters religious school club and starts to prepare for the competition. She even spends her money that she saved up for the bicycle, to buy a console that helps to study the Quran. From this, I would conclude that Wadjda was so determined in her winning that she spend her money that could help her to buy the bicycle. Throughout the movie, we can observe the notable progress of Wadjda in her studies of the Quran, that she eventually wins the competition. However, I would not say that Wadjda studied Quran only because of desire to win money. By her nature, she is a kind girl who always tries to help and support her mother and despite the fact that she has rebellious character, we cannot say that she was rebellious against the Islam religion itself, but rather some of the traditions in religious society.Unfortunately, Wadjda does not get her prize money, because the school principal did not want to let Wadjda buy the bicycle. The school principal criticized Wadjda in front of the whole school and gave her a lecture on morality. At that moment, young Wadjda realized that adults themselves are not always right and that they can be sometimes very dissembler. The school principal was the one who always scolded the girls for inappropriate behavior, but herself was caught with a man. Later, we can see that Wadjda received her bicycle as a gift from her mother, who in turn also went through her own problems. At the end of the movie, we see happy Wadjda on her desired bicycle, feeling herself fully free person.The movie Wadjda is not only about the simple story of a girl who wanted to buy a bicycle. It is much deeper than that. It is the movie about dreams, about overcoming obstacles, about hard work, friendship, and love."}, {"id": 92, "text": "A girl who finally got her bicycle The Wadjda is a picture showing everyday life in Saudi Arabia, including interrelations between family members, educational system, common values and norms, on the example of Wadjda and her family. The production featured team from Saudi Arabia, Netherlands, Germany, Jordan, United Arab Emirates and USA (1). The director of the movie, Haifaa Al-]Mansour, is the first female filmmaker in Saudi Arabia. She is respected for bringing attention to topics within her culture that used to be closed for discussion. Furthermore, she promotes critical view on traditional and strict culture of Saudi Arabian society (2). The movie portrayed scenes from life of Wadjda including her relationships with her family, friend and school. Her very wish to get a bike so she could play with her friend Abdallah was never supported by her family. The reason was that it was unacceptable for girls in her culture to ride bicycles. Therefore, Wadjda decided to save money for purchasing the bicycle on her own. Fortunately, the school she attends announced a competition of Quran recitation with a prize of 1000 Riyals. So she joined the religion club at the school and won the competition. However, when principle of her school asked on what Wadjda would spend her prize, she answered she would buy the bicycle. The principle got disappointed with Wadjda's answer and told her that no girls rode the bicycles and donated the money. Of course, this is not the whole plot of the movie, but I think that what was meant by it was to express critique to the traditional culture of Saudi Arabia. The movie did not have aggressive attitude towards customs and traditions, instead, it just showed them in action. It had not made a revolt but politely pointed at particular aspects that were problematic. I guess, female figure in the production pointed direction into gender interrelation and certain dos and don'ts. The beauty of this movie was in the way they were pictured. For instance, norms of behavior through school principle Ms. Hussa, relationships between men and women through Wadjda's parents and her relationship with adults, classmates and Abdallah. The way the movie depicted the character of Wadjda was interesting. Wearing converse instead of black shoes, listening to the music in English, earning for her dream bicycle by selling bracelets, which was prohibited in school. All her actions were pointing at her rebellious and unconventional personality. In addition she was persistent with her aim of getting herself the bike, and obstinate despite the opinion of her family. She invested in device for learning Quran and resisted being laughed at in religion club. Wadjda even prepared herself to getting the bicycling by asking the man in shop to keep it for her and Abdallah to teach her how to ride it. All of these characteristics, in my opinion, were leading to a picture of a brave girls who did not filter herself through the prism of her society. I mean that she kept dreaming and working on getting the bicycle even when she was told that it was unacceptable and scolded for continuous asking to lend money for the bike. One of the scenes that impressed me was a dialogue of Wadjda and her mother. Her mother was saying that she would like her hair shorter and when Wadjda told her to cut it, she replied that she kept them because Wadjda's farther liked them long. Because there was no son in their family, Wadjda's mother was worried of high probability that Wajda's father would marry another women. I saw the problem of value of girls and boys. The progeny was considered progeny when there was a male, and women were not included in family trees. I would not say it was different in my own culture, still, the absence of son in the family as a reason of divorce seemed quite problematic. In addition, I myself felt offended when Ms. Huss decided to donate Wadjda's prize money to Palestine. Not it was unrighteous thing to do, but that prize was honestly earned due to Wadjda's effort. Just because the in the society it was unacceptable for girls to ride a bicycle, depriving Wadjda of her prize when she was wanted it for so long and worked hard for it seemed unfair for me. But wasn't that a point of a movie? To point at cultural issues. I believe that movie did a great job in engaging and emerging into movie's atmosphere. Moreover, it was filmed in appealing way, related to everyday life, so that it could easily be felt by the viewers. Aside warm atmosphere, important message, comprehensive plot, and great delivery, the movie was nominated to numerous awards. Among 33 nominations, Wadjda won in 22 from 2014 to 2014 (3). In addition, this movie was also included to the list of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die by Steven Schneider (1)."}, {"id": 93, "text": "Wadjda is the movie directed by the first women director from Saudi Arabia Haifaa Al-Mansour. The plot of the movie is about Saudi girl Wadjda who is willing to purchase a green bicycle. The story begins when her neighbor young boy Abdulla grabbed her scarf and Wadjda tried to return it while he was riding a bicycle. From this moment Wadjda aimed to buy a green bicycle and started to save money for that by making bracelets and counting her own budget. The price of a bicycle is really high and her mother is not going buy it to Wadjda when she asked. That is why Wadjda decided to participate in Qur'an competition at school where the winner gets the money prize. This movie contains a lot of cultural features of Islamic life in Saudi Arabia. Most of this cultural features related to women's life in Saudi Arabia, for example, it can be observed in the movie that they are not allowed to look at men on the street, and make their voices or laughs be heard, and the most important ride bicycle or car. During the film, all women have a driver who takes them wherever they need. However, from the example of Wadjda's mother, it was really complicated as the driver all the time to complain because she is late or they are out of time. Moreover, Wadjda's mother told her that in their society it is not allowed for women or girls to ride the bicycle and if she does it, she will not able to have children. However, this fact raises questions such as if it is alien for their society why sales clerk behave so free with Wadjda about the bicycle and even at the end sell it to Wadjda's mother. In addition, all women cannot drive the car on their own but they have drivers who are males and are not their relatives or part of their family. From my point of view, Haifaa Al-Mansour through these moments in the movie addresses the problems that exist within the Saudi society. Wadjda is a rebel character at school who totally differs from her classmates, she is wearing sneakers which contrast with the all-black uniform. However, at home, she is totally free and her relationships with her mom are really warm. Her dad appeared in the movie a few times and it is known that he is going to his second wife because Wadjda's mom is not able to give his son. From the scenes of Wadjda and her mom, we can see that at home they wear comfortable, colorful clothes and behave free. However, as soon as they go outside they must cover their bodies with total black clothes. This addresses another problem in Saudi Arabia where women are still cannot go outside without covering their bodies and faces. Moreover, the moment where Wadjda put her name on the family tree to show that she is taking the important part in her dad's family. However, then we observe that it is not true hen Wadjda find the paper with her name on the table and when her dad married the second time. Wadjda's rebellion nature change slightly when she found out that Qur'an competition is the only way for her to reach her goal. She started to be a model student and memorize Qur'an. The astonishing moment when she bought the game that helped her to memorize Qur'an's passages and terms. The notion that such games are existing makes me surprised. However, the fact of how Wadjda started to prepare in order to win shows her clever, strong and charm personality that amuse viewers. Even though she won the competition, she did not get her money prize because as soon as her strict teacher Hussa heard that she is going to buy a bicycle for this money, they took this money and decided that they will spend it for charity or donation. That is really unfair and represent how strict society is towards what is not looking normal for them. The movie demonstrates many contradictions such as prohibition for women to not look at men or laugh loudly on the street, but to have male drivers who are not from their families. Moreover, the fact that some women at school as director Hussa or other teachers wearing normal clothes and have makeup while their students are not, this increases a lot of questions and debates. For instance, Wadjda's mother who does not cut her hair because her husband likes it and even she is doing everything for her husband he blamed her for not giving him an heir and married second time. This movie demonstrates daily scenes from Wadjda's life and addresses that where women are empowered she is put all her force and will to get what she wants. This drama gives a hope that with such kind small rebels one day the life will change for those who live with such rules and rights."}, {"id": 94, "text": "To begin with, a movie tells us an ordinary story about kindness and a little girl that has a strong sense of purpose..."}, {"id": 95, "text": "Wadjda is an excellent film in that it shows a glimpse of a society from the prospective of the title character, Wadjda, a young middle class girl in Saudi Arabia.The main conflicts surround Wadjda and her mother. Wadjda wants to buy a bicycle to beat her friend/crush Abdullah in a race. This is very atypical in Saudi society: girls don't ride bikes, it is for boys. This doesn't stop Wadjda, as she enacts a few different schemes to try and raise the needed funds. Unfortunately, she clashes with the school principal, Ms. Hussa. Ms. Hussa attempts to save Wadjda by constantly reprimanding her. Eventually, Wadjda decides to sign up for a Qur'an recitation competition to win the money for her bike.Wadjda's mother is also having problems. She is at ends with her husband, who is constantly away and wants a son that becomes more evident that she can not produce. She is still deeply in love with him. Her other problem is with riding with her dim-witted, easily agitated driver (this was made before women could drive in Saudi Arabia).One of the best parts of the film is the characters interactions, Wadjda and Abdullah's budding friendship/romance. Wasjda and her mother's slow estrangement her father is particular hard to watch. This is a potent movie and seems very realistic. They don't tell the watcher what to believe and leave things as are.: (for Westerners) an eye opening look at one of the most conservative societies on the planet.Everyone involved in the project should give themselves a hand, the did very well."}, {"id": 96, "text": "I just left the cinema with a big smile on my face. By reading the synopsis i thought would be a heavy, dense movie about the modern Saudi Arabia and the struggles of being a woman there.But not, the rebel Wadjda will give us that, but with lots of charisma and positiveness. She will fight that society and the rules, as an empowering call for adults woman to do so and take back their space in that male society."}, {"id": 97, "text": "This was a beautiful little movie. While I don't know much about the religion the movie was simple enough that it filled in any gaps that I had to understand what was going on. The story was simple which allowed for more exploration of the characters, thus making you care more. All round this was a good movie that I recommend for anyone to watch if you get a chance."}, {"id": 98, "text": "A liberal 10 year old girl faces the hardships of her own home country and religion throughout her journey in the movie. Her name is Wajda and she wears converse sneakers to school and barely wears her head gear and gets scolded by her teachers and mom, once in a while for it. One day she is being teased by a boy who she likes to hang out with and he rides a bike, and she promises to beat him in a race when she buys her own bike. However, it is not custom or ordinary to see women riding a bike...Wadjda is an independent girl at the young age of just 10 and i find it very fascinating how immature, but mature at the same time that she can be. When she is at school and sells wristbands and illegal things to make money to buy her bike that cost 800 riyals, the audience feels the strive and determination of a girl who is living under the limitations of religion and a misogynist society. Moreover, Wajda helps a classmate talk to a boy for the payment of 20 riyals and also charges the boy she delivers the note to 20 riyals and gets obtains money in whatever way that she can. Meanwhile, her house structure seems pretty calm and comfortable, with a nice kitchen, living room and even a video game system that is definitely not allowed in the customs of the country. Let alone women cannot wear nail polish, bracelets, and or unveil their hair in public. However, her father and mother are never home and when she sees her father bring home his family tree, that hangs up on the wall, that does not include his daughters name. It only includes the names of the male heirs in the family which foreshadows the departure of her father from her mother to go have another wife to produce an male heir for him. It is sad that this happens to Wajda's mother who did everything to appease him and respect her religion, but in the end it is very nice to see that she changes and tells Wajda that she can do whatever she wants and be whatever she wants and not let anybody change her."}, {"id": 99, "text": "This film is about a young spunky girl growing up in Saudi Arabia. Her mother is married to a man but he is making a decision on whether to marry another women or not. Throughout the movie the girl, Wadjda, learns to ride a bike from a neighbor boy.

She really wants to ride a bike like her friend, but her mother denies to buy her one because this disobeys the social norms in their Arabic society. Wadjda tries to collect money from her friends, and even wins a competition(But she does not actually get the award at the end). Eventually, her hard work impresses her mother to allow her to ride a bike. The last couple scenes in the movie was very touching to me. Wadjda's mother divorces with her father, and uses all the money she has for the red dress to buy Wadjda a bike. When I see Wadjda is finally riding the bike, I am so happy for her, but also sad for her mother. I would give this film an 8, because I really like the story line and how religion and social norms are playing such an important role in this film. I would definitely recommend this film, because it shows so many culture elements that we can never see in our life."}, {"id": 101, "text": "Wadjda is about a young Saudi Arabian girl who challenges the social laws of Saudi Arabia. The movies main plot line is the struggle of Wadjda trying to get enough money to buy a bike. To get money Wadjda scams some people out of money as well as selling bracelets. The biggest sum of money was going to come from the Quran contest that she won However, there are greater problems within this because in Saudi Arabia girls do not ride bikes. Because of this the teachers do not let her keep the money. Another instance where you see injustice is with Wadjda mom, since in Saudi Arabia she can not drive. This leads her to get a driver and causes problems with her job. The end of the movie was very heartwarming because the mom buys Wadjda the bike instead of buying the dress she wants. Then in the closing scene, the guy Wadjda likes asks her to marry him when they are older."}, {"id": 102, "text": "Wadjda is the story of a little girl living in Saudi Arabia.

When she asked her mom about buying a bike, she says no and that women don't ride bikes. Wadjda does not care what other people think and begins trying to save up money to purchase the bike. Eventually, Wadjda enters into a school Koran recitation contest to win the prize money and buy a bike. She spends a lot of time preparing for this competition and eventually wins the prize money. When she tells everyone she is going to buy a bike, the school then donates the money instead of giving it to Wadjda. At the very end of the film Wadjda is very sad that she can't purchase her bike. For the happy ending, Wadjda's mom buys her a bike and she beats Abdullah in a race.

It was very interesting to get a different perspective of their culture. The main character, Wadja, was trying to save up for a bike to race her friend. Throughout the film we saw the way of life that the women live. We learned about marital customs and how strict the women's rules were to live their life. Overall, I liked this film. It made me very happy when Wadja got her bike in the end. This shows us that Wadja's perseverance throughout the film pays off."}, {"id": 104, "text": "The film Wadjda gives the viewer a unique glimpse into an entirely different society. The film seems simple at first but as the events unfold the story becomes much deeper. The film shows how women have to cope with the patriarchal society. What makes the film so good is how it tells a story of how the Saudi community functions through the experiences of a young girl Wadjda. It is inspiring how determined Wadjda is to get a bike and race a man, despite the action being against the cultural norm. Even in dark parts of the film the viewer still has a sense of optimism due to Wadjda's tenacity. The director did a great job in telling the everyday story about the Saudi Arabian people without any bias and through a young female. In the center of the film we see the everyday life of Wadjda and other girls of similar age. All the girls in the all-girl School must conform to the status of the ideal wife and are prepared for that job all through School. However, they act and laugh normal children would. The impact of School on their lives is best seen with their lack of surprise when being on their period to having to hold the Koran with a napkin. Wadjda's mother is also a strong independent women who strays from the expected behavior of women. She buys Wadjda the bike she wanted that was frowned upon due to her being a woman. And she cuts her hair despite her husband telling her that he did not want her to. It is rare to find a foreign film that can actually inspire you and really impact your global perspective. I truly enjoyed this film and would suggest it to another student or teacher."}, {"id": 105, "text": "In my opinion, Wadjda was one of the best foreign films I've seen thus far. I really appreciate films, especially those from other countries, that have a really strong female protagonist, and this film was no exception. It was even entertaining to see the establishing shots of her battered-up sneakers as opposed to every other girl's simple black shoes, to show how she was different from those who conformed. The story revolved around the titular character, Wadjda, a young girl that questioned the roles imposed upon her by society. Although it was against sharia law, her one main goal was to buy a bike in order to race her friend. She loses hope when she is unable to save enough money on her own, but she soon hears about a Qaran recitation competition at her school, where the winner is able to win a cash prize. In the hopes of obtaining her bike, she enters the competition. She ends up winning, but the headmaster donates the money to Palestine instead as she discovers that Wadjda was simply trying to buy a bike. The movie ends on a sweet note, with Wadjda finding out her mom has bought the bike for her anyway, and she is able to race her friend. I'd give this film a solid 5 stars."}, {"id": 106, "text": "Wadja is a very interesting film that really opens the world up to Saudi Arabia on gender roles. Due to Culture and religion, as well as the Taliban, Saudi Arabia faced Sharia Law, which caused all of the gender inequality issues there is today. Wadja focuses on a young girl who is still in grade school and pursues a certain bike she has had her eye on even since she first sees it. She does everything she can to earn enough money for the bike and even gets the store clerk to hold the bike for her in his shop. Throughout the entire storyline, there were the never-ending hints at all of the gender inequality. A few I can think of right now are the differences between life at home and life outside of the home between the mother and the daughter. First of all, when Wadja and her mother are by themselves at home they are happy, and they are who they truly are and express themselves that way, but as soon as they step outside of the front doors to the house it all changes. Wadja is young and more of a courageous rebel, but her mother puts the veil on and applies herself to every other expected gender role in Saudi Arabia's society. Lastly, before or after watching this film, I recommend doing research on how the director had to complete this film when it came to directing and everything else while in Saudi Arabia."}, {"id": 107, "text": "The film, Wadjda, directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour, was one of the best films I have ever seen. It was truly inspirational for all girls especially, and I loved it! The actress, Waad Mohammed, did an amazing job playing her role. She was such a strong and independent girl, who despite all the name calling for being a girl, never let the boys pull her down. I loved this about her, and she inspired me to never give up and let the boys beat me down."}, {"id": 108, "text": "Overall I thought this was a great movie,that showed how life typically is like for young women in Saudi Arabia. The main character in the film Wadjda goes to an all girls school, and is one of the top students in her class for chanting out of the Koran. In the film she signed up for a Koran Recitation Competition, but the principle of this all girls school isn't very friendly. Wadjda was not always in good relations with the principle, since she occasionally got sent to her office for misbehaving on school grounds. She wasn't really doing anything wrong, but her two acquaintances at the school were doing things that were supposed to be forbidden in public like: painting ones nails, and reading magazines. What I liked about this film is that, it showed the educational system in Saudi Arabia. Most people would think that their education system is not very good, but it seemed good in the film. My favorite character in this film was Wadjda, because she was always very determined and confident in herself. Her friend was a neighbor's child, and he always rode his bike around, which made Wadjda want one for herself as well. This desperation to have a bike of her own angered the principle, because this was seen to her as an insult. Wadjda won first place in the competition. When she was asked what she would do with the money she receives, she said that she would buy a bike, this did not satisfy Ms. Hussa. Ms. Hussa (the principle ) said that she will give the money to donations, like Qatar . I thought this was despicable, Wadjada should have been able to do anything she wanted if she were given the money as a prize. This was a good movie, I would give it a 5/5."}, {"id": 109, "text": "Many of you might have watched this movie without really knowing the history behind it and how much this movie really means to the women of Saudi Arabia and to their country on general. Wadjda is not simply a movie about the oppressing rules in Saudi Arabia and how a girl over comes them. The movie itself is an example of this. Haifaa Al-Mansour is the first Saudi woman director of the country. She had to fight for almost 3 years to get the financial support to get the movie made and once she did she face difficulties while filming because she could not be seen interacting with the men of the crew in public so she had to stay inside of a ban from where she directed which made it extremely difficult to do so. Wadjda was also the first feature length movie shoot entirely in Saudi Arabia and with a mostly Saudi cast. This was also the first movie the country ever submitted to be considered by the Academy Awards, it did not get nominated but the simple fact that it was submitted speaks a lot about how important this movie is.Of course, the story of Wadjda had a lot to do with the recognition of the movie. The story of a girl who want to ride a bicycle in a country where bicycles are only for boys. Wadjda doesn't give up and does whatever she has to do to get her bicycle and race her friend. We see the character of the movie overcome many obstacles on their lives, from simply cutting their hair to taking responsibility for their actions. The movie clearly criticizes the society of Saudi Arabia but it also shows how the people of the country can help make it better and that it is possible for it to get better. The movie was controversial when it first came out, Haifaa Al-Mansour faced criticism for the source of her movie calling it anti-religious, which she denied. The movie was still a big success in the country which shows how there is hope for it to change for the better and how it is already changing."}, {"id": 110, "text": "I really loved this movie.

I saw behind the scene shots and I can see the struggle of shooting the movie. But the crew handled it really well. Good job Haifa, keep the great work.

You can't forget little Wadjda who has no innate reverence for silly rules, almost na\u00efvely turning the overbearing form of Saudi Islam on itself, her mother, as much a victim of life as any other, eventually growing out of her own distress and taking a step to giving her daughter the liberty she never had, the shop-keeper, who tacitly roots for little Wdjda, and of course, Wadjda's little pal, who, born to be an alpha in Saudi society, glows with joy to see his friend - one he cares for - break a little bit freer, teaching her to ride a bike. He himself has no innate need to be the alpha, and is just happy for her. All these people together deal a small blow to the ills of their society, which are indirectly ridiculed, through the hypocrisy and self-interest of their servants.

Wadjda wants to race against neighbourhood boy and friend Abdullah (Abdullrahman Al Gohani) who has his own bicycle, but girls riding on bikes is frowned upon, almost banned in fact, Wadjda's mother refuses to buy her daughter a bike.

Following encounters with the strict headmistress, Wadjda sees an opportunity to make the money she needs to pay for the bike, entering and participating in a Quran recital competition, with a cash prize of SR1,000 (about $270 US dollars), so she studies and learns the Quran word by word, which impresses her teacher. When it finally comes to the competition Wadjda is delighted to win the competition, pleasing the headmistress and teachers, but she announces her intention to buy a bicycle with the cash prize, the headmistress is unimpressed with this and tells that the money will be donated on her behalf to Palestine instead. Wadjda returns home devastated, and finding that her father has taken a second wife, but her mother surprises her, for her achievement at the competition, she has bought the green bicycle she has always wanted from the store, and in the end Wadjda is able to win in a race against Abdullah.

Mohammed gives an endearing performance as the title character who is a tomboy and will do anything to get her beloved bicycle, the supporting cast are all good as well, I agree the story is simple and easy to slip into, but it is indeed much more interesting baring in mind the topics of Saudi Arabia, including martial law, restrictions for women concerning travel and the importance of religion and the Quran in the country, following the release of the film though the law has been lifted on women riding bicycles, so a great result, it is a terrific drama film.

We root for young Wadjda (Waad Mohammed) and her distracted mother (Reem Abdullah), two victims of the most brutal, reactionary regime on Earth. Wadjda has to turn to the insane Kor'an to try to win a cash-prize, and her mother distractedly waits for her husband to take a second wife because she can no longer have children (and his longed-for son). In the end, they are both left entirely alone against the world, and the hope is that other bright children will forge change: but of course it will require more than that. It will require real men with the courage to overturn this benighted regime, blast away hypocrisy and introduce modernity.

Her mother(Reem Abdullah) does not prevent Wadjda from enjoying her little freedom and privacy in her room, but she is not so pleased about her daughter's transgressive activities including listening to some 'infernal songs' from the Western world. The principal of her girls' school, Miss Hussa(Ahd), also sees the potential of troubles inside Wadjda. She sternly handle her students as required for her position as the head of the school, but she is not a mean, heartless woman; like Wadjda's mother, she just disapproves of Wadjda's improper deeds even though she understands her troublesome student more than she admits.Wadjda is also well aware of the social restrictions surrounding her, and the sense of isolation and exclusion is always around her and other female characters throughout the film. We do not see any men in Wadjda's school because they are not allowed by law, and there is an amusing moment when Wadjda is paid to be a messenger going between a girl and her secret lover. While Wadjda's home is nearly isolated from the outside, Wadjda's mother can go outside for her work, but she needs a driver just because women are not permitted to drive in Saudi Arabia.The movie does not criticize the social aspects reflected in the story, but it is surely an odd experience for the audiences outside Saudi Arabia to observe the world where sexual inequality is taken for granted by law and religion. Wadjda's father(Sultan Al Assaf) looks like a nice man, but he is becoming a distant figure to not only Wadjda but also to a woman whom he once loved. We seldom see him at their home, and he sometimes looks like the guest of the house although he is technically the master of the house. Like many married man in male-dominant society, he wants a son, but Wadjda's mother does not want to get pregnant again for her health reason, and she knows too well that her husband is probably considering having the second wife just because of that.Meanwhile, Wadjda sets herself upon a personal mission to be accomplished. She wants a bicycle for having a race with a boy who has been friendly with her, and she finds the right one for her at a nearby shop, but there are a couple of obstacles she has to deal with. While she has to learn how to ride it, she is blocked by her mother's objection, for riding bicycle is deemed as a taboo to women(believe or not, as mentioned in the film, they think riding bicycle seriously affects woman's fertility).Still determined to buy that bike, Wadjda begins to save money by any means available to her. She initially tries to get the money through her usual transactions of banned items at her school, but she only finds herself soon brought to Miss Hussa for that, and her mother is naturally angry to hear about her daughter's naughty dealings at the school.And then, Wadjda comes across a very good opportunity she cannot possibly refuse. She is not much interest in religion, but, when she learns that the prize of the upcoming Koran recital competition at the school is the cash enough for buying her bicycle, she immediately goes for it without any hesitation. She joins in the Koran reading class, and she also buys an interactive video game for her Koran study at home, and she turns out to be a good learner.I do not dare to tell you anything about the outcome of her diligent efforts, but I can say that the director/writer Haifaa Al Mansour will give you powerful moments to linger on your mind even if you are not very surprised by what happens in the end. For her realistic approach to the story, Al Mansour insisted on shooting her film at Riyadh despite the restrictions to be put on her direction(she was not allowed to interact with her mostly male crew in public, for example), and how she managed to complete her debut work in spite of many difficulties resonates with her heroine's strong-willed determination. Like Wadjda finds a way to deal with her oppressing system to get what she wants, Al Mansour found a way to fulfill her small but significant vision which is vividly packed with realistic details including female students' quite careful handling of the Koran or a young student rejecting her mother who also happens to be a senior student of the same school(this is the world where an 8-year-old kid can get married to older guy, you know). As a matter of fact, you may be surprised to know that she directed all of the street scenes in the film from the distance while staying inside a van parked nearby(she interacted with her crew mainly through a monitor and a walkie-talkie)."}, {"id": 116, "text": "I just watched the film Wadjda, and I just want to say that Haifaa Al- Mansour has done a brilliant job. The story is solid and unique, and the same goes for the characters. It avoids common stereotypes but instead does what every film should do: present its characters as real people. Wadjda is a great character; headstrong, occasionally manipulative, clever, she perseveres to get what she wants, sometimes a bit self serving with her own interests at heart, but ultimately she cares about the people closest to her. How refreshing it is to see a character like her in film. The acting is very great too, especially the younger cast. The cinematography is beautiful, and paints a very personal picture of Wadjda and the people around her. I recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving yet relatable story. Wadjda is ultimately a timeless film. If you haven't seen it yet, you should."}, {"id": 117, "text": "One, or two, years ago this was at the Tribeca Film Festival, I believe, and it was one of the many movies I missed. And what drew me to the project is that you don't hear about a lot of movies coming out of Western Asia that aren't about turmoil and, from what it seemed, the film was just about a girl's quest for a bike. Now, mind you, the film does touch on some issues a young girl faces within Saudi Arabia, but these are more presented as obstacles to overcome rather than some type of western perception which would make everything look like it is simply a backwards, oppressive society.Characters &amp; StoryThe movie follows a young girl named Wadjda (Waad Mohammed) who is a bit of a tomboy who isn't always one to hold her tongue. This personality, naturally, rubs many people the wrong way, especially her principal Ms. Hussa (Ahd Kamel), and even her mother (Reem Abdullah) to a point. But, with Wadjda being the type of girl who pursues what she enjoys first, and perhaps considers what may be considered appropriate in her culture second, she usually finds herself getting reprimanded repeatedly.Luckily though, she has a friend in this local boy named Abdullah (Abdullrahman Algohani) who very much likes her. The two play together often, but one thing they can't do together is ride bikes. Wadjda's mother worries it may do something to Wadjda's virginity, so she won't buy it, and that leads to the meat of the film which is Wadjda's pursuit to get the money for the bike.This includes making bracelets; passing notes between lovers, which causes a local scandal; and then getting into a Quran competition. The competition can be seen as a turning point for her for it makes Ms. Hussa think Wadjda is starting to realize the way things are and is starting to assimilate, but with Wadjda winning she finds out that the prize money was really meant for something selfless, leaving us to wonder if Wadjda may ever get her bike?PraiseLike most Americans, I would argue, my knowledge of what goes on in Saudi Arabia is limited to what the news feeds me. With that in mind, I loved this film because though it focuses on a small area in Saudi Arabia, I feel like it doesn't just use the location but also the culture. Be it the movie speaking on the mother's issue with being unable to produce a son, leading her husband to getting a second wife; Wadjda's issues with facing gender norms; this situation where two close girls get ostracized because Ms. Hussa, seemingly, thinks they maybe lesbians; and a slew of other matters, it just feels strangely refreshing to a person like me who feels like there are way too many films solely focused on Judeo-Christian characters' faith and culture.And while the story is definitely something which kept me entertained, so was the acting. Though no one is digging deep down and trying to pull out an Oscar winning performance, the benefit of that is everything feels authentic. Nothing feels over dramatic, or tone down for the sake of trying to present Saudi Arabia as this really tolerant place which the Western World is misinformed on. It recognizes the issues a young girl, and a grown woman, would have in the country, but doesn't try to really be political. It presents the issues that woman have there to be, as noted above, as more so obstacles than anything else. Not to say that calling them obstacles isn't likely an understatement for those actually living in Saudi Arabia, but in terms of the film, especially for Wadjda's story, things never seem absolute when she is told no by someone. Presenting a sense of hope, to me anyway.CriticismAs for criticism, honestly I don't really have any. When I think about all the characters presented in the movie, I feel they are all developed enough to satisfy my pickiness. Also, the movie didn't feel all that long and though I didn't laugh or get teary eyed, I did feel very much focused and entertained throughout the film.Overall: Worth SeeingReally, the only reason I can even fathom someone not wanting to see this is because you'd have to read subtitles. Other than that, the movie is quite good to me. Wadjda's story gives a lot of perspective on what a young girl's life in Saudi Arabia maybe, though is may also apply; seeing her mother's story I felt was a taste of how adult women had to deal with things in Saudi Arabia, and I'd argue her mother's story could be a movie of itself; as for the characters at Wadjda's school, while only Ms. Hussa is really given any type of meat to her role, she does represent an enforcement of the status quo, and with her mentioning how she was like Wadjda, you realize there is a multitude of reasons she could have gone to a spunky kid like Wadjda to this stern woman she seems to be. And all together, it really makes for a good way to spend an hour and a half, which is why I think it is worth seeing."}, {"id": 118, "text": "This is a gentle and perceptive movie about the growing perception of the 11 year old lead character that things are not as they seem. Saudi culture is clearly changing and the girls at the school where Wadjda goes are all under the thumb of the local culture.Wadjda wants and bike and that task becomes a symbol for here journey. She enters a competition where the prize is 1000 riyal and that will pay for the bike.The competition doesn't work out quite as planned. As her mum explains ( with the insight of adults) what Wadjda needs to understand is that she shouldn't have let the school principal know that she really only did the competition to get herself a bike.That is - the culture of Saudi is changing and there are ways to work around most of the restrictions but it is best not to confront those rules head on. There are also big changes in the family setup to work through.A wonderful movie and I hope my daughter will get to see it soon."}, {"id": 119, "text": "The movie is about Wadjda - a nimble, brave and funny little girl. The narration starts with girls, dressed all black, singing about their faith and God. And black is the only color women may wear in public. Not wearing a headscarf is considered to be offensive. According to the Salafi scholars, women should cover their bodies entirely, so that no men can see them, thus, all the woman in Saudi Arabia (at least in the movie) wear hijabs. Hijabs are represented as not comfortable: women heading to their jobs covered their faces entirely, that probably prevented from proper breathing, since it was hot outside. For those women, commuting cost takes on a new form. Sometimes the girls closed their faces entirely with a solid piece of clothing (even their eyes). And even the sneakers are called to be ugly shoes and must be replaced by regular black shoes. There is also a peer-pressure, as the girls do not tolerate deviant behavior as well. For instance, girls started being treated badly right after they were publicly accused for painting their nails: one of the girls did not even want to touch her dishonored friend. So, the dressing code is very strict. Apart from dressing rules there are also other social norms regarding women's behavior. A woman (presumably a teacher) forbade the girls to laugh, motivating this with the fact that women's voices must not be heard by men outside. Respectable girls should not be seen by men as well (girls were to blame that men see them). Working alongside the men is forbidden also. Actually, no interaction with men is allowed. As far as I understood, there is the so-called Religious Police institute, that makes sure everyone behaves properly, in accordance with Sharia (Islamic law based on the Quran). Women should be seen with a man in public. Even a little girl walking with a little boy is not allowed. So, not to catch men's eyes is a woman's problem. Watching this movie gives a good clue on women's everyday struggles in Saudi Arabia. I was unpleasantly surprised (no, not like that, I was shocked) when a character, named Salma, who is probably 12-years old, got married. And her husband was 20-years old. Women's oppression is not limited by involuntary marriages. The struggle extends beyond that, women should fulfill their main duty - continuing husband's lineage (giving birth to boys), they could be abandoned otherwise. For example, Wadjda's mother should give birth to a boy to solve the family conflict. Otherwise, her husband will marry another woman (not the other, but the second one), which he actually did at the end. But she gave birth to Wadjda, is not that enough? It is not. There was a dramatic moment emphasizing baby-girls' role in the lineage, when Wadjda put her name on a sticker, and stuck it on the family tree of her father (she was not supposed to be there, obviously). The main actress excellently played her role, showing not only sadness, but also Wadjda's spirit, her strength and tenacity. I was impressed by how smart and enterprising Wadjda is. Take at least her dealings with the bike seller into account, and the services she provided for money, selling bracelets, all to buy a bicycle. The bike, by the way, might be a metaphor: a right to use transport by yourself as an embodiment of freedom and equality, which she aspires so much, but can neither ride a bike, nor at least buy it. Girls are not supposed to ride a bike. Once her mother even says: You will not be able to have children if you ride (a bike). But giving up is not about Wadjda. She thoroughly prepared for the competition to win a cash prize. This school competition to demonstrate your religious knowledge: background to God's revelation in the verses and the recitation part. Wadjda eventually won that competition, but nobody gave her the money (probably because she was willing to spend that money on bike, or maybe nobody was going to give her the money in anyway). This way or another, she managed to get her desired bike. Wadjda's mother bought it for her, and this scene melted my heart. In general, the movie raises many social issues and struggles that women face in a country like Saudi Arabia, with strict religious rules, and fundamental gender discrimination. Women's representation is ambiguous. At one side there is Wadjda's mother, who is busy with cooking, cleaning, gossiping on the phone, caring only about how to regain her husband's attention. On the other, there is the mother's friend - Leila, who works in the hospital. Once, she was working with her face uncovered, and she even greeted a man. That actually shocked Wadjda's mother, and she considered that behavior improper. In some sources the genre of the movie is said to have several comedy elements. Of course, I appreciated the ironical joke told by the little boy (Wadjda's friends). The boy's relative supposedly blew himself up, which is okay since he then should get 70 chicks in the heaven for that. That was both funny and scary. Apart from that, nothing was funny about the movie. Actually, I find it a tragedy. This feature film made a strong impression on me. The main cast was a little girl, and the movie director was a woman. Bravo! I appreciated that a lot. A great deal of attention was paid on people's feelings and everyday struggles. Not on the politics, economics, and war, but people's lives, dreams, problems and hopes. As for the movie picture, it was beautifully filmed, it could convey the atmosphere through colorful views of the surrounding. The whole movie was in native language with English subtitles, this is great, since you can witness the emotions properly. I would definitely recommend watching this movie. Not only could you get acquainted with the cultural aspects of Arabian women, but also get a dose of motivation from that brave ambitious little girl."}, {"id": 120, "text": "This movie completely questioned our islamic life style which u can't ignore at all.

I felt that, the Director and others were trying question our religion. I saw the production team, they all are non muslim. Then i got it clear, they made it to mock our religion.

Story about the little girl attending the harsh medressa is equally horrifying and entertaining. Main merits for that go to the young Waad Mohammed that plays charismatic Wadjda and all of her charms and wits on the big screen.Script and camera belong to the first female cinematographer in Saudi Arabia, Haifaa Al-Mansour, which is a big milestone itself. Production mainly originates from abroad, which was clearly a must when it comes to seeing the light of the day for Wadjda makers.Wadjda has my warm recommendation for the true quality family drama in every sense of the word."}, {"id": 122, "text": "Being a Saudi girl myself I didn't know what to expect, but honestly it was quiet good.

That kind of thing only happens in this side of the world.I really believe that the story portrayed everything well and fair, there were a lot of good laughs.

Regardless what one thinks of that country, be that knowledge or just stereotyping, it has a culture that is very different than that of what the western audience is accustomed to.So he have a heroine who is your typical rebel teenage girl, who has realised that being a woman can be challenging and she therefore must give her fight to survive. The story revolves around an utterly sinful desire this young revolver has: to buy and ride a bicycle. To go about that, she must overcome her mum's objections, the shopkeeper's and pretty much everyone she is acquainted with.Unprepared to simply accept fate, she is prepared to do whatever it takes to ride that bicycle. Quirky and witty, this is a delight and one should not allow any preconceived notions of Arabic culture to stand in the way of enjoying this pleasurable debut.Wadjda is a hero in any culture."}, {"id": 124, "text": "The director Haifaa Al-Mansour tells the tale of a child called Wadjda whose wish is to have her own bicycle so that she might race against her friend and neighbour Abeer. The only problem is that Wadjda is a girl and girls in Saudi society do not ride bikes, which are considered boys' toys ... As we follow Wadjda in her quest to find the money to purchase the bicycle she sees being delivered on the roof of a van, we are introduced to her society and its culture and, in particular, its treatment of girls and women. Al-Mansour's portrayal of her country is shown without heavy judgement, although the bitter sweetness of being female is not concealed.Filmed on location in Saudi Arabia, a feat in itself in a country that does not have a film industry as films are considered sinful, Wadjda's desire represents the wish for female freedom; her lack of a bicycle is mirrored in the adult women's inability to drive, prohibited for women in Saudi Arabia, and the problems this creates for them. So the child's desire to ride a bike becomes a metaphor for freedom, which is the central theme in the film. This is a subtle tale full of character, charm and complexities and not at all as one might expect. The young girl who carries the film, Waad Mohammed, is terrific and it is hard to believe that she was not an actress before appearing in this feature.Does Wadjda achieve her desire and get her bike? Is she able to race it along the dusty roads as free as her friend Abeer and the other boys? Well, you will have to watch the film for the answers and in watching the film will support the director and the nascent film industry emerging from within Saudi Arabia."}, {"id": 125, "text": "\u00a8You won't be able to have children if you ride a bike.\u00a8Wadjda is a beautiful yet simple film about a young girl who is willing to break society's boundaries and traditions in order to achieve her goal. In a sense it plays out as a metaphor considering Wadjda is the first feature film from Saudi Arabia which happens to be directed by a female. In a culture where women aren't allowed to speak up to men or even to drive a vehicle, Haifaa Al-Mansour has found a way to share her voice with the world through cinema. That is groundbreaking on its own considering that Saudi Arabia doesn't even have a film industry and that women are very much tied up to the limitations that their society puts on them. Al- Mansour, who also wrote the screenplay, gets her message across in a simple manner without trying to be judgmental or harsh on her culture. It is through the eyes of this 10 year old girl that we see how difficult the culture is on women. Not being allowed to ride a bike for fear that she could lose her virtue and purity plays out as a metaphor as to the limitations females face in these countries. I'm pretty sure that we all agree with Al-Mansour's viewpoints here in the west, but it is a shame that this film won't be seen by the people who really should see this film, the Saudis. It may be a familiar tale to us (it has all the known elements of a classic underdog story), but it works thanks to a wonderful performance from the young Waad Mohammed who plays a character we all can identify and relate to. Wadjda is worth seeing for the historical significance it has for females in Islamic countries who are trying to get their voice heard.Wadjda (Waad Mohammed) is a ten year old girl from Saudi Arabia who lives with her mother (Reem Abdullah) in Riyadh. She's from a very conservative society where women have to cover their hair around men, but she is a very lovable girl who's always pushing the boundaries to her limitations. When one of the boys (Abdullrahman Al Gohani) begins teasing her and outruns her on his bike, she promises that she will buy one to race him and beat him. She sees a beautiful green bike on sale and since her mother doesn't give her the money because she considers girls shouldn't ride bikes, Wadjda decides to raise the money herself. The perfect opportunity presents itself when director Ms. Hussa (Ahd) offers prize money for the winner of a Koran recitation competition at her school. Wadjda begins to dedicate her time and efforts to this competition, while her mother is worried about trying to convince her husband (Sultan Al Assaf) to stay with her and not get remarried. Wadjda is dedicated to achieving her goal despite the limitations presented by the people around her.The young and talented Waad Mohammed stands out in this film with a heartfelt and lovable performance. It is a simple tale and one we've seen many times in the past with the exception that this film is told by someone who has been facing those very same limitations. Some universal themes about the human spirit and the power of the will are portrayed nicely in this film through the eyes and smile of Waad Mohammaed. Director, Al-Mansour, also gives us glimpses of the limitations women have to face through very small scenes and moments. There is a scene where Wadjda's mother is shopping for a dress and she tries on a beautiful red one and you can't help but wonder what a waste it is considering she can only wear it at home for her husband. She covers herself completely when there is a man around. She also spends so much time fixing her hair, only to cover it until her husband who sometimes doesn't show up in days can appreciate it. Al-Mansour presents these scenes without being judgmental, but they come through very well. Wadjda, like us, doesn't seem to understand all this and won't conform to those boundaries, which is the director's way of sharing her hope for a brighter future for these women. Maybe if there were more determined girls like Wadjda they could break through some of those boundaries and limitations and have some more freedom. The film is full of hope like the main character and it is one worth seeing."}, {"id": 126, "text": "The total lack of films that come out of Saudi Arabia made Wadjda, a Saudi film by Haiffa Al- Mansour, instantly alluring. Haiffa Al-Mansour is already accredited as being the first successful woman filmmaker in Saudi Arabia's history.This is very much Al- Mansour's film. She charms the viewer with the common everyday struggles of the Saudi woman, and rather than address the issues in a combative way, her approach is warm, even cute. This draws us in to her characters and provides us with some heartfelt laughs along the way.The precocious 10-year Wadjda is growing up in Riyadh where she wants nothing more than a shiny new bicycle, but not only is she a little short on riyals, in Saudi Arabia women do not to ride bicycles. Saudi moral code bans woman from driving, going out in public unveiled, living unaccompanied, leaving the country alone, and opposing their husbands' orders in any way.Small details make grand impressions: In an all girls school teenage students paint their toenails, a sin, and are publicly vilified for it. The mere possibly that workmen half a mile away might see school girls playing in their courtyard forces all the girls to rush inside, lest they be judged impure. Pubescent girls are considered impure and must use a tissue just flip the pages of Koran.Wadjad's truly beautiful mother spends much of her time perfecting her appearance only then to have to then cover herself with a full hijab. She is never openly defiant; defiance is impossible, but even thought she is obeying age old traditions that we'd assume would have dulled any emotional protest, through the mother's submission we get a brief glimpse of her distress, the natural human emotional distress that no amount of aged tradition or religious subjugation has the right to inflict on any human being. In a country where cinemas are banned, Riyadh is not exactly a city where women can just go around shooting films. Females mixing with male co-workers would bring dire consequences. Al-Mansour shot the film anyway, directing much of it from the back of a van, and the result is a film representing the triumph of the defiant feminine spirit, in all forms.For more film reviews visit getthebonesaw.blogspot.com"}, {"id": 127, "text": "WADJDA is a straightforward tale of a young girl Wadjda (Waad Mohammed) growing up in a suburb of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who wants to buy a bicycle. Unable to find the money to do so, she enters a competition to speak the Koran in public with a substantial cash prize. After considerable time spent studying the text, she wins the competition, but sadly doesn't receive the money. In the end, however, she achieves her dreams - but not in the way she expects. Haifaa Al-Mansour's film is noteworthy for being a woman's film directed by a woman; it shows in careful detail the ways in which women's lives are constructed in Saudi Arabia, as well as showing how influential the Koran is in determining people's behavior. Some viewers might think that the women's lives are unfairly restricted; the film suggests that this is what many women believe is the right thing to do. By doing so, WADJDA shows how different people embraces different concepts of Islam. On the other hand, the film also suggests that individuals - especially children - should have at least some means to express themselves, particularly when they have worked to hard to achieve their aims. To restrict them is also to repress them; and this ultimately leads them to accept subordination as a way of life. WADJDA proves that the opposite should be true; not only for Wadjda herself but also for her mother (Reem Abdullah)."}, {"id": 128, "text": "In a land where where cinemas are illegal, the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia by its first female director, 'Wadjda' is simple yet alluring neorealist film about a child and a bicycle. Haifaa Al-Mansour's brave effort gives us an interesting glimpse into the lives of women in a strict religious country like Saudi Arabia.Being scolded for not wearing a head-scarf to school and for singing when her father's friends are in the other room (women unable to show themselves or their talents in presence of men), being sexually harassed by a building site worker, seeing her mother sad and angry because her dad is about to marry another woman (desperation for a male heir and the existence of polygamy), her mother almost losing her job because of her dependence on a rude driver (women are not allowed to drive any kind of transport), seeing one of her classmates getting married (rare but existent child marriages), seeing two elder schoolmates get wrongfully accused of immoral intimate conduct, and feeling disappointed after not seeing her name in the family tree (only male children are given importance); these are just few of the female struggles we see through the eyes of our young tomboy heroine, Wadjda. From the very first scene where she stands out in a group of singing school girls with her converse shoes, we see Wadjda as someone rebellious and strong. In a repressive land where women are oppressed, based on strict religious laws, not only by men but by other women as well, Wadjda dreams of having a green bicycle, so that she could overtake her annoying yet caring friend Abdullah. Though girls are not allowed to ride bikes, she starts collecting money by selling love-song mixed tapes and football club bracelets to her schoolmates. And thus begins her journey. Just like 'The Bicycle Thief', the bicycle here signifies freedom.The young yet incredibly talented Waad Mohammed gives a charming performance, and carries the movie on her shoulders with terrific ease. Waad along with Haifaa (Director) are the two brave talents that emerge from this feature. All the supporting actors act commendably as well. International composer Max Richter's background score is subtle yet as captivating as the movie itself. Shot with such authentic beauty, there are many scenes which stay in your mind long after the movie is over, one of which is where the young friend Abdullah asks Wadjda, in an adorably sweet way, if she knows that he wants to marry her when they grow up; the scene has a lot of meaning and hope attached to it.It's not just a critique on Saudi society, but it's a universal story which talks about a society's limitations and possibilities."}, {"id": 129, "text": "Wadjda is a school girl who has a dream of driving a bike, which is mostly considered to be a boys' thing in her community.

Starting from zero and despite all complications, she beats every school girl.This movie is about many many things. But mostly how big a dream can come and how those inhuman traditions shape persons, narrow their minds and how some of them still are sparkle of light in darkness. Plot mostly concentrates on Wadjda, but it still exposes bad habits and traditions of Arabian society - problems in family, outside family and at schools. But those supporting stories are quietly playing behind this little girl's strive for dreams. Wadjda is a quiet type movie. It does not have big emotional culminations or some plot twists. It goes very slowly from the beginning to the end as pale as landscapes of Saudi Arabia. However it's still good movie to watch - its simplicity, clarity and sincerity makes quite enjoyable film experience. Unlike most movies produced in Islam countries, Wadjda does not bring any criticism of religion or traditions or anything else. It just tells a story leaving everything open to judgement.For the record, director Haifaa Al-Mansour is a first female director in Saudi Arabian and is considered one of the most prolific movie makers in the Kingdom. She truly did a great job illustrating Arabic reality in a very small and personal story of young girl. Haifaa also wrote story herself. Screenplay is quite good, without any major plot holes or fails.Oscar chances? Pretty good for many reasons. First of all, it's a good cinematic piece. Secondly, it's directed by a woman from Islamic country. Third, it's is first submission by Saudi Arabia. Fourth, it is quite charming and easy to understand story, which can reach to very bottom of every hart. And finally, it gets quite successful PR company by producers and director herself.

In short, WADJDA represents quite a number of firsts. It's the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, a country where cinema is prohibited. Writer and director Haifaa Al Mansour is Saudi Arabia's first female filmmaker. It is also the first submission from Saudi Arabia for the Foreign Language Category for the 2014 Academy Awards. Set in a country known for its repression of women, the movie follows our title character\u2014a 10-year-old spirited girl\u2014in her journey to buy a new bicycle so she can race her best friend, neighbor and crush Abdullah. Even though Wadjda's mother warns her to stay away from both bikes and boys because of their culture's strict customs, Wadjda is determined to buy her bike with her own hard-earned money, no matter what the consequences. This, in turn, leads to joining a Koran competition at school. If she wins, she will have more than enough to buy a bike and therefore beat the boy next door.Subtly, the film explores the repercussions from this society in which girls should only be seen, not heard and, in public, only their eyes should be seen, with the rest of their faces covered by black veils. Wadjda tests boundaries in her search for freedom of expression. Although she discovers the contradictions in her world, she's determined to challenge women's traditional roles. The movie covers major topics such as polygamy and child-brides, as well as smaller oppressions such as the restriction of driving and rules of women in the presence of men. It's mind-blowing to me that a movie about the oppression of women was made in the exact environment it depicts. On DVD, the making-of featurette explores in-depth the struggles and challenges that faced director Haifaa Al Mansour. The line, respectable girls go inside, is said to Wadjda in the film, and Mansour confronted the same problems. She had to direct her cast out-of-sight using a walkie-talkie to communicate with her cast and a monitor to watch the filming. She could not be seen working with men and often, when religious officials would come to inspect the bustle, production would be halted and moved to another location. It took close to five years to make the movie, but the effort is worth it. First timer Waad Mohammed is perfect as the fun-loving rebel Wadjda. This film is rated PG and I recommend it for ages 10 to 18. The pace may be slow for kids under ten. This is truly a landmark film that the world needs to watch. I give it five out of five stars. Perhaps the most uplifting message is that although the plot is fiction, the remarkable story behind the movie is not, and that shows that revolution is possible. This film played in theaters last year and will be released on February 11 on DVD/Blu-ray.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST Film Critic Cassandra H.

Women may now ride bicycles, can sit on the national advisory council, and a decision has been made by King Abdullah permitting women to vote and run in municipal elections in 2015. Regardless, it still takes a great deal of courage in Saudi Arabia to stand up to centuries of repressive traditions and assert your full rights as a human being.Wadjda, funded by European companies and backed by the Sundance Institute, is the first film to be directed by a Saudi woman, Haifaa Al-Mansour, and the first to be shot inside Saudi Arabia. In addition to being genuine and heartwarming, the film is a powerful indictment of the gender inequality that Saudi women face in their lives. For a ten-year-old child with intelligence and an independent streak to be compelled to follow strict religious laws while attending school is quite a challenge. In a sparkling performance by Waad Mohammed, Wadjda is a rebel from the outset. She wears sneakers and shoelace bracelets to school, sells friendship bracelets to her classmates, listens to Western pop music on the radio, and wears baseball boots, much to the chagrin of Ms. Hussa (Ahd), the school's overbearing principal.She constantly admonishes Wadjda for not complying with restrictions such as completely covering your face and not being seen in the company of men unless they are a part of your family. Fortunately, Wadjda has a great relationship with her mother (Reem Abdullah) and they treat each other with humor and mutual respect, yet there is tension, mainly created by her father (Sultan Al Assaf) who is in and out of the home, looking for a second wife who can bear him a son. The girl has become friends with Abdullah (Abdullrahman Al Gohani), the next door neighbor of about the same age, who rides a bike and playfully challenges her to beat him in a race.Their relationship is very sweet and very natural without straining for cuteness and their smiles are enough to put even the grimmest viewer in a good mood. Wadjda is also full of surprises. When she expresses a wish to compete in the annual Koran contest, her authoritarian teacher who is ready to expel students for all kinds of harmless interactions is taken aback. Of course, Wadjda's reason for entering the contest is to win enough money to purchase the green bike she has her eyes on and which the local store owner is holding for her. Though girls riding bikes are frowned upon because of the absurd claim that it will keep them from having children, to Wadjda, it is a symbol of her independence from social and religious strictures. Her quest to save money to buy the bike using every street smart she can think of shows the strength and quiet determination of her character. Though there are many outstanding performances including Reem Abdullah as Wadjda's reassuring and sympathetic mother, Waad Mohammed's dramatization of the plucky ten-year-old with the broad smile helps make Wadjda one of the best films of the year. Unfortunately, since there are no cinemas in Saudi Arabia, it is doubtful whether Saudi's will ever be able to see it."}, {"id": 132, "text": "Wadjda is the first film made in Saudi Arabia, a country where cinema theaters are banned. And is directed by a woman (Haifaa al Mansour), no less, and has a quasi feminist theme as well. The simple plot centers around Wadjda (played by Waad Mohammed), a rowdy girl, about 11 years old, living in Riyad who dreams of owning a bicycle (in Saudi Arabia, the movie tells us, girls riding bicycles are frowned upon). In order to buy a bicycle, she enters a contest in her girls-only school for recitation of the Koran with a cash prize, despite the misgivings of the harsh, stern headmistress (played by an actress called simply Ahd, in perhaps the best performance of the film).The movie reminds me of some Iranian films of the past that also are centered on children (for example, Abbas Kiarostami's early films or Majid Majidi Pedar and Children of Heaven). I suppose directors from conservative countries like Iran or Saudi Arabia chose movies centered on children's since films dealing with adult themes would surely hit censorship issues. Perhaps the movie has more social interest than cinematic interest (though it is well filmed). It is fascinating to see the contrast between the relatively affluent society (Wadja's house has all the latest gadgets) and the very conservative traditions of the country (at one point, for example, the mother of Wadjda is afraid that her husband will take a second wife, as it is allowed there). Or we see one of the girls in the school, of Wadjda's age, showing the photos of her marriage to an older man. And once when Wadjda falls from a bicycle and draws blood, her mother is at first afraid her hymen has broken \u2013 virginity in women is extremely valued in Saudi Arabia. A very interesting movie to watch, especially since life in Saudi Arabia is very seldom shown in movies."}, {"id": 133, "text": "It is quite hard to come to Wadjda with a clear head and I suspect with the awards season coming up, it will be harder to do so in the future, which is why I wanted to watch it now. Part of the reason for this is that the film has had quite a bit of publicity due to its place in history, it being the first film in Saudi Arabia directed by a woman and this made me think that perhaps critics would have been quick to be generous to it. For sure I think this is a factor and the context of it representing (in theory) a country moving towards ever so slightly less hard-line conservatism may also be a factor in awards voting; but my concern was that this mean weaknesses were forgiven and stronger aspects were hyped up. The second thing in my mind was that perhaps Wadja would be very critical of Saudi as it may be seen as time to settle some scores and that this would be less a film and more a finger wagging exercise.The reality is that neither of these are really the case and indeed the main strength of Wadjda is that it is simply a coming-of-age story which is set in Saudi Arabia. This means that the film doesn't push an agenda in a very heavy handed and frequent way, but rather just uses the culture of its setting as part of its story, just like any other such film would do in the context of their country. I liked this a lot because very quickly I was able to settle in and just enjoy the film for its character and story. And it helps that the story is engaging, warm and quite cheering in some ways; Wadjda is a sweet heart to the film and is very well played indeed by Waad Mohammed and she plays very well with her simple goal of just wanting to be herself and not be restricted by others \u2013 again a theme that maybe has more significant in her context, but still one common to these types of films. The film plays his out well with other threads and challenges to others around her which resonate with the impact of restrictions but again not in a heavy-handed or really obvious way.It is a fine line to walk but the film does manage to flag issues for discussion but not to do so in a way that is overly critical or unrealistic even if it is progressive; perhaps to use the right language it is a very subdued and modest criticism and it is never front and centre on the screen. The balance means that it will engage you with the simple structure of its story while also making its points with things shown to inform and characters within the story used to illustrate different aspects of choices to be made \u2013 whether it be Wadjda's refusal to be restrained or Ms Hussa's overcompensation for not doing the same herself. It is very well shot and directed \u2013 and not considering the circumstances, but rather it just is. The use of locations is really good, giving the film a strong sense of play and I do hope someday there is a making of documentary as I think the daily reality of making this must itself be an interesting story.Wadjda is a very good film even if I think a lot of the hype and gushing that will come during the awards season is as much about the context as it is about the film itself \u2013 although this is not a bad thing by any means. The makers walk a fine line really well \u2013 not making direct criticisms so much as telling an engaging and warm story out of which comes the obvious criticisms and discussions which could be had. It does this very well and deserves to be seen as a film as well as a statement."}, {"id": 134, "text": "The Middle East is such a hot topic, but so little of the conversation is generated by natives that it's almost impossible to have any sort of dialog. On the one hand, we get the western phobia of Islam which includes hateful stories on the people/governments of Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Afghanistan. On the other hand, we get the defensive responses of the governments/peoples of those countries who hate to have their countries painted in such broad strokes. This is exactly why a movie like this is so important! For once, we're presented with a perspective that looks at the issues with introspection. It might not the perfect description of life in Saudi for a woman, but it's a start and it brings up important points.I'll start with the fact that the cinematography and acting are excellent. Those who might expect a B-movie production from a Saudi filmmaker making her first movie will be more than pleasantly surprised. The script is well written, the actors play their roles fantastically and the movie is well edited. As far as plot, the movie is seemingly about a girl whose goal is to acquire a bike and the obstacles she needs to overcome to do so. On the surface, this might seem like a really simplistic plot but the way the story is told makes in much different than the normal protagonist overcomes difficulty story. And in fact, as it soon becomes apparent, the story isn't even really about the bike at all, but a chance to give context to the lives of women.And thought I might have already raved about the technical aspects and how the story is told, in reality the #1 reason you should see this movies is because of the questions it raises. In the movie, we are confronted with important issues about the role of women is Saudi society and the different nuances of life. There is just the right balance of things that are told to us directly and what we must infer. To westerners, it might be one the first times we get this perspective. To Saudis and proponents of Islamic law, it's a chance to begin a discussion about the role of women in Saudi society. Regardless of where you stand, this movie is an opportunity to start the education process and the discussion on the topics at hand."}, {"id": 135, "text": "Wadjda is 10. She wants to buy herself a bicycle so she can win a grudge race against a neighborhood boy, but has to find a way to hustle the money while going to a Saudi religious school that takes a dim view of fun and games. There's your problem right there, as they say on the Internet.A movie is truly exciting when it shows you something you've never seen before. You'd think this would most often be sci-fi, but it isn't, because they use the same grey metal corridor all the time, in everything. Wadjda is, because it reveals a world that almost nobody gets to see even if they want to - and a very large number of Americans won't look at even if you show it to them, because they're scared of catching stealth jihad.This is hilarious, because the hard cases who run Saudi Arabia - like Wadjda's head-mistress - ban bracelets, magazines and tapes of love songs for fear that any exposure to those things will infect their students with whorish Western culture. Either one side overestimates the power of the other's influence, or both do, or perhaps the two sides would flip and trade places, with Riyadh turning into Miami on spring break and Burning Man banning women from pedaling their own concept tricycles.The latter probably won't happen, so if you're not afraid of Islam cooties, watch this movie and you will find an extraordinary treat for the curious. It shows Saudi women in their domestic lives, before and after they put on the space suit to head out. It shows how the gender-based class system works in general, while drawing characters who began to feel like my relatives after half an hour. Wadjda was my kick-ass little niece, and her mom was my sister-in-law, and I wished there was a way for me to call them up and say something encouraging. I wished there was a way to send them stuff - I'd give Wadjda an iPod full of Pink Floyd and death metal, and I would give her mom the robot taxi from Total Recall, the one that looks like there's a man driving it.This movie passes the Bechdel test summa cum laude, as one might expect; its sensitivity and realism means that technically (since this is the first movie ever to be shot entirely in that country), the Saudi Arabian film industry now has a better average track record with female characters than Hollywood does. The relationship between Wadjda and her mom involves some yelling, but is sweet and wonderful through and through.The movie never criticizes the social regime of its country, but it doesn't have to - even played completely straight, it looks horrendous. This is the most sexist society on earth, and Wadjda's school is like an alien experiment run by creatures that hate joy in all forms.Wadjda itself, however, is pure joy. It works on every level - as drama, slice of life, children's movie, movie about children &amp; an insider look at Saudi Arabia. It's an awesome movie."}, {"id": 136, "text": "A fantastic little film directed by a woman in Saudi Arabia. That's astounding considering that women are pretty much not allowed to do anything there. Al-Mansour had to direct her cast from inside a van, because she couldn't direct the male crew out in the open. It's also astounding because Saudi Arabia has almost zero history in the art of cinema. It's shocking how well made this film is. Of course, the subject is the existence of women in the country. Waad Mohammed stars as 12 year old Wadjda, a wily young girl who does not like her lot in life. In particular, she wants to ride a bicycle, which is a huge taboo in Saudi Arabia (they're afraid it might break her hymen). Her mother (Reem Abdullah) is going through her own problems. After she had Wadjda, she can no longer have children, and her husband is trying to land a second wife so he can produce a male heir. Wadjda's attitude gets her in plenty of trouble at school, with headmistress Ahd (that's the actress' name, just Ahd) disapproving of every little thing she does. It sounds like the film is as oppressive as Saudi Arabian society, but it's actually quite joyous. Mohammed is so insanely lovable. I was hugely touched by the film."}, {"id": 137, "text": "Beyond being a well told, charming and ultimately touching film, this tale of a young girl trying to find a place for herself amidst the sexist rules of Saudi Arabia is noteworthy for a number of things, chief among them that it's the first film shot completely in Saudi Arabia and the first Saudi feature ever made by a woman director, who had to hide in a van and direct by walkie-talkie for a number of scenes. (Movie theaters themselves are outlawed in the country).The story is largely a familiar underdog tale, and the pace can be too leisurely at times, but the specifics that surround the main character \u2013 her mother's emotional struggle with the possibility her husband may take a second wife against her wishes, the absurd danger of a pre-adolescent girl simply having a boy pal, the constant teaching that women shouldn't even be heard by men, help the film feel more unique and disturbing than all the western equivalent. outcast kid joins contest to prove their worth films we've seen. Indeed, even the contest here is loaded with complexity. Wadjda isn't particularly religious, but the contest is about a verbal recitation of sections of the Koran, so she takes it on as a means to an end (money to buy a bike she wants \u2013 another thing girls aren't supposed to have), not as expression of piety.If not quite as powerful as some films about repression, it's certainly a worthy and well acted one, and a brave leap for a film-maker whose greatest triumph may have been getting the film made at all."}, {"id": 138, "text": "A cinema from the very nation where cinema itself is banned, Wadjda tries to portray the everyday struggle women undergo in the highly conservative nation of Saudi Arabia which restricts them from driving, going out unveiled, talk to men in public or disobeying their husbands, all captured in a very delicate manner by director, Haifaa al-Mansour, the country's first female filmmaker.Set in Riyadh &amp; shot entirely on location, Wadjda tells the story of an 11-year old girl who wants a bicycle for herself but is denied by her mother as girls riding bikes is considered immoral and who herself is distracted because her husband wants to marry again so that his new wife can provide him with a son. When the school Wadjda studies in decides to have a Quran recital competition, Wadjda sees it as an opportunity to raise the fund she needs to buy the bicycle &amp; use this religious method to get what its society considers a taboo.Wonderfully written &amp; directed by Haifaa al-Mansour, steadily photographed, firmly edited &amp; outstandingly performed (especially from the first time actress, Waad Mohammed, as the title character), Wadjda manages to make its voice heard loud &amp; clear in spite of maintaining a light tone throughout its runtime and on an overall scale, is a welcome effort from the filmmaker who dares to challenge the nation's unfair moral codes against women and in the end, wraps itself up by delivering a strong emotional punch with its bittersweet ending. Don't miss it."}, {"id": 139, "text": "The title character is an 11-year old girl living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Her adventurous spirit causes trouble living in such a repressive environment, particularly for girls.I compared this film to The Circle, an Iranian film in 2000 which also chronicled the difficult lives for females in another repressive regime. The Circle was dramatic and tragic. Wadjda has a good share of drama but it also has a special lightness. Its characters seem to be able to find ways of having fun within their restrictions.Occasionally, a side story about Wadjda's mother is confusing. The film also misses a few opportunities for other expanded side stories. One involves a religiously fanatical school official who does not seem to practice what she preaches. (Isn't that always the case?). Another involves a very amiable relative who seems to break barriers by working in an environment along with men despite the controversy this causes.But the main draw in this film is the very charming performance of young actress Waad Mohammed.

There are no villains, but true to real life, just people in different circumstances. That's what I'll take away from this movie.The characters are very pleasant and are well portrayed so you can empathize with their issues. This was a pleasant change from having issues presented like an agenda on most media outlets.My only gripe with the movie is that the characters don't develop too much. Where they are at the end is not far off from what we began with. In that sense it is more like a short story than a novel.The acting is top-notch and although the story isn't quick, it definitely doesn't drag. I would love to see a sequel if they decide to make one, it just seems a bit... incomplete.I'd recommend you watch this if you like movies like Before Sunrise - movies rooted in life and the pace of daily life - over action flicks."}, {"id": 141, "text": "Wadjda is a film written and directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour. What makes this very unusual is that this is the first full-length movie made in Saudi Arabia AND Haifaa is a woman. Apparently, she got approval from the powers that be and my daughter read that she went to extraordinary lengths to get the film made. For example, she was not able to talk directly to some of the crew since they were men and she reportedly needed to communicate with them by phone. My assumption is that Wajdja is a film that illustrates, in a gentle way, the difficulties Haifaa has experienced in her native land. The film manages to address difficulties and sexism that women face due to the culture\u2014but in a gentle manner that was still allowable within their society.Wadjda is a young girl (about 10) and she isn't quite like other girls. By Saudi standards, she is a bit of a tom-boy and her greatest desire in life is to get a bicycle\u2014although she is repeatedly told that girls do NOT ride bicycles! So, she devises a plan to buy her own bike. But, being a kid, she obviously cannot afford it and takes to making money through odd jobs. However, when she learns about a Koran scholarship competition, Wadjda sees this as a chance to earn a lot of money. And, this spunky kid works very, very hard. What's going to happen? See the film.I enjoyed this film on two entirely different levels. On one hand, she's a cute kid and you really are pulling for her. Her story captures your heart.

Both have been denied to her because the poorly educated conservatives of the world whether Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindi or Buddhist see such independence and freedom as a threat to their beliefs and control. Also woven within those religions is protection from the threat males feel because they are too lazy to take responsibility for controlling their libido. Historically the easiest way to control such threats is through containment from burqa to foot binding or simply murder such as seen happening to women who speak in Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Wadjda is listening to her own heart when she says, Catch me if you can! as she rides off with that smile of freedom on her face.

Well, it got made, and it's something that everyone should see.The title character is a ten-year-old girl in Riyadh. She hopes to buy a bicycle but that will be no easy task in a country where women and girls are supposed to stay home. So, Wadjda decides to take a Koran recital class in the hope of winning enough money to buy the bike.This is a minimalist movie. There's no high action or pulse-pounding score. Most of it focuses on Wadjda and her day-to-day existence as she navigates a patriarchal society. A key reminder of Saudi Arabia's status quo is the taxi driver (I think that he's Pakistani). The kingdom has large numbers of guest workers from across the Muslim world, and you can bet money that they have no rights once they arrive in Saudi Arabia.All in all, the movie makes Saudi Arabia look like a grim place to live. Since the release, the kingdom has started allowing movies to get shown (the first ever was Black Panther). It appears that al-Mansour has directed some movies since this one, so I'll be eager to see them. In the meantime, definitely see this one."}, {"id": 145, "text": "Wadjda is an important film in world cinema, being the first film from Saudi Arabia to be directed by a woman and one of the first to gain international recognition but while you're watching it, it doesn't feel 'important' at all but just hugely charming and you think that maybe its importance simply lies in it being one of the great films about childhood. The title character is a young girl living in Riyadh who dreams of owning her own bicycle even if girls are not really permitted to ride bicycles. When she sees a beautiful bike in a shop she decides to do what she can to get the money to buy it.Haifaa Al-Monsour's film is certainly radical coming, as it does, from a culture where women and girls are treated very differently from other parts of the world but it is so open and funny and with such a wonderful performance from Waad Mohammad as Wadjda, (it's one of the great child performances), that you never think of it being radical. Indeed, if it tells us anything it's that people are the same the world over, especially children. Yes, in the overall scheme of things Wadjda is important but it is, above all, hugely enjoyable."}, {"id": 146, "text": "The film tells us about the story of a 10-year-old school girl living in Saudi Arabia. Her name is Wadjda. The main character of the film, Wadjda, is a girl, who is believed to be not suited to the traditions and beliefs in the country. Wadjda is always criticized for her behaviour and actions that are not typical for this kind of strictly religious country. It is obvious even from the start of the film that she is not similar to other girls of her age. The scene, where she is singing, can be taken as an example. She was not allowed to sing as her father's friends were at their home, and it can be assumed that girls need to be silent and be careful in what to say, especially when they are in the company of males.According to strict customs, all women, even from childhood, are supposed to obey particular rules and honor the traditions. In this case, the character of Wadjda is used as a metaphor of oppressed women. The parallel is given through the willingness of Wadjda to not only ride a bicycle, which is actually forbidden for ladies, but also to take a race with a neighbour boy knowing the fact that this is not allowed for girls ro communicate with males. The girl is like a symbol of rebellion against the unfairness towards women. As Wadjda obviously has no permission to have a bicycle, she tries to break the limitations by attempting to earn the money for a purchase. If we accept the fact that earning money is one more problem for women, especially for young girls, we see how ambitious Wadjda was in her plans to break the limitations the society and her family set on her desires. The perfect solution was to raise money through winning in the Quran competition , where the prize was given by money that is more than enough for Wadjda to buy a bicycle. Here we see the importance of the Quran, before this event Wadjda was not interested in reading the Quran. There are many more examples, where gender inequality takes place.Meanwhile, her mother is struggling to save their marriage with her husband, who is wanting to get married for the second time. The reason is that her mother did not bear a son, that is why he wants to have a second wife, who can give birth (a boy). She is doing her best to save the marriage. By this part of the film we see not only the oppression of Wadjda's mother, but also the unimportance of girls in comparison with boys. In order for a woman to be a valuable wife she needs to bear at least a son. So, only the birth of boys is counted as important. It is obvious that this issue touches the polygamy as it is normal in the country to have more than one wife. According to the the book written by Adeeb Khalid called Islam after Communism: Religion and Politics in Central Asia, we know that polygamy is not restricted by the shariat, even though it is illegal for some counties (148).The author argues that men get married second and even third times and this is done only through religious ceremonies (Khalid, 148). Even though polygamy is recognized as illegal, these marriages are socially accepted and is still experienced in many countries. In addition, the issue of marriages at young ages is also given in the firm. It is shown through the classmate of Wadjda getting married at the age of twelve. Even in the countries in Central Asia, where religious traditions are less strict, underage marriages are experienced (Khali, 75).As I have previously discussed, the film Wadjda touches many issues both social and religious. The center of the film is a girl, full of courage and bravery, who is standing against the rules the society dictates her. In my opinion, the film does not criticize Islam as a religion, bit disagrees with some aspects. The main attention is, of course, paid to the role of women in the society. It is mostly described by Wadjda and her mother. Women are allowed to wear what they want and behave the way they want only near their husbands, and Wadjda's mother experiences this, but her husband does not pay sufficient attention to this for the reason I have described above. As for Wadjda, she is like a light in the darkness, the drop of hope for better lives of women in the society. Moreover, the willingness to ride a bicycle is probably used as a metaphor for having freedom of choices. Even though there have been some changes in gender inequality issues during the last decade, most of the traditions are still present and the question of female rights is still open."}, {"id": 147, "text": "It turns out that in 2013 Saudi Arabian government finally allowed women to ride bicycles, with a condition that she is accompanied by a guardian and the place is not crowded with men. Considering this, it is interesting how in a country where even a woman riding a bicycle could have been banned, a female director managed to make a full length movie, one of the main ideas of which is the women's role in society. It seems like there is a hope that something can change in Saudi Arabian puritanical society in even if little but perceptible steps.One thing that doesn't seem to change is Islam. Islam is the concept that controls every aspect of life in Saudi Arabia. The legal system is based on Islamic law, Sharia, which is almost the only source of legacy there. Islam and Sharia decide what person must or must not wear, eat, study and even think. Haifaa al-Mansour in her Wadjda pans out to show the casual life of people, especially women, who live in a place full of taboos, restrictions and control. And the fact that this movie is the first feature-length film entirely shot in Saudi Arabia, which was directed by a woman makes it at least highly worth watching.The main character is Wadjda (Waad Mohammed), a little girl who wears sneakers with purple shoelaces instead of black school shoes and listens to pop music instead of studying verses from the Quran. She wants her mother to buy her a green bicycle and to finally outrun her friend, Abdullah (Abdullrahman Al Gohani). Her mother (Reem Abdullah) refuses to do so, because riding a bicycle is highly unacceptable in Saudi Arabian Wahhabi society. So Wadjda decides to earn money herself, and does so not as an act of protest, but because she doesn't understand why she can't have a bicycle like other boys. The movie explicitly shows that Wadjda doesn't oppose the religious norms, but she serves as a kind of prism, through which ordinary women's life is revealed. Life, where there are no fitting rooms for women in clothing stores, so that women need to try their clothes on in a restroom, life where women are not allowed to be heard by men, life where women are not allowed on a family tree, and ultimately life where women are in black and men are demonstratively in white (Muslim's traditional religious clothing).In such a highly Islamic puritanical traditional society Wadjda's mother is no exception. She is a typical woman from narratives: beautiful and sinless, loves her husband and throughout the movie does everything to keep him from the second wife. She drives three hour to the end of the world every day only because her husband is jealous and forbids her from working at a nearby hospital, because men work there. She wants to cut her hair, but she can't because her husband likes her long soft hair. She has understood the terms of the society she lives in long ago and just lives in compliance with her role as a woman, whose only mission is to obey men.It is indeed interesting what some people think of as a normal life, others can find completely and unexpectedly crazy. I never would have been able to imagine that riding a bike could be forbidden for me, so that I will feel ashamed while riding it on a street. However this is a reality for women in Saudi Arabia.Nonetheless, the purpose of Wadjda is not to summon for radical changes, but to entertainingly show that there is an opportunity for change and growth. Wadjda's endeavor to earn money by secretly selling handmade bracelets in school, where it is banned, and acting as an intermediary for elder students turns out to be not enough to buy a bicycle. So when an opportunity emerges to win the sufficient amount of money in a Quran competition, she decides to participate, even though she has shown no interest in religion and Quran before. Here Quran as an axial detail of the plot changes its role from being a limiter to becoming a liberator.Haifaa al-Mansour indeed has created an undoubtedly noteworthy piece of art. Not only did she manage to for the first time entirely shoot the feature-length film in Saudi Arabia, but she also managed to find a perfect balance between telling a beautiful story and inconspicuously appealing for social changes.Connoisseurs of art-house and festival movies would without doubt appreciate Wadjda, yet this film is a must-watch for anyone who is interested in different cultures and for those who just love a good movie."}, {"id": 148, "text": "The film Wadjda tells us about the story of the girl, who just wants to have a bicycle. However, her story is taking place in Islamic society, some aspects of which the film, I guess, wanted to show us. First of all, I would like to mention that the film was shot very well, it could transfer us the message that the author wanted to deliver to us. Beside this, the quality, sound and translation are also very good for the 2012. Of course, it is not Hollywood film, but it did very good at sending a message. Cinematography, from my point of view, is very good, as it is not a fantasy or action movie that need some special equipment and effects. The film is a real-life film and to show this atmosphere such work of the crew was enough. So, after watching this film, I think that the idea was not to show how a little girl reached her aim in Islamic society, but rather the main idea of the film was to show a gender inequality in Islamic societies, mainly in Saudi Arabia. So, my central argument here is that Wadjda, a little girl, was shown us as a fighter for the rights and equality in religious society, as the film is about gender discrimination in Islamic society of Saudi Arabia. To support my argument, I want to give you two big areas: social separation of women and men and domestic inequality between genders. These two arguments will help the reader to understand my point of view. Firstly, during whole film we were witnesses of obstacles that Islamic society creates for women. Socially, the role of women in Islam is underestimated, which is depicted by the director showing separated schools for boys and girls, where any haram thing is prohibited. Girls even cannot speak loudly because men could hear it. Beside this, inequality is shown in the fact that girls must always be covered in streets, except home and school. So, by walking with open face Wadjda is depicted as a person that wants to resist these rules. Another thing about clothing is that men can wear whatever they want, what we can see in some scenes with Wadjda's father and the driver, however, girls are allowed to wear only black paranja, which covers everything, even face. All these things can be put in social separation of men and women, considering men as higher and privileged than women. Therefore, by not following those rules, I mean by not covering her face, selling bracelets in Madrasa, going in street with a boy etc. Wadjda is fighting with existing inequality in society. Also, when she ignored and continued to play in the yard of the school, while a man was looking at her is a bright example of resistance too. Elaborating more on social aspect it is also important to mention that it was a shame for a driver to work for the mother of Wadjda, even more he was always arguing with her even if she was an employer in that case. So, socially the role of women in that society was lowered, but it is common not only for Saudi Arabia, but also to other Islamic state of Middle East. Women are harassed and have restricted rights. One of such scenes can also be seen in film, what really shocked me. The scene is about a female fitting room in a big shopping mall: Wadjda with her mom is trying the dress in toilet. I was astonished how can women live in such conditions? The moment shows us that women in this society do not deserve a normal fitting room, which is nonsense in modern world, where everyone is for equal rights. So, having such harsh conditions, still Wadjda decided to buy a bicycle, even if her family, teachers and society are against it. The head of the school once says that riding for bicycle is not good for the honor of a girl, which mentions the fact that Islamic people pay a huge attention to honor, virginity of the girls till the marriage, they even prohibit girls to walk with a man in the street. Second aspect is about domestic issues in the family of Wadjda. As we can see her father comes home once a week and her mom serves him not as an equal, but as a superior. This episode shows that a man is king of the family and he does what he wants. Wadjda's father once refuse to pay for the driver of her wife, he blame her wife of not giving a birth to a boy, removes the name of his daughter from a family tree - all these scenes show the patriarchal model of Islamic families, some traits of which Kazakhs also have, but not in such harsh way. Domestic discrimination is a common thing in such societies; however, it is very sad that those men can easily leave their families and marry second, third or so on times. The reason for leave of Wadjda's father in film is an absence of a son, but sometimes it can be just existing polygyny, traditions or culture. Because of such attitude toward women, Wadjda and her mother were left in a situation, where her father would not come back, and her mother could not marry another man because of rules of Islam. I think, the message of the director was to show these problems openly in order to protect some families from break down, or to show how inhumane can be such religious societies. Gender inequality is also can be observed from the scene when Wadjda had guests in her father's room and she and her mom were delivering food as a waiter and knocking the door. Men in the film are shown as rulers, bosses, who can do everything, while women are oppressed. The author shows the scene when mother of Wadjda asks her friend Leila whether her husband is not against her work in hospital, where she works with men and uncover her face. On the one hand, it is not so bad to help people and work for a good salary in hospital, on the other hand, many women cannot afford it because their traditions prohibit it. After watching the film, I started wonder whether this situation is present in many Islamic countries all around the world, and do those women really suffer from inequality and discrimination? Concluding the review, I wanted to claim that the film did a great job in showing existing situation in Saudi Arabia, by making references to other Islamic states of Middle East, regarding gender issues. I liked directory of the film, as those people could show the issue and send a message that people should fight for their rights and dreams as Wadjda did, so that in the end they will reach their goal, which is shown as a bicycle bought by her mother. I think, a director took Wadjda as a little girl because he/she wanted to show that she cannot to anything, she is a little person in this society. However, by showing some feeling between Wadjda and Abdulla, the author was considering a change in men also, that step by step together we can change the situation for better. Wadjda can be considered as a symbol of fight with discrimination, a move towards equality and happier life, as those strict rules and taboos just deprive children from childhood, women from freedom of choice and societies from social balance."}, {"id": 149, "text": "Synopsis: This film was about a girl named Wadjda, living in the city of Riyadth, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The story starts when Wadjda while playing with Abdullah, losing the race since Abdullah has a nice bicycle. She promised she will beat him when she will purchase her own bike. This thought did not leave her all the time and the bicycle she liked was very expensive (800 Rials). Her mother, teachers, and whole community censured her wish, but regardless, she has attempted to collect money by her own, selling bracelets and even tried luck in competition in Quran reciting. With the help of her mother and strong wish, she managed to win the competition. As soon as she thought that she could spend the prize fund to buy a bicycle, the money was immediately sent to Palestine against her will. Even in this case, she did not give up her thoughts and wasn't discouraged. She borrowed a bicycle from Abdullah to learn riding and looked-for ways of collecting money. At one night, she found her mother on the top of the house, with a sad face, watching the wedding ceremony in front of the house. Her mother, Reem, said to Wadjda that her father taking another wife and she was the only close person left in her life. Reem bought a bicycle for money, that previously collected for a dress, to fulfill the dream of her daughter. In this way, Wadjda could reach her dreams and the film was finished with the scene of racing between Wadjda and Abdullah, where both of them are happy in that moment. Review: The director of the film was able to make a great movie, not only entertaining the audience with funny moments but also touching the very important issue of the Muslim world. The key point of this issue is the misunderstanding or extreme interpretation of rules in religious communities denies the right of people to choose or can lead to discrimination. The film lasted 93 minutes and in my opinion, it was perfect duration with minimum boring moments and conversations. The quality of the film was not perfect, but acceptable to me. Moreover, all conversations were in Arabic language and only English subtitle was available, causing discomfort (I was looking up and down all the time). On the other hand, it gives the opportunity to feel the emotions of actors and actress, such as disappointment, fear, and delight, in their voices. The aim of the film was to recreate the daily life atmosphere of the middle eastern world precisely. In my opinion, it was successful, because the film includes many detailed aspects. First of all, characters were dressed in traditional clothes appropriate for that region, such as kandoura/thamb for men and chador/burqa for women. Secondly, throughout the film, holy book Quran and calling for prayer or azaan (especially in the morning) played important role in the characterization of the Muslim world. However, the only thing missing in this film was mosques, which is an integral part of Muslim culture. What makes this film unique is that it shows some debatable issues of the Muslim world. First of all, it is the problem of polygamy. During this film, we saw that how the mother of Wadjda, Reem, throughout the film was worried about the intention of her husband to marry the second time. It made her vulnerable and finally, her husband married again regardless of her wish. This issue is common only in a small portion of Muslim communities, which hold some extreme interpretations of religious rules. According to some scholars, polygamy was important previously during war conditions, where there was a lack of men and many women were needed in protection. However, this idea has remained in some Muslim societies even there is no need for the polygamy, because of unilateral understanding of rules. The same can be attributed to the marriage of young girls (the example is Salma, which was married at age 13), which was important in medieval age because of low life expectancy and which was still remained in some Muslim communities. Secondly, throughout the film, it can be seen that characters often worried about the opinions of others. For example, in madrasa where Wadjda was studied, there were strict rules, prohibiting even simple bracelets or music tapes. Other women and teachers often repeated that the laugh of a girl should not be heard by men and therefore they should not laugh near open places. It seems that these people afraid the opinion of community and their behavior often demonstrative, which is quite controversial to the idea of taqwa and ihsan in Islam, which means that every Muslim should care about the God's contentment only. Moreover, in the middle of the film, there was a scene, when Wadjda and Abdullah saw men coming to a home for condolences, and Abdullah told that the late had blown himself up with explosives to kill unbelievers. Also, he added that this man will go to heaven and will get 70 virgins, which is great misconception spread among many Muslim and non-Muslim communities. This idea is controversial to the ayat in Quran, which tells that killing an innocent, regardless to religion, gender and race is comparable to killing all of the population in the world; in fact, murder is deprecated by Islam, but unfortunately, that issue still remains actual. Finally, the moment, when Wadjda won the competition, madrasa teacher made a decision about how to spend this money instead of Wadjda against her will. It reveals a problem of discrimination and the absence of the right of choice which was the result of unwritten rules. Interestingly, Islam was the first religion which gives equal rights to everyone despite the race or gender. Also, Islam reveals that God gives people the right to choose and could be either right or wrong, and everyone will be responsible only for their own actions. However, there are some cases, when girls or women have no right to choose (in marriage or other personal issues) as was shown in the instance of Wadjda, which lead to discrimination. To sum up, this film describes the Saudi girl Wadjda, who persist in collecting money to buy a bicycle. She met many obstacles and indignation of community, but finally, she was able to manage. This film was interesting and funny and could recreate the atmosphere of the Saudi world precisely. Moreover, this film could touch some important issues of the Muslim world, such as misconception or extreme interpretation of religious rules, which leads to discrimination and the problem of the right to choose."}, {"id": 150, "text": "Wadjda is the name of an Arab girl. The name of this girl is symbolic to the meaning of the current movie which entire tied to her. At first glance Wadjda seem that she is one of the hundreds of thousands of adults in Saudi Arabia who dreams to have a bicycle, which is not allowed for the girls in this country. The movie is interesting because we are offered a unique opportunity to see the life of a closed country with many prohibitions and taboos for traditionally marginalized gender group. After analyzing some elements of movie from internet I encountered that the movie is filmed by a female director, and most astonishingly, filming process did not become a challenge or protest from men's side. From my perspective, such subtleness of the movie is closely related with the fact that it shows life of women in the Arab country without vulgarity and amorality. Despite the fact that the picture is female angle of view it is unique due to its debonair scenario line which likely might be interesting for men too. Moreover, this picture charms viewers with its positive energy, and reason for this is the beautiful relationship between two representatives of the new young generation, Wadjda and perhaps her only friend, Abdullah, the boy lives in neighborhood. Their friendship gives us right to claim that life is not stopped at all, rather it moves very unflappable by changing the people's traditional mindset and correcting the rules and restrictions invented by them. From my point of view, most likely the bicycle is the symbol of freedom and the opportunity to be part of society which eventually broke all the stereotypes and established cannons by Saudi Arabi men. At first, I did not pay explicit attention to the actions of the Abdullah, but as events in the picture developed, he literally turned into a her in my eyes. Initially, he did not take Wadjda for serious and always teased her, but his position changed drastically when he witnessed that the desire to purchase a bicycle is not just simple fantasy of ten year old girl, instead it turned out to be that this a big dream, for the sake of which the young rebellious character girl is ready to do everything she can including participating in the tournament for academically reading and delivering Kuran and doing some business with her fellow peers. After such enormous endeavors of girl to have a bike, Abdallah realizes that he was wrong in relation to girl, at later times he presents her helmet for bike, then teaches her how to ride a bike and after some he even becomes ready to give his bike to Wadjda. In my opinion, this particular scene of picture delivers that there is little blink of hope and belief that the young generation is striving for transformation in the Saudi Arabian society, instead of blindly following after medieval time Islamic principles and values. Sometimes, the principles of Sharia law seem very harsh and very violating the rights of women. Wadjda cannot understand all this thing rationally, but she perceives that something is wrong in their community and shows her protest through her behavior. The rules that make her mother fully tried after the exhausting work which is located at the other end of the city. In real sense, these rules forbid such women in Saudi Arabia to be happy, to enjoy the life and not be afraid to fulfill their dreams. As we saw Wajda's mother lives in fear and worry that her husband may go to another woman. To be frankly, the women's social status in Saudi Arabia is not to be envied. Wadjda's father leaving his family just because of the traditional stereotypes which was imposed by religion, he accuses his wife that she cannot give him male child. In second case he claims that marrying to the second wife is his mother's wish. I do not understand these customs of Saudi Arabia despite the fact that I am a Muslim too. Wadjda's mother is very beautiful, an ideal wife, a good mother for her daughter, and perfect keeper of the hearth. Apparently, these factors are not enough to stay in his first family. In my opinion, it is totally unjust and unethical to leave a woman with a child without means of subsistence, when she cannot get a normal job and get herself without being conveyed by a personal taxi driver. To conclude, the plot of the film is very simple and vital. Generally, women's life in Saudi Arabia consists of many prohibitions such as not walking in the street with your head uncovered, hiding your face from men, not to talk loudly among themselves, not to lough, not to sing songs, etc. They are taught from childhood to be obedient wives, good housewives and pious Muslim women who in memory sing the surahs of the Holy Koran. In other words, their religious traditions prohibit the autonomous social status of women and Wadjda in the picture protesting somehow for these rooted conservative rules."}, {"id": 151, "text": "I was brought here, and I'm so happy that I was, by the 'Mary Shelley' Junkets. I of course like everyone who thought Frankenstein is a special book. So I looked up the people behind it on the legendary IMDB bebeplesae!!!! And thank you IMDB for the great job you all do on a never ending! So I watched this to see the precursor, if an omen of goodness would manifest before me or I would be bestowed by a plague on both films. Abuuut Half way in or so, I forgot all about Mary and Elle and in fact, everything and everyone and modern society and I was so immersed in this gem that I found myself floating in another realm, a sweet region so remote from the same old higgledy-piggledy that the first thing I said out loud to myself was 'dang! This is screen-writing 101! This is who you go to for a wonderful seminal terrific screenplay festooned with all the wonderful trimmings only a super-ingenious-smart-lovely-creative story-teller can provide administer and deliver! It was just so nuanced, no preachy nothing, even though the antagonist or teacher lady was delivering these homilies they didn't feel like forced or nothing, it was just a special work of art. And I learnt so much, I had no idea about all this stuff, but how much fun is it to learn from creative art than to watch some crummy lousy overblown hyped up weird sensationalized newscast - yuk on that score, but on this - I want to watch it again!! And oh! This is after watching 'Mary' which I have not left a review, but this is all I have to say , I will be saying it there as well, It is a huge crime in creative writing if this person, is not pumping out works of art on a regular... either fixing stuff, pumping out scripts, directing her own work, others work.. whatever, just someone pray, do not waste good talent, and this folks, is superlative talent!"}, {"id": 152, "text": "I don't really believe in giving films points; credit or positive reviews on the shallow basis that they merely are what they are. Wadjda is the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia - not only this, but is the first feature-length film made by a female Saudi director AND revolves entirely around the world of a little girl. This is quite something for a nation which, until recently, had both banned cinemas and are rather strident in what they permit their female population to do. The sheer fact that Wadjda even exists has thus led to the likes of John Hartl, of the Seattle Times, to say it deserves praise ...just for being what it is, but this is not a philosophy I find myself being able to subscribe to. I think it right to say that similar cries of acclaim were directed towards Osama in 2003, which was one of only a handful of films the nation of Afghanistan had ever made and was, I believe, the first to be produced in a post-Taliban era. Subjectivity, however, must always triumph.If Wadjda deserves any credit for anything at all, then it is for the fact that it is a damn fine impressive piece of film-making in its own respect. It is so competent, in fact, that watching it and researching the facts afterwards causes you to wonder if anything that you are reading about the strictness of film-making in Saudi Arabia even existed at all. Indeed, by the looks of things, their citizenry are as cine-literate as anyone else and are more than aware of how to put together a solid piece of drama film-making.Wadjda revolves around a young girl played by Waad Mohammed, who is the Wadjda of the title. She lives in Riyadh with her mother and father; attends school and enjoys messing around with a boy named Abdullah (Abdullrahman Algohani). Wadjda is a bit of a rebel: she is bored by prayer recitation at school and wears trainers where everyone else dons more formal looking footwear. At home, she records pop music off the radio and dances to it in her room - because we're all experts in Middle Eastern cinema, we know from seeing 2009's Afghan Star that it is illegal for women to dance because one of the contestants in said documentary landed themselves in some serious trouble when she momentarily did such a thing. She has a streak of wit to her: I'm too good looking to be related to you she quips to a shop-keeper before haggling with him. The bulk of the film will go on to consist of a lust Wadjda has for a bicycle she cannot afford and will not have bought for her - a solution, however, arrives in the form of a Quran recital competition which comes with a cash prize. The exchanges between the characters throughout feel very real - this is seemingly a film about fictitious people in a given situation, of course, but it is also a film depicting a kind of liberation from being unable to act in front of a camera for the purposes of film-making. Both the editing and camerawork additionally do well to place you on the dusty streets of Riyadh. Al Mansour decides to take the opportunity of being the first woman to make a Saudi Arabian film in order to go down the route of a kind of progressivism - Wadjda is not a film particularly eager to make the case for the status quo, but it is not an especially aggressive film which stamps its feet for the cause of social change. Much of this, I think, is down to the fact the film is about children and a child - more specifically, a child who rebels. A film about an adult woman causing trouble, or mischief, may have been at once less subtle and harmed its chances of getting made. Moreover, Al Mansour appears to use the film as an opportunity to address the issues dominating contemporary politics in Saudi Arabia, but does so in such a way that is not preachy and assumes the viewer know nothing of Saudi society. I was unsure, for example, if the scene whereby Wadja's mother spends a good deal of time on screen in her own home uncovered, before covering her head with a burka in order so that her taxi driver will not see her face, was meant to be comedic or not: will Muslim men watching the film not see her anyway as she stands, on screen, before she covers up? Irrespective, if at first we were unsure of how men and women interact with one another in this place, we are certain when Wadjda's teacher outlines that a woman's voice is her nakedness if a man hears her speak. Best, therefore, to keep silent whenever possible.Wadjda's desire for a bicycle derives from seeing several boys riding bikes and her thinking it looks like quite good fun. The bike, therefore, comes to epitomise a sense of evenness. In conjunction with this, the director additionally depicts the otherwise harmless friendship between Wadjda and Abdullah - two foils otherwise spending the entire film at one another's throats but destined, we feel, to remain together for the rest of their lives. What kind of marriage they forge between them, and what role Wadjda might have in fulfilling the position of the wife, is perhaps uncertain: we sense Al Mansour hopes it will be different to what the reality might be if the film had been made forty years earlier."}, {"id": 153, "text": "Saudi Arabia has a desert climate, and most people have good living conditions, but men are very dominated by the family. Wadjda is a 12-year-old girl, she is very active, and different from other girls; she wears jeans and skate shoes. She likes to listen to love songs. In Saudi Arabia, women need to wear the headscarf to cover their faces when they go out. Wadjda also should wear the headscarf when she goes to school, the principle has the conversation with Wadjda about her headscarf many times. One day, some friends come to Wadjda's house, but women cannot meet with them; Wadjda and his mother just leave the food at the door. Onetime Wadjda put her name on the family tree, but the second day his father takes it off. Women's names are not allowed to put on the family tree. Women cannot drive, so they have drivers; Wadjda's mother is late to work one day because she has trouble with her driver. Wadjda wants to learn and buy a bike but in their society, women cannot ride a bike. She starts earning money and learns ride bike secretly. Her mother rejects her many times to buy a bike. Finally, her father married to someone else, her mother is so sad and thinks she should make Wadjda happy, so she buys a bike for her."}, {"id": 154, "text": "Wadjda was such a good movie! I thought it gave everyone in the western world what life is like in Saudi Arabia for not only men but also women. Westerners always joke about the rights in Saudi because they are so far behind places like the United States and the United Kingdom and their culture is so much different than ours. I was a cool learning experience for everyone because I honestly do not think that many people actually knew what life is like there. But the director was very creative on how she was able to make this movie and be able to follow rules and laws in the Saudi community and she still was able to make an awesome movie and she even got awards for it. She was talking about it in a Stephen Colbert interview what she had to be in a van covered up and used a radio and a loud speaker so she could say what she felt needed to be done and do what any other director would do. The ending was also very heart warming and really made me and the people I watched it with very happy. I also think that its ironic that the UN women rights council is now headed by Saudi Arabia, but hopefully this means they want to push themselves more and become a better country when it comes to gender rights. But absolutely great movie! I would totally recommend it."}, {"id": 155, "text": "Very little can be said without controversy about a movie made on a culture that typically rejects outsider's views. Frankly, I fail to see the point of the whole effort and the risks taken by passionate women filmmakers who make films like Wadjda. Maybe it is to keep the hope for change alive or to express dissent against social oppression. In either case, outsiders can only sympathize and then move on with their lives. Truth is, I'll never fully comprehend the state of women in the Saudi patriarchy. As a reviewer of this film, I choose not to comment on that part. I'd only say one thing. A lot of circumstances are comparable to the odds faced by women even the most progressive societies. If you are watching this movie with a sociological perspective then you're probably going to miss the fun. So, for the sake of the story, leave your judgement outside the door. What strikes me in this film is a child's will to overcome obstacles. It's not because Wadjda is a girl child that her story is more interesting. Although, that might be core to the plot. I can attest that all children at one point or another feel left out, isolated, unloved even. Wadjda's mother loves her but she has a lot of things to deal with. The inspiring part is that she understands this and is willing to work with whatever she has got. Her family is undergoing some stressful times that are usually hard to cope for a child of her age. Instead of acting out like an entitled kid, she hacks her way through troubles. She's a natural entrepreneur who would not back down. Its uplifting to watch Wadjda because of her ingenuity to invent her surroundings. She displays leadership as well. The film deals with hypocrisy nicely. Just compare the characters of Wadjda's teacher with the shopkeeper who holds out on the bicycle for her.Wadjda is a unique story. It is somewhat reminiscent of 'Children of Heaven'. There is a competition and prize money involved and the outcome is again wholly different and not at all what you'd expect. It is a heartfelt story about a child coping with abandonment issues through a cause. Her aim is to get a bicycle for herself and win a race with Abdullah (a cheeky little boy who's also her best friend and bears a lot of her brunt too). The goal she has set for herself, probably signifies one phase of hardships. Wadjda may have achieved this one with her single minded determination but where she goes from there is left to the audience's speculation. There is a lot of optimism there. Although, her adorable mission is enough to melt away the hearts of skeptics, you'll find her persistence quite infectious."}, {"id": 156, "text": "Sweet yet eye-opening and thought-provoking movie.Life in Saudi Arabia, as told through the eyes of a 10-year old girl. On the surface, the story of a girl who wants a bike. However, it is so much more than that. The movie shows how women are forbidden from doing things that anyone in the west would regard as a fundamental right (or wouldn't even think about at all, it would be such a given). Becomes an indictment on the male-dominated culture of the country. However, not overly judgemental in its telling - the culture is what it is, basically. If you want an incredibly critical, confrontational and graphic exposition of the extremes of such a culture, see The Stoning of Soraya M.Superb performance by Waad Mohammad in the lead role. She gets the spirit of the innocent yet enterprising girl down perfectly. Good supporting performances too."}, {"id": 157, "text": "Wadjda (2012) is a Saudi Arabian film written and directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour. Waad Mohammed portrays Wadjda, a ten-year-old girl who is buffeted by Saudi Arabia's restrictive rules concerning the proper behavior of females. These rules enter into every realm of life, not just clothing, but also behavior. Just as an example, if girls in a group are talking among themselves, they have to move if men can see them. It's OK for the men to look, but not OK for the young women to be seen. Wadjda takes most of these restrictions for granted, but the one restriction she can't accept is that girls can't ride bicycles.Most of the movie is concerned with her attempts to obtain a bicycle, despite societal pressure not to own or ride one. However, she can buy one, if she has the money. She needs to earn the money, and she does a pretty good job of getting small amounts by using her wits and her ingenuity. (Wits and ingenuity are a good thing for everyone, but they are vital for oppressed members of society.) Then, opportunity appears in the form of a Koran competition,which carries with it a cash prize.There's a subplot to the movie. Wadjda's mother (played well by the lovely Reem Abdullah) is tempted to take a hospital job that is close to her home, but requires some departure from strict adherence to the societal restrictions. There's also the mother's concern about her husband, Wadjda's father, who comes home occasionally and plays video games rather than interacting with his family. He's not a brute, but his mind is elsewhere, and Wadjda's mother knows it.Although some subtleties are surely lost on non-Saudis, I think this movie is definitely worth seeing.

Whale Rider (New Zealand), Yesterday (a rare Zulu film), and The Day I Became a Woman (Iran) instantly come to mind. The challenge set before the girl (in this case a Koran proficiency contest) is a MacGuffin to lead us through the journey of cultural biases against women and girls. Fortunately, men alone aren't painted as the chauvinists; some (not all) women in the school system are the hypocritical despots. The DVD I viewed did not contain any making of featurette or director's commentary (I can't speak for the Blu-ray, since I didn't receive it), which is a shame, as we'd all benefit from understanding the hurdles a female director must scale in order to bring something as brave and tactfully done as this to light.

Most of those are courtesy of Mohammed, an appealing 12-year-old actress with solid comic instincts.she wears jeans and baseball boots. She also listens to western pop music on the radio, hangs out with a boy, Abdullah, and has her own small business selling plaited friendship bracelets to her schoolmates.When Abdullah crows about having a bicycle, Wadjda is inspired to step up her moneymaking activities in order to buy one for herself.The limitations and humiliations conferred by her sex confront Wadjda everywhere she turns, from the building-site worker who sexually harasses her to a family tree on the wall of her home that lists only males.In a subplot, Wadjda's mother (Reem Abdullah) is anguished because her husband (Waad Mohammed) seems to be on the verge of marrying another woman, in a polygamous arrangement. This is appalling, and so is a brief scene in which a girl of 10 or 12 gleefully shares pictures of her wedding to a 20-year-old man.These are little flaws, however, in the fabric of a first-time feature that doesn't falter in achieving its main goal: to make clear certain realities of female life experience in Saudi Arabia while also proffering comfort in the form of the hope of a fairer future.Don't MISS THIS Beautiful MOVIE!!!!!!!! IF U R A Muslim IT's A MUST"}, {"id": 160, "text": "My first impression of the movie was about the resistance and challenges that arose for Haifaa Al-Monsour directing and producing the movie, that alone peeked my interest in the film. But the dedication and perseverance to achieve Wadjda's desire to buy a bicycle sold me as well. I always love a good tale about females standing up and not caring about their place, but would rather live for themselves. Wadjda's tale is something that can be felt in every place in the world, it doesn't matter the culture, we all know that one girl growing up that didn't care what others thought, and just did what they wanted. Some faced sexist walls, others religious, or even family boundaries that said they shouldn't and still they did. In this case she faced them all. But the parallel between Wadjda's story and her parent's relationship was what really got to me and left me crying in the end. In a good way.This experience has left me with one major impression: Anything that Maifaa Al-Mansour directs, I will purchase."}], "reviews_amount": 161}
