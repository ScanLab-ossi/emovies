It is a very heavy film but it is important for us to remember our past and accept it so the same mistakes won't be made in a future. It is a miracle what a film company can do on a power of will and raw determination without the financial support from the government, just so the people could know and remember what their ancestors went through for them."}, {"id": 1, "text": "The film touches on historically important topics of the Kazakh steppes.

It is a real story tragedy which was lasting for 2 decades all over the world. I wonder how those nations survived and even have their own independent countries.

This is an untold story of century old colonization of Kazakhstan. After many years of struggle, Kazakhs have been fighting for its independence for a long time. It is impossible to watch film without tears. The Kazakhs fought with the bare hands, against well-armed Russians, fought only with one strength of spirit. Such stories are certainly very impressive. Mass battle scenes are very brutal and bloody, but the scale of filming is simply amazing! The gloomy landscapes of the steppes and the delightful soundtrack complete each other. Battle scenes make you not only shudder, but also sympathize with the actors, relive the events with them! The film describes a crime against humanity, and the immoral behavior of the colonialists. The film features one of the most memorable scenes in the world cinema history, when the hungry wolves were chasing mother with her kids, the mother faces a difficult dilemma between her childrens, choice of life."}, {"id": 34, "text": "True Soviet power story about an attempt to kill the Kazakh people"}, {"id": 35, "text": "We were waiting for this kind of movie for a long time.

Zhandosov, who visited Sarysu district on a special assignment, gave the following information: While visiting the villages, I came across corpses that had not been buried for decades ... Women endure poverty and hunger. Men are immediately discouraged. Depressed people eat whatever they can get their hands on. The bones are collected and boiled dozens of times to connect the heart. Semi-processed hides can also be replaced by food. I met a few people who ate dog meat and did not hide it. On the way from the tenth village, I saw two teenagers from a deserted Japan. In the 5th village, a woman with heavy legs, half-swollen from hunger, approached me and asked me to shoot her with a dog.The Holoshchekin genocide left Kazakhstanis, first of all, the Kazakh people, hungry and refugees.
