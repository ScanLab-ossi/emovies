Then when I saw it was a last chance screening at my local &amp; thought to watch cos I saw Will Ferrell was in the cast &amp; thought it was be a comedy so I thought why not.The film follows a family who retreat off to the Alps in Switzerland after the father of the family is grieving the loss of his father who died 8 months prior. But after an avalanche incident, the divide between the the father &amp; the rest of the family deepens. The film from then on has the family punish Will Ferrell's character as he tries to make amends.The film is flat. Really flat. No comedy. No laughs. Not even remotely 1 redeeming feature. The film just drags &amp; drags &amp; drags, with the main chunk mostly focusing on the family being miserable &amp; moody. There's no oomph or any upbeatness to be had. It's just a bore-fest. But given this was suppose to be some character study I can kind of see why. Still, when you see Will Ferrell in the cast, along with the word comedy you're going to assume the film is going to be humourous in some way or another it wasn't.Ironically enough the title fits because the film really did go downhill fast. It's boring &amp; forgettable. And just when the film actually finally gets somewhere it ends! Making you think That it!?. All the dreary crap &amp; that's the thanks we get? Poor. The film is purely depressing &amp; is enough to put you to sleep.This hands down has to be the worst comedy film I've ever seen. I usually don't mind comedy films (even american ones). But this boring, depressing 80 minutes tripe was rubbish. I also learned now that this is a remake of a European film released back in 2014 under the name Force Majeure. Never heard of it, but it would probably be more memorable than this bland &amp; mundane excuse for a comedy!1/10"}, {"id": 7, "text": "This film already exist, and it's excellent. Simply look for Force Majeure (2014) or Turist (2014) -- same film but different title in different countires. It places people in a somewhat unexpected, yet perfectly realistic, situation and shows how their lives gradually implode in the aftermath. It shines a light on ordinary human weaknesses, and how pathetic many of us really are. It forces the viewer to reflect upon their own strengths and weakness: what woud YOU have done? And it does it really well. Why whould anyone see the need to remake this? And with as terrible an actor as Will Ferrell, of all people? Is Hollywood really so desperate, having no original ideas of their own anymore? That's just ridiculous. I'd encourage each and every potential viewer to avoid this pitiful copy and watch the original instead. Boycott is the only way to force Hollywood to stop with this nonsense. No more recycling!

This movie is going to cause some couples to divorce after they watch this.in short, we have a slow motion train wreck with no recovery. I had hoped that at least there was going to be a payoff at the end but it ended poorly too. The humor in it was just enough to keep you there for the whole thing hoping that there would be at least a redeeming joke or something. Nope. Awful. People are going to watch this and if hey see themselves in the characters, it will likely speed up their impending divorce, not stall it with nostalgia and discovering why they fell in love in the first place. Basically you see two people staying in a loveless marriage just long enough to see their kids out the door so that they can finally sleep in separate bedrooms or get the sweet relief of splitting up."}, {"id": 10, "text": "First, and most importantly, know this is not a comedy, it's a serious, purposefully slow-moving character study with a few very funny, even laugh-out-loud moments. Knockout scenery (and if you've ever been a skier you'll be craving time on the slopes immediately after viewing), this is the kind of film that inspires wanderlust, but some will find it too subtle and quiet. I liked it, but there were elements that bugged the heck out of me, especially the non-development of the two sons as important characters--they remain blank stares and mysteries for the entire film. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is very good here, Will Ferrell good but mostly one-note: The film is definitely given a shot in the arm by actors in supporting roles. Overall a recommended watch if you enjoy character studies where simple, subtle facial expressions and body movements are as important as dialogue."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Saw this opening night and was expecting a great new comedy..... big mistake.

So please see the original film. It truly captured what a marriage is like that now has a crack in the foundation. They never should have made this flick. If Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus wanted to make a comedy about a vacation gone wrong, go ahead. But leave FORCE MAJEURE alone."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Not funny nor dramatic. Lazy remake of a great European movie. Look for the oroginal"}, {"id": 16, "text": "Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are two of the most talented and successful comedy actors in recent decades. Nat Faxon and Jim Rash form a Oscar-winning writing duo capable producing moving, thoughtful work full of heart and humor. Force Majeure, the film on which Downhill is based, is a powerhouse of picture, one of effective dark comedy and pungent drama. With all these forces seemingly playing in favor of Downhill, it seemed like the movie was an inevitable hit.So, why did it whiff so miserably?A major issue with the film is its lack of subtlety. None of the characters' flaws or any of the developing sources of conflict are unveiled with any level of showmanship. They're clumsily slapped onto the screen with the same level of delicate touch that a toddler uses to finger paint. The only difference is what the toddler creates will ultimately be colorful and show signs of life.Another massive flaw (I'll stop with two since I don't need belabor the point with excessive cruelty) is the apparent fear that went into the writing. All the punches were pulled. There are so many moments that walk right up to the edge of making an emotional impact, delivering laugh, or doing something of worth, but they cautiously pull back before completing the mission. We're left with an empty feeling at every turn.For those who are unfamiliar with the film's premise, the plot revolves around a mom and dad who take their two kids on a ski vacation. During an avalanche that takes place while the family is sitting at the caf\u00e9 table, dad runs away, leaving his family helpless and alone. It turns out the avalanche was controlled and posed no real danger, unbeknownst to the vacationers. Dad returns to his trembling family and acts as though nothing happened. Mom is ticked.It's a rough look for dad, as he has lost the respect of his wife and kids. He proceeds to make excuses and deny responsibility for what happened. So, mom takes the atrociously bad advice of a concierge at their ski resort and decides to live her best life or something like that. Evidently, her best life includes breaking the fidelity of her marriage and touching herself in a bathroom stall. To each their own I suppose.Mom's exploration of her true desires could have been funny and revealing. Eventually, one would assume, she would learn the error of that way of living. But she never learns that lesson. Instead, the movie simply abandons that plotline after 15 minutes or so. Oh well, her best life would have been a first round elimination at the best life qualifying tournament. Not much interesting stuff going on with her.Mercifully, the movies sputters to a halt after a weakly realized pseudo-reconciliation for the family. Then, because the writers weren't quite finished firing blanks, the final scene orchestrates a scenario similar to the avalanche from early in the movie. This time, mom, dad, and the other adults involved all fend for themselves. The point exactly of this moment is unclear. It'll leave audiences everywhere shrugging as the credits roll and they turn to person next to them and exchange a look that says, I'm sure glad that's over."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Have you ever been round to another couples house, and they start bickering and sniping at each other in front of you.

Will Ferrell's affect was as flat as an envelope. I think that Will Farrell's character was intended to be that of a man struggling to show emotion and begin to put energy into his marriage. Even at the end of the movie, I can't imagine Will's character ever looking any different. There was no sign of change or grown throughout the movie. Julia's character comes off as something of a shrew, and I found her unsympathetic. I did not find the boys' roles in the movie to be of interest. They were props more than characters.

On the slopes, a vacationing family from the states is approached by a freelancing photographer in Austria; he convinces the Americans to pose for a series of stills that seemingly proves their unconditional regard for each other. Downhill, directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, begins just like Reuben Ostlund's Force Majeure, its 2014 Swedish predecessor, establishing the husband/wife and parents/children bonds without any latent pathos for the most part, but with one small difference, played as comedy, that foreshadows the old adage; appearances can be deceiving. Whereas the Swedish couple and their two children get through the session against a French Alps backdrop without a hitch, the Americans' photo shoot ends up being a bit helter-skelter. On a physical level, Pete Staunton(Will Ferrell) hurts his wife Billie(Julia Louis-Dreyfus), when the two bump helmets a little too hard while leaning in for a pose. Technology, albeit of the non-digital kind, quietly insinuates itself as an obstruction from the corporeal world of loved ones. Polycarbonate plastic is just the beginning. Ow, can't begin to describe the emotional upheaval Billie will feel when their marriage is put to the test.A stranger is in their bed. It plays music, it replaces the human voice, it controls every minute of people's lives. And it rings. Thomas(Johannes Bah Kuhnke), in Force Majeure, promises Ebba(Lisa Loven Kongsli) that he won't pick up. The wife gets up to use the bathroom. When Ebba returns to the bedroom, she catches him red-handed with the phone. We don't know who's calling. It could be work, a telemarketer, a friend, or another woman, but that's not the point. A binary is established by this inanimate bedmate; reality/fantasy, a bizarre threesome, in which cyberspace, particularly, the infinite amount of naked ciphers whom Ebba, a flesh and blood Norwegian bombshell, has to compete with for her husband's attention. Thomas' counterpart in Downhill may not be, as it turns out, a serial philanderer, but Pete, in spite of being, by all appearances, a loyal spouse, seems more in love with his phone than Billie. While the family sleeps, Pete is wide awake, texting a good friend on the toilet. Potentially, any woman he wants is at his fingertips. But she's not real. Modern life is no life at all, half of it is spent online. Pete probably doesn't have the slightest idea what to talk about with his wife when Finn(Julian) and Emerson(Ammon Ford), their sons, aren't around to fill the white noise. That's why in the restaurant, Charlotte(Miranda Otto) is a sight for sore eyes. He gladly accepts the hotel concierge's invitation to join her for dinner, against Billie's objections, because the husband needs the social interference of extra bodies rather than spend time alone with the woman he had promised to love and cherish 'til death do us part.The avalanche remains the same. Harry(Vincent Wettergren), the son, in Force Majeure, can see what his father can't. The snow's momentum will cause the frozen assemblage of precipitation to supersede the parameters of the restaurant's terrace. Thomas insists that the disaster in the making, more or less, isn't real, but rather, controlled, despite the screams emanating from his family and the other patrons. His denial of what is plainly apparent suggests an inability to distinguish reality from fantasy. In Downhill, to the filmmakers' credit, offers an explanation as to why the father in Force Majeure and its American remake, saves the cell phone instead of safeguarding his family from potential death. Pete is googled to death. The father surfs and texts so much, he forgets where his real life begins, Downhill seems to suggest. To Pete, on a metaphorical level, the avalanche is an event film, but he fails to notice the lack of protective glass, the oncoming snow is not a flat 2D image, so the metaphor fails. This is no movie screen. He makes a run for it when his recognizance usurps this waking dream, the suspension of disbelief. During the cataclysm, Pete's modern brain keeps his lizard brain in check. The primordial cerebellum signals to Pete that he run away from a filmic image, like the moving train from the 1896 silent one-reeler L'arrive d'un train en gare de La Ciarat, directed by Auguste and Louis Lumiere, which caused 19th century moviegoers to flee the bijou. The avalanche, quite pointedly, looks more life-threatening in Downhill, the rogue snow, a killer on the loose, so prevalent it causes the disaster zone to go white, like the screen of a smart phone on the blink. When the ice flurry settles, Pete realizes his mistake, like so many of us, thinking that our online lives are more important than our offline ones. After the incident, Downhill riffs on the motif set by the original film, in which Thomas and Ebba stare at their reflective selves brushing teeth with electric toothbrushes. Thomas hates the man staring back at him. In Downhill, Pete becomes the man he hates, when Billie asks her husband to take care of his dental hygiene on the other side, the same bathroom in replica. This mirrored Pete is like the negative of a photograph. Same man, but harder to decipher.Ebba never quite forgives Thomas in Force Majeure. A wreckless bus driver, obviously drunk, can't maneuver the long and winding downhill roads. Once again, the father fails to act. It's Ebba, the mother, who orders everybody off the bus. Downhill, in contrast, reveals the fallacy of Thomas' prior heroics, when Ebba gets separated from the family on their last ride down the mountain. She was pretending to be lost or hurt, just like Billie, who gives her husband a second chance to be the hero. The mother wanted Finn and Emerson to respect their father again. For Billie, her husband's correct interpretation of the reality/fantasy binary is enough. This time, Pete is offline. He finds his wife sitting down, perfectly safe and sound. Instead of standing still, Pete searched for her in earnest. It's a Hollywood ending. After all, it's a Hollywood film, a fantasy. Conversely, in Force Majeure, Ebba walks like a woman. Thomas walks like a boy.Reality."}, {"id": 115, "text": "This is billed as a Will Farrell disaster movie which I find to be a redundant phrase.

Sure, the first is a European drama, more artistic and better quality as film making, but it's also an unsettling movie, and for me it left an impression I won't forget soon.

It could not work because they could not relay on the one thing that keeps the movie going. They needed to put in many things to play it safe. It was not a bad movie in content.

There's a certain self-serving pretentiousness in saying a movie isn't as good as a foreign film most in your reading audience hasn't seen. That seems never more so apparent here. This is a review of Downhill that's based on its own merits.I came away liking this in the end. There were some tonal issues in the comedy/drama mix - particularly some contrivances which work better in a comedy than a relationship drama. The movie is a drama first and foremost, but is probably funniest to parents who can enjoy the awkward interactions between husband and wife trying to juggle stress for the good of their kids - and their family vacation. The humor isn't what drives this movie, however, so even Ferrell fans hoping for a laugh-fest aren't going to get it here. Both Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus have shown strong dramatic acting chops before, and I think they do so here.It's wonderfully shot. The wide views of the mountains and the music that accompany the cutaways makes for some great ambiance.The nature of the movie's turning point is maybe its biggest dud, mostly because the entirety of it doesn't make much sense. The scene is initially done well, building up the intrigue and fear of the moment, but when the father returns without so much as an are you guys okay? the scene loses a little dramatic punch, because it seems a little too contrived that a parent, who feared for their own life, would have had so much disregard for the welfare of his wife &amp; children.The film seems to try to reconcile this - in the face of seeing his family pulling away - by painting Ferrell's character as not only disconnected/distracted, but by seeming to have an active disdain for his children. Maybe these scenes are believable to some, but to me they felt like contrivances in a film that portrays itself based in a reality. Is this a story of a father who's sacrificed his family for work? Is this a breakdown by a man who lost his father earlier in the year? We never quite get sense of why this is happening.Ultimately this is solved via comedy - Ferrell getting drunk enough to admit his fear, and we come to realize what seemed like an existential threat to their marriage was really just a prolonged fight.This is why the movie works for me. Spouses get into plenty of arguments, even some which seem more serious that really were because of moods or the way the parties handle communication post-incident - not the incident itself. Sometimes all it takes is a silly resolution to fix what seems like a serious fight, and that's about as close to reality as the movie gets."}, {"id": 204, "text": "A real uninspired film, with terrible writting, awful pacing, and boring characters.

The overriding feeling I had throughout was of awkwardness, due in large part to characters dancing around a crisis without directly addressing it, while at other times the relational, familial aftermath of the critical moment plays out in front of other people, which only increases the awkwardness. As a result, in a strange, difficult to describe way, it is one of the most unsettling movies I've seen in a long time, precisely because it seems to establish a light-hearted tone, while at its core it's a very serious drama about a crisis of trust that happens within a marriage. This bait and switch of tonality seems to be what other reviewers are complaining about or misinterpreting; whereas I think it is what makes the movie at least partly successful."}, {"id": 234, "text": "Beautifully written and executed by Julia and Will.

If you have been there in your life and felt what they feel or if you are basically married, then you know why it doesn't come unconditionally and why a spec of hope can keep the snowball rolling /falling yet with no forward movement. The analogy of an avalanche or falling snow is the perfect accompaniment to the story of marriage.

So says the punching bag, sad sack persona of Pete Staunton. Staunton is played by Will Ferrell who keeps the funny shtick to a standstill in 2020's Downhill (my latest review). Oh and Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays Staunton's grating wife Billie. Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus really get out of their comedic comfort zones to give startlingly raw performances. Elaine Benes and Ricky Bobby, we hardly knew ya!Anyway, Downhill is not a comedy or even a black comedy as some people might have suggested. Just call it American Beauty minus the dark side with a slight lane of awkwardness. Yup, if you've ever had reservations about getting hitched, Downhill might halt and force you to keep those reservations.So OK, Downhill is a remake of a 2014 Swedish film titled Force Majeure. I haven't seen Majeure so I'm basing my write-up here on something viewed with fresh eyes. Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm aware. As voiced by other critics, the original did it so much better.Now would I recommend the independently felt Downhill? I thought I already did. It's a revealing snapshot of two people getting through a crappy marriage by using an avalanche and slalom skiing as coaxed metaphors. Would I call it entertaining in a Brady Bunch vacation sort of way? Uh no. Downhill is demoralizing, snippy, and a little cold (no pun intended). It uses frustrating drama as a backdrop to beautiful mountain scenery via the Austrian tourism industry.With lush, snow-blind direction by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash and some Enigma-style music by German Volker Bertelmann, Downhill becomes eighty-six transitory minutes of numbing character inquiry.

I'm reviewing this as a film unto itself. I enjoyed it while I watched it, but that enjoyment didn't extend past further reflection. The tone is wildly off. The film tries to present itself as a drama and comedy, but it's very clearly the former. The comedy confuses the drama. If it stuck solely to it's dramatic elements and dealt with the subject matter at hand and really peeled back who these people are and examined why they did what they did, we would have had a great and possibly poignant character piece on our hands, but instead it leaned on uncomfortable moments for laughs, which killed the dramatic tension. Also, it should have been a good thirty minutes longer. The characters kids needed way more attention than they got. So did Ferrell and Dreyfus. Especially Ferrell. The entire narrative hinges on a single action his character makes and the movie doesn't come close to truly exploring why he did what he did. And what it does to address it, makes very little sense. SPOILERS follow. An avalanche hits. Instead of helping his family, he runs. His fight or flight instinct kicked in and his was the latter. Very interesting. Have him examine this. Let us watch a man deal with learning that his first instinct is cowardice. The movie doesn't think that's interesting. It thinks it's interesting to have the character yearn to be twenty and responsibility-free, but having that be a motivation for the character poses a question that muddies the water: If he wants to be single again, then was leaving his family to die an intentional act? The movie never goes there so I'm assuming the answer is no, so why even go there in the first place? All in all, I think the movie's main issue is focus and indecision. It should've settled on a tone and stuck to it and made a clear decision on how to approach the main characters actions and then let the narrative naturally unfurl from there. But, It didn't, so the movie didn't work for me. I'm going to check out the original now and see how those filmmakers handled it. Hopefully their approach will work.

It is about a marriage that is tested by events on a vacation. I like both leads, JLD plays her role really well, and I like the twist of how Americans deal with unforeseen circumstances when they travel. Great twist that the original movie did not have for obvious reasons. I have no problem with remakes as long as they are done well - no one is trying to 'steal' someone else's property and the original writers, no doubt, got paid. The majority of Americans often don't get to see foreign stories with subtitles, and smaller distribution for various reasons.

First ITS NOT A COMEDY, if you are expecting to see step brothers in the Alps, then you're going in completely wrong. It's a drama about a husband who basically abandons his family in a perceived time of crisis, and the fallout that this causes the family over the rest of their Alpine skiing vacation.Do not expect zany Will Ferrel or Seinfeld Julia Louis Dreyfus and you might actually enjoy this movie. It's slightly dark, a little awkward and there's moments where you genuinely hate both of them. I will say this is not one of Ferrel's better dramatic rolls (Everything must go was better) but it's not an entirely nonredeemable movie. Definitely not deserving of the 1 stars its been given. Even if you hated the story and plot you could at least give it 3 stars for the incredibly beautiful Alpine scenery.

Unfortunately, this film was disappointing. This isn't the kind of feel-good romantic movie to take your significant other out to see on Valentine's Day.The film isn't mushy and doesn't resolve like a bow on a pretty package. Instead, it is more of a warning in relationships, showing how miscommunication, self-centeredness, defensiveness all can contribute to breaking down bonds in relationships. The humor in it is how the couple fails to address the issue directly causing further distance, bringing others into it to plead their case, and even puts the kids in the middle. There were some cringeworthy moments throughout.Some of the film's less flattering moments include an awkward scene with a ski instructor, crude sexual humor, and drunkenness without any really point.I would recommend steering clear of this one, in favor of a nice evening in, preparing dinner for your partner, snuggling up on the couch and dreaming together about your hopes for the future so you don't end up like Billie and Pete unsure of what is next in store for your relationship."}, {"id": 253, "text": "The movie is a remake of a relatively recent movie Force Majeure (2014) by Swedish director Ruben \u00d6stlund.

The plot is way too simplistic for mature viewers, while inappropriate scenes (including a disgusting female mastr'b8ing scene in a public restroom) make it a terrible choice to be watched with your ski passionate teenagers. Then the presentation of a dysfunctional family does not make it a good material for a comedy either, which instead of being funny is presented by a distasteful sequence of low-key mishaps of a typical selfish and immature married couple that viewer does not want to relate to. On top of that the presentation of European society supports the ignorant and superficial stereotypes among the American audience. The authors had a great opportunity to create a comforting sense in the audience by accentuate the beautiful landscape of the Alps and the depth of European cultures, but they rather make you hate the idea of ever going to the land of crazy hedonists... or to watch the movie ever again."}, {"id": 254, "text": "I spent eight bucks to see the movie Downhill last night.

It's a small but engaging film with English subtitles over a few scenes when the dialogue naturally shifts to other languages. Apparently American film producers thought it could be redone without the need for those pesky subtitles, or tight storytelling. Or decent casting, acting, photography, sound, or any of the other basics of professional filmmaking. The resulting mess is Downhill starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell.

It's awful.I loved Force Majeure and had high hopes for Downhill.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month and is being released by Searchlight, with the previous name of Fox missing from the title since the Disney purchase.I love movie titles with double meanings, but in this case, it's not a good thing. While the movie features a family on a downhill ski trip in the Alps, the title of the film best describes the direction the marriage is going in throughout their adventure. Timed perfectly for a Valentine's Day release, it really isn't the fun rom-com you're thinking it should be with comedy giants Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

She is a talented comedienne who is very believable in a drama too. The nuances on her face were perfect and spoke volumes. My husband and I saw the movie together and both felt sorry for Will Ferrell's character, who is a complete wuss during the story. My husband was especially frustrated that the character was never able to quite redeem himself. Miranda Otto, who plays Charlotte, will look familiar to you but you won't quite know where you've seen her before. Suddenly, you'll remember it was in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers franchise where she played Eowyn. Her character in this movie doesn't have an ounce of integrity like Eowyn did in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Fans of The Office: The Complete Series will get a kick out of seeing Zach Woods. What's funny is his character's name is Zach in this movie. When Kirstofer Hivju first appeared on the screen in the movie, you could immediately tell there were Game of Thrones:Season 1-2 fans in the audience. There were some laughs and even a few quiet cheers, as his character, Giantsbane, was always a fan favorite. When the movie ended, the lady sitting behind me in the theater said, That's it? but I actually thought it was an insightful ending. You get to see some beautiful Austrian mountains.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:I haven't seen the original movie that this is modeled after, but everyone who has, says the first one is sooo much better. Sooooo much bickering. That's neither enjoyable, nor funny. It definitely needed more humor to balance out the drama and depressing moments. The actors who played the sons did a good job, but they sure aren't like most realistic, rambunctious boys that age that I know. Instead, these boys are super mellow. They're played by Julian Grey and Ammon Jacob Ford.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus did a fantastic job with a delicate balance of am I crazy or are you crazy in trying to grasp the relational meaning of a very telling event with her husband and family that shattered any doubts of her husband's state of mind.It's a wonderfully set movie in the Austrian Alps and while I do not recommend it for many, I'm sure its audience will find it and love it, though it may not happen primarily in theatres (despite the fact that is certainly best viewing of the lovely cinematography!!!)I think the trailers, and the two great actors' comedic success, mislead many to expecting a comedy.

That's the feeling I had walking into the theatre for the Americanized re-make of one of my top 10 favorite movies from 2014 ... FORCE MAJEURE. Sure, it's common practice for U.S. filmmakers to farm international cinema for new projects, but when they mess with the really good ones, I can't help but feel nervous to the point of dread. A sliver of hope existed since this new version was co-written (along with Jesse Armstrong, creator of Succession, and Oscar nominated for IN THE LOOP) and co-directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, the creative forces behind THE WAY WAY BACK (2013).Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell star as married couple Billie and Pete. Along with their two teenage sons, they are on an Austrian ski trip meant to help Pete get through grieving his father's death, and bring the family closer together. If you have seen the original or the trailer, you know what happens next. Pete's reaction to a near catastrophic event creates a divide between him and the family ... especially Billie, who is left shaken. This part is all quite similar to the original film, yet this version is different in so many ways.Casting two brilliant comedic performers in the lead sends a strong signal that humor will play a role, and that the exceptional gravitas from filmmaker Ruben Ostlund's FORCE MAJEURE will be softened somewhat. Both of those points hold true. However, surprisingly, this re-make manages to still generate some of the shaken-to-the-core emotions that come from having trust broken in such a startling manner. Ms. Louis-Dreyfus is especially strong here, and carries a much heavier load than Mr. Ferrell. As she is balancing her shock, frustration, and anger, while still attending to their equally shaken boys, Mr. Ferrell is relegated to spending much of the film wearing a wounded puppy look as he attempts to move on without addressing the issue.Adding to the comedy elements are Zoe Chao (The Comeback) and Zach Woods (The Office) as Pete's friends who get drawn into the fracas. Miranda Otto takes a break from her usually dramatic roles to play Charlotte, a wacky resort employee whose personality is a bit out of step with normalcy; although her zaniness succeeds in preventing the weight of the event from crushing Billie. Fans of the original will recognize Kristofer Hivju, who plays a resort security advisor this time. Another difference is that the kids (Julian Grey, Ammon Jacob Ford) play a bigger role in the family dynamics and fallout.It's clear that filmmakers Faxon and Rash set out to purposefully make a more mainstream, accessible movie than the Swedish version. The film remains effective at generating conversation about survival instinct and protecting one's loved ones. It should be mentioned that this is not a typical Will Ferrell movie, and anyone expecting Frank the Tank, may only be pleased with one brief scene. Instead, this is about a man coming to grips with how his actions affected his family, and even his view of himself."}, {"id": 260, "text": "As Downhill (2020 release; 86 min.) opens, we get to know the Staunton family: Pete and Billie and their two boys have just arrived in the Alps for a ski vacation. The next day after some morning skiing, they head out for lunch on an outside terrace. Then a controlled avalanche goes wrong and comes barreling down the mountainside, straight towards the terrace. Just before it reaches the terrace, panic ensues and Pete grabs his phone and runs, leaving Billie and the kids. After the snow hits the terrace, everyone is okay, but Billie and the kids are in shock. And where is Pete? At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from co-writers and co-directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who previously brought us the excellent The Way, Way Back. Here they remake the 2014 Swedish film Force Majeure, which garnered worldwide attention and acclaim. Eventually Hollywood announced a remake, starring Will Ferrer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. My big fear was that the remake would be done as a comedy. If you've seen Force Majeure, you know that it is anything but a comedy. The good news is that Downhill is not an outright comedy, although there are certainly funny bits in it. The bad news is that it's simply not a great film, and it outright pales compared to the original. The worst of it is that, whereas the original was a 2 hr. movie looking at the complicated consequences of the avalanche incident, the remake runs short of 1 1/2 hr. and even then it doesn't focus nearly enough on the consequences of the avalanche incident. Instead the movie makes some diversions that go nowhere and are irrelevant to the core of the film. Julia Louis-Dreyfus (as Billie) tries to save the movie, and almost does, giving a terrific performance, but in the end it's not enough. Will Ferrell is horribly miscast as Pete, I mean what were the movie makers thinking? Kudos for the photography, which is eye-candy from start to finish, as well as for the original score, courtesy of Volker Bertelmann (a/k/a Hauschka). Bottom line: Downhill is the Hollywood remake of Force Majeure that nobody asked for.Downhill premiered at last month's Sundance film festival to ho-hum reaction, and is now seemingly rush-released into theaters. The movie opened wide this weekend and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (about 12 people). If you haven't seen Force Majeure, don't waste your time and money on Downhill and seek out Force Majeure instead. If you have seen Force Majeure, there is no point, none whatsoever, to see Downhill, but hey don't take my word for it and check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."}, {"id": 261, "text": "... you expected a daf mindless Will Ferrell film- u bias colored ur expectation and that expectation wasn't met so u felt disappointed and disliked it cause u wanted fun and to laugh - first let me tell you something I've realized about comedians : Bar none, they are amongst the absolute pinnacle of most intelligent humans amongst us - without question!

Because just because most comedies by definition can't be heavy, these comedians themselves are almost constantly dealing with concepts that, quite frankly to delve into let alone have an understanding of, is almost physically painful and certainly psychologically so - it's a living hell - as I child, who had an intrest in evolution and natural selection, once theorized that high intelligence would be selected against by means of suicide - because our species doesn't require this type of intelligence any more and most high iq eq humans suffer depression - so for fugg sake don't pigeon hole them into one genre and then be overly critical when they don't fit into what u want them to be - THIS FILM WAS GOOD, ALMOST VERY GOOD and it deserves a fair viewing because it's meaningful and the actors worked hard to convey the gravity or it all - just stop being so rigid and be grateful we have a cashe of talented individuals to make the content that, let's face it - we all consume in absurd quantities because our minds require distraction (because we no longer need to do daily chores merely to get thru and be comfortable for one day, because now... meh...) sorry but RE the film 7-8 stars no question"}, {"id": 262, "text": "I expected a screw-ball comedy-gone-flat, but was delightfully surprised by the humanity and thought that went into creating this film. Will Ferrel is cast against character, and though he almost pulls it off, something was left on the slope. JLD nails the caring, self-sacrificing mother quite well (later revealed to have achieved parenthood via in vitro). She's pretty funny, and very serious throughout and drawing viewers into her 'life,' and the intersection of parental roles, gender, age, and culture. When the family is confronted with a potentially life ending horror, one parent responds one way and the other, another, creating the conflict that defines the story...and it is not comedic; pure drama.Any parent will admit that there may be a point when they reconsider their choice to be parents, and it may seem like regret. This film explores those moments creatively and compassionately. There are some memorable scenes and some really thoughtful insights. A few false notes but nothing that deserves a negative overall rating. Keep an open mind and allow yourself to feel the funny AND painful parts of the story, just like life, and love, and parenting, and relationships."}, {"id": 263, "text": "Good movie, but I can see why people have issues with it.This is not a Hollywood comedy. It's not what audiences are going to expect when they see a movie stars Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. It's not a laugh-a-minute movie.This movie is about a couple in crisis, a crisis that starts when the Ferrell character acts like a coward when the ski resort the family is staying at is threatened by an avalanche. His character flees his family and runs for safety.The main part of the movie deals with the afterath. It's not a funny premise.About 15 years ago, Ricky Gervais started doing a show called The Office. Gervais found humor by exploring painful and embarrassing humor. It's not easy humor to grasp: it's not escapist humor, it's the kind of humor found by laughing at the human condition. It's not what Americans expect, esp. in a Will Ferrell movie.Downhill is an exercise in cringe humor. A view who goes in expecting that can appreciate the movie for what it's doing. And points need to go to Ferrell for playing such an awful, confused man. And Julia Louis-Dreyfus is terrific in the lead role.Having seen this movie, I now want to see Force Majeure, the Swedish movie it was based on. I would not be surprised to discover it's a much stronger movie. It is difficult to translate European comedies to Hollywood: Americans demand our comedies by light and fluffy. Feels like Downhill was a compromise, much as Cousins was a watered down version of Cousin, Cousine, and The Bird Cage was a watered down version of La Cage aux Folles.What really irritates me here is that, once again, the studio marketers badly misrepresented the nature of a movie just to sell tickets. Had the studio been honest about what the movie was trying to do, we would not be seeing so many 1-star reviews from people who had the wrong expectations about what this movie was."}, {"id": 264, "text": "Billie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Pete Staunton (Will Ferrell) are on an Austrian ski vacation with their two boys.

It has been rewritten and directed by comedic actors, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. They have become a great filmmaker duo following two poignant films with nice comedic touches; The Way Way Back and The Descendants. This one is a great disappointment. As a remake, this is an utter failure. It takes the unsaid and say it out loud. It takes the regular life and makes it wacky. While there are some compelling moves, this keeps feeling wrong.I try to envision not watching Force Majeure first and imagine watching this with virgin eyes. I don't know who came up with Charlotte but she seems to inhabit a wacky Will Ferrell comedy. I do not like Otto's accent or her character. The movie is trying to be wacky and then like an avalanche, it tries to be serious. It can be funny and serious but wackiness can often clash. In the big overarching premise, it's trying to be a wacky ski comedy from the 80's with a gigolo ski teacher and a swinging manager. It doesn't need it and doesn't want it. There are moments that intrigue me. I didn't really like Zach and Rosie except one moment at the end of the scene where Rosie is looking at Zach. I like the resolution of Billie and Pete but it goes a step too far. That's this movie at its core. I like a lot of it but it always goes one step too far.

As for Julia Louis-Dreyfus she plays a frustrated wife of Pete. She is very unhappy with her spouse and marriage. She doesn't bother to deny it for the children or peace sake.The performances was dull from both actors and the story quite dumb. As for the character I disliked to so much for being so inconsiderate and a trouble maker was the wife. Couldn't stand how plain &amp; old Julia Louis-Dreyfus looked in this film. She looks old enough to be the boys grandmother and not their mom.

There is great third lead by Zach Woods, who tries to be the good voice.The only thing I really did not like was the casting of Will Ferrell. Julia was casted fine, the anger was great. I had problems with Will though, he did great facial expressions, as short as this film is, you can tell is character is just not a good dad, at home or away.I was not familiar with the original , so that would be a strong reason why I enjoyed Downhill.My verdict, See it."}, {"id": 267, "text": "We didn't know this was a re-make.

And even though Julia &amp; Will are comedic actors, we didn't necessarily expect it to be a silly, hilarious movie.So - if you're thinking it's a fun RomCom, it's not. Would I have been disappointed if I'd seen and compared it to the original film? Probably. Is it the worst movie I've ever seen? Not at all.It's one of those real-life, awkward, uncomfortable films. I know a lot of times if a movie is real and uncomfortable, people hate it and rank it accordingly. We don't mind uncomfortable, because we get tired of predictable, wrap-it-all-up-in-a-pretty-bow endings. I thought JL-D's acting was excellent. When she told her version, it choked me up because I hadn't realized how impacted she and her children had felt. I watched the girlfriend's face (Rosie) as she heard the story. Loved watching her expressions change from surprise to dismay then judgment. I immediately knew whose side she believed. One reviewer thought the boys' looks were 'we know!/get us out of here' to the audience but I thought they also did a good, subtle, real acting job of portraying their disillusionment, disappointment in and disconnect from their father.Was it a great date night movie? No, not if you're dating and childless. As someone who's been married a long time with teen kids, too many moments were all too familiar. Was it a good story with good acting? Yes.

It was in this film that he shows how incapable he is of showing a depth of character. He had the opportunity to show real wisdom in this role, and with a partner like Louis-Dreyfus, who became an incredible, intense foil in this film, he didn't show up. Just as he didn't show up as the character struggling about his marriage in this film.The story is about Billie, Pete, and their two sons Finn and Emerson, on a once in lifetime ski trip in the Alps. There is a slight tension as they check into the hotel, Billie's tense smile and expressions show it.As the film wears on, there are moments when this tension subsides momentarily, but it is reflective when Billie has to keep reminding Pete to get off the phone and quit texting his workmate Zach (Zach Woods) and his new girlfriend Rosie (Zoe Chao). You get the sense that he's jealous of Zach.When a controlled avalanche barrels down on the lodge deck where they are sitting down to eat, Pete runs away from his family out of panic. Leaving Billie to wrap her arms around Finn and Emerson protecting them from the snow crashing around them.Pete's running away becomes the elephant in the room until they have cocktails with Rosie and Zach. Billie tells the story, and Pete tries to defend his behavior, which erupts into a huge fight bringing their marriage issues to the table.Here is where Ferrell's failings as a dramatic actor come to fore. When the camera focuses on him and the expression in his narrowly spaced eyes, there isn't much at home. He's like a child, and the audience realizes what Billie has been dealing with, raising three children, not two.As a side note, this is a remake of a film I saw in 2014, which was better in many ways.Louis-Dreyfus is fantastic in this film. I've never seen her act in a dramatic role, and she excels here. She has a very expressive face, and it tells the story as you need to know it. Ferrell is like a man child. He has minimal range, and his previous role as an overgrown elf probably fits him perfectly. Miranda Otto (Charlotte), as the hotel representative who tries to give Billie advice about living her life more fully, is hilarious. Jesse Armstrong and Nat Faxon wrote a good screenplay. Faxon directed the film, and despite Ferrell's inability to put depth into his role, the rest of the film was terrific.Overall: I was severely disappointed in the way Ferrell's performance hurt this story."}, {"id": 269, "text": "Downhill seems to have come from out of nowhere. Suddenly, there is a Will Ferrell movie in the theaters opening on Valentine's Day weekend; and, multi-Emmy-winning comedienne, Julia Louis-Dreyfus is co-lead. One would think that there is comedy gold here, so why isn't there more promotion. Well, there's a little misdirection, here. Downhill is a Hollywood remake of an acclaimed Swedish film, Force Majeure, which was more of a drama than a comedy; and Downhill sets itself apart by adding more obvious comedy elements here, whether or not they are necessary is a separate issue. Nevertheless, the synopsis is as follows: a married couple on a family ski vacation in the Austrian Alps after narrowly escaping an avalanche deal with the simmering tensions and the reality of life and their relationship.Actually, the premise is quite fascinating. I won't say exactly what happens with the avalanche, but it's pretty well depicted in the trailer. It is a funny situation, but it also is very serious. The problem is that the balance of the tone of the film is not well calibrated. The producers cast comedy stars and asked them to perform in this uneven mix of drama and comedy. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is great. She's captivating. Her performance mines the wry wit of all that happens, and she hits the emotional depth of the drama. Will Ferrell, on the other hand, is ill-equipped to meet the gauntlet that Louis-Dreyfus throws down. Some of the comedy and reactions of Ferrell are good; but, ultimately, his skill with the dramatic elements is lacking. The push and pull of the couple is the main source of comedy and dramatic tension, and the fact that Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus are so unmatched make it ultimately unsatisfying. It really feels like Ferrell was only cast so that Downhill can be marketed as a Will Ferrell comedy, which it is not.Additionally, Miranda Otto shows up intermittently as a resort guide, who is ingratiating herself with the main couple. She is boldly only there for comic relief. I felt she was completely unnecessary. Otto is having such a ball as this boozy, free-loving lady that she seems dropped in from another movie. There was no genuine laugh coming from anything she did.On a positive note, the scenery is beautiful. The film is well-shot and may make you consider going to the Alps on a ski vacation. It's not something that I would want to do, but it looks great. Downhill's other saving grace is the modest runtime. Although it takes a while for the film to get to the meat of its action, it doesn't feel belabored. It gets to its point. I only wish it had actually been either funnier, or that Louis-Dreyfus had a more capable comedic and dramatic actor to work with.So, Downhill has a good premise, but an uneven cast. The film is short and it looks good for those who want to go skiing. It is not as funny as it pretends to be and the dramatic tension feels weak. I suggest waiting for this one to be on your favorite streaming service. There is a compelling conversation to be had after seeing what happens here if you give it a chance. Actually, give Force Majeure itself a viewing.

Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus both lead this bummed out dramedy, and neither do a particularly impressive job throughout. There are flickers of potential from each of them, but that, and the pretty cinematography, is really the main thing the film has to offer. What is left of this dull adaptation, is a shallow, depressing, and bland reincarnation of a story that you will cringe watching at parts, and struggle to stay awake at others. It's a very repetitive and annoying film, as it tries again and again to shove down the viewers throat just how horrible it seems to be for the main two characters to be parents. I'm not discounting that fact, but the approach to it in the film feels all but subtle. The script is incredibly formulaic, the family itself incredibly generic and annoying, and it feels so lost within its own sense of grief and betrayal that you tend to lack any emotion while watching the film at all. In the end, Downhill isn't a total disaster, but a disaster nevertheless. It has so few rewarding comedies, and at best it struggles a few mediocre scenarios to capture the viewer's attention, but very few at that.

The writers did a wonderful job of not doing their job, and they created a group of unbelievable, half-witted, air-headed, millennial-type characters all doing unbelievable, half-witted, air-headed, millennial type things.

Concerning the directive efforts...I won't even go there, because the words needed to describe that area, in this movie, cannot be used in an open-to-the-public forum, such as this. I was happy to see attempts were made to conserve wherever possible. An example would be the growths of an organism on the side of an actor's face. Obviously, the appliances used were leftovers from that midnight meat train movie. In summary, the crew made a good effort, as crews usually do; the acting sucked; the writing sucked; the direction sucked times 2 and the entire movie sucked. However, I could SEE and HEAR the movie.

With the two stars of this movie, Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, both being known primarily for their comedic talents people could easily be mislead into thinking this is an out and out comedy. While there are moments of humour sprinkled throughout (mostly just through Will Ferrell being so naturally funny in most things he says), this would have to go down as an out and out drama in my opinion. It's actually really dark in places and can give you quite an uneasy feeling while watching it. From that point of view I thought it was a reasonably well made film.This is a remake of the 2014 film 'Force Majeure'. Americans tend to get a hard time when they remake European films. I never saw the original so can't compare the two, but I know it would at least be different in the sense that these are American characters in Europe. The 'Americans being Americans' aspect is played up quite a bit throughout the film. It leads to some pretty awkward scenes and it's not always clear whether this is intentional or not. The film really isn't an easy watch looking back on it.'Downhill' is extremely short scraping in at just 86 minutes (6 minutes of which are credits). Typically films like this like to stick around a little longer in order to expand the relationship deterioration arc and give a little more depth to each character's perspective. The film does feel quite rushed. It's safe to say that the acting talents of Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus play in a big part in keeping this the watchable film that it is. I certainly can't recommend this as a must-see film, but I do think the current IMDb rating of 4.8 is harsh and unwarranted. It may be a bleak film but it does what it sets out to reasonably well."}, {"id": 276, "text": "Downhill Review:Downhill is the remake of the 2014 Swedish film Force Majeure following a family barely escaping an avalanche during a ski vacation in the Alps. After the events, Billie (Dreyfus) and Pete (Farrell) are thrown into disarray as they are forced to reevaluate their lives and how they feel about each other. This played at Sundance however we missed it because we already had tickets to another movie, a pretty bad one may I add. In downtown Park City they advertised Downhill everywhere and even had a shop for it. The reviews came in the next day from critics and they said it was just ok. A few weeks later now and audiences are absolutely hating it giving it a 14% and a D CinemaScore. I don't know if it's just me but I enjoyed Downhill a lot more than I thought and what most people thought. I think the main problem people have with it is the tone. With the comedic talent of Dreyfus and Farrell, most everyone was expecting a comedy. Every time someone leaves the theater whenever I'm working, almost everyone says I thought it would be funnier or That was really weird. Even one person got so furious at us and went on a long rant almost claiming that it was our fault. Needless to say, this is a drama with some light hearted moments. It's not just a comedy. With the subject matter I could hardly see it being a full on comedy. Being a skier I found some parts to be pretty funny because I could relate to some of it. Even the other humor I thought was funny. Miranda Otto's character is either going to be pretty funny or pretty stupid to some. Otto had a funny performance to me and she did fairly well. I could almost say the same thing for Will Farrell's character. The whole film is kind of choosing who's side your on and if you don't like Farrell's choices it might just hold an affect on his whole character. I thought he had his comedic moments and did well. Obviously it's not his most amazing role ever, but for more of a drama I think it's a good suited role for him. However nothing compared to Julia-Louis Dreyfus's performance. She gave it her all. This is an early prediction but others have been saying this as well. It would be great to see her get a nomination for the Golden Globes next year. She really can put on a good fight scene that's realistic and emotional. I think people just look too much at the negatives for this film. To me there's more positives than negatives. Like before, there's good acting and I thought the screenplay was good. Many negative reviews compare it to the original international film and how it's not ad good as it. There's rarely a time where an adaptation from an international film to an English film is even better. The cinematography with the beautiful scenery is just gorgeous to look at. There's a nice contrast of the blue sky with the white snow. Volker Bertelmann's score is really good and I've been listening to it for a couple weeks now. It's fun, sounds like winter, and there's inspiration from traditional music that originates from the Alps. Overall it's just a really good score and maybe, once again another early prediction, it could potentially get a notation. Of course there's some negatives. The runtime is really short and I think there would be some benefits with extending it a little more. Some characters needed a little more development, and I think the marketing could've been better as it said it would be more of a comedy. The tone sometimes was a little uneven but I didn't mind that too much. Downhill is getting too much of a bad rap and it's honestly not that bad. I'd recommend it for a fast film to watch and it's pretty enjoyable to watch.My Grade: B+"}, {"id": 277, "text": "Had this film existed before Ruben Ostlund's wonderfully subtle but quite a heavyweight cinematic commentary, this movie would have been received as one of the more favorable Hollywood light comedy of the recent years which is quite a splended slight departure for Will Ferrell that's way more restrained than his usual output. Or maybe it would have been more effective as a cable network mini-series adaptation of three or four 40-minute parts because there are lots of comedic material one could squeeze out in that winter resort setting expanding it (though some might say that's dumbing down) would have made good use of Faxon's and Rash's solid background in American television comedies, not to mention the minted reputation of Louis-Dreyfus. It could have helped people dissect the brilliance of what the emotionally and philosphically-dense Swedish social-comedic masterpiece has accomplished despite only having a very taut premise. They would even be forgiven had they borrowed some tricks in the Seinfeld TV show toolbox to tweak the narrative by using American characters. There are fans like me who certainly wouldn't mind.So as a one-off feature film, Downhill just ended up becoming that average film that looks significantly dimwitted when compared to the presence of the mammoth that is Force Majeure, which is quite unfair because, I'm gonna cite one example, even though that avalanche scene was executed decently, but comparison-wise, that's just where the lopsidedness actually manifests, so #ForeverInTheShadow of Force Majeure this film turned out to be.My rating: C-flat."}, {"id": 278, "text": "People expecting a light hearted comedy, will of course be dissapointed.

Pete cannot quite leave his phone alone as he follows the holiday of his unmarried co-worker Zach played by Zack Woods. Let's say he's pining for the free as a breeze #. But the family do manage to get in some prime skiing on the slopes. The beautiful cinematography by Danny Cohen is worth the price of admission alone. Until a controlled avalanche comes crashing around them as they lunch alfresco. Well not quite around them all as Pete grabs his beloved phone and staggers off as quickly as his snow boots can carry him.Nat Faxon &amp; Jim Rash direct what initially I thought was a comedy but is in fact a brutal dissection of a marriage, with comedy on the side. As Billie brushes snow off herself and their boys on the cafe veranda, Pete comes back and calmly orders soup. While we are still in awkward shock of this moment the couple make a complaint but they are told by Kristofer Hivju that they aren't in America anymore where you can sue when the coffee is too hot. Kerching. Warnings had been posted all over. Pete thinks he might have seen them! So why didn't Billie the attorney not notice them I wondered if we're placing blame?When the family arrived Billie and Pete shared a sink in their lovely suite, but there's no room for Pete now to share with Billie, and he is banished to the other side of the mirror with his own sink. You could say the mirror is cracked in this frosty new environment. The simple facade of a happy marriage was sorely tested when the family were left to fend by themselves. And the event is painfully acted out when Zach and his girlfriend Zoe Chao's Rosie arrive unexpectedly. At Pete's invitation! With Pete stressing how you cannot run very quickly in snow boots. But as far as Billie was concerned this was the moment that Pete saved himself rather than his family. With the avalanche controlled the Austrian authorities were expecting no casualties, but she didn't know.Taking time out Billie gives us the comedy with Miranda Otto's man hungry hotel manageress, providing Billie with a ski instructor we can all fall for. Giulio Berruti could be the traumatised Billie's comfort break, but not recommended for solo play in a bathroom afterwards, wearing ski gear and those damn ski boots that get in the way of everything. But Pete doesn't fare any better in the family friendly resort with the two boys. Already ashamed of him, he over enthuses with the boys, and gets thrown off the toboggan ride. A very funny comic moment for him comes when he is flattered by a woman via her friend, oops sorry wrong man. But Will Ferrell's comedic talents are used more as the embarrassing Dad. And disappointing husband, as eventually cutting the 'I'm fine' tension, Billie can no longer hold in her feelings at Pete's failure to care for his family.The film is a remake of a Swedish film Force Majeure that won a prize at Cannes 2014 and the 86 minutes is perfectly timed to give you the trauma of the avalanche moment, and the more devastating after effects. The whole holiday was a disaster in the adult resort where the kids would have enjoyed more the nearby family one. All that way for the boys to be on their devices. And not just the kids. But I did have some sympathy for Pete and the heliskiing trip that was a disaster.I was pleased that the film wasn't purely a comedy, with Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus raising the dramatic tone, and elevating it to a very awkward, in a good way, and interesting watch in how a marriage can fall apart in just one moment. You'll leave feeling a little shell shocked with what just happened."}, {"id": 280, "text": "Downhill is a somewhat uncomfortable watch with two of cinemas most flamboyant comedians trapped in a script that fails to channel the depth and skill they're known for. While there are attempts and successful moments of hilarity, this Dramedy leans more to the drama but surprisingly delivers honest truths that will resonate with the relationships or marriages we are in.The event that sets the stage for the story allows for powerful unspoken moments, expressions of hurt and internalised disappointment that would be delivered and felt by any long term couple who encountered a situation like the lead characters.For a fleeting moment we are given an answer to Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver's impeccable storytelling in Marriage Story before the film itself feels like it's also on a weak layered fracture of snow physically taking the form of the film's title.Dreyfus and Ferrell play the vulnerability and emotional detriment of their relationship spectacularly, but they are hugely let down by the hollow comedy of the script which does little to extract the goldmine of the setup and peel back layers on their characters and sound acting ability."}, {"id": 281, "text": "The Hollywood remake of one of the best films of the last decade, Force Majeure, Downhill is a desperately disappointingly watch at times. Not only does it fail to live up to the brilliance of the original film, but it misses the mark with its own ideas about marriage, family and individuality, proving frustratingly simplistic all the way through.The film does gather a little bit of assurance in its latter stages, bolstered by Julia-Louis Dreyfus' performance which almost single-handedly saves the film from total mediocrity.But as an exercise in emotional drama, Downhill is a disappointment. As a dark comedy, it's a disappointment. And as a retelling of one of the most memorable films in recent years, it's a huge disappointment.Before going too heavy on the comparisons with Force Majeure, let's just look at Downhill in and of itself. It's certainly not a terrible film, impressing with gorgeous visuals, the odd smirk of laughter and a strong turn from Dreyfus.However, it never manages to find its feet as it tries to juggle both interesting and dark emotional drama with more run-of-the-mill Hollywood humour.Will Ferrell, for all his best intentions, is miscast in this role, too often relying on active comedic energy that isn't really what the story requires to be more interesting or entertaining. And that's a misconception that seems to run through the film as a whole.With an overly simplistic take on its core themes about relationships and individuality, Downhill is disappointingly dull all the way through, seeming to come up with an answer to its main thematic questions within the first act, and then leaving a fairly random thread hanging for the rest of the film.Compare that with Force Majeure, a deliriously entertaining dark comedy that bubbles with tension and emotional intensity all the way through, and Downhill is even more disappointing.From Palme D'Or-winning director Ruben \u00d6stlund, Force Majeure is a perfect example of the brilliance of tense and cagey drama that hits close to home, but brought to life with darkly fun-loving energy and a Scandinavian twist.Force Majeure a film that has everything, working as a comedy, a drama and even a thriller. Downhill, on the other hand, is rushed in its first act, uneventful in its second, and only briefly interesting and original come the finale.In Downhill, Julia-Louis Dreyfus is the bright spark, giving a performance filled with pent-up rage that gives a brief hint at the provocative drama that Force Majeure hits home with so effectively.Meanwhile, directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash lack the penetrating energy of \u00d6stlund in Force Majeure, also missing the mark with the film's focal scene that should have been a strong foundation for the story to the finish.Whereas \u00d6stlund made the avalanche that sets off the chain of events a striking moment that sticks in the mind, Faxon and Rash seem to skip over it too quickly, only then raising it again later on when the story requires it. And in that, the drama and tension is never as well-built nor natural as Force Majeure makes it.Overall, Downhill is a roundly disappointing watch both on its own terms and as a remake of Force Majeure. Its Swedish source material is far, far better in every way, and although this American remake has a few bright sparks, it misses the mark on its comedy and drama throughout."}, {"id": 282, "text": "We're not in America, where you sue because your coffee's hot, madam.Based on Ruben Ostlund's Swedish Force Majeure, the American remake, Downhill, shows the same theme: Is a man a coward when leaving behind his family to flee an avalanche threatening to engulf them all. The sluggish skiing vacation turns out disastrously as Billie (Julia Louis Dreyfuss) and her boys virtually shun dad (Will Farrell) for his perceived cowardice.I hoped for an extensive debate about the uncertainty over what he did, and by extension the demands made in modern times on the male ego, where giving women newfound freedom and respect, the man may be judged by outdated standards of chivalry. Lacking the original's Scandinavian cool, this typically American, cumbersome tale film takes too little time parsing the act and too much time with cheesy process shots and slow reactions lacking insight or debate.Dreyfuss has the meatier role, doing less of her Elaine clueless but more of her sure-as hell-persona. When she says, I throw my arms around my children and I just wait ... I wait for us to die together, any thought that this might be a comedy is gone. Although Downhill is billed as such, no comedy is really discernible except when she struggles with an instructor. Ferrell has the thankless role of the coward who can't defend himself because the script doesn't allow him room to work out a defense. As is always the case with a Ferrell character, he's bound to be humiliated and probably not know it.Friends make lame defenses for him with instinctive survival reaction theory, but it isn't even Ferrell defending himself nor is it cogent argumentation. Thank goodness for the isolating one shots of the two principals: their interchanges are largely her declamations of his cowardice and his looking guilty. As for the shots of the Alps, no challenge there--any screensaver can give you the same glory; for instance, when the characters talk with a white mountain background, it's mostly green screen and not very convincing.Male courage will have to be deconstructed in a better movie. For Downhill, I will revisit the Scandinavian original to see if the theme is better relayed, or if not, if its subtlety wins the day. Meanwhile males, you're not going to like the exposure in either film."}, {"id": 283, "text": "LIKES:Beautiful Setting Orchestra Music Deep Morals and Meaning Occasionally FunnyDISLIKES:The Acting Is A Touch Overdone The Kids Involvement In the Film Focus On the Awkward The Banter That Is Not Fun Feels Both Lows and Truncated Attempts to insert Culture With Art Could Not Pick Drama Vs. Comedy The VERDICT:This reskin was not the best face lift Hollywood has given in my opinion. Though cinematography has revealed a wonderful setting and the artistic approach sells the lessons at hand, the film itself is rather boring. This is primarily due to the presentation having difficulty choosing a lane to present the film, with artistic display vs American entertainment battling it out for first. Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus can't seem to find the chemistry for an award-winning performance and the other characters do little to enhance the experience outside of awkward banter and some forced comedy. It goes to show that a movie like this can keep an original skin and be appreciated, like we saw in the Academy Awards, but for this reviewer, the remake is not worth the trip to the theater. I would suggest this is at best a free stream or watching on cable to get your best investment.My scores are:Comedy/Drama: 5.0 Movie Overall: 3.0"}], "reviews_amount": 284}
