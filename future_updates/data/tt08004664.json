The movie felt a little repetitive and predictable at times. I didn't find it very scary either. The monster was cool but didn't really do anything. Mostly just creeped around the entire time. Generous 6 stars."}, {"id": 2, "text": "So basically they took Babadook, took off his hat and named him Larry. Nice one time watch. View and forget"}, {"id": 3, "text": "I really enjoyed Come Play, I thought it was orignal and had a really creepy vibe to it. Yes it was a very simple plot but either way it was enjoyable."}, {"id": 4, "text": "The movie has a decent, but flimsy, premise that sets up some good early scares. The problem is that these characters barely act like people, let alone parents of a pre teen autistic child. Even when the film tries to put a twist on a few cliches in some scenes it doubles down on those same cliches in the rest of the film. Solid CGI and a few good ideas make this horror flick at least entertaining, but too inconsistent to be more than passable."}, {"id": 5, "text": "The field of horror movies is dominated by mediocrity. A lot of horrors are actually awful, and only a select few are actually good or great. This one is perfectly medicore in every aspect. It's exactly what you can expect from a mediocre horror movie, nothing more, nothing less."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Come Play tries to be something more substantial than just another cheap horror flick, and for that, I give it due credit. It's unfortunate, then, that it's often slow and boring. It's clear that it makes an effort at connecting on an emotional level, but again, it simply fails."}, {"id": 7, "text": "The trailer looked good so I buckled up and gave it two hours of my life. And I'm glad I did. The build up to finally seeing Larry the was worth it, and it was honestly creepy. I had a few good goose bump moments... but I never got jump scared like other reviewers said. I was kinda hoping that the story was going to go in a different direction then it did, I was hoping Larry really was misunderstood, but I'm satisfied with the ending, albeit a bit predictable... it was rather sad... so If you got a soft spot i'd recommended having a tissue nearby."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This movie freaked me the hell out, though I took off a star for jump scares. Overall, it had me on the edge of my seat and the monster was scary. It's a good, creepy movie and it's definitely worth the watch."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Like the top comment said (at this time) I wish directors would stop being directors and producers. I agree with this sentiment exactly. Every horror film I have watched recently that fell flat on its face, has ended with Directed and Written By:Movie was done well, and was probably budge-friendly due to all the low quality phone shots, but the concept was kinda dumb. Seemed like an obvious bite off of It Follows, but instead of the metaphor of STD's, it's about kids always on their phones."}, {"id": 10, "text": "It's very child focused, but is probably too scary for little ones, all of the adults feel like they're being portrayed as childish fools &amp; teens would most likely laugh at it, so who is Come Play for?Without looking, It feels like this is from a very junior team of writers, production staff &amp; directors, but having said that, it does look good, but it's only a very thin veneer of horror with regular appearances of Sponge Bob &amp; an over reliance of tech to allow the stories plot. The scene where the parents explain what they think is happening to each other is totally laughable, in fact I did!It's not bad bad &amp; it's not funny bad, but it's just very so-so; if the point is to say get off of screens &amp; gadgets, well we can all agree with that, so let's go........"}, {"id": 11, "text": "I kinda forgot how the story went but i'm pretty sure this is just Babadook with iphones and fwends. The sfx isn't that great and some of the characters actions are questionable, but the spooks are pretty good, just the right amount of cheap jump-scares and smart atmospheric spoopiness here and there. Still, if you haven't seen Babadook i'd recommend that over this."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I've seen better and worse, but for what it is, as a PG-13 horror movie, I think it does really well. It's short on scares, so don't go into this hoping to be scared out of your mind, but I think the emotional power that the message conveys is definitely worth a viewing. Definitely struck my heart strings by the ending. It's definitely derivative of several movies, but it's pretty good for sure."}, {"id": 13, "text": "I started watching this movie without any expectations but this movie was a really nice surprise. It has a good mixture of jump scare without it being overwhelming and the storyline was good also good. It has nice effects and good sound effects. I highly recommend it if you are in the mood for a good horror/thriller with a twist into the modern."}, {"id": 14, "text": "So I went to see this movie cause it was a horror movie finally in Dolby (after Tenet held the theater for like 6 weeks) and I absolutely loved it. I thought it was paced very well for tension and excitement but it also allowed for character development which is always great to see in a horror movie. The characters that you thought would be cookie cutter roles that you seen a hundred times in scary movies end up surprising you in how they turn out. The monster was definitely scary and kept a great suspense going the whole time. And then, it finished off with a very strong ending. I want to learn more about the monster and would love a sequel. 10/10. (Gillian Jacobs definitely did not Brita this up!)"}, {"id": 15, "text": "The amount of times spongebob is referenced or clips of it that are played in this horror film is unforgivable. This was not scary at all. I WISH I had not spent $20 to watch this. But, it had great reviews which I now believe are fake or payed for. Theres no way people actually like this movie. No way. They also tried REALLY hard to have a deep meaning about technology and social media and it made an already bad movie suck even worse with that failed delivery. Just awful. I tried so hard to find a redeeming part of this crap show and couldnt find one. Save your money!"}, {"id": 16, "text": "This movie was so hard to watch for so many reasons. The writing was awful. Totally unbelievable social interactions take place throughout the movie. In a movie this bad, I wish I would have at least gotten to see Larry clearly. I did not think there was an agenda here but I found it in the specific choices for the people helping Oliver (only kid of the three to not be a total jerk initially, the teacher, and the doctor)."}, {"id": 17, "text": "I liked this movie. i had low expectations for this film due to its cheesy plot in the trailer, but ultimately was pleasantly surprised. It was scary, had good pacing so it didnt feel too long, and the heartfelt story of the family really made me connect to them. interesting yet good emotional ending. I like these horror movies that dont get a lot of fame but are done well. Plus they show the villain quite a bit. 8/10"}, {"id": 18, "text": "This movie may be rated for 13+, but I know many adults that would be thoroughly spooked by this one.There's really very little that I can say I disliked about this movie, it was well-shot, the acting was good, the pacing kept me interested throughout and the idea is fairly fresh.If there's one misgiving I have about the film, is the audio. The show jumps back and forth, between using almost inaudible whispers to extremely loud bangs. Something I usually expect from horrors, getting the audience to lean-in and listen before a scare, but it was a little overused here.Overall though, fantastic film, made my Halloween much more spoopy."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I think this movie was great, only a bit too fast in the begining and we don't get a good picture of how Larry looks like but most of it was great, good acting from the kids, good story, Larry is scary and it had a good ending which made my heart melt."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Movie does the excellent job to depict the struggle that every parents has with children with ASD. For me its not abut the monsters, its about cleverly interconnected pallet of art pieces, bravo !!!"}, {"id": 21, "text": "This movie scared the heck out of me and very sad ending"}, {"id": 22, "text": "I think Come Play had the potential to be something much better than the version I saw. It has an intriguing core (that connects from an emotional standpoint) and some okay jumpscares. However, the performances aren't that great (Gillian Jacobs had me laughing unintentionally on at least a couple of occasions), the kid's autism is treated as a mere plot device, and from the moment the physical manifestation of the creature is revealed, the film progressively got less scary. Now, I know it's easier to sustain viewer interest in a short film (which I'm sure was the reason for its success) but for a 95-minute feature, there has to be more meat to characters and some level of logic that works within its creepy, manipulative universe. Writer-director Jacob Chase doesn't capitalize on the premise (that of a monster using electrical devices to abduct a child) and delivers a ho-hum horror escapade that I'll forget pretty soon."}, {"id": 23, "text": "This movie is a little gem of a horror film. Not saying it's the best but for what it's worth, it scores points on some decent scares using electronic devices. It's refreshing to see that we haven't run out of ideas just yet. Great acting by Julian Jacobs. Definitely worth a watch."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Nothing to see here, folks. I had the privilege of seeing this movie alone in the theater with my friend and we had fun pointing out things during this tame movie. For example, in one scene the dad is working in his booth and there are pamphlets blowing everywhere. The perspective shows the dad in the front of the screen with the pages flying in the background. Suddenly, a collection of papers - *gasp!* - hit something, forming the shape of a man standing there. 1. This has been done before (see The Conjuring). 2. The monster in the movie looks nothing like a man... why did the collection of papers form that shape?Another scene, near the climax of the movie, the mom cries, I wish you were normal! to her son. But the monster is chasing them throughout their house and things are chaotic. The timing was awful there; shouldn't she have been more concerned about their safety? Also, the adults are quite ignorant. Can't they think of anything to do against this baddie than run or throw electronics out of the house? The dad tries to outsmart it by locking it in his booth, but... I mean, the monster just got in with all of the doors closed, you think that's going to stop it? It didn't even work, as the dad is attacked mere moments later.Come Play borrows things from more successful movies like Poltergeist and The Conjuring. It's nothing but lame jump scares that would seemingly only frighten newcomers to the horror genre. Gillian Jacobs, who I loved in Community, gives a good effort but the movie just stinks. It's also repetitive... get used to seeing the cover of the novel the monster appears in, and get used to the first few pages; they will be read often. Sadly, parts are also predictable. We see the kid using his dad's digital measuring tool, and sure enough, the monster, who is mostly invisible in the movie, is measured by him. The distance gets smaller and smaller... we all saw that coming. Mama asks her son to look her in the eye, which he doesn't do; he is autistic, and that's how it is. But of course, the boy eventually does.Lame movie, not worth your time."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Most characters have a story arch which is a rare thing in recent movies. The plot is simple and very predictable, but it doesn't hurt the overall enjoyment of the flick.The horror is tense yet offers nothing new to the genre.

This movie was so bad, I don't even know where to begin. - there was nothing scary about it (a few typical monster scenes that we have all seen 100x's in any other horror movie);, and a few routine jump-scares. Other than that, - nothing -- I fell asleep twice from boredom. - Believe me, I'm not being a jerk, just being honest with the hopes that I can save some of you some time (and possibly money if ur renting).

I love it!!!!!!"}, {"id": 32, "text": "Larry the monster is just plain scary, no wonder he has no friends. John Gallagher Jr is awesome as always.

Top that off with an emotional story line and a sympathetic monster and you have a good time at the movie theater."}, {"id": 33, "text": "Let me just start this off by saying this film has its moments of genuinely good horror, but it's still very clunky. I think if you take out Spongebob then you have something here. I think it would've worked better if they made up a cartoon character instead of using the most innocent character known to man. He's basically the secondary antagonist. The first being Oliver's mom, of course. Ditch Spongebob and make a more focused and serious horror movie. When you watch a horror movie, you usually try to put yourself in the role of the main character and try to feel what it's to be them, and all I could think is what show Larry (awful name for a horror villain, especially when there is a Spongebob character named Larry) would try to lure me in with. If you want a good laugh, imagine this movie but replace Spongebob with the Youtuber or cartoon you were obsessed with as a kid. To me, a monster named Larry trying to kidnap me by using South Park clips is delightfully dumb. The entire movie reeks of 3am calling Spongebob gone wrong Youtube videos. I'm not kidding you when I say there is a scene where Larry tries to lure the main kid in with a kitchen sponge. It was hilarious. There's not much else to say. I hope everyone who made this had fun and is proud of it, but for me, I think it was an interesting idea with some good moments, but is still heavily flawed with its characters, message, and overall badaling decisions."}, {"id": 34, "text": "This movie was based on a short film by the same director and as a short it probably work but in the same way as Lights Out and Mama it's not enough to be a full feature. A scary 5 minute movie can seldom be stretched into 90 minutes without loosing the things that make it scary. The movie is decently made but not enough to make a lasting impression. It would have been better if the studio let the director make a new movie instead of just making a longer movie of his short story.I hope the director gets a chance to make another movie with new material to show his potential like David F Sandberg."}, {"id": 35, "text": "To be clear, this was not nearly as good as that film, which ranks as one of my all time favorites. But it's got some similarities. We have a young boy with emotional issues, a mother troubled with how to relate to him, and something very creepy haunting the boy. The positives: I felt that the boy's Autism was authentically portrayed. I loved the concept of how the demon presents itself. The acting is strong and there were were some good jump scares. I was also impressed with the very unexpected and satisfying ending. The negatives: Some unrealistic character decisions, slow pacing at times, and over long. There isn't much in the theaters right now so If you're in the mood for a horror film on the big screen, this is well worth your time."}, {"id": 36, "text": "This movie was sooo good Decent scares, with a heartwarming message.

This is a horror movie that is based on a 2017 short film. It's a little different than the usual monster movies because Larry-the name of the creature-is just looking for a friend. 'Won't you be my neighbor....Ahem, I mean friend?' Azhy is a child with a speaking problem; he doesn't speak. He uses an app on his phone to do his speaking for him. He also uses an iPad, which is where he first comes across Larry. Larry lives in another dimension and uses smart phones and other mobile devices to try to materialize into our world. He uses incredible amounts of electricity while doing so-lights will dim or break when he is near. Gillian and John are Azhy's parents, who don't know how to handle him so they seek out the help of a professional doctor, Eboni. You might wonder how everyone knows anything about Larry. That's because there is a story on the iPad that explains everything you need to know about Larry-it's written much like a children's story, with pictures. Whenever Larry finds a candidate to be his friend, all he has to do is touch hands-like shaking a friends' hand-and they will accompany Larry back to his dimension.

Hopes are always high this time of year for a creative new horror film. As each Halloween approaches, we search for new movies that will frighten us in an entertaining way, or at least be creepy enough to make us sleep with the lights on! Looking to be this year's horror breakout, writer-director Jacob Chase has expanded his own 2017 5-minute short film LARRY into a full-length feature film.Azhy Robertson (the young son in Noah Baumbach's Oscar nominated MARRIAGE STORY, 2019) stars as Oliver, a dead-ringer for Danny Torrance in THE SHINING (1980). Oliver is an autistic, non-verbal boy who has no friends and depends on his electronic devices to communicate and entertain (he loves SpongeBob SquarePants). His parents, Sarah (Gillian Jacobs, Community) and Marty (John Gallagher Jr, SHORT TERM 12, 2013) constantly argue, which exacerbates Oliver's hyper-sensitivity. When Dad moves out, an overwhelmed mother does her best to follow the advice of Oliver's therapist. What she doesn't know initially is that some being or creature named Larry is tracking her son through an online story called Misunderstood Monsters that pops up on his mobile devices.Larry just wants a friend. As the story slowly unfolds on the tablet Oliver's dad found in the lost &amp; found in the parking lot booth where he works, we come to understand exactly what is happening, and who and what Larry really is. The theme has some similarities to Jennifer Kent's excellent film, THE BABADOOK (2014), with a dose of THE RING (2002), but the suspense never builds to that level despite a nice performance from young Mr. Robertson.A clever twist actually ends up lessening the fright factor here. The monster can (mostly) only be seen via the mobile devices, which means the visuals are often limited by the size of the screen, although I'm a fan of the practical effects. Because of this, sound effects are critical, as are the reactions of Oliver and his parents ... as well as the classmates unfortunate enough to get volunteered for a sleepover.It seems only fitting that in 2020, loneliness is the real monster, and technology is the conduit for its impact. Additionally, all parents will relate to the extremes Sarah and Marty go to protect Oliver, and the final scene does offer an all-knowing moment that reverts to a simpler time ... one that Larry wouldn't appreciate."}, {"id": 58, "text": "It was like kids scary story but not horror as I expected, I liked the concept of the loneliness and the autism spectrum point but I still see it just spooky yet sad ending that broke my heart"}, {"id": 59, "text": "I am very desensitised to horror movies.

You've seen a lot of it before in movies like Babadook (family psychology myths), The Conjuring (retro clothing and things going bump in the night), Insidious (boy targeted by spirit trying to come through from another dimension), and there are even echoes of Sixth Sense (hiding under blankets, walking around a house at night). So no, this premise is not original. But that doesn't mean you won't like it. I love a good genre flick done well, and I felt like this one did some shining (pun) and some stumbling. Overall, it wasn't a waste of money and I would recommend it, depending on your taste.DO WATCH IT if you enjoy: 1. Horror with a deeper underlying meaning 2. Family-centric plots 3. Worlds where humans turn out to be mostly good people 4. Jump scares 5. Slow burn moody movies 6. An ending that actually ends and doesn't unnecessarily set up a sequel, just in case the film does well and the studio wants to cash in (sorry, rant over) 7. Believable acting (mostly)However, DON'T watch it if any of the following grates on you: 1. Lights always flicker when monster is near 2. Parent, although terrified for child, constantly leaves child alone in rooms, outdoors, etc so they are conveniently vulnerable 3. Vague family drama where parents can't stay together for some unexplained reason 4. Always walking toward the dark closet/corner where you think a terrifying monster might be instead of running 5. Standing and staring where monster is instead of running 6. Phones don't work right when monster is near 7. No clear rules on how monster appears, what it can affect or how it goes away, but still it goes away...maybeSPOILER ALERT When a struggling, well intentioned, couple with an autistic child find themselves stressed out over family life, they decide to take some time apart. Meanwhile their sun, Oliver, is unable to speak yet due to his disability and is having trouble making friends. Enter bullies, but not like you'd think. There's no hardcore bullying here, and the bully aspect is half-hearted at best. In any case, Oliver is lonely. But he's not the only one.Sarah, his mom, is also lonely; frustrated that she's bearing the brunt of raising Oliver and trying to determine what's best for him while her husband Marty is at work. Marty isn't a typical absentee father-he cares for Oliver and wants to help, but doesn't understand the strain Sarah is under.But there is another character in the family: a malicious being trapped in cell phones and iPads, reaching out with an offer of friendship to Oliver. It's a horrifying slenderman of a creature that no child in their right mind would EVER intentionally go toward, except Oliver...oh and Byron, Oliver's schoolmate and bully-turned-friend. For some inexplicable reason Oliver constantly goes toward the dark closets and creepy hallways this monster menaces. Oh, and the monster's name is Larry.At this point, The Babadook should be coming to mind, and it certainly is reminiscent of that movie in many ways. The overall vibe is a weird mashup of 70's meets 2020 as bowl haircuts and vintage clothing and furniture are featured throughout, while idevices constantly remind us we aren't in the area the movie says we are. I liked the vibe, actually. It was like a horror remix of familiar elements in odd juxtapositions.The leads were more than passable, with Azhy Robertson doing a fine job of being autistic, which is not an easy role to nail.The horror cliches were there, front and center, but the real pit in the cherry for me was the plot holes surrounding the monster myth.He seems to drain electricity, so whenever he's near the lights flicker and eventually pop (why, horror movies? Why must lights ALWAYS flicker?), however reading his story also seems to give him power, so that half the time I can't tell if he runs off of electricity or literary curiosity. Initially he is able to flicker lights and make noise without his story even being read, later we are made to believe he can only come through to our world when his story is finished, but that's just not the way it happens. He is able to move large, heavy objects, break things, open things, chase people, and move freely about the world. He can pick up Oliver, he has mass, he can screw in light bulbs for God's sake, but just chooses to do random stupid stuff instead of what he's there for. Initially, you have to turn the pages of his book and willingly read the story, but by the end he is forcefully turning the pages so they see the story even though they don't want to. He should have been able to end this movie in the first five minutes. All he needed was to turn enough pages to get to the end, which he can obviously do. Also, he's capable of trailing, attacking and wrecking Marty, for no apparent reason, while Oliver is the one he wants and in a completely different location.This family ping pongs from devices are dangerous to devices are the only way to see the problem then back to break all the devices and still they don't seem to affect the creature in any predictable way. He emerges from dead (unplugged) devices to attack them in the real world, and is seen moving INSANELY fast in several scenes, only to lumber around aimless when the plot calls for it. The monster and rules regarding the monster are so inexplicable that they, at times, broke my ability to really enjoy the beauty of this story.Because the story is good. It's often told well. The acting is enjoyable, but not award-winning. The character development is lacking, but still better than a lot of horror. The jump scares are...well, what you'd expect.Why watch it? Because it's a decent entry into the genre. Not original, not ground-breaking, but it's not horrible. It's got scary moments and heart-warming moments, and most of the characters are likable.Overall, watchable."}, {"id": 72, "text": "After watching so many horror/thriller movies, and being let down, I admit that I was pleasantly surprised at how good of a movie this actually was. It took ideas of many movies and blended them all together into its own unique style. Acting was good, and they did a good job making Larry seem creepy. I will say though that I didn't see this as a scary movie at all, but as a movie about loneliness and love, with a sprinkle of creepiness added to it. Great ending to.

This movie isn't scary unless you are a kid or on some strong recreational drugs, the plot is ludicrous and unoriginal, but the run time is short enough to make it through to the end.

However, I really liked the creature design (and the details were quite good at times! Like the texture of his leg while Oliver and Sarah were under the bed). I also liked that both parents realized the truth somewhat early on, I felt that broke the convention of one (or neither) believing until the very end as most movies do. I appreciated how the loneliness also applied to Sarah, and her struggle in her marriage of feeling like she alone took responsibility for the tough times in raising Oliver.

Influenced by many other films, some with a demonic element, others with spirits that invade as something innocent and target children, others where televisions, screens, etc. show a metaphysical element (eg Rings), but also somewhat ET and contact with the child, while combining with a sensitive subject, autistic children and the attacks they may receive from other children.

Larry was similar to slender man: (1) the appearance were tall and thin, (2) the way they came were read or summoned by somebody.The most disappointing was Larry itself because it showed up after an hour in the movie, and it wasn't scary enough except from the scene that Oliver's mother saved her son from Larry and then turned into a Larry-like monster.

So come play is about a monster that watches Oliver through his phone and tries to get him to join him in his world because Oliver Is lonely. So here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:1. Creativity: This movie actually uses creative ways to display the monster who is invisible through the majority of the movie. Using a laser distance meter, saying you have to use a phone to display the monster's location, and how the monster has control of the lights of everywhere. Not just in a house but the street lights. It makes it suspenseful knowing that you arent safe anywhere2. Technology - As I said, this movie uses technology to display where the monster is. If not, they use an object that helps point out the location of it. But anyway, the technology aspect is amazing because Larry wants Oliver because he doesnt have any friends so he's always on technology. But the monster uses the technology as a gateway to get into their world. In my opinion, this movie actually did a good job with what Countdown and Bedevilled couldn't do3. Ending - I was kind of tired of horror movies always ending their movies with either the protagonist dying or saying that it's not over. But this movie made me smile so hard with the ending. The mom dies but Oliver and her spirit plays with each other downstairs and the husband cries happily to see her. An ending that ends happily rather than just sourlyCons:Acting - At best, the only thing I can say is the acting was solid. It's far from bad. It's just solid to meOverall, this is a good movie and I suggest you watch it"}, {"id": 109, "text": "I was not expecting a movie like this to keep my interest, but, was I wrong.

It is great and I mean, great. You will not be disappointed."}, {"id": 110, "text": "Okay so not knowing much about this movie or seeing many previews i was a little weary about seeing it but never fear it was the scariest movie i have seen this year it had very little swearing which you might not care but meant a lot to me also the jump factor is huge here i can definetly say i recommend it"}, {"id": 111, "text": "And the acting police. 1. For all the crappy movies I have to wade through to actually find something worth watching these days is like finding a particular needle in a stack of needles. 2. This movie had an original plot, decent acting (despite what another reviewer had complained), it was creepy, and you didn't know the ending 30 minutes into it. 3. I gave this movie an eight because it's actually one of the better creepy movies I've seen in three months. I don't know about all of you, but indie movies are starting to grind on my nerves. I have to turn on the subtitles because I can't understand what they're saying most of the time. And then you have these user reviewers who critically acclaim movies where there's some hidden meaning in the ending that leaves you asking, wtf was that and why did I just waste ninety minutes of my life I'll never get back to watch that bunk?So, this movie is not fantasy as another review suggests. It's a very decent horror movie that I think most people will enjoy."}, {"id": 112, "text": "I think this was a good horror movie, which had something new in it that kept it interesting. The general presentation was very good.The pacing is a slow burn with more and more weird stuff happening as it goes on, which I liked a lot. Being someone who hates jump scares I was glad this one didn't really have any. The horror aspect was well done but some might find it mild maybe, and it was scary.I like that there seems to be an allegory happening in the background of technology causing people to become more isolated and lonely; which of course is sad but true. The demon could be interpreted as a representation of loneliness perhaps as you get older.I'm not sure why this one was lower on the ratings, but I think it is underrated and I enjoyed it.7/10 a good novel horror."}, {"id": 113, "text": "While we all want something terrifying from the horror films we watch, it is nice to get some psychological and emotional aspects intertwined within the scares to give it that extra depth. This particular story is very reminiscent to Mike Flanagan's style where he places just as much importance into the heart and soul of the characters as the amount of detail in the creepy creatures or hauntings. It's definitely a great and promising first feature effort from Jacob Chase.The film still does have its classic clich\u00e9s with many predictable timed jump scares and the all too common tech themes of late , but it still wraps everything together nicely with some interesting concepts. There are some tremendous moments of authentic emotion portrayed by the main actors as well which is an underrated aspect especially in horror films. There's also a very interesting entity with a great backstory with some decent enough CGI to present it. The atmosphere and tension is prevalent and there are some clever camera choices.Overall it's way better than many will think it will be after seeing the very cliche trailer, and people shouldn't take it for just a kids horror. If this is the one wide release horror film we get for Halloween, it does serve its purpose well enough."}, {"id": 114, "text": "No, it's not a masterpiece that would deserve 10/10 as some have rated it here. But it's not a total crap either so it doesn't deserve 1/10 ratings either. The story as a whole is actually good, something different. There are few jumps scares, some better than others, there's some creepiness at times. It's supposed to be a horror movie but at times it felt more as fantasy - I think that might be one of the reasons why this movie is rather weak, the director couldn't make up his mind what genre to choose. The main actors, unfortunately, are terrible. The few ones that are actually ok play only secondary roles. The parents are annoying, you actually hope that at least one of them would die - they're so unlikable (I won't say if anyone dies or not because I don't want to give spoilers). Some the dialogues would make your eyes roll as well. I don't know what went wrong, the movie had so much potential to be so much better. I thought it might have been the budget but for 9mil (to compare: Babadook had only 2mil) I would expect something better. In short: it's an ok movie. Definitely something different. The 5.9 score it has at the moment is fair."}, {"id": 115, "text": "It's rare that a movie blows me away and sticks with me for hours after I've finished watching it, but that's exactly what Come Play did to me. Right from the beginning, the eerie vibe starts and it doesn't let up.I have a tendency to get deeply involved with movies of this nature, outcast child struggling through a broken home and difficulty in school. Yes, it's because I can completely identify, so it makes these films more effective and personal. In this case, Oliver is an autistic child who uses smart phones and iPads to communicate.But when an e-book titled Misunderstood Monsters appears out of nowhere, the story begins to unfold.Misunderstood Monsters is about Larry, a lonely creature just looking for a friend to protect. But it's not as simple as that, Larry is not the kind of friend you want. He taunts, torments and injures as he tries to gain enough strength to take his chosen new friend, in this case Oliver.The amount of tension is constant because Larry is persistent, and the moments of peace are very brief. Eventually, mom and dad put their differences aside as each becomes aware of Larry and his intentions, and their attempts to stop Larry become a lot more challenging than just destroying the devices of communication in the immediate vicinity.The basic story of the parents is that mom is the primary caregiver who struggles to help her child gain the ability of speech and have some sort of social interactions with others. Dad is the fun one who distances himself from the serious aspects of caring for a child with limitations, and prefers to be the lighthearted and fun parent, despite the inequality in responsibilities. Further interpersonal plots twists are one of Oliver's school bullies was once his best friend but that ended in a misguided effort by mom to protect her son from scrutiny. Larry plays on all of this in an effort to convince Oliver to take his hand and be his 'friend'.And like the best movies of this nature, the ending is very bittersweet. You realize the steps mom is willing to go to protect her son, to the point that Oliver actually understands. It's a real heart tugging finale and it has choked me up both times (so far) that I've watched the movie, and that's not an easy thing to do.This is a classic film in that you understand the director likely had aspects of Oliver's upbringing in his own childhood, and that's what gives it a very penetrating authentic feel. It's smart and scary, sweet and sad, and ultimately very effective for those who can connect with the subject matter rather than just expecting a silly knife wielding psycho looking for his next teenage victim to off.An extra mention to the child actor playing the lead role. He did an outstanding job! Right away, your heart goes out to him. He portrays a shy timidness with the innocence of a child that makes you just want to protect and comfort him. His looks and mannerisms playing such a challenging role at his age are to be commended because nothing about it seemed silly or fake. He kind of reminded me of Danny from The Shining but even more engaging.There are a number of messages in the movie, one of which is how technology has crippled human interaction and responsibility. All you need to do is look at how many millennial females cannot seem to drive a car without a phone in their hand and you completely understand.Come Play became an instant classic for me. I was never bored and was on the edge of my seat the majority of the movie. The ending that left me sitting there in the dark feeling a bit emotional helped solidify it as a new favorite. Very well done and highly recommended."}, {"id": 116, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)2020 is undoubtedly one of the worst years ever for movies, not even in terms of quality, but the infinite delays of highly anticipated films automatically make this year more underwhelming than what it would ever be. Nevertheless, it still delivered a few surprises along the way. Movies that I wasn't really expecting to like as much as I did (Underwater, The Call of the Wild), or even films that I knew I'd enjoy them but eventually end up absolutely loving them (The One and Only Ivan, Palm Springs, The Personal History of David Copperfield). Jacob Chase's feature directorial debut is amongst the former group. I only knew the premise and the cast, which I have to admit didn't really convince me, but I still gave it a go since this could be my last trip to a film theater this year...If it ends up truly being my last time watching a movie on the big screen this year, then it's a wonderful final film. Come Play is one of the biggest surprises of 2020. There are so many aspects that I absolutely love about it, but it doesn't escape from several issues as well. I'll start with the impressive performance of Azhy Robertson (Oliver) as a non-verbal autistic kid. As someone who has shared some time with a young autistic girl, I left the theater fully believing that Azhy was, in fact, autistic in real-life (I didn't recognize him from Marriage Story). I was mind-blown when I found out he wasn't. His display feels so realistic and authentic that I never thought his portrayal was pure acting.John Gallagher Jr. (Marty) is really good as well, but he doesn't have as much screentime as Gillian Jacobs (Sarah). The latter isn't exactly awful, but she definitely disappoints in the more sentimental moments. She's great during the horror sequences, adding to the suspenseful atmosphere, but when the time comes to really deliver heartfelt dialogues and passionate expressions, Gillian fails to offer a convincing performance. The other kids in the movie are also quite cringe-worthy, but not every young actor can be incredible at such a young age.Despite the cast's irregular interpretations, none ruins the captivating story behind Larry, the misunderstood monster on the other side of the screen. The social commentary is loud and clear, giving the film a whole other layer. Jacob Chase's commitment and dedication to this work (based on his own short) are palpable throughout the runtime, visible through the numerous tiny details spread across each storyline. I found myself astonishingly invested in the narrative. However, Chase often repeats scenes meant to pass that social message he so desperately wants to transmit, transforming many scenes that could be genuine into something extremely forced.This last aspect is compensated with innovative horror sequences with highly creative use of today's technology to generate an incredibly tense environment. There aren't many jumpscares, but most are pretty effective. Nevertheless, it's the suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire movie that elevates the overall horror vibe. Chase also employs long takes, which ultimately leaves viewers at the edge of their seats due to some excellent camera work (Maxime Alexandre) and seamless editing (Gregory Plotkin). I really like the score (Roque Ba\u00f1os), but there are a couple of moments where the almost silent music weirdly becomes an adventure tune.Another brilliant technical decision comes from Chase's work with the VFX team. As expected from a low-budget production, the visual effects would never reach today's standards if they decided to show the monster in plain sight during daylight. If you go into the film expecting a monster movie where the latter is the protagonist, forget it. The crew was intelligent and humble enough to acknowledge the not-that-good VFX quality, so Chase hides the monster with low lighting and shows him during night sequences and/or through a smartphone/tablet's camera. It might be a disappointing aspect for many people, but I was delighted with this smart decision.It's more of a family drama than a generic horror flick. There's a fair attempt at delivering something special, and I do believe it was very close to being one of the best films of the year. The treatment of the autistic character is near-perfect. I love the fact that not only the movie shows every problem that a condition like this brings, but it also demonstrates the extraordinary qualities that autistic people possess. Even though he cannot speak, Oliver is exceptionally clever, fun, and brave, something I believe most of today's society doesn't think autistic kids can be. The ending is both bold and surprising, finishing on a significant emotional moment that will leave viewers with a bittersweet reaction.In the end, Come Play is one of my favorite surprises of this year. Jacob Chase proves that he's a dedicated filmmaker who knows his craft. With exceptional preparation, Chase presents an extremely captivating narrative, distinct from the generic horror flicks that flood every year. By focusing on the emotionally compelling story instead of the formulaic jumpscares, the horror sequences have a much more significant impact due to the viewer's connection with the main characters, especially Azhy Robertson's. The latter delivers one of the best young performances of 2020, interpreting an autistic kid with remarkable authenticity. However, the rest of the cast is not up to the task, especially Gillian Jacobs, who disappoints with an overall emotionally underwhelming display. The social commentary is important and efficiently transmitted, despite Chase eventually losing his balance and exaggerating the number of scenes that ultimately become forced. Technically, the suspenseful atmosphere steals the spotlight from the few yet effective jumpscares. Ends with a surprisingly bold, emotionally bittersweet moment. As long as you don't expect a monster flick packed with predictable scares, I sincerely recommend it to anyone looking for a Halloween plan.Rating: B+"}, {"id": 117, "text": "Over the symbology of this film, other than say that im overwhelmed by the sensation of true fear, like the ones i felt when i was a little boy afraid of the thing called''bolla'' here in norway, and the film is completely without blood and gore, thats almost unheard of today.so i would say a nightmatre on elm street without blood and gore factor could be a good comparishion( i hate to compare ,but larry told me to do it sooo...)so plain horror you get, almost nonstop seemingly never ending, and the production has a vast variety of sound and light effects, cgi of superior quality, and the children actors are like made out of a good mix of tom and sean and some forrest in the edges. and its a film that will scare the heck out of people that are convinced that that can track ghosts via the camera we all have in our digital gadgets, and will for sure loose their senses each time a light starts blinking.im ready to declare that this is the best of its kind made in this decennium, pure horror for all its worth, hypoanemic and hypointestinosic it is, and could even be used by the round table a saturday evening with the family, not familyfriendly but rather safe wihin the frames of common scares. its a must see film is the grumpy old mans message"}, {"id": 118, "text": "Grab some pillows and blankets to hide behind because today we are talking about the new terrifying film, Come Play! Come Play has brilliant jump scares flying at you left and right, and tons of scary scenes that will make you jump in odd ways. The suspense of the movie continually puts you on the edge of your seat dying to find out what happens next. Come Play provides an authentic plot. Quite frankly, I have never seen anything like Come Play, which makes it even more entertaining to watch.Come Play follows a young boy named Oliver (Azhy Robertson) who is on the autistic spectrum and, unfortunately, cannot verbalize for himself. Instead, Oliver uses his phone or tablet to communicate. However, one night his phone starts talking to him. In the middle of the night, Oliver's phone randomly gets stuck on a book called Misunderstood Monsters, and Oliver learns of a monster named Larry, who just wants a friend. Soon Oliver learns Larry's true potential and he and his family must escape the curse of this devilish monster.The most compelling characteristic that makes Come Play so entertaining is the writing. The writing is superb. It is written in a strange and clandestine way, so it doesn't scare you in the predictable ways you might anticipate. Come Play is extremely impressive with its horror approach. The writers create angst and scare you with just two innocent people walking down the sidewalk, and not with a huge creepy monster. This movie's electrical effects are extremely important because of the electrical connection Larry has. The lighting effects in this film are exceptional. They definitely make the movie even creepier.Come Play is a horror movie. I recommend it especially if this is your first experience viewing this film genre, because it is scary, but in a fun and entertaining way. Besides the typical jump scares, the movie also provides a different type of horror - bullying. Bullying is shown quite a lot in the first half of the movie and may not set the best example for children watching. Important lessons are communicated in this film, particularly the importance of friendship and family.Similar to when the jump scares made me scream, I am screaming now that my rating for Come Play is 5 out of 5 stars. It has amazing writing and electrical effects. I recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults, because of the frightening scenes and language. Reviewed by Jude A., KID FIRST!"}, {"id": 119, "text": "Made an account just to give this movie the rating it deserved. I have to say I'm a huge horror fan and I was pretty excited to watch this film after the high score I saw here. A huge disappointment would be an understatement. First of all if you read the reviews you'll see that most of them are written with the Unrecognizable Wish Chinese merchandiser language that is far distant from English. This movie is the horror movie version of 'when you order online / when it arrives home' meme.What a terrible plot that is basically non-rhyming, less inspired version of Babadook.I have to give credits to the movie, because usually I love the low budget B movies with terrible acting but NONE of them had the level of uncanniness in Gillian Jacobs' acting. This was the worst one I have ever seen. (The part where she's ''running'' downstairs to check the children is my favorite)Throughout the film after seeing some of the well-thought out (almost artistical) jump scare scenes would indicate that someone knew what they were doing. The only scary thing about this movie is that this movie had a budget. It's not even a good bad movie.Unfriending Larry on Facebook."}, {"id": 120, "text": "I really enjoyed the originality in how the movie makes a vague distinction between possible supernatural influences verses online child predators in telling a story about a very creepy and scary monster that seems to seek sympathy for being lonely and having no friends by communicating t his through an online children's book to an Autistic child who can't speak and say no to this monster. I was beginning to think this was going to be a kind of Maurice Sendack Where The Wild Things Are kind of tall tale. BIG NEGATORY ON THAT! This is some scary movie on a psychological level I've not seen in other similar movies about monsters.This is clever on so many levels in toying with the audience at the same time drawing them in as to what it is and what it wants with an Autistic child who can't speak to say no to the monster that it doesn't want to be its friend.Very good special effects and convincing looking monster and very scary. I don't know if this would freak out kids at the age of the child actors that experience this monster. I know at that age I would just soiled myself and ran out of the theater screaming.I predict this is going to be a classic horror movie on lines of the Chucky, the killer doll in The Child's Play movies. You've been warned!"}, {"id": 121, "text": "An interesting premise ultimately can't make up for what is a rather formulaic, overdramatic, and predictable little thriller- even despite its better qualities. The best moments in the film happen about after the halfway point. The first half of the film is the exact predictable introduction you would expect from this type of flick, and it's rather disappointing to see they settled on a setup so unoriginal. None of its characters really prove to be likable, and all their characters seem to be all over the place at times, with every character often making stupid decisions in order to keep the plot going. I guess you can just right it off as typical horror movie cliches, but it just seems so frustrating and unnecessary when you have a unique and original premise for a horror flick for the first time in a very long time. It has a decent amount of scares when the film is at the height of its powers, but sadly it isn't enough to carry the film along to the end, and eventually the scars just become rather jumpy, predictable, or simply consist of really loud noises. There is no definitive style behind the film, and a weird amount of Spongebob references and clips on screen, I have literally no clue why. At times I felt unsure what age group this was made for, as it often seems like a little kid film with its younger characters, but obviously too scary for any younger kids to enjoy. In the end, Come Play was entertaining, somewhat scary at times, but ultimately not original enough to be worth your time. My Rating: 5.5/10"}, {"id": 122, "text": "Based purely on the horror side of things 'Come Play' would've gotten a 4/10 from me. It was another element to the story which I'll take about a bit later that boosted it up to a 5/10 in my books. The horror element was everything I hate about the horror genre. It was safe, supernatural and instantly forgettable - not to mention unoriginal. The PG-13 rating here is barely even scraping it at that. It could've been rated G and no one would've questioned it I suspect. The supernatural side of things in horror annoys me so much when characters keep treating each other like these things could never possibly happen in their world, while they're currently happening. It's so tedious.The element of 'Come Play' that held the most interest for me was actually the autistic child and his interactions with other kids and his parents. That was all handled quite well. If this film had been a straight up drama with these same characters I think I would've enjoyed it a whole lot more. Also kids can often be quite annoying in film and particularity horror movies (see 'The Babadook'), however by having him be a mute it not only added to the complexity of the character and the situation, it also took away his ability to come across as grating to the audience.Sadly though, there wasn't enough focus on that to save the film or even come close. The film relies on unearned jump-scares and a supposedly creepy looking monster (who did nothing for me personally, but each to their own). This was a tedious and slow way to spend 90 minutes of my time. I don't recommend this one."}, {"id": 123, "text": "I really enjoyed this new take of horror where the creature comes from the technology and implements technology to the horror world. With that being said it does make it a little corny at times.This also isn't a typical horror movie that is filled with jumps scares but more rather a slow burn of horror that kinda keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. It does a really good job on keeping the film with a creepy vibe.As for the plot I enjoyed it as it really goes to the mental side of kids and how parents not being connected with their kids can cause problems.Finally as for the acting it was with smaller lesser known actors so at times you can kinda lose focus and not really bond or feel for the actors. For me that doesn't really take away from the movie as a whole so overall I would give it 75/100."}, {"id": 124, "text": "*There is no end credit scene*The director Jacob Chase and crew brought an enlightening horror film. The story sets when a creature targets a young boy through screen devices. It had a familiar feel like The Babadook (2014) but both of them are completely different particularly in their significance. The jump scares were weak though it did deliver a few creepy moments however not worthy for one to feel terrified. The creature's story was fascinating, but there were so many missed opportunities, it needed extra scenes of having the creature lurking more in the corners with the device in hand. When the plot established itself, suddenly it was rushing to be known which took away the creepiness and the suspense of the creature too early. Even though I did like how the parents handle it, their reactions still needed more feeling of terror.The creature's existence surrounds the theme of loneliness and it doesn't only projects when one is lonely it illuminates how society uses their screen devices more than taking in what is right in front of them. As one has things to do on any screen device, this story sets a reminder to look up and don't miss connecting with others. The movie was more of a heartbreaking story than something to be scared of. I was surprised by how moved I was especially through the theme of being overprotective which can be misunderstood and could break relationships. What an ending, while the film lacked many things, the end was perfect and beautiful in which it got me in tears.The composer Roque Ba\u00f1os sets a good atmosphere, not scary but keeps up with the suspense. When the suspense fades, there is another tune, a soothing beautiful piece of music and it goes well with the heartbreaking moments.The main actors' performances, John Gallagher Jr., Gillian Jacobs, and Azhy Robertson's were good, but they could have been more solid if the story added further depth scenes into the lingering threat. I can't forget Winslow Fegleyand, my gosh this kid was fantastic, I was so impressed and I liked his importance in the storyline."}, {"id": 125, "text": "I watched this with pretty low expectations of just another 'creature' movie. But I was pleasantly surprised. The story centres around a young non verbal autistic boy called Oliver who communicates via electronic devices, namely an adapted phone that allows him to 'speak', however something is 'living' in his phone and wants to be his friend. It opens an app telling the story of Larry. Pretty much friendless he lives with his bickering parents. After an incident at school, with his former best friend, his phone is lost to him leaving him more isolated than ever. Oliver's Dad finds and ipad in a lost property box at work, takes it home and the story of Larry reappears. Larry is, according to the story, a 'Misunderstood Monster' who simply wants to be friends with Oliver, but Oliver senses all is not right and he hides the ipad to protect himself. Thinking that she can help her son to come out of his isolated existence, Oliver's Mother invites his old friend and two other boys to a sleepover, in the hope that they will befriend her son. However when the boys find the ipad that Oliver had hidden Larry decides to make himself known to them.The story is pretty good, the parents are nice people, the kids are lovely and you actually root for them. There are a few genuinely creepy moments as Larry pops up in different places or skulks around in the background. And there are also a couple of quite touching moments, something which I didn't expect. It's a good movie, not a groundbreaking horror by any means, but I've seen a hell of a lot worse in the past few lockdown months."}, {"id": 126, "text": "Well, Come Play from writer and director Jacob Chase wasn't exactly the most scary of horror movies, nor were it overly outstanding. Now, don't get me wrong, because Come Play is a watchable movie and it certainly was entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. I, however, had just hoped for a bit more scary movie.The storyline is pretty straight forward, with the obligatory jump scares throughout the movie, of course. However, while the storyline was bordering on being generic and mundane, it was actually the message of the entire movie, the concept around which Larry took place, that was the most interesting aspect of the movie. And on that part writer Jacob Chase managed to deliver something interesting enough.Visually Come Play didn't disappoint. The CGI were good and the creature design of Larry was actually quite nice. However, I just wished that we would have been given more prolonged on-screen time with the creature, instead of it being the usual flashes and glimpses that you usually see in horror movies.The cast in the movie was good, and I especially enjoyed the performance of child actor Azhy Robertson - playing Oliver - because his performance was amazing, and he was the main source of carrying the movie for the bigger parts. He really performed quite well in that role.Come Play is an adequate modern horror movie, but it didn't really bring much of anything new to the horror genre.My rating of Come Play is a six out of ten stars. Yes, I was entertained by what the movie turned out to be. Sure, I had wished for more, but writer and director Jacob Chase managed to churn out something that was adequately entertaining."}, {"id": 127, "text": "Come Play is very similar to The Babadook in the sense that you read a book and the creature will appear. Unfortunately, this film does not live up to the same heart-pounding, edge of your seat watching as The Babadook gives. Instead of being absolutely terrified of Larry, the creature, we're drawn in to feel sorry for him, and rather than hoping the family doesn't meet an unfortunate end, we're left almost cheering for Larry to get the friend he wants. The meaning behind the story was great. Don't be a bully, everybody needs a friend, and family is incredibly important. However, this movie only tries to scare with the slamming of doors, or other everyday objects, and therefore not the horror movie we deserve on Halloween.Overall, I'm right in the middle for whether to recommend this film or not. If you need to see this film now rather than later. Go on a cheap night. Otherwise, I'd say wait for it to come out on a streaming service. Again, story premise is great, but the execution of actual scares is poor."}, {"id": 128, "text": "Yup, could have been, like in actually wasn't. Two more drafts, and this could have been something special. But as it is, Come Play is a bit boring and repetitive. Honestly, that's almost all I can say about this one.Don't get me wrong though. There's a lot of work in this film, some really good performances (and some not so good ones as well), but you know what they say: The fish stinks from the head. And it does. Many situations come across as being at least unauthentic, with some dialogue that feels like it was written in a drunk frenzy. Which I don't condemn. But still. It feels like the writer (who's also the director, which I don't necessarily recommend) just watched some YouTube screenwriter masterclass, and in it he learned about the importance of set-ups and pay offs. Yes, those set-ups are VERY obvious, and the pay offs are... well, let's say naive.Two more drafts, overlooked by a good writer - and this could have been really good. But as it is, it's a watchable and at times questionable and cringey pseudo-horror film that was at least competently made. Except for some sound design decisions. Will you ever learn that turning on the phone's LED doesn't make a flashlight charging sound?

He gets completely terrified, believing the monster to be in his room and is woken up by his mother who thinks he has had a night terror.The story of Larry appears via phones and tablets randomly and when being read lights flicker and explode. It becomes apparent that Larry is trying to enter Oliver's life, and that he is in danger.I found this film to be refreshingly original. It does not follow predictable pathways. The cast are excellent, especially the little kids. The scenes from the sleepover are superb!! And also when Oliver's dad is in his little car park booth. As a parent, you would never in a million years believe a monster from a story was a real thing. It is not perfect and I did feel a little bored at times but overall it's a good (not too scary) horror flick with some excellent new ideas. The cast really make it very engaging"}, {"id": 131, "text": "Come play is definitely the most surprising movie of 2020 so far for me. I was expecting this to be complete garbage, because of that disgusting tittle and then I saw the trailer then I was kinda hyped, then I saw the short Larry and I was hyped even more, then I watched the movie and I liked it. This movie obviously has flaws and I'm not saying it does not but what I am saying is that this is pretty damn good horror movie at lest for 2020 standards not in my favorite horror movies of all times but it's really good. Jacob Chase directed this movie to PERFECTION! Like wow the suspense that is in this movie is very strong and I love the demon Larry what an icon honestly. He really is terrifying. I love the idea of a demon living in phones and screens that's a really cool concept to me. I love the story of the movie it's a little bit unconventional honestly. Yes it is a child friending a demon story we have seen thousands upon thousands of times before but this movie has an unconditional approach to the sub genre. With the main child Oliver in the movie he is autistic (in the trailers not a spoiler) and he talks via a phone or tablet and it just adds an interesting depth to the movie. You have some touching Emotional moments Especially towards the end no spoilers of course. Where this does fail for me is characters decisions in this movie are some of the dumbest things I have ever seen. There's certain scenes that made me want to shout in the theatre why.. just why. It took me out of the movie so fast whenever we had dumb moments from our characters. Some of the characters like the group of bullies are annoying and just flat out dicks. I mean it adds to the plot but it's just not Pleasant to see bullies practically attacking an autistic child. But overall this movie is extremely surprising and I highly recommend checking out come play it was such a good movie to see on Halloween I know the theaters are slow right now but this is one you should see in the theaters or wait till it comes to Home but I really do think you should go out and support this movie."}], "reviews_amount": 132}
