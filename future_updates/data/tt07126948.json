{"name": "Wonder Woman 1984", "titleId": "tt07126948", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "So, here we are after months and months of delays DC finally relased the highly anticipated WW84, and it is... well... cool. My opinions about the movie are mixed so I will seperate them into 3 categories.1. Good: Gal Gadot - she is a GODESS, i repeat GODESS! Excelent as Wonder Woman, full of emotion, extremely likable understood the character and did a great job just like in the first movie, maybe even betterPedro Pascal - I just want more of him! Altough his character wasn't developed that much, Maxwell Lord, and is a bit of a predictible personality you can still see he is having a blast playing him and is so entertaining.The visuals - a really beautifull movie to look at ( fireworks scene ), definetly worth seeing it in a theaterStory and message - it kind of felt like a Disney movie with is main theme of nothing good is born from lies and it's vibrant characters and looks, the pogression of the story is solid and preety interesting, altough it starts slow trying to explain and tell a lot of exposioson about the past and the present, but the second act picks up the pace and it is way more entertaining and action filled than the first act.Chris Pine - loveable as Steve and a nice characterFight scenes - great and really well done ( Mall robbery being the best ) and again. Gal Gadot shows a lot of emotion in them2. Mixed: Kristen Wiig- after the first act i kind of started hating on her character Barbara, which was likeable, with all of the cliche villian tropes she was taking, and when Chettah shows up for a 2 minute fight at the climax her looks reminded me of 2019s Cats and was a bit cringyWriting - some moments could have been less chessy and could have been written more deeply than they were ( scene where Diana says goodbye to Steve was short and was not that emotinal in terms of dialouge and the reunion of Lord and his son also felt so fast and not that emotinoal )Pacing - sometimes a bit slow, sometimes a bit fast, not good, not bad3. Bad: CGI and green screen - at some moments despite looking fabolus you can clearly, i mean clearly see the green screen moving ( every close up of WW running is awfuly done ) and the CGI being absolutly ridiculous ( Cheetah again ) which sometimes ruins the good moments in the movie Logic - I may be nitpicking but some of the moments really do not feel well explained. Like how does Steve now how to drive a modern airplane, modern looking g63 jeeps pulled me from the 80s vibe of the film, for some reason she can fly all of a sudden, and sprint with heavy objects and trucks... these are just some and there is moreOpening sequence - In my opinion, enjoyable but wasn't really necsesary at allAt the end, WW84 while a bit flawed is still an enjoyable movie with enough action and heart to make it entertaining to watch. I think that it could have been better, but sadly it was not. Would recommend seeing it in a theater for the lovley looks.6/10 for me"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Saw an advanced screening - this was the most excited I've been to see a movie in a very long time. It appears I'm in the minority who found it to be, frankly, terrible. While the performances of the leads were enjoyable, I found the movie's writing and direction so flawed as to be practically unwatchable.Gadot continues to embody WW laudably, if leaning at times toward overacting. Pine is effective as the fish out of water launched several decades into the future, even if some of his comedic moments with Gadot fall flat. Pascal plays a classically over-the-top 80's villain with enthusiasm - it seems he relishes every moment getting to play a bad guy. For me, Wiig gave the strongest performance of the first act - her comedic timing is given plenty of time to shine, and the audience has ample opportunity to empathize with her. Unfortunately, these four performances were not enough to dig this film out of the hole the writers created.Written with an over-inflated sense of self-importance, riddled with clunky dialogue trying desperately to convey depth and universal truths, the end result is an endless stream of cringeworthy, eye roll inducing lines that are so on the nose I wonder how they made it out of the writing room. At no point does the film treat its audience with intelligence, opting instead to spoon-feed every concept. How do they convey that WW is not only an action hero, but an advocate for the humanity in all of us? By forcing her to deliver gems like But Barbara, what about your warmth? What about your humanity?Further issues, presented as they occur to me as I tire of reflecting on this mess:Why is the heist scene so intentionally campy? The movie is *set* in '84, not *made* in '84. Fortunately the remainder of the film abandons this style.Their *most* creative way to sell Barbara as awkward but likable is to have her drop her briefcase of papers? Couldn't come up with something original?All Smithsonian employees have access to an unguarded airfield? A WWII pilot can understand the controls?No fully-fueled fighter jet has a range to fly DC to Cairo.WW has only ever vanished a coffee mug in all her trying, but can suddenly vanish the jet because she must.I know we're racing against time to save the world, but let's go fly through some fireworks. It'll look cool, promise.One moment WW can effortlessly sprint pushing a disabled armored vehicle down the road, the next she can't push two of them apart with all her might.The moment she rolls along the road with the two children in her arms is astonishingly poor CGI. Throughout the film, the most obviously CGI'd elements simply have no weight to them.Don't play the audio of Steve's how to fly speech over the moment WW takes it to heart and learns. Trust your actors and audience. Show, don't tell.Max didn't think to steal health in return for wishes until the end of the third act?Cheetah has practically zero screen time to pose a real threat. One fight and she's dealt with handily.Hundreds of nukes launched, and they don't vanish - they crumble in mid-air. This is somehow not a problem for the planet?Returned to the white house grounds, Max somehow lands within yards of his son who has been wandering abandoned highways?Linda Carter's cameo was *painful*. If she didn't actually smile and wink into the camera, it sure as hell felt like she did. I won't be re-watching to find out for sure.I'm tired of griping. I wanted so badly to like this continuation of the DCEU. I'll be there for the next one hoping for better, but my god was this a disappointment. I saw the movie for free and the cost was still too high."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Very long winded and quite soppy, I found myself getting quite bored. I m not really sure what this movie is trying to be, a drama love story maybe with a few action scenes. Disappointed."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I was honestly shocked by how bad this was.First, Kristen Wigg is NOT a convincing villain. I adore her, but Cheetah was not for her. Second, the CGI/effects are terrible. They look unfinished, but they're the final product. Third, the lack of action for a superhero movie is embarrassing. Mary Poppins has more action than this! Fourth, the story is seriously lacking. Instead of action like it should have, they have emotions to make up for it's lackluster feel.I won't spoil anything, but this was seriously disappointing."}, {"id": 4, "text": "The sequel to Wonder Woman was rescheduled time and time again because of the emergence of COVID-19 and cinemas being off limits. It's finally been released however but can also be streamed on HBO Max which has made some to say that cinemas may be a thing of the past.So is this sequel as good as it's amazing first film?The film opens with Diana reminiscing to when she was a child and taking part in an Olympics style event in which she excels until she is felled by a tree branch which makes her fall from the horse that carries her but then decides to cheat to try and take the lead. She is found out to have cheated however and whilst she is heartbroken at not having won she is told that her time will come. This opening is in keeping with the first film and is fantastic.But as the film then flashes forward into 1984 it starts to come seriously unstuck. It's easy for films to fall into a kind of exaggerated, unrealistic and truly irritating parody of a decade especially one that is larger than life like the 1980's. The film falls headlong into this trap and so the 80's we see is wall to wall bad fashions, people eating fatty foods in abundance and littering. It feels fake and manufactured. If there was a hashtag that could be used here for the Twitterati it would be #notmy80s. 'Ah but this is the vision of the 80's that is individual to this film and Patty Jenkins' I hear the comic fanboys screaming. Then in that case it just plain sucks.There then comes an action sequence in a shopping mall in which WW foils a robbery. It's so pointless and pathetic that I actually shouted out in the cinema 'This is awful!' I even for a nanosecond thought of walking out. This would have set a new record for the fastest time I've walked out of a film, having lasted only ten minutes watching Freddy Vs Jason.Fortunately the film calms down on the over the top 80's schtick as we see the main narrative for the film- an artefact known as the dreamstone which can fulfil the wish of those who touch it but with a catch. For every wish, the person loses something else dear to them. When I heard of this premise for the film it seemed fine. But as is stated by characters within the film, this is actually based on the urban legend of the 'Monkey's Paw'. When I found this out (and by characters in the actual film!) the premise disintegrated right before my eyes. I felt robbed and the whole premise for the film felt lazy. In fact, very quickly in the film I found myself thinking 'I really don't care what happens to ANY character in this film'. Nothing in the film's runtime swayed me from this.Diana wishes for Steve Trevor to come back and hence this is how we get Chris Pine back in the sequel. However, with this wish coming true we see WW start to lose her powers. The scene where we see him reappear should have had a massive emotional pull for the audience. There was nothing. This film is just like it's depiction of the decade it takes place in- all surface, no depth.We are introduced to the socially awkward Barbara Minerva who wishes to be just like Diana. She gains her wish. She later wishes to be an 'apex predator'. Again, she gets her wish and transforms into supervillianess Cheetah. The first glimpse of Cheetah was so naff I actually burst out laughing.We also get another baddie in the form of 'orange man bad' Max Lord who is based on Donald Trump. Theres even a border wall in the film. Hmmm. The President of the United States in the film is obviously based on Ronald Reagan. There are even allusions to his Alzheimers with him saying that felt completely disorientated and 'somewhere else' during one scene. Or maybe with such as admission he's based on Joe Biden instead.The real problem for me throughout the film are the scenes that involve Wonder Woman which is massively problematic based around her character. The action scenes contain the worst examples of CGI I've seen in a long long time. There are times when Wonder Woman feels more like an action figure in a really badly conceived computer game from the early 00's.There is also a scene in which we are introduced to a new power that Diana unveils. She can turn objects invisible by simply touching them. This made me roll my eyes when I had already rolled them far too many times already. 'Maybe she can also make this film half it's running time' I found myself thinking.Another scene that had me rolling my eyes was when Barbara decides to go to the gym when she discovers she has superstrength and decides to lift weights. There is also another cringy scene when she bumps into the creepy guy who harassed her earlier in the film.But there are scenes that work. When Diana finds out she can fly it's through a statement Steve has made earlier in the film about his love of flying. These scenes are beautiful to behold and don't involve dodgy CGI. This scene works amazingly well. If only the care and attention that had gone into this scene could have been applied to the rest of the film the whole movie would be more of a rewarding experience.I enjoyed the scenes of Max's health getting worse with every wish he bestows. This could have been exploited more with him disintegrating more radically throughout the film a la the undead character in An American Werewolf In London. But I appreciate that that might not have been appropriate in a film aimed primarily at children.When Diana has to say goodbye to Steve so that she can get her powers back, again, there should have been more emotional resonance for the audience. Again, there wasn't any.In fact when I heard that Diana was to lose her powers to get Steve back I instantly thought of Superman 2 with Superman willingly renouncing his superpowers so he can enter a relationship with Lois. But whilst I was hoping for a sequel as good as Superman 2 for Wonder Woman instead we got Superman 4: The Quest For Peace resplendent with a naff call for world peace in a nuclear free world.After the first film I would have wished for a sequel. After seeing Wonder Woman 84, I renounce my wish."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I can't believe how the studio approved this script \ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd22"}, {"id": 6, "text": "PROS The Cinematography is top notch .The Score is good .The chemistry between Gal and Chris was enjoyable .CONS Gal was at her worst . she did a decent job in the previous installement but this time she was way off the mark .I love Chris Pine . He is an underrated actor and i enjoyed his previous movies but his comic timing in this movie fell flat .The villains are cartoonish .They didn't get a good screen time to performe well but i can't blame them coz the writing sucks big time .The CGI looks Really Bad .The dialogues were cringe-worthy .The action scenes were barely entertaining .All in All . One of the worst sequels i heve ever seen and it's poorly written and directed . Save your precious time and watch the first wonder woman is more entertaining and fun to watch ."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Interesting how polarised the reviews are, personally sI liked it but thought like a lot of people that... in summary: Gal Gadot was magnificent. Wonderful A+ actress. She has found the role of a lifetime. Kirsten Wigg was not the right casting and poorly written for - she didn't make me think nerd or scary ever - Cheetah was onscreen for maybe 90 seconds? Why even bother then, no tension at all in her. Pedro Pascal - well cast and did right by the role but Max Lorre was hammily written, started great but got worse and dare I say obvious. Chris Pine is well used and provides the comedy. He obviously enjoys working with Gal Gadot and the chemistry shows. The direction was great, I have no problem with the production and execution of the film and Patty Jenkins knows what she's doing. But the script.... oh my. See above plus not enough action (what there was is excellent) including not supervillain-based combat. Several scenes were fine but just too long, the flying comes too mind - 'very cool!' then 'OK yup we get it' then 'can we now do something else pls?'I liked the film and glad I got to see it in the cinema too recommend that to all - but if you were to miss it I wouldn't blame you - unlike the legendary first film.I hope there is a 3rd and they sort the script.PS: I didn't think it was woke at all, or that he was based on Trump - literally never crossed my mind during or now.

So boring."}, {"id": 14, "text": "The 1st WW film was absolutely brilliant and had more ticks than a farmer's dog in my book. WW84 is, which truly saddens and maddens me, the polar opposite. It has a script so weak it should be classed as highly vulnerable, a plot that has more holes than my kitchen colander, and characters about as believable as a career politician. I did love the opening island scene where the girl actress playing the young Diana was superb, and apparently did all her non-cgi stunts. But then it went downhill faster than an illiterate skier passing a 'Warning - cliff ahead' sign. I won't go into detail over WW84s failings as I have a bus to catch...in a week, but I think I can reveal my favourite, jaw-dropping line from the film without it being a spoiler...'...

They should have copy the first movie's style but just change the third quarter since that is the worst third quarter of any super hero movie i've seen. This movie was kinda like superman 3 the quest for peace but much worse. G al Gadot can't act so should have been protected more like she was in the first movie by using chris pine's acting skills more to make up for G al's lack of no acting talent at all.. all she does is try and pout like in 'imagine song' thinking that the audience will fancy her and forget that they're watching a terrible movie.

Cliche, lame plot with few action scenes. The main character appears weak, uninterested, secondary...Comparing to the villains who are it seems the highlight of the movie unfortunately....Shame!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "Quick non-spoiler summary before I dive into spoilers; there is no semblance of a plot in this movie, it's just some weird rubbish about a wishing stone like it's the real life embodiment of the make a wish foundation for everyone and you don't have to be dying. The CGI is some of the worst I've ever seen given the advances in CGI over recent years; this movie looks like it could've been made in 2004 and no one would've batted an eye lid. Spoilers on some of my favourite CGI moments from this movie below. What really redeems the film is the performances from the main cast, in fact I'd say all of them did a genuinely great job. Gal Gadot, in spite of the film's glaring weaknesses, impressed as Wonder Woman and offers a better performance than she did in the first film, Kristen Wiig performs well as the goofy character that then turns into a popular, sexy figure around the city and then eventually, powered by not wanting to return to the goofball version of herself, becomes filled with jealousy and this eventually leads to her becoming The Cheetah. Unfortunately, the animators seem to have took a page out of the books from the movie Cats, as The Cheetah is a total and utter abomination to behold. There's a reason she's only seen under darker lighting during her 5 minutes of screen time, absolutely horrific but again that's down to the CGI team. The best performers in my opinion were Chris Pine as Steve and Pedro Pascal as Max Lorde. Their acting performances were genuinely brilliant and captivating at times, which helped to draw away from the film's glaring weaknesses. Pedro in particular was great as Max Lorde, it's just a shame that he was let down by a silly excuse of a plot.Spoilers from here on in!!Returning to the plot and why it's so rubbish, a random stone that essentially grants wishes is found in a jewellery store's back-alley black market. The stone was powered by the God of lies and as such if you use the stone to make a wish it takes something away from you; your greatest strength. The woman who becomes Cheetah knows Wonder Woman (WW from here on for short) for all of 5 minutes when she asks the wishing stone if she can be like Diane. She doesn't know that Diane is WW, she just likes her as a person and as such doesn't realise she'll gain WW's abilities. The stone takes away her humanity from her essentially, and she just becomes an inhumane husk that enjoys being so powerful because 'she had nothing' even though she had a very good high paying profession and a likeable personality. Her story arc coincides with that of Max Lorde, a business man who was originally going to purchase the wishing stone from the black market. Cheetah gets her hands on it originally because the FBI sent it to her so that she could investigate it. Max Lorde finds out that the items were all sent to the museum where Cheetah works and pays them a visit, putting all of his funding into their department and throwing a party. At this party, he asks Cheetah if she'd like to go up to her office with him. They go up, make out, Max finds the stone and Cheetah let's him 'borrow it'. Except it isn't borrowed, as big Max decides to become the stone as his wish. His business is failing and he wants to secure a legacy for him and his son, so when he holds people's hands and asks them to make a wish the wish will come true. He can also control what he takes in return for the wish, and uses it for the most part to take everyone's oil at first. However, he finds that the wishes are causing him to become very ill. After a visit with the president, he finds out that their is a system that allows for someone to take over every tv on the planet with a transmission. The particles that touch people after they go through the TV are somehow enough for Max to be able to grant everyone's wishes. At this point, WW tries to stop him but is stopped by Cheetah before she becomes the abominable cat creature. Oh yeah, WW wishes her dead boyfriend back to life and it took her powers from her so she gradually gets weaker throughout the film and is such is absolutely pummelled by Cheetah. Cheetah then escapes with Max. Max grants her another wish and she wishes to become 'an apex predator', leading to this unholy curse. If Cats was the cause of 2020, then this abomination has doomed us to more suffering in 2021 you heard it here First ladies and gentlemen. So to stop Max from granting everyone's wishes and becoming all powerful, WW relinquished her wish and her dead boyfriend dies for the second time, which everyone knew was bound to happen. Commence a sequence of her running away and getting her powers back with some utterly awful CGI that made me wheeze during the film. She then takes some random Amazon girl's armour which could withstand the force of every man (as she requires some plot armour - more on the aforementioned girl later). WW then finds Max but is blocked by Cheetah, who rips the armour to shreds like its nothing. As expected, more plot armour is required for WW to win this fight so they are fighting beside a transformer station and cheetah decides to swing from the electric cables. This causes them to rip and inevitably their fight takes them into a body of water. As you guessed, WW plunges the cables into the water and electrocuted cheetah to the point f being unconscious but she's perfectly fine as plot armour requires it. She then finds Max in a building granting everyone's wishes through the tv. As you expect, the negative effects of this lead to nukes (obviously nukes; it's the Cold War guys this has to be the ultimate threat!) being fired by America and Russia and lots of people start dying. By granting these wishes Max also takes people's health and life source so that he can remain strong and powerful, causing more death. There's a lot of wind around Max, essentially a hurricane that WW can't get through, but as expected plot armour prevails again and she sneakily gets her lasso through the hurricane and wraps it around Max's foot, defeating him through the power of love and truth. Everyone renounces their wishes, Max goes to find his son and Cheetah wakes up and both her and Max face no consequences. Max also gets a chopper back to DC and finds his son with no issue at all. The end.Utter rubbish. I genuinely think my description of the movie may be making it look better than it is. I'll tell you one thing, it certainly looks better than the CGI. My favourite CGI scenes in this movie;-The swinging sequence in whatever that trial at the start was for looked absolutely horrendous. It was so obviously fake looking that I could've sworn I saw the green screen.-Every time WW runs super fast looks hilariously bad. This also applies when she learns to fly.-The sequence where she lassoes around the shopping mall is an abomination.-Cheetah when she becomes Cheetah is a cancer to the eyes and looks just as bad as the creatures from 2019's Cats.-My personal favourite; Chris fires an RPG from a Jeep/Tank and WW lassoes onto it and swings in front of the tanks they are chasing to grab some kids who are playing on the road to stop them from being run over. However, due to her power's weakening, she loses her grip on the lasso when she grabs the kids and while she's holding them they start rolling, like Neymar after he feels a gust of wind. The resulting rolling sequence is utterly hysterical, with animation that would look like a blush of inadequacy in the movie Sharknado. They're left lying in the middle of the road with the tank approaching so how do they survive? The tanks just swerve out of the way. What a waste of time.Overall, scoring this film I give it a 4. The plot is terrible and the CGI is embarrassing however it is redeemed by great acting performances and a great soundtrack. I'd personally put it in the 'so bad it's good' category as I was laughing a lot during this catastrophe. If you enjoyed Sharknado, you'll enjoy this."}, {"id": 29, "text": "Worst movie I have seen in a long time.

Chris Pine and Kirsten Wigg are solid, but Pedro Pascal steals the limelight from everyone but Gadot as the wonderfully layered protagonist Max Lord.this sets a firm nail in the coffin if the dark Man of Steel and BVS efforts the WB kicked off with.

I was especially moved at the scene where Wonder-Woman had to let go of the Love of her life: Steve in order to do what is right .. You can really feel the weight on that scene! and I'd say it's far better than all the CGI-Fight scenes we are used to with the kind of Superhero movies we watch.In all, I'd say if you are looking for a movie with a good story line, that plays with your conscience (the right way), then watch this.

DC has such a wide range of villians but they never pull the trigger on the big ones same case with the justice league film.

But this is coming from a guy who thoroughly enjoyed the extra 30 minute smash fest of Superman vs Zod in Man of Steel."}, {"id": 61, "text": "There is a post end credit scene. I've just read a review by someone saying they were floored on how the amazing ending made the whole movie for them. I'm totally lost as their comment floored and taken aback by the surprise ending would be an understatement must have felt like they were in another screen watching a different movie ending. There is nothing exceptional about the ending of WW84, post end credit scene I didn't see coming but not amazing! Let's rewind to the start. Great opening scene back in the Amazonian warrior days as Diana competing in an event when she was a little girl. Great hopes for the rest of the movie with this fun opening scene. Then fast forward to 1984 and again a great second opening scene and then BOOSH, it falls flat. We have 2 new characters on the scene, Max Lord and Cheetah (don't really see her as Cheetah until the end) and for the next 1 hour it is all about tracking down an artefact with mysterious powers, and nothing much else happens. The action scenes (way into the end of an hour) was great but not amazing compared to the first Wonder Woman movie, and they were very short lived and quite feeble. The build up for the end fight scene, when we eventually see Cheetah, was so underwhelming as it was over as soon as it started. Max Lord was quite annoying and not really one of those super villains that you are going to remember! Should a movie stand on it's own and not be compared with it's previous release, perhaps, but as it's DC Universe strengthening their superhero portfolio I would have expected a lot more here. If we cast our memories back to Man Of Steel (brilliant movie) but then no follow up as it jumped into Batman Vs Superman (which you could say was the Superman follow up to Man Of Steel) but let's be honest it was a bad movie! Then we had Justice League - pretty good but no amazing - and again no follow up to this just yet, and Aquaman which was brilliant. So we are waiting on a sequel for Aquaman and Justice League (don't count the Zack Synder release coming out next year!) Then Wonder Woman was a brilliant movie and now Wonder Woman 1984, the second outing, was nowhere as good as the first, therefore we have a trend forming here that 90% of the time sequels are normally worse therefore the third Wonder Woman movie should be brilliant. Wonder Woman had so much more heart in the character on how she lovingly set out to save people during WWI but Wonder Woman 1984 just didn't have any heart string tugging for me compared to the first. I do wonder if the Director (Patty Jenkins) has peaked too early in her career. Like Mendes did with 007 Skyfall, the movie studios banked on Spectre being better than Skyfall (which it wasn't) and then 1917 movie which rode on the coattails of pure marketing and wasn't that big a deal! The problem with Wonder Woman is it kind of gave up on the action after a while with a built up ending which fizzled out like dunking a short lived, cheap sparkler! A lot of reviewers are saying it's a breath of fresh air to give out a positive message during the current Covid challenges. Yes that's true but WW84 was never made with Covid in mind and doesn't deliver compared to Wonder Woman and Man Of Steel Is this a movie about justice and human compassion (which is the backbone of the Wonder Woman character) yes it is and the ending does have an important message about the gift of human spirit and love for each other. But it failed to deliver the overall feeling of despair and despicable human behaviour and sacrifice which was so apparent in Wonder Woman - a much better movie than Wonder Woman 1984. I hope the next installment goes back to its roots and doesn't dwell too much on unimportant storytelling which is a big criticism I have on this movie. More amazing action is what was needed, of which this movie lacks compared to the previous."}, {"id": 62, "text": "Before the pandemic i used to go cinemas twice a week , WW84 was out in Dubai yesterday , i went to watch on its first day , it was more like an event to me after staying away from theaters for 9 month due to COVID 19 &amp; it was complete disappointment.

She just exudes Beauty and Hotness. Coming to the movie, the story is about obviously truth, love and greed. Movie starts with a grand Amazonian Sports event and jumps to the 80s America. Kristen wig was great as a Gemologist and many things.Pedro Pascal's Max Lord is a TV personality as well as a businessman which was well played by Pedro Pascal. The story revolves around a Wish-coming-true stone which is there for thousands of years so u can figure what it's all about but it is in the way that's shown. Sadly, there is nothing unique and standing-out about that here in the movi except for some great costumes, action and Background score. Visually the movie was great when it's on the sky, in Themyscira and on Gal. So it was just ok in terms of Cinematography. Coming to the Score, honestly I expected a lot more than this from the Legendary Hans Zimmer it's probably the 80s theme that stung him but anyway the score was still among and similar to the bests in the DCEU . Cheetah's VFX was better than I thought it would be and overall CGI was great in some scenes and dreadful in other scenes. At least the climax was not all about protag v antog fights if anything it was well . And I personally thought the Golden Armour will be the Highlight of the movie but it only just covers WW from Cheetah's scratches that's all. It sends a warming message about the endless wants of us humans which is not very much a convention in superhero movies. So concluding Should you watch the movie? Ofcourse u should for Gal Gadot's grace Wig's rage, the characters were well connected not great. Steve and Diana were Great but I wish there'd beenore depth between them and Steve himself as well but it was fine. Even for a superhero movie there are considerably few logical loopholes. To make it much more straightforward, it's not like the first Wonder Woman. WW84 just will carry the legacy of the 1st WW movie but will not add anything more to it.In a nutshell, Don't miss the movie for it has a heart to it and frankly, nothing much.Pros: 1. Gal Gadot 2. Kristen Wig and Pedro Pascal 3. The heartedness and wholesomeness 4. Costumes and an overall a not bad Technical aspectsCons: 1. Script 2. VFX in some scenes. 3. Connection b/w characters is fine but the depth is lacking. 4. Slow paced at times."}, {"id": 119, "text": "I am very disappointed with this movie, very boring and lousy storyline.

But he is the good side of everybody's mind I'd say. This time Diana shows a weak side inside and out. But she choose the right decision. Pedro Pascal plays Max as a not only super villain but he plays a fragile and struggle with his problem man. Maybe it's not a everybody's favorite movie, but I enjoyed it. Also I am glad to see more love scenes of Diana and Steve. They are too cute couple to see in DC comics."}, {"id": 121, "text": "Definitely a successful new take on what a Wonder Woman story can be. There's always a dichotomy with who she should be in her stories. I believe she can be both of these. Patty showed this very well."}, {"id": 122, "text": "Was very excited for this movie, the trailers looked amazing. I went to a preview screening tonight and just go home. But what I got out of it was nothing like what I was imagining it.let's start with the pros: setting - I thought the setting of 1984 was better than the first film being in WW1, added some more color and fun to the film. Kristen Wigg as Barbra - she was my favourite character in the film, (but that's also a con), Diana and Steve - I liked how the roles have reversed now so Steve is just like Diana was back when they went to London in WW1, but not it's Diana showing Steve everything Washington D.C has to offer. Hans Zimmer Score - as usual, the score was great to listen to WW flying scene - I really liked the scene where Diana takes flight in the clouds and they have Steve's voice over, but I would of enjoyed the scene to be silent with no voice over, so the audience has to actually think for what's happening in the scene and the reason behind it opening scene (young Diana) - my first reaction was that scene was so unnecessary, but writing this review changed my mind and made me like the scene since it had nothing to do with the dragging main plot. the backdrop of themyscara gave great visuals and there was some good action in the scene. cinematography - many shots looked great in the film, wether it was action shots or drama shots, most of them all looked bright and exciting or dramatic and powerful. cameo - I've seen some episodes of Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman TV show, but there were some super fans in the cinema that were cheering and clapping so it was nice to see others enjoy the cameo. now to the cons... runtime - for the films plot, the runtime of 2h30m is too much, this really could of been just around 2 hours if they cut out so many unnecessary scenes in the film. screen time for Barbra - a pro for me was that Barbra was my favourite character in the film, but she barely gets any screen time as Cheetah, so her character was basically wasted, they had so much potential for her. Action - out of the like 3 or 4 action scenes in the movie I only enjoyed the one between Diana and Barbra in the White House, but that lasted barely 2 minutes. The other action scenes were a bit unforgettable and short, especially the ending Ending - the ending was so anti climactic, it was just a 2-3 minute action scene between Diana and Barbra and then Diana taking over Max Lords broadcast and the end, like they could of done so much more with that ending fight scene. Plot - the plot really could of been in like an hour special of Wonder Woman TV show or justice league, really. it takes if I remember probably a solid 40 mins - 1 hour to finally get to the wishing stone and why it's important to the story. sub plots - sub plots are usually good to fill the runtime but this film doesn't use it well. when we get a sub plot in this film, it just completely forgets the main story line of the stone or the villans in the film, and a sub plot scene might take up a solid 20 mins of the film, and some can be really unnecessary to the story or comedic timing. CGI - Diana running down that road was like twilight breaking dawn part 2 cgi when they're running in the woods they rushed Max Lords character - we really only started to care about max lord right at the very end when we see his childhood flashbacks, but apart from that, he's just used as a soap opera character with everything to do with custody for his kid overall 3/10 for me. I'll probably watch it again in theatres to pick point some things I missed in the first viewing and maybe getting a second viewing out of it might change my mind on some things but I'll have to wait and see. But also the theatre I was in for the screening was full, about 200 people, was such a great atmosphere to be in a packed theatre since Star Wars 9 came out. Everyone was clapping when Lynda Carter's cameo appeared."}, {"id": 123, "text": "I am a heterosexual man. I hate movies that preach girl power and make all hetero men look bad..eg Captain Marvel, the female Ghost Busters, the new Charlies Angels, the old guard etc.Wonder Woman is not one of those movies. The movie never diminishes the men.Wonder Woman is a straight up fun superhero movie with a hero who just happens to be female.Honestly when watching it, I felt just as comfortable is if I were watching spiderman or any other male superhero.SPOILERS AHEAD ************ This the 2nd wonder woman movie as such, she had already become accustomed to living in Man's world, so there are literally NO AWKWARD SEXIST CONVERSATIONS in the entire movie.Gal Gadot shines here. This character is her crowning achievement much like Christopher Reeve's superman. No matter how powerful she is in a fight scene, she always remains feminine. As seen from the trailer, through some SPOILER her boyfriend is resurrected, and he helps her a lot throughout the movie. He is THE man, and when Wonder Woman is around him, she completely melts and lets him take over....even if she is the superhero (How is that sexist against men ?)Also did I mention that they kept the story feminine? I like seeing feminine women. Wonder Woman is supposed to be the ultimate woman and it is embodied here, when you realize what motivates her to fight.Also for fans of the character of Wonder Woman, the movie does some nice fan-service including some other well known Wonder Woman powers such as SPOILER: -the invisible jet her ability to flyusing her tiarra as boomerang-using the lasso of truth to its full capability.By the end of the Movie Wonder Woman's powers are fully realized and she looks friggin awesome.Again, I cannot stress enough.

Gal Gadot gave a very good performance, Diana is strong character but is also sweet, I loved the parts where she rescued the children, Chris Pine was good too, I like what he brings to the role. Pedro Pascal and Kristen Wiig (she shows off her talent as an actress with the transition in awkwardness and confidence that Barbara exhibits after getting her wish) were very good villains, well written, you can really feel for both of them. It indulges in the '80s aspect. It's a very pretty film, it's got good cinematography, action and humor. The CGI is good, but I found the lasso effects in the opening to be a little dodgy. The movie has a very good message and it was sad what happened with Steve and Diana when she has to let him go. In comparison to the performances given in the previous film, MoS and BvS, I found the performances of Pascal and side characters to be over the top whereas the ones in the aforementioned films, I found to be more realistic. I would've liked to see a few more connections to other DC films, like a Wayne Enterprises sign etc. Simon Stagg was featured, and there should be more expanding and building for the DC Universe. It felt lonely with Diana in the movie and it was better when Steve came along, but maybe that was the idea because Diana lives a lonely existence as those around her die and she keeps a low profile, and that connects with Barbara. Hans Zimmer gives a great score, I really liked how A Beautiful Lie was included in the sequence when Max renounces his wish. The first one is slightly better as I said in the title, but both movies are well written and put together. This one isn't exactly a sequel to the first one, I would've liked if they delved more into Diana keeping a low profile, keeps that connection to BvS, and why she's doing it, then again I may need to watch the movie again for that part so take that criticism with a grain of salt.

Wow! What a movie Wonder woman 1984 was, it connected with me on so many levels, so lets get started.My first few positives would be the cinematography, set pieces, character background and action. This movie was completely visually captivating, there was so much visual creativity built into the amazing world building it took my breathe away on multiple occasions really making me get lost in the world. The set pieces were also phenomenal, Dianna's home was absolutely beautiful and explored in a lot more depth here, and in general for the whole movie there was some beautiful set locations that the movie explored, allowing the audience to admire the films beauty, whilst also having great sets to set up the big action sequences. I also really appreciated the character background for Diana, having a good amount of time seeing her childhood and the life lessons she learned from her mum aunt through the games was really great and really made me understand how far Diana has come since she was a child. The action sequences were also excellent, there wasn't absolutely loads of action, but for what this movie did it didn't need a lot, but the actions sequences we did get were absolutely excellent, they were thrilling and entertaining exploring Wonder womans powers well, but also with great stunt work and creativity with the sequences as well.My next few positives would be the great 80's tone and aesthetic, its humour, the great performances with great chemistry, as well as the fantastic villains. I absolutely loved the 80's tone and aesthetic of the movie, they just got it perfect, from the score, to the set pieces and costume design, event the dialogue felt nostalgic and it felt like a completely different kind of superhero movie to anything that I have seen, this also stayed consistent throughout and just completely worked. The movie was also hilarious, the script was excellent, there was so many clever funny lines, and Chris Pine was absolutely excellent here and really sold his character being from a different time period really well. I also thought that the performances here were excellent, as previously mentioned Chris Pine was hilarious, Kristen Wiig was excellent, her performance was believable and charming, establishing her character really well, but also showing a more serious side to her which I loved. Pedro Pascal was absolutely excellent as well, he was intimidating and disturbing and was excellent with his over the top execution working really well especially for the 80's tone to the movie. And Gal Gadot was just excellent, she is Wonder Woman and nobody else can play the character, She was funny, charming and really expresses Diana's more vulnerable and human side perfectly she was truly excellent in the movie, the whole cast were also excellent with each other and had brilliant chemistry whenever any of them were together on screen. The villains were also fantastic, I loved that the movie balanced the villains being a great cause of conflict with the protagonists and exploring their powers well, but also making the audience understand their perspective and what they were going through balancing it with sympathising for them whilst also understanding that they made some terrible choices.My next few positives would be the amazing script, the interesting plot points and developments and the great mysterious tone. I found the script for this movie absolutely fantastic, it gave heart and humanity to superheroes which this genre very rarely does, there was some powerful and inspiring dialogue teaching a lot of people great values, and it spread a message that really connected with me. I also found the plot points really interesting, having a stone that you can wish for something and it comes true was really interesting to me, and added a good blend of fantasy to the realistic human emotion of the characters, I also found that they get an equal amount taken away from them after they have wished for it to be really interesting and was explored well with the characters especially Diana. Because of this, the movie had a great mysterious tone. The movie waited a while to reveal the true powers of the dream stone which I loved, it added tension and mystery and had me constantly questioning what was going to happen which I loved.My final few positives would be character development/ depth, emotional weight, powerful themes and messages and the fantastic final act. I absolutely loved the amount of character development and depth this movie had with its characters, the movie spent way more time developing and focusing on the characters which Ioved, you understood Max and Barbara and what they were going through in their lives and this developed into them turning into great villains throughout the movie, the amount of depth that they went into for Diana as well was truly fantastic, her love for Steve was so strong she was willing to give up her powers to be with him and it was just powerful, and her depth of understanding of the people she was protecting was truly amazing. The movie also had a lot of emotional weight which was a welcome surprise. The movie portrayed Diana and Steve's relationship so beautifully and with so much emotion when they had to say goodbye it was a very heartfelt and genuine moment, and the movies focus on day to day life and enjoying the things you have in your life without wishing for more really got to me, these were powerful and well explored themes that the movie handled perfectly. And finally, the final act was excellent, it was an edge of your seat and entertaining thrill ride, with Diana becoming full on Wonder woman, in a culmination of fantastic action sequences, character work and a very touching end.Overall Wonder woman 1984 takes risks, and is a different kind of superhero movie, creating a fresh change for the genre, with the perfect blend of fantastic action sequences and fantasy moments, fantastic performances from the whole cast, but also adding humanity to the characters making you connect to them on a more substantial level, and with a powerful and moving message that movies from this genre rarely have."}, {"id": 143, "text": "I felt it is quite varied from other superhero movies, It was more of an emotional feel-good kind of film, and the sentimental aspects in the film worked satisfactorily.

It has been delayed a number of times since late 2019, then the COVID-19 pandemic did so again, but I'm glad I finally got to see it, directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster). Basically, in her childhood, young Diana (Lilly Aspell) competed in a multistage athletic competition on Themyscira against older Amazons. She is disqualified for taking a shortcut during the competition; her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), and her aunt Antiope (Robin Wright) lecture her on the importance of truth. In 1984, decades after the First World War, Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) works as a senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. She also continues to fight crime as Wonder Woman. Diana meets new co-worker, Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig), who is insecure, unnoticed by others, and tries to befriend Diana. Whilst researching ancient Mediterranean civilisations and antiquities, Diana is handed a mysterious Dreamstone, which seemingly grants wishes upon contact with any user. Both Diana and Barbara both hold the stone and are unknowingly granted their desires: Diana wishes for her deceased lover, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), whose soul is transported into another man's body; Barbara wishes to be like Diana, and slowly becomes beautiful, strong, and powerful. Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) is a charismatic businessman and entrepreneur, but he is actually a fraud with a failing business. Lord visits the Smithsonian, it is clear that he knows the power of the stone and wants to get his hands on it. He manages to manipulate Barbara during a gala night at the institute in order to acquire the stone. He makes the wish to become the embodiment of the stone and gains its power. In doing so, he can grant one wish to a person, and take whatever he desires from them. Over the next few days, Maxwell rises to become a powerful influential figure, while leaving chaos and destruction. Diana is overjoyed to have Steve back in her life, and he is amazed by the many innovations of the future. But Diana realises that her wish has come at a price, as she is slowly losing some of her abilities. Barbara however embraces her newfound beauty and popularity and takes advantage of her strength and powers. Diana, Steve, and Barbara investigate the Dreamstone further, it is discovered it was created by the God of Treachery and Mischief. The stone grants a user their wish but takes their most cherished possession in return, and the only way to reverse the condition is by renouncing their wish or destroying the stone itself. Steve realises that his existence comes at the cost of Diana's power. Both Diana and Barbara are unwilling to renounce their wishes and try to figure out another solution. Maxwell is desperate to reach out to as many people as possible to grant their wishes and gain more money and power. He manages to get himself a meeting with the President of the United States (Stuart Milligan), who tells him about a satellite broadcast system that can transmit signals globally. Barbara, desperate to keep her power, is determined to stop Diana from harming Maxwell, and joins him as they travel to broadcast station that he will use to communicate to the entire world, offering to grant their wishes. Steve convinces Diana that she must let him go and renounce her wish, she reluctantly does so and regains her strength, and gains the ability to fly. She returns home and dons the armour of the legendary Amazon warrior Asteria, then heads to the broadcast station. She battles Barbara, who has made another wish with Maxwell, transforming her into apex predator creature Cheetah. After defeating Barbara, Diana confronts Maxwell, who has already communicated to millions of people who make their wishes. But Diana uses her Lasso of Truth to communicate with the world via him, convincing everyone to renounce their wishes, after realising the consequences. Maxwell is convinced to renounce his own wish after realising he will lose his son, Alistair (Lucian Perez). The world is eventually restored, and Maxwell is reunited with his son, telling him the truth about his fraudulent lifestyle. Sometime later, Diana is walking the streets during the Christmas holidays, and she meets the handsome man (Kristoffer Polaha) whose body Steve was inhabiting, and she continues to protect the world. In a mid-credit scene, Asteria (Lynda Carter, who famously played Wonder Woman on television) is revealed to be alive and living among humanity in secret, much like Diana. Also starring Amr Waked as Emir Said Bin Abydos, Natasha Rothwell as co-worker Carol, Ravi Patel as Babajide, Oliver Cotton as Simon Stagg, Gabriella Wilde as Raquel, Kelvin Yu as Jake, and Asim Chaudhry as co-worker Roger. Gadot remains perfect casting as the beautiful warrior princess, Pine is both charming and amusing as he discovers the 80s, Wiig who is normally comedic gives an interesting serious performance, and Pascal is pretty good as the power-hungry villain. I agree that it is little bit long, and the various storylines going on make it a bit messy, but you cannot help but be thrilled by the explosive chase and fight sequences, with fantastic special effects, and one or two good songs, including Frankie Goes to Hollywood, in the soundtrack, an entertaining superhero action.

She is stunning, and her performance, especially when she was confronted by Barbara after the White House battle, showed a subtle but effective improvement in acting prowess, as well as a level of confidence in her ability to shoulder the privilege of embodying Wonder Woman.Chris Pine was also very good, and for the most part, played the comedic and emotional beats to perfection or near perfection. Kristen Wiig also delivered a surprisingly striking performance, capturing quite effectively, the polarity of her character. Also, Pedro didn't disappoint either, and did an extremely excellent job with what he had to work with.All in all, the acting and cast were up to the task, and carried the movie quite well, however, the movie itself had a whole lot more shortcomings.The VFX of WW84 are sadly below par, the action sequences are quite underwhelming, the fight scenes are either badly choreographed, badly directed, badly edited, or badly photographed, the story is too ambitious which is fine, but unfortunately doesn't manage to deliver that ambition neatly, and the villains make decisions that appear okay on the surface, but are rather nonsensical with a deeper and obvious look.The finale fight wasn't exiting and further showed Jenkin's struggle with executing well directed action, while Wonder Woman's confrontation with Max illustrated very well, just how the movie couldn't live up to the standards it set for itself. And moving from the finale to the beginning, the first 20 minutes of WW84 are pretty thrilling, however the movie stalls thereafter, and at points, dips.In addition, WW84 felt a lot like The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Wolverine and of course, as this franchise has been doing, Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Feeling like these movies isn't a bad thing, however, the end product needs to somehow be complementary, and in many ways, WW84 failed to do so, though in others, it didn't.To give WW84 a 4/10 would simply be too harsh, however, it is certainly not an 8/10 outing, while furthermore, it sadly fails to trump its predecessor.

The villians were a bit dull but overall it's a must watch for DC fans"}, {"id": 220, "text": "So it's just a movie, but you can't call it a superhero movie or some DCEU things, just using the characters and background the story is ok but if it's not of WW or Gal Gadot I won't buy it Not bad but it's a pity there's no much connections between DC movies"}, {"id": 221, "text": "Very poor script and silly plot resulting in a bad Surprise for the fans , I am really disappointed with what I've seen .

This movie feels like some sort of good message delivery video. Not that I'm against movies which deliver good, positive message but I think that's all this movie does. It feels like I have spent 2.5 hrs in a catechism class with some great score by Hans Zimmer and 3 action scenes, each lasting for 5 mins. The movie starts with Diana who stops a robbery at a mall where they are trying to steal some ancient artifacts. There we come across a Citrine stone created by some evil god(I forgot his name) which grants wishes. Long story short.. Barbara wishes to be like Diana(unaware that Diana possesses superhuman powers) and Max Lord absorbs the stone itself. And the movie is a 2 hour long headache where Diana is trying to stop Max Lord being defended by Cheetah from creating chaos throughout the world with a long speech at the end of the movie. There are so many loopholes in this movie. No clear backstory on the Citrine stone or how it came into existence. Does Max Lord still have the powers of the stone? How did Barbara became Cheetah? She never mentions that she wants to become Cheetah.. she just says that she wants to become an apex predator and Max Lord isn't even touching her when she says that (btw the wishes only come true if your actually touching the stone or Max Lord, after he absorbs the stone). They have also made use of the transitive property so that Max Lord can touch everyone (figuratively) to grant everyone their wishes. It's like Max Lord is controlling some equipment which shoots particles (don't ask which ones) and these particles falling on all the human beings. So in a way, Max Lord is in physical contact with everyone. I don't know.. it's one of those lame things. Even I don't get it. And at the end Diana speaks through Max Lord with everyone to renounce their wishes and everyone agrees. Come on.. seriously? On the postive side, I liked the score by Hans Zimmer. The performance by Kristen Wiig as Barbara/Cheetah and Pedro Pascal as Max Lord were really good. It's a shame that they failed to make good use of it. Overall my experience was not great. The 1st Wonder Woman movie was so much better than this sequel. This movie made me do the unthinkable act - texting someone while watching a movie in theatre. Seriously.. it's a big deal when it comes to me. Anyways it did not make me sleepy, like the Suicide Squad garbage did.

At least bring out the Evil possessed being and have an epic showdown or something ... Greek Descendant vs some other religion immortal battle ... TV Animated series are freaking way better portraiting Diana / Wonder Woman.

Not to mention the awful last 10 minutes of that first movie. After seeing this sequel, I was pleasantly surprised by this fresh, creative continuation of the character of Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot kills it as the main character once again, and proves her worth as possibly the best part of the DC universe at this point in time. A stand out performance for me was Pedro Pascal as the main antagonist, with a unique and human twist to his ending in the movie. As great as this movie is, the cgi let it down in some scenes but overall doesn't ruin the experience. There are also many cheesy shots and lines, but this is passable as the movie is set in the 80's - an era of cheesy movies. Overall, an amazing ending to a horrible year.

I waited patiently for this film to release and I was dismayed by what I saw. The action is dull, the acting is wooden and dialogue sounds like it was written by a a first time writer. If you love cliches this is your movie. It's filled with them and you just have to roll your eyes. Superman v. Batman is a far more superior than this film. Director Patty Jenkins really dropped the ball. The first film was so much better. What blows my mind is that the movie was directed by the same person who directed the first one. I think it was the right decision to split the release between digital and theatrical because it was not going to make its profit back just by doing a theatrical release, let alone on demand. I don't recommend this movie. I'd advise you wait until it's free on tv in about a year. It's that bad. It pains me to be so critical of Wonder Woman because I'm a huge fan. However, I'm not a fan of a director who can't even make a decent sequel. This is the same director who is going to direct Star Wars Rouge Squadron in 2023.

(Of all the WTF moments of 2020 trailers, this was top of the list.... just HOW? A McGuffin is involved, but no spoilers here!).In brief, Patty Jenkins delivers a popcorn blockbuster than has legs (over and above Gadot's perfect specimens!): the Goblet-of-Fire-Potteresque pre-title sequence is thrilling and engaging. And the story builds cleverly through the first half of the movie. Above all, there is a heap of HEART involved here.... this is not your run of the mill supervillain showdown flick. In fact, it's a movie with TWO villains (normally a doom-laden premise for this reviewer... Spider Man 3.... shudder), but here it really works well.Sure, there is a requirement for a suspension of belief, but - hey - it's a DC movie. On a slight downside, the second half of the movie - for me -unfortunately doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first half, blending Bruce Almighty with Superman 2 and rather over-egging the pudding.But in a lockdown morass of B-pics, this sequel is one that is gorgeous to look at (Matthew Jensen's cinematography is superb), gorgeous to listen to (an epic score by Hans Zimmer) and is genuinely engaging. There's also a nice vein of humour running through it... when Kristen Wiig is in a park, a rough sleeper on a bench is reading Waiting for Godot.... or is it Waiting for Gadot?? It's such a brief scene, I wasn't sure!Although I DEPLORE the Warner's decision to release their material in parallel to streaming, here is a movie that is MAGNIFICENT on the big screen and WELL WORTH you getting out to the cinema to see... assuming that you can find a UK cinema open (I saw this in the excellent Showcase De Lux in Southampton).Oh, and if you are someone who dives for the exit at the first title... resist... there is an excellent and surprising mid-title sequence that will particularly appeal us older folks!(Please check out the full graphical review on bob-the-movie-man, which will be going live shortly. Thanks)."}, {"id": 231, "text": "I have seen quite a mixed reception to Wonder Woman 1984. A lot of people really like it, and it also didn't work for some people. I haven't seen anyone who hated the film though, but no one seems to love it in the same way that I love it.However, with that in mind, it's fair to say that I didn't love the film until the third act. I really enjoyed the first two acts, but there were a couple of elements that kept me from being completely taken with the film. Fortunately, they weren't issues once the third act came around, because the whole film was about setting up little pieces and building to an epic final\u00e9.This was by far the best performance that Gal Gadot has ever given. She was absolutely fantastic as Wonder Woman, and Chris Pine was also sublime. I wasn't convinced about the way they chose to resurrect him at first, but this is one of the aspects that I ended up really appreciating. Pedro Pascal as Maxwell Lord and Kristen Wiig as Barbara Minerva were also terrific.Wonder Woman 1984 might have come out in 2020, but it felt like a product of the 80s. The production design was perfect, and the cinematography had a very 80s feel to it. This was great because it's my favourite decade, even though I wasn't born until a few years after it ended, and so I loved seeing these characters in that time period.The narrative of Wonder Woman 1984 was exceptional. It didn't feel like a superhero film for most of it, but that wasn't a bad thing. In fact, there was a large chunk of the film, probably an hour or so, in which Gadot was portraying Diana alone, and not Wonder Woman. That could have been an issue, but I was so invested in what was happening on-screen that it didn't bother me in the slightest.The story centred around greed, and how having too much power can corrupt even the most innocent of people. That was such a profound message, and Patty Jenkins directed the narrative in a completely engrossing way.There wasn't really a straight-up villain of the film, which I liked. Maxwell and Barbara were easily corrupted because they weren't happy with the lifestyle that they had and they were willing to do anything to change it, but they weren't evil.I'm always a big fan of fish-out-of-water elements, and that's what we had here with Steve being taken out of the 1910s and placed in the 1980s. It was very entertaining to watch, and the chemistry that Gadot and Pine shared on-screen was even better than it was in the first film.There was a scene towards the end that really hit me on an emotional level, far more than I would have expected from a comic book film. I won't spoil what happens, but it involves a choice that Diana had to make in regards to not letting greed overcome her and making a sacrifice in order to retain her humanity. This wasn't something that I expected, and it elevated the film for me.I also really loved a scene where Diana and Steve were in a plane, with some fireworks going off around them. I'm not sure how practical that was, but the cinematography and musical score were beautiful.Aside from a couple of coincidences that were only used to move the narrative along, and the too sharp of a decline from Barbara into Cheetah, I was completely floored by Wonder Woman 1984. It wasn't what I expected, but it exceeded my expectations and so I call that a win. Seriously, whenever you can, you need to see this film.SCORE: 96%"}, {"id": 232, "text": "I'm telling you I'm so disappointed... Gal Gadot is a Goddes, don't get me wrong.

In general: super basic plot with mega ultra tropes;effects are seriously...so disappointing like you're watching Adam West's Batman and it's not even cute..;characters (main villains) are sooo tropey...you only roll eyes on everything they say and motivation...;no background whatsoever...I thought maybe I should have known something from comics, but no...;music of genius Hans Zimmer was so loud, I couldn't hear dialogues.Honestly...I'm so sad writing this.

Sure, it's fun, hits all the right superhero marks, and visually, the 1980-something world is a technicolor throwback to behold.Wonder Woman 1984 doesn't have the same jaw-dropping impact of Wonder Woman (how could it?), but Jenkins maintains a steady hand on the character and her story.This is a superhero film meant for the big screen but trapped on a smaller one.Bonkers in a way that superhero movies these days don't have the nerve to be. You'd have to be a Grinch to hate on a blockbuster sequel that's so puppy-eager to please.

Helped hugely by the success of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. After so long (and so many) movies, audiences have come to expect a certain type of action-blockbuster. Usually climaxing with a level 100 boss battle (complete with threatening sky beam).WW84 is not that movie.The original Wonder Woman was closer to that mould, apparently forced in that direction by studio high ups, but this time it seems Patty Jenkins has earned enough sway at Warner Bros to make the movie she wanted to.WW84 manages to achieve something unique in the superhero space by offering a film less concerned with the next action beat, and more concerned with the next emotional one. It's ultimately a love story, wrapped in a social commentary on capitalism, with a message of truth and hope. For me it invoked the same sense of hope that came with watching Donner's 1978 Superman as a kid.Of course Gal Godot and Chris Pine still carry the film with their brilliant chemistry. And Kristin Wiig was a great choice for the role of Barbara Minerva. I also appreciated Pedro Pascal's turn as villain Maxwell Lord who comes very close to being too over-the-top cheesy but still pulls off a convincing humanising performance.WW84 is not the epic superhero blockbuster we might have been expecting with a return to the movies. Perhaps it's trying to be something more. A timely reminder of what a true hero can be in 2020."}, {"id": 235, "text": "When was the last time you saw a proper standalone superhero film? Yeah, I couldn't remember either and as I watched Diana swing from one lightning to another, I experienced that long forgotten feeling of heroic joy. While it certainly didn't live up to the ridiculous hype, it was still a grand spectacle that satisfied my craving for a cinematic experience.To my surprise, the narrative of the film was a lot bigger than was shown in the trailer and I mean a lot! Due to her actions, Diana ended up paying quite a hefty price as she battled two intriguing and non generic villains while the events of the film escalated to levels that are uncommon for most superhero movies. With that being said, WW84 did try to poorly juggle too many subplots and as a result couldn't tie them up in a nice way without leaving a multitude of in-your-face plot holes.I admired that instead of trying to justify the plot elements with pseudo sciene or the word quantum, the movie just admitted that it was magic. Sadly the narrative itself lacked the magic of the original as it failed to conjure up a single emotional moment, not counting the stunning prologue. Gal Gadot was naturally electrifying but her performance felt timid, as if she was sacred of being a powerful heroine that we loved in Part 1.As the film swings between magnificence and disappointment, it satisfies the cinematic superhero craving thanks to the impressive visuals and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack but it fails to create the exhilarating experience due to a flawed narrative and a lack of an emotional touch. If I watched it at home, it would have been a 6/10 so cinema is recommended.Movies.shmovies on Instagram"}, {"id": 236, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The superhero genre has been growing exponentially during the last decade, so it's bizarre to go through an entire year with only Birds of Prey and The New Mutants instead of literally dozens of films from both Marvel and DC. Thankfully, Warner Bros. decided to release Wonder Woman 1984 before the year's end, but not without a catch. Most people will only have the possibility of watching one of the few blockbusters of 2020 through HBO Max, a streaming service only available in a couple of countries, while some incredibly lucky moviegoers might have the chance of seeing this visually epic film in theaters, depending on the country's pandemic rules.Fortunately, I'm one of those lucky people who got the opportunity to end 2020 on a positively immersive note by watching Patty Jenkins' latest flick in an almost empty IMAX theater (paradise). If you've been following me for some time, you know I'm a firm believer and defender of the so-called theater experience, and I can't hide the fact that I felt extremely emotional going into one of the best, biggest theaters in Portugal to witness one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2020. Until 2017, DCEU struggled to deliver a massively loved installment, and Wonder Woman came to the rescue. It was one of my favorite films of the respective year, so I was obviously excited for its sequel, even more having in mind the circumstances we're all living in.In my opinion, this sequel stands close to its predecessor. With a lengthy runtime known for being associated with absolutely epic movies, I was confident that WW84 could deliver a solid film with great villains for a change. Well, Kristen Wigg and Pedro Pascal are definitely two of the indisputable standouts. Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and David Callaham made the right decision in dedicating a significant portion of the screenplay to Barbara Minerva and Max Lord. Their arcs are far from being groundbreaking, but they're a thousand times more effective than the CG punch bag narrative.Barbara follows the lonely, insignificant, no one cares about me archetype, and Wiig does a surprisingly remarkable job in portraying this character, but the script is what really makes her shine. At first, her comedic mannerisms left me a bit dubious about the eventual character's likeness. However, as time flies by, it's almost inevitable to feel sorry for Barbara, making her future motivations understandable and perfectly natural. On the other hand, Max Lord is apparently exploding with conviction, but his life is not as amazing as everyone might think. This time, it's Pedro Pascal who ends up elevating the character, delivering a brilliant performance with just the right amount of over-the-top expressions.Even though these two are magnificent, Gal Gadot continues to prove that she's one of the best casting choices of the millennium, interpreting Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman. I seriously cannot imagine another actress wearing that costume, throwing that Lasso of Truth, incorporating the character's essence as seamless as Gadot. In this movie, she was able to perform highly emotional scenes, nailing every single one. Her chemistry with Chris Pine (Steve Trevor) is palpable on the other side of the world, and their interactions go through every zone of the emotion spectrum. Regarding Steve, I'm not going to spoil how he comes back or anything concerning his arc, but I can safely write that his presence in the film is both necessary and logical.The biggest compliment I'll offer this sequel concerns its screenplay and direction. Finally, I can confidently write that the DCEU is capable of producing a well-structured, well-developed story with well-written characters. It doesn't have as much action as the original, but I still didn't feel the 151 minutes. WW84 flows incredibly well due to Jenkins' ability to fill up the runtime (almost) only with important scenes. There's a slight over-persistence in the attempt at sending a certain message (I'll get there), but story-wise, I sincerely wouldn't take a second out. Even the comic relief moments, particularly with Pine (who plays some sort of parallelism with the first movie's Diana), are welcome and timely.The action scenes might be low on quantity, but the few that the audience gets are long, complex, and technically challenging to pull off. The opening sequence alone almost made me tear up due to its epicness. Hans Zimmer's powerful score, Richard Pearson's clean editing, and Matthew Jensen's camera work all work together to present a lengthy, grand, wide view of an Olympics-style obstacle course with young Diana. Throughout the entire film, the action is colorful, vibrant, fun, and entertaining... except for the (supposedly) climactic clash.Well, to be fair, there are two climaxes during the last thirty minutes since WW84 owns two antagonists to play with. One of them is closed in perfect fashion, with the emotional stakes at their highest. Great job there, no complaints whatsoever. However, the main fight sequence inexplicably contrasts with the rest of the movie's action. The vibrant colors disappear and are replaced by a dull grey, which makes one of the characters involved (who shares the same color tone) hard to notice, transforming an epic final battle into an underwhelming, barely comprehensible collection of awkward cuts, punches, and screams. Gadot's golden suit is way less exciting (and poorly lit) than her original costume, and Barbara's arc ends without real closure.In addition to this, Jenkins insists too much on passing to the audience that greed brings horrible consequences. Be careful what you wish for, money and power can't buy happiness, be thankful for what you have, and messages along these lines are repeated continuously (implicitly and explicitly). I admit that it might be a nitpick of mine and that not many people will feel like I did, but I couldn't help but feel that some moments sounded and/or seemed a bit preachy and way too repetitive. Also, it's a bit weird how the official premise mentions Wiig as Cheetah, but this word is not mentioned once in the entire film... Nevertheless, don't be mistaken: I'm thrilled that WW84 is the last flick I watch at a theater this year!All in all, Wonder Woman 1984 proves that DC continues on the track of success by delivering a well-structured, well-developed DCEU installment without an absurd amount of overwhelming CGI and/or forgettable villains. Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns, and David Callaham's impressively layered screenplay makes the lengthy runtime feel adequate not only by offering epic, exciting, technically superb action set pieces, but also due to the remarkably well-written heroes and antagonists. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are outstanding together, but Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal steal the show as the newcomers. With two wonderful villains, WW84 boasts a solid, elaborate narrative that I was lucky to witness on the big screen. Unfortunately, the climactic battle is disappointingly underwhelming and colorless, Barbara's arc ends abruptly without true closure, and Jenkins insists too much on the thematic message of the story. These issues may affect more viewers or not, but one thing's for sure: it's one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year, worthy of being seen on a massive theater.Rating: A-"}, {"id": 237, "text": "What should I write about Wonder Woman 1984? The unique and breath-taking choreograph and action sequence inspired by Cirque du Soleil? How Ms Gal Gadot is perfect for the role? She is strong, determined, heroic and beautiful, you just can't take your eyes off her. Should I commend the skilful direction of Ms Patty Jenkins? Who portrays female power so well? This is not a good year for movies, and also movie fans. First, cinema closure. Then, many movies are forced to push back their screening dates. Will the experience of big screen be finally replaced by streaming companies? I really hope not. After the release of wonder woman in streaming, we know that a perfectly clear digital copy will be available on the web, and this will affect the box office of Wonder Woman 1984 somehow, even diminishing the efforts of Ms Gadot, Ms Jenkins and the entire movie production team who have worked hard for this movie. But let me assure you that no digital copy can replace your experience in the movie theatre. This is a chaotic year, but with the vaccine in the horizon, I believe hope will prevail once again. In this chaotic year, we need a movie like Wonder woman 1984.This movie had brought me into a journey to another world, and let me lost in this world happily.

Pedro Pascal continues to remind us why 2020 is arguably his year; Kristen Wiig channels Annie from Bridesmaids and totally owns the role of Barbara Minerva, whilst the producers thankfully do justice to her CGI counterpart.Is it better than the 2017 film though? The short answer is no: it takes an hour at least to get going, whilst the final showdown between Diana and Barbara is underwhelming, lasting only seconds longer than the infamously short dust up between Batman and Superman in BvS. Thinking about it, none of the action is particularly memorable, at least nothing on the same scale as the trench scene from the first film.However, bum-numbing runtime aside, this film is still a good time, demonstrating that, even in the oversaturated superhero genre, films like Wonder Woman can still have the power to surprise its audience."}, {"id": 239, "text": "Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkis return for the sequel to Wonder Woman.

In the trailers, they put New Order - Blue Monday and it was one of the things that took me to see the movie.It also has fan service and references according to the mythology of the heroine in the comics. And that post-credits scene was sensational, it made me tear up and vibrate, and look, I didn't even accompany this person in her time!"}, {"id": 240, "text": "After months and months of anticipation Wonder Woman 1984 has finally made its way to the UK and I went back to the cinema today to see it and here is my review. The premise of the film is set in the year 1984 and sees Diana Prince trying to get on with her life as new threats emerge to challenge her.Main Character I remember when Gal Gadot was cast as Wonder Woman, most of us out there were like she looks the part but can she act the part and without a shadow of a doubt she is perfect as Wonder Woman and it is the role she was born to play. She brings so much life to this character and you really care about Diana and really want her to succeed, her character takes interesting twists and turns and it feels like an appropriate development from the previous film and credit to Gadot for that.Supporting Characters Chris Pine reprises his role as Steve Trevor and I wasn't sure about this after what happened to his character in the previous film but it really works and is a real highlight of the film. Pine and Gadot have superb chemistry together and it is even better here then it was in the previous film and that is because both of them are having so much fun together and it is really nice to see and works for the story the film is trying to tell. Kristen Wiig plays Barbara Minerva and I thought she did a really good job in the film, I must admit I wasn't sure at first but as the film goes on she gets better and better and her character is one you can feel a bit of sympathy for and you understand the actions she takes and credit to her for a strong performance here. Pedro Pascal plays Maxwell Lord and he is fantastic here, the trailers make it out that he is just a cheesy villain but he is far from that, he is the most interesting character in this film and they do so much to make him a memorable antagonist and one that will be remembered. I think with The Mandalorian we have maybe forgotten just how good Pascal is and this film is here to remind people just how charismatic and amazing an actor that he is.Story The story for this film is fantastic and one of the best in recent comic book films. The relationship between Steve and Diana is really well developed and better handled here then it was in the first film, mixed with the interesting characters of Barbara &amp; Lord provides a fascinating story that feels appropriate in 2020. It really pulls on the emotion and especially in current times it feels like the story people need and one that will resonate with audiences. A film like this shows that sometimes having less characters but really developing them is a much better idea and allows you to really get invested in what you are watching.Script The script is great, this film takes place in the 80s and doesn't hide away from it but it also doesn't cheese the film up too much and feels like the right amount of it. The drama is ramped up and I grew to really care about the characters in the film and the blend felt right all the right through with those deep moments and the lighter moments.Style As I mentioned above the film does a really good job in making you feel like you are watching the 1980s and it is a fun change of pace from what we are used to for sure. The action scenes are also pretty well done in this film even though there is an over reliance of The Lasso Of Truth, that is a tiny complaint. Though I do have a bigger complaint and that is some of the CGI, these were in the trailers so there not spoilers but it is Cheetah and the Golden Winged Armour. They just don't look very good and the action scene teased in the trailer disappoints and fails to live up to the hype.Overall Overall, this is a fantastic film that improves on the first film. If you are a fan of Wonder Woman you will really enjoy this film and this is a film you have to experience on the big screen so when you feel comfortable go out and support cinemas and this film by seeing it."}, {"id": 241, "text": "Sure you'd agree with me that Gal Gadot is a treat to our eyes, and in WW84 she shines with exquisiteness physical beauty and excellent acting. But the movie itself, especially its script is simply pathetic.Pulling her bf from heaven into Earth is just nuts. Diana asked how was that and he replied that he was in a good place and then all the sudden he was in the body of that unknown guy and he used the phone book to track her. wao, and where the script writers sent the soul of the man whose body was taken (or borrowed)? hey wait, we just borrow a body... nuts.then, the transformation of the nerdy, kind, good-heart archeology lady into the mean-spirited cheetah makes no sense. it doesn't suit well that if you are really good person with respect and love for humanity rooted in you, makes no sense of all the sudden becoming totally the opposite plus becoming bad is not a good message. me, i did not like that.also, everybody getting from egypt to new york in seconds is totally loco, and i don't think a pilot from world war II could immediately fly F-16. and diane gets into the smithsonian to just steal a plane which full gas tank and all ready to fly, come on...i could go on and on. yes, i know its just a movie, but when i compare WW84 with the one we saw in 2017 there is such a huge difference in quality.the one before is far superior, far more entertaining and believable, and the little diana competing in the initial games is a cute lovely little girl, but when running and competing does not seem athletic at all to overpower the other seasoned warriors.also, pedro pascal as max could not be more annoying, and so creepy the way he hugs his little son, who should be scare to no end with a dad so loco that that.i could really go on with more examples on how the script is weird, but sufficient to say that Gal Gadot is PERFECT as wonder woman, the most stunning wonder woman ever. BUT the movie itself is disappointing to say the least. i give it a 2 out of 10 and will not watch it again, nor recommend it."}, {"id": 242, "text": "Just saw it and I have to say I am bit disappointed with it. There was no big battle or catastrophic scenes that is synonymous with superhero movies. Cheetah again is another weak villain and the other one was nothing but just someone who grant wishes. It feels more like a made for TV movie instead.I can't help to think one of the reason why the film was so bad was Patty Jenkins unhappy with her pay though she got a hefty increase on this 2nd movie. It may be justifiable for her comment however I would compared it to someone new who just started working maybe with a couple of years of experience as opposed to someone who has already been doing it for decades. There is no way the compensation package will be the same for both. So she should do the grind like everyone else before demanding more.Unfortunately this movie wouldn't give her that considering how badly it turned out both from CGI and storyline perspective."}, {"id": 243, "text": "Jenkins' fast paced direction makes this film an effective comic book movie that leans heavily on wholesomeness and optimism, leaving out any kind of moral ambiguity or nuance for bright colours and popcorn friendly ostentatious action scenes. WW84 is a rare superhero sequel that, for better or rarely worse, carves its own path and finds something joyous, wacky and deeply enjoyable as a result. Gadot has a queenly self-possession and she remains a charismatic presence who wields the lasso with authority. There are some fantastic costumes and some terrific bold performances from a delightful cast specially Pedro Pascal who's talent is being wasted behind the Mandalorian helmet. It's a visually dazzling melodrama that has to hide it's relative disinterest in superpowered showdowns but the movie's in service of a plot that sometimes loses sight of what makes the character so great in the first place. Though the film can't quite reach the heights of the first film, it is still brimming with the same wonder and joy as the previous one beacuse unlike the first the flaws are minor and aren't glaring at you and the movie definitely soars beautifully when it matters the most. Overall, Wonder Woman 1984 is a very hopeful film with hints of sadness and realism especially towards the end and it kinda takes you back into the real world with a much needed message of hope and a sense of optimism, contemplated strongly by the musical score from the legend Hans Zimmer."}, {"id": 244, "text": "So the pandemic situation cancelled Wonder Woman premiere in June 2020, but finally we are hare ,watching the Diana Prince, who is becoming Wonder Woman in every difficult situation. She is the solution, the one hero that everybody is waiting for. Yes she is entertaining me enough to pass over the corona situation in my country. At least, we can think about movie and we watch it on the cinema like ordinary days we have. It is a fun way to appreciate the world. She is the light on the movie nowadays. I don't know who else can be Wonder Woman, than the gorgeous Gal Gadot. This Wonder Woman 1984 is quite different with the previous Wonder Woman, because we can see more drama and more loves, but at the same time we have more tears and more desperate feelings. Wonder Woman is pictured to have weaknesses, is about to love. Loving can take some energies inside you. Sometimes we lost the way and we redefine again ourselves. I think Patty Jenkins here want us to know that Diana Prince is also weak about love just other women. When we are really in love, we are just weak, we are not becoming ourselves, and sometimes we lost ourselves. The drama inside, the extraordinary special effects, and of course the beauty of Gal Gadot makes once again the breakthrough in our Wonder Woman era. I am thankful to the God that I am alive in the same universe with great director and actors of this movie."}, {"id": 245, "text": "(This review is from my daughter)About Wonder Woman 1984...I cried multiple times during the movie.I was an outspoken fan of the first WW: Wonder Woman was portrayed as a badass warrior with an immense heart. I am so happy that WW1984 explored the other side of Diana: her constant pursuit of love, truth and conciliation; her belief that humanity has achieved great, formidable things and that, in the end, human beings can UNDERSTAND AND FORGIVE each other and rise above selfish motivations. YES, the action sequences are effing AMAZING!! BUT, it is the EMOTIONAL sequences in the movie that will make you cry like a baby and will make you say to yourself: this is the movie we need for the times we're living right now.This movie is aspirational. It captures perfectly the 80's mood in its setting, design, feel, almost cartoonish approach. It is DELIBERATELY corny in doing this. And it works so well because it is self-aware and earnest! This film is like Wonder Woman herself: full of heart, full of goodness, full of hope. The music score... oh my God, the music score...As I said before: Diana/Wonder Woman is the feminist icon we need. Strong, compassionate, truthful, badass, sensitive, sensual. And one of the best parts about WW movies is exactly this: the development of Diana as a character with these traits is not done at the expense of weakening and demonising male main characters. Steve Trevor is her equal (except in super-hero powers...), and she LOVES him PRECISELY because he is so strong, competent, badass, courageous and heroic. Max Lord - one of the most complex main villains I've seen in a comic book movie - well, let's just say... be prepared to cry for and with him. Only a WW movie can make you feel like this for a villain.This movie does a 180 in relation to the previous one. Be ready and open to this change. It is done deliberately - after the massive success of WW1, trying to repeat the same formula would be destined to fail. By adopting a complete different approach, WW1984 works perfectly and is a great sequel to the brilliant first movie!Ana Cavalieri"}, {"id": 246, "text": "I liked the first Wonder Woman. I did not love it, I did not hate it. It was a competent movie and a pretty good superhero movie although it had a lot of bad things about it. This 1984 sequel is cut from the same stone, only dialed up to a over the top 1980s movie. In comparison the CGi is better in this movie, and perhaps the acting is also slightly better overall. The villains are also slightly better, but since the absolute atrocious villains from the first movie are some of the worst of all time it does not really say so much. Everything else though... oh my...Okay, lets start with the good. As mention above the DC computer graphics department has improved. Without checking I assume some got fired and they hired more competent people because the special effects in this movie is about 10 times better than the first... well, it was so bad in the first movie so not a good comparison and the effects have bad moments in this movie too... The music and scenes are done well. Patty is a great director comes to scenes, settings, set design and using it to paint a gorgeous picture. She should make documentaries or something, action movies however... not so much... And as in the first movie the on screen romance and scenes with Diana and Steve are great. Those two have a great chemistry and almost all the plus I can give this movie comes from those two and their scenes together. They should make a movie with those two stranded on an island or something, I think they would do a great job.Sadly there the praise ends.The big negatives are the over the top cranked up to maximum fling and flung to cranked up music. It is hard to explain, but is just like someone threw all they could think of about the 1980s into a blender, threw tons of pastels at it, put the volume on max and then let a subpar action director throw this mix at the screen with little to no thought behind it. This is just noise and colours and attempts at humour that is meant to be cool, teach us something, and the movie is supposed to have this big psychological worldwide unification moment and it all fails. Miserably fails.This movie wants to be cool, it wants to have depth, it wants to give us WW as this inspiring mother figure that cares for all and save us from ourselves. But since it is all done with really bad dialogue (only the scenes with Diana and Steve work) and almost every scene is cringeworthy garbage this movie is a huge failure. It fails with almost everything. And when Diana is not with Steve she is like a walking around cliche teddy-bear stating so many nauseating lines I am uncertain which line is the worst. Dianas wisdom is by itself a drinking game in this movie. Diana's power level change constantly, there are plot holes in almost every scene, and the villains, although a lot better than in the first, are such cringy over the top weirdo types that I kept thinking of Sharon Stone in Catwoman. And the 1984's scenes and feel is too much. This movie is a parody of the 1980s.I could go on about how nukes work, or how much fuel there are in planes, and how geography does not change to fit a movie or any other thing that bothered the hell out of me with this movie, but I will just end this with stating that the 3/10 point is generous, only saved by the great pairing of Gadot and Pine. Those two should always be in each other movies from now on. I also give a extra point for Patty Jenkins use of set design. Some of this movie is lovely to look at, too bad the movie otherwise suck. I also want to state, since I saw this movie in Spain, that if you go and watch it in Spain ignore the translation text at the bottom of the screen. Sure the dialogue in this movie is awful, but the translation make it even worse."}, {"id": 247, "text": "I loved this film so much. DC Comics have been on the right track in recent years with a move from drab superhero films to bright, fun blockbusters, and Wonder Woman 1984 is the culmination of all of that hard work. Though a fairly simple and arguably overlong film, this is pure, unadulterated superhero joy throughout, prioritising fun, action-packed entertainment over convoluted comic book lore from start to finish.Highly reminiscent of the original Superman starring Christopher Reeve, Wonder Woman 1984 is a film that just wants to have as much fun as possible, no matter what. So, while its immediate predecessor may have seen Diana Prince fight off enemies in a fairly more gritty and down-to-earth style, this sequel breaks open the toybox with a seemingly infinite supply of utterly delightful superhero excitement.Everything about Wonder Woman 1984 is bright, fun-loving and so wonderfully innocent. From its humour to its action and even the colour of Diana's superhero outfit, this movie is perhaps the most purely enjoyable comic book blockbuster of the 21st century.Though the story admittedly takes a while to get into gear, the opening two sequences of this movie are so much fun, and hark back to a more innocent, fantastical view of superheroes like in the days of Christopher Reeve's Superman.As comic book movies have come to dominate the box office, we've been looking for new, supposedly fresh angles on classic superhero stories, but it's not often that we get a movie nowadays which just wants to tell that classic story in as enjoyable a manner as possible.Despite an undeniably slow-moving first act, Wonder Woman 1984 bursts into life in the second act, with a thrillingly entertaining story of globe-trotting goodies and baddies, all culminating in an utterly preposterous but brilliantly enjoyable action finale that just keeps getting better and better.This movie isn't trying hard to be relevant to the modern day, or even to the laws of reality, but it's exactly that which will make Wonder Woman 1984 a timeless classic of superhero cinema. Simplistic it may be, and completely detached from reality it certainly is, but that willingness to just let loose and have fun makes the film so enormously likable.Gal Gadot is once again outstanding as Wonder Woman, and without doubt the best hero in the DC Extended Universe by a long way, while Chris Pine delights in a smaller but still thoroughly enjoyable supporting role. Kristen Wiig is a surprise too, while Pedro Pascal is the real stand-out as the film's main antagonist, with just the right balance of menacing greed and comic book villainy to fit this film's fun-loving atmosphere to perfection.Coupled with gorgeous visuals and excellent CGI effects throughout that only add to the film's bright-eyed take on superhero cinema, it would take the coldest of souls to find something to genuinely dislike about Wonder Woman 1984.Director Patty Jenkins led the way forward for DC with Wonder Woman three years ago, and now with this sequel, Jenkins has once again cemented herself as an immensely talented filmmaker, always putting the audience first and telling the fun, enjoyable story that we all need, and that Wonder Woman really should be.Overall, it's fair to say that Wonder Woman 1984 is a far, far cry from the drab beginnings of DC's Extended Universe with Man Of Steel. Blissfully simplistic yet endlessly entertaining, the film's unrelenting imagination and desire to have fun will set it out as a timeless classic of superhero cinema, featuring another spectacular performance from Gal Gadot as Diana Prince, and more incredible directing from Patty Jenkins."}, {"id": 248, "text": "I liked the first movie, not as much as everyone but it was a compelling story, and I enjoyed it very much, nothing perfect but solid. I love the DCEU and superhero movies in general and I was very hyped for this movie and I couldn't wait to watch it in theaters during those hard times we're living. I was able to watch it and enjoy its wonderful visuals in theaters, but I was mostly disappointed.I honestly found the plot awful. The actors, especially Pascal and Wiig play their parts wonderfully, they're good actors but the very inconsistent characters, apart from some good scenes, are not enjoyable. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are also great and the truth is that the dialogue between Diana and Steve did touch me and there were very good scenes, my favorite of the film was when they say goodbye again, I got really emotional and it was wonderful.But apart from a spectacular opening scene with Diana in Themyscira, and some entertaining action scenes, the plot and script of the film are very bad and border on the ridiculous. It tries to honor the 80s and the superhero spirit but fails, being quite lazy and inconsistent.I don't blame the director as she did a very good job with the first movie, and I think Jenkins is a compelling director with good qualities. Maybe it's mee who has not known how to connect with this picture, and I am not saying that it is a total mess either. But the incredible sountrack of Zimmer, good action scenes and the excellent performances of the protagonists do not manage to save a film with a poor story, with a very different tone from the first and that does not manage to keep entertained or express its message well (an interesting one but poorly expressed).It's a shame because I love the DCEU (specially the Snyder ones), more than many, they tend to be deep films and with good direction and I like their seriousness, or when they try to change the tone like they did with Aquaman which was a bit more campy or go more to comedy like what they did with Shazam or Brids of Prey they also, without being so good, manage to get you entertained and you enjoy them, even their worst films for my taste have something interesting.WW84 disappoints me but at least it has some scenes that I liked. I was looking forward to this movie a lot and it's a shame for me.

Tarantino Kill Bell is one of the most beautiful films that has presented us with female characters, and I don't hold a grudge against female superheroes.For example, Jennifer Lawrence with the mysterious character was amazing and Scarlett Johansson as a black widow was amazing But with this movie, the character, the story, the music, the fighting CGI is bad, and by all technical standards, this is one of the worst Superhero films recently I apologize for the Captain Marvel movie and take the title of the worst Super Heroes movie and award it to this movieLet's first explain that very few Super Hero movies have a dramatic or original story that excites the audience. There are very few, as usual, there is a danger to people, and the job of the superheroes is to always stop this danger. This is the scenario, and this is not a weakness, but there are factors that distinguish these films, including the problems of superheroes who suffer from psychological or family problems or problems with their acquired power. As for the character of the villain, what is the evil that he possesses and enjoys, what does he do with this evil, what are the causes and justifications for this evil, and the moral dilemma that we always live with between villains and superheroes or the superhero can rely on comedy and provide us with many interesting comedic scenes or moments Wonderful fighting, all these factors contribute to making the film close to the heart of the viewer and be beautiful, but this movie does not contain nor does it contain any of this"}, {"id": 250, "text": "Finally, the film we have been waiting for from after the success of the first part and one of the films that were successful in the world DC Everyone is waiting and excited about this movie, which is considered a huge budget and an excellent crew ... so does it deserve? .....

The second thing is the story itself follows the path of its righteousness and right, meaning everything important to the story has become his excuse was stupid and as if they say the audience is tolerant, or it can not pay attention, or that you see. Why are the heroes not like you ... Unfortunately this is walking the length of the film there was nothing logical in it at all He landed his sweet messages many, and this is acceptable, but not to the point that he turns a silly drama film that talks about how the world has changed with love and affection! Even the bad guys who are the most important elements in the film, unfortunately, were ridiculous and bitter. Do not let me burn you. How did I save the world, unfortunately ..In the sweet element of the story, which is the return of Steve, the friend of the heroine, and how he gets to know the developed world and was trying to adapt to it and was enjoyable, but myself, the whole thing became fast and fast, and everything was controlled without any logic, but it was one of the best elements of the story as laughter at leastWe survived the action scenes, which unfortunately were an Indian film, meaning a movie with a huge budget, the effects were excellent, but the execution was stupid.But the frankness is transmitted as an experience in cinema. It was enjoyable at its moment, I mean, the action scenes took advantage of the cinema screen and speakers, right, and this was a wonderful thing in the atmosphere of the film, especially with the huge scenes and I have a second experience, God willingActing here was excellent frankness from all the actors. Even if the characters were ridiculous, the performance was from the heart, and it is the one that lets you hope for a pen, especially actor Pascal as Max Lord and actress Christine Wiig as CheetahIn general, the film never had expectations and exaggerations, and it reminded me of finding a movie Superman IV: The Quest for peace And how did they turn the action movie and the heroes into a movie How did he try to change the world with positive thinking .. Here the story is patched up, believe it, and how you are The action, as you expected, was bad coordination, even though the effects are mighty Acting is excellent despite the ridiculousness of the characters ... The film is worthy if you love the heroine and that you see it in the cinema as an experience I waited to see him at home, and a huge screen and worthy headphones arranged for you, and his money is related to a world DC I recommend it to fans of the character, especially in the post-end scene, and what I find can focus on and enjoy"}, {"id": 251, "text": "This was the central theme of the movie, and my word, how I'd wished the people in charge would take this into heart! This was a terrible movie, and an even horrendous follow-up to the sparkling original. It provides even more damning evidence to reinforce the notion that DC has ceded even more ground to Marvel in terms of the expertise in transferring comic book heroes to the big screen.If anything, director Patty Jenkins has been found out. All that hoopla she earned from the first movie has been needlessly squandered with a storyline that is both underwhelming and dragging. The unnecessary revival of the Steve Trevor character, and motivation of a meglomaniac villain adds tedious minutes to an already unexciting plot. And worse of all, that supposedly climatic big end-fight between Wonder Woman and Cheetah, well, its so terribly imagined, you would have thought it was the work of a first year film school student. The closest I could think of was Michael Cimono winning Best Director for The Deer Hunter and then went on to make Heaven's Gate. The only bright spark was the appearance of the former Ms World USA 1972. And that wasn't even part of the movie.

The way she would swing in the air is just so CGI-packed and gives off unprofessionally edited vibes.However, towards the end, the fighting scenes got much better. That's a plus.

Wiig I usually enjoy and I did enjoy her as the more nerdy character she was playing but then her character sort of got lost and they never used her to her full potential and Cheetah felt like she had just jumped off the set of Cats. Bold decision using a Cat based Gillian I thought and don't think it paid off to be honest.The main vilian in the film bugged me as soon as he got on screen whether that was his purpose or not I don't know but his superpower and the way it was used well let's just say a little overkill and I felt that story arc was poorly written and the film started off well but the second part was just long winded and reaching.Overall the film wasn't bad but just a bit long and story could have been a tad better.

If you're a comicbook fan, you've watched the second trailer and you have thought a little bit, you could find out for yourself, how the events will unfold in the exact same way and at the end you'll be right. There was not a single moment that surprised me.The action scenes are good, the colors are also used on spot, but the thing that seemed out of fashion a long time ago and that was in the first movie too, is the excessive use of slow motion. Several times done it's fine, but to be used in almost every action scene...To the pros I would add the musical layout, which reminds us in what time period we are, plus the recognizable Wonder Woman theme.Although things were predictable, I liked the performance of Pedro Pascal as Maxwell Lord and I would say that his arc was the best part of the movie. Kristen Wiig was good as Cheetah, but the gradation, toward her final appearance as a comicbook villain Cheetah, was more interesting, than the final battle. They could improve her as a character. I liked it more, than what they did with Ares fight in the first film.There're are too many cliches and Chris Pine is like transparent character. I mean he's there and he's important for Diana, but other than that, with him or without him there's no big difference. Overall his character was written way better in the first movie. Here he's kind of a emotional reminder for Diana plus the funny guy in the movie.At times the movie feels too long and it really is. They drag some plot points way too much and you can feel that a bit boring.I'll not gonna spoil anything, enjoy the movie when you have the opportunity. Definitely will watch it again, but I think that my overall opinion will not change much. Some things in the 2017 film were done better, other were elevated here, but overall, for me both movies are on same level."}, {"id": 256, "text": "It was good to be back to cinema, but this one was a bit disappointing.The movie starts really strong, and for the first 25/30 mins, I was thinking that this could not only be better than the first one, but even one of the most interesting superhero movies of the last years. Both of the intros (in the past and in 1984) are absolutely perfect, really good pace, fun, smart. The film works really well with the 80s nostalgia and take us back to that time as good as other movie/tv show did recently.Even the second act of the movie works. It's not as good as the first one - the relationship between Diana and Steve works most of the time, but it's also a bit too cheesy sometimes; Maxwell Lord starts working really well, but if falls to a too much cartoonish representation - but it has a good pace, the 80s are still there, we have a very good and fast paced scene in Egypt and Kristen Wiig does a wonderful job as Barbara Minerva.The issue is the third act of WW84. We can find some plot holes here, but the worst part is that the final 30/40 minutes felt like an enormous TED Talk. The movie tries sooo much to preach to the audience, to teach us everything about life, to explain us everything like we are 5 years old children that it turns out to be repetitive, predictable (ok, a problem with 90% of comics adaptations), lame and cheesy as hell. During this part, Pascal seems like an animated villain, Gal is not especially inspiring (probably the final scene with Chris work for some, but for me was a bit...meh) and even Wiig has a weird transformation - although is, by far, the best arc of the movie. This act alone is a 4/10. It would be even less, if the soundtrack was not so epic (a fantastic job by Zimmer) and the panic scenes around the world didn't work so well.I tried to think that during most of the time, the movie was fun (even if never memorable), so I can't say that I hated it, but I can definitely say that I was disappointed.The genre is saturated, I think everybody knows that by now, but the problem is not the superhero movies by themselves. We need more Jokers, more Guardians of Galaxy, more Deadpools, more Dark Knights and more The Boys. What we don't need is over and over again the same movie, with the same structure, the same dialogue, the same threats. It's time to move on."}], "reviews_amount": 257}
