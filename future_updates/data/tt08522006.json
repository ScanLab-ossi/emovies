{"name": "Happiest Season", "titleId": "tt08522006", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "This is a very good movie with a lot of feel good moments. Dan Levy is the man and Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis shine. As a straight man who has never had to hide who I am, I really learned something in this movie and I hope others do too."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Look, I get they took a gay story and put it through the straight trenches, but this movie had the chance to really make a statement by having Abby and Riley be the end game. Was anyone else hoping for that??? Harper wasn't redeemed enough to get her happy ending. Still good, but really missed a huge opportunity for a unique love story."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I loved the concept of this movie. A gay Christmas rom-com, how much better could it get? Answer: a lot. It was great up until Kristen Stewart's girlfriend blatantly lies to her and shows no remorse. I have no issue with the concept of people coming out on their own timelines. I do have an issue of lying to your partner like that. In my opinion, they make a terrible couple. I would much rather see Kristen Stewart with Aubrey Plaza. Great concept, terrible execution."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The movie starts off all joyful and festive, sticking to what was marketed and promised in the trailer, however that all comes to an abrupt end way too soon. This movie left me feeling more annoyed than it did make me feel happy about a journey meant to be about self acceptance and family. Firstly, I'm shocked to see so many people overlooking and justifying Harper's manipulative and ignorant actions towards Abby. There is a fine line between being afraid to be out and mistreating your partner because of it. She doesn't need to be painted as a villain but she should've had better character development rather than shoving it all in the last 10 minutes of the film and call it a happy resolution. Second, what is up with movies/tv shows casually placing outings as the major turning point plus for shock value? Then proceeding to brush it off with a half assed apology from who was responsible, downplaying the seriousness of how wrong it is in the first place. Cliches like that are literally meant for straight audiences. The fact that so many saw Abby and Riley being a potential couple further accentuated the lack of chemistry between Abby and Harper in the long run of the film. The jealousy antics and the overly fake forced heteronormativity that was done to an extent that tormented Abby, only made Harpers character even more dislikable. Yes, this fight/situation alone didn't have to mean they should've parted ways, but given the poor writing choice for putting Abby in the limelight, mostly seeing her perspective makes viewers much more sympathetic for her, making it harder to be so quickly forgiving for everything she had to go through like 3.5/4 of the film. Everyone's coming out story is different perhaps the most important line in the whole movie. This movie had its wholesome moments and I see why people enjoyed it but overall for me it just left a sour aftertaste, made me uncomfortable at times for how stressful and triggering it was, but like it or hate it, the film was poorly executed for the themes they wanted to explore and surely shouldn't be regarded as a romcom."}, {"id": 4, "text": "The moment Harper said she lied about being out to her parents, I would have been out of the situation. I would have ubered home with harper paying. Harper was so disrespectful throughout the entire movie, I really felt for poor Abby. (who was really trying to be a trooper) Dan levy (voice of reason) said things exactly as I felt them aside the ending where he felt she should forgive harper.F that noise!Abby should have gotten with Aubrey plaza. I was rooting for that.Disappointed it didn't go in that direction. Nightmare gf. Nightmare family.Kristen Stewart wasn't as bad as I thought. She looked really beautiful..."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I should start by saying I can't stand dramedies. The idea of spending two hours cringing isn't exactly appealing to me, but if that's your thing this might be the movie for you.The punching bags for this film are Jane and Abby.Jane is portrayed as a person who is seemingly nonneurotypical in some way, and we can tell because her family treats her like a pet that they tolerate. She's smart enough to write a novel and be the family's IT person but she can't be trusted to do a basic task list. If I didn't hate this movie by halfway through the scene where her painting gets destroyed would have done it for me. She deserves so much better as a character.It is easy to blame the criticism of Harper and Abby's relationship on people's ignorance of the nuance of coming out, but you can tell that it's a toxic relationship from the first scene. Why can't Harper respect Abby's feelings about Christmas? Why did she let her partner fall off of a roof rather than help her? If that wasn't enough, you get to see Abby confront her complicated feelings about the holidays and losing her parents right before being told that she was lied to by the partner who is insisting she enjoy Christmas.Harper is easily one of the worst people I've ever seen Kristen Stewart paired with romantically in a movie and I've watched all of the Twilight films.Dan Levy is brilliant in this and so is Aubrey Plaza. Both of them feel out of place in the film because we end up rooting for Abby to leave with them rather than deal with Harper anymore. Their messages about being an LGBTQ+ person trying to navigate love in a complicated world are what the film was supposed to be about. The rest of the movie feels like filler around their onscreen time.If you like dramedies and toxic relationships (of all types) then this may be the film for you. If you were looking for a lighthearted holiday RomCom that features an authentic LGBTQ+ couple then this isn't it."}, {"id": 6, "text": "The main character, Abby, gets treated horribly by her girlfriend and her family and this is never addressed. The film pretends that the problem is Harper not coming out to her family and the troubles this causes for her relationship, but really all the problems come from her being a huge d*** to her patient girlfriend. I suspect the parents are supposed to be laughed at, but for me they were just too mean. Let's say that Abby really was just a friend of Harper's, even so, the way she gets treated is just too rude for me to be entertained by the comedy. It was painful to watch her spend horrible days alone in a foreign place, abandoned by the woman she hopes to marry who is too busy flirting with her ex boyfriend (she's not even flirting with her hot ex girlfriend Aubrey Plaza!). Moreover we learn that Harper did something horrible in high school and that's also not a problem. The ending is ridiculous- as if conservative parents and competitive sibblings can turn around overnight. The writers could have made an effort there. The problem is that i am asked to forgive Harper and the family and be happy that Abby is going to be part of their gang but they have been written unredeemable- so the only way to do this is to take a leap of faith. I can't believe this is supposed to be heart warming and funny. The only good things in this movie are Daniel Levy, Aubrey Plaza and K-Stew but mostly because I feel so sorry for what she's going through and that they didn't give her more things to do as the talented charismatic actress that she is."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Such disappointed by this movie and wanted to love it because of the lack of representation of holiday films that aren't heteronormative schlock...but, the lack of chemistry between Mackenzie Davis's Harper and Kristen Stewart's Abby and the unbelievably dysfunctional family at the center of it was too much. Harper's treatment of Abby had me rooting for the latter to run away with Aubrey Plaza's Riley which would have made this a much better movie. Dan Levy's coming out speech is one of the few bright spots in this film. I'd suggest skipping this one and rewatching the far better City of Trees if you're looking for a way better LGBT holiday movie."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Should of left the rich white lady for Aubrey Plaza. Booooooo \ud83d\udc7b"}, {"id": 9, "text": "I'm one of the biggest fans of Rom-com no matter gay or straight. The story had promise though hardly original. The first few minutes had promise. The last few minutes had a twinge of a happy ending. Everything in between was filled with cliches, horrible unlikable characters doing horrible things with just the worst dialogue I am sad to say. Aubrey Plaza and Dan Levy, bless your hearts for making this movie a little less unbearable."}, {"id": 10, "text": "The Happiest Season this movie is not. Honestly, this movie was just watching someone gaslight their partner into staying with them during a horrible, awful family holiday. I was stressed and shocked almost the entire running time, and the bad acting and writing did not help either.Seriously wouldn't recommend."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I was impressed with this film considering all of the big name actors/actresses in it. The production is strong and beautifully shot. The styling is also great. Kristen Stewart shines in this role. The storyline is heartfelt and entertaining. But also, representation matters &amp; Happiest Season is a movie everyone can relate to, LGBTQ or not."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Fresh. Relevant. Heartfelt. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was so nice to see LGBTQ characters at the center of this story, rather than side characters or fillers. For those who have already come out, and for those who struggle to find a way, we see you. This will be on my holiday must watch list for years to come."}, {"id": 13, "text": "The far too often shallow facade and deceit of meeting traditional and expired conservative expectations played out in a cinematic seasonal pantomime (oh no it isn't; watch it and find out!). Primarily preaching to the converted, it reminds us why individualism is the foundation of us all. Could have been the best Christmas film ever if the father had come out as a cross dresser and the mother as an habitual piercer but you should always leave room for improvement and any improvement in the views of some is always well and truly welcome."}, {"id": 14, "text": "This movie is light hearted, heart warming and literally the cutest gay movie I've ever seen. It's absolutely worth watching with such an amazing cast. The way its directed is charming and clever that it gives joy and comfort. Happiest season definitely reaches up to the mark and proves their title name and the Christmas vibes are so fresh and delightful. Lead actors are nothing but best as we witnessed Dan Lavy before in Schitt's Creek by his ravishing performance, he does not fail to do so again and of course Kristen is a treat to watch. In a nutshell, it's a perfect Holiday rom-com to watch and feel good in these difficult times. Everyone should def watch it!"}, {"id": 15, "text": "Nonstop cringing. Awful script. Awful acting. Just one cliche after another. Not once did I root for this couple. If anything I hoped Abby would leave her for Aubrey Plaza. I booed at the end. Clea Duvall, you're better than this. So much talent wasted in this god awful movie."}, {"id": 16, "text": "I found that movie to be a painful, tragic drama exploring how overly perfectionist parents can completely ruin their children's entire lives well past childhood, and the toxic environment they create destroys all around them while maintaining a saccharin stepford wives midwestern idealism.The movie was much more of an emotional horror that had a completely idiotic and unrealistic happy ending shoehorned in, in which everyone realized the power of love and being a good person and everyone was happy and and accepting there were no more tears ever the end.Really bad. Just... Really bad."}, {"id": 17, "text": "What a pile of drivel this was. You can't spend an hour and a half of a movie with bad acting, with disrespect, lies and deceit and the last 12 minutes, with a few redeeming words and that is supposed to save the movie; and about that the only reason Harper has seen the light was because she was trapped by the situation..Abby showed no self-respect, by turning a deaf ear and taking Harpet back. This movie sends the LGBT cause, back to the closet."}, {"id": 18, "text": "One group loves this movie, the rest of us are still trying to figure out why. OK I did love the nostalgia (for me personally) of seeing the Guthrie Theater in downtown Grove City, PA (one of the more repressive villes I know of, but it is the ancestral home) otherwise there was little to like.As with most people in my group I found Dan Levy and Aubrey Plaza to be excellent. I too felt that Abby and Riley could have found happiness together sharing their common heartbreak.There were so many cliches, so many stereotypes, and how did I miss that Sloane and her husband resolved all their differences in the background while Harper and Abby found eternal bliss in the closing minutes? How did the kids not get into huge trouble for having set Abby up for shop lifting?It was painful, dreadful, slow, and I was really looking forward to a thoughtful and well acted treatment of an important moment. Better luck next year."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Good performances, but a script filled with tired tropes about dysfunctional family holidays which miraculously resolve in the last 5 minutes. Ambitious (at family's expense) father, aggressive you-will-be-nice mother, family members lying to each other all over the place, and no real good reason for the main character to actually be in love with her lying partner.The only refreshing parts are the ones exploring the incredibly painful results when a family rejects a gay child. That needs to be explored more everywhere, and while I know not all families reject their gay children, this family seems well-placed to do so except for the last-minute turnaround into mental health for everyone. The only reason this is two stars instead of one is that the attempt to explore this aspect was ok.My biggest beef: Why on earth does Abby love her partner? Liars rarely confine themselves to one area of their lives, and we never see what makes the relationship important to either of them. We're supposed to simply accept it as a given and be surprised when lies and dysfunction abound.And, MY biggest beef: no real character development. Just character about-face at the last minute. Someone needs to inform the writers that development is a process, not an event."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Last year, we had Last Christmas for the annual holiday season movie, with the charm of Daenerys Targaryen. This year, the charm is doubled, in Happiest Season, with Bella Swan the converted vampire and Grace the latest version of bionic woman (in Terminator: Dark Fate). The stories are quite different but both are reasonably enjoyable holiday fare.In my headline, I made reference to the 1967 movie about a girl bringing a black boyfriend home to meet her parents. Times have changed. The parents in Happiest Season are perfectly happy with a black son-in-law, even when his genes dominated her daughter's in the twin grandchildren. The issue now is coming out.Abby (Kristen Stewart) plans to propose to Harper (Mackenzie Davis, hardly recognizable from her role in Terminator), after spending her meet-the-parents vacation over Christmas. The little twist is that it is only when they are about to arrive at Harper's parent's house that she tells Abby that she had lied about coming out with her parents. Somewhat shocked, Abby resigns to making the best use of the situation to get into the good books of the parents, and have coming out and proposal after Christmas, in that order, quite obviously.There are subplots and support characters in abundance but I have covered all you need to know about plotline. A lot of this movie looks familiar, even clich\u00e9. But it has its little charms here and there, cruising into the mandatory happy ending, offering generous portions of ingredients in tune with the holiday spirit: love, forgiveness, reconciliation, positive vibe and so on.Stewart and Davis have done well, even with some of the awkward scenes they are written into. Mary Steenburgen and Victor Garber are just about the best veterans you can find for the parents. The rest of the large support cast generally delivers what is required to hold this movie together into a feel-warm holiday season flick."}, {"id": 21, "text": "That was quite frankly terrible. Full of horrible characters depicting awful behaviors, and a wholely farssical plot. I'm so disappointed."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Pathetic screenplay, unlikeable characters, and a tremendous waste of talent from a cast that could have been great in the hands of competent writers."}, {"id": 23, "text": "The family in this movie is detestable with zero redeeming qualities. Kristen Stewart, Aubrey Plaza &amp; Dan Levy are the only likeable characters. And that's not enough to make this movie watchable let alone enjoyable."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I don't know why anyone thinks is lighthearted holiday fare. It is one of the most depressing and aggravating holiday films I have ever watched. There is just so much heartbreak and a lack of joy, and not at a lot of holiday fun and romance. I loved the representation for the LGBTQ community, but this movie was not what I hoped it would be. I wasn't looking for a Hallmark or Lifetime cloyingly sweet Christmas movie, but I at least expected some romance in the middle of the movie. What I got was like watching my family if a movie was made about us."}, {"id": 25, "text": "In the beginning of the film i was thinking and predicted that this movie is gonna be bad or just alright, well surprisingly this movie is very good, as the movie progesses this movie become more entertaining, funny, and more intense, Kristen Stewart perfomance is pretty good, Mackenzie Davis performance is amazing, the supporting actor and actress especially Mary Holland and Dan Levy perfomance is amazing, they really funny, i really like both of them, this is a very good holiday movie"}, {"id": 26, "text": "Slow, dim witted, no character development, no believable comedy, no script, no believable gay relationships, JUST A WHOLE LOTTA NO NO NO'S"}, {"id": 27, "text": "I see a lot of reviews here saying they did not expect this movie to be good and I have to agree. I put it on while I was working and barely paid attention. By 15 minutes in I turned it off to watch it later, knowing it was something special that deserved my attention. This might be the first time I have ever seen Kristen Stewart look comfortable in love on screen. Alison Brie &amp; Dan Levy are hilarious as usual and Aubrey Plaza brings a down to earth, calmness to the film, providing Abby with the only true support for most of the movie. Im giving it an 8 because it was slow in some parts but overall this film was delightful. When the credits rolled I tearfully looked over at my boyfriend who was crying as well. He said this is now on our holiday movie list every year!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "How was this movie made? The characters are terrible. I dont believe the story at all.

Thought the plot and acting was amazing. The lgbtq representation was really nice to see in a christmas movie which we never get. Also has some great humor in there as well and a great cast. Overall i loved it!"}, {"id": 31, "text": "I hated this movie. I was so close to shutting it off halfway through and pretending it was all just a nightmare. The characters are shallow, the writing is terrible. There is no reason anyone should be condoning toxic relationships. And that's what this movie does.You can't spend the last 10 minutes in a film just showing happy people and pretending that all the awful things before that didn't happen.The characters all got over the pain they endured way faster than I could get over the pain I endured from this movie. It's been 3 hours since I finished the movie and I'm still upset. So how could Abby just take back Harper after 10 minutes."}, {"id": 32, "text": "The only way this movie got a 5 or higher was on the coat tails of Dan Levy and Kristen Stewart.

Stay away from this one."}, {"id": 34, "text": "This film is a great feel good movie, but it doesn't let its characters off the hook too easily either.

Mary Steenburgen!) 100% recommended."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Daniel Levy was the only redeeming part of this movie and he was barely in it. If you think you know where the stories is going, don't waste your time actually watching."}, {"id": 36, "text": "The acting is absolutely horrible except for Aubry Plaza."}, {"id": 37, "text": "I loved this movie! It captures so well the stress of hiding a part of yourself from your family (and being the partner of someone who isn't out), but also doesn't force the idea that coming out = loving your partner enough. As Daniel Levy's character said Everybody's story is different, if your partner doesn't feel comfortable telling their family yet, don't pressure them, but if you don't feel comfortable being in that situation then it's okay to say that you need to be with someone who is more ready.The actors did a great job, the characters got me very emotionally invested and I felt like I was apart of the story. The storyline is a bit predictable and clich\u00e9 but it was still done well and I loved the happy ending."}, {"id": 38, "text": "This film had potential, it was funny at times and wasn't filled with cringey lines or over done. My problem was with the relationship itself, I didn't even want the two to end up together, at least not right away. Harper was not a likeable character to me whatsoever, after lying time and time again, and pushing away Abby as much as she did. I was not rooting for her in the end, I think Abby put up with too much and I wanted her to stand up for herself walk away. The family also didn't treat her well at all! Very frustrating."}, {"id": 39, "text": "I initially wrote this one off as another contrived Christmas romance movie, and I was also expecting this to be another contrived LGBT romance as well. But I was surprised at the sensitivity that the film sometimes demonstrated. Certainly, it was a bit cliched, but not harmfully so. A wonderfully fun and heartfelt film, to be sure. It's one that we need in this year."}, {"id": 40, "text": "With a cast like Dan Levy, Aubrey Plaza, and Kristen Stewart and a story written by Clea Duvall - I had high hopes. A nice cheesy christmas movie that just so happens to involve lesbians should have been a big win. Many, like myself, were rightfully disappointed to find out it would involve the over done being forced back in the closet clich\u00e9 but gave it a shot anyways. Not worth the benefit of the doubt. It displayed nothing but toxic behavior/relationships, over-the-top dialogue, and nonsensical interactions for the majority of the story. That being said there were still ways the movie could've somewhat redeemed itself but it instead offered a one-dimension happy ending that tried to tie every negative aspect of these people's lives into a pretty bow. The ending lacked depth, ignored highly problematic behavior, and provided a resolution that was both phony and undeserved. Overall disappointing."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Lots of hate in the comments but the movie slapped as far as im concerned. no one wants to lose a family and homophobia makes you scared like that, so i don't know what are ya'll expecting from us who are in similar situations. harper did what she had to do."}, {"id": 42, "text": "A movie that you can really enjoy. Christmas or not. Gay or not.

It's pretty funny and I enjoyed it up until the ending.Harper is portrayed as a generally terrible person for most of the film and a quick speech at the end doesn't redeem her enough to justify Abby staying with her. Kristen Stewart honestly had more chemistry with Aubrey Plaza's character and this film could've taken a bold direction in having those two end up together. This doesn't ruin the film, but just hinders it from becoming a real Christmas classic."}, {"id": 44, "text": "Where to begin. this is one of the best films i have seen all year, though admittedly i am a tad biased because of my undying love of kristen stewart, and the fact that i have been waiting five months for it. regardless, never have i felt so represented by a film before, many aspects of this film encapsulate my story. it's done beautifully - far better than anything i could have possibly imagined. it's a heartfelt, genuinely funny film that was exactly the kind of media that could have changed my life aged 13. i am so unequivocally grateful to Cl\u00e9a DuVall for the creation of this movie. i'm not sure if i'll ever have the words to describe how important this movie is, but i can say that i recommend it to you, and would do so a million times over."}, {"id": 45, "text": "I honestly haven't related to a movie as well as I do to this one. Especially to Harper... my parents are me as the perfect child and I feel if I came out as anything but straight I wouldn't be good.

I should give one for Mary Steenburgen but this movie doesn't deserve the 7 star rating it has, so someone has to sacrifice.Overall this movie has such a good message but it's executed so poorly. For 3/4 of the movie they work off this cringe comedy angle, but the real cringe is the poor writing and utterly disgusting plot. There are a few moments that meet expectations but they are preceded by insane and unrealistic moments.

Aubrey Plaza and Dan Levy were amazing, their characters made the movie more enjoyable. i don't know why, but i thought Kristen Stewart did a really mediocre job, her face literally changed 2 times. they wrote a lot of things in the script just so that the movie would be longer and that was really annoying. i guess the movie is ok if you want some light rom com attempting to have a christmas theme."}, {"id": 56, "text": "Happiest Season has a lot of the hilarious awkwardness of Meet the Parents with the added twist of two closeted girlfriends.

The movie perfectly captures Guess who's coming to Dinner and Meet the Parents vibes while bringing it's own heartwarming and hilarious tale of sister rivalry and competitors mentality. You never felt being lectured, and lesson of self acceptance is perfectly resonate with viewers.Kirsten Stewart was the true shinning star of the movie, her comic timing and awkwardness perfectly shows how one feels meeting the family of significant one on major holiday season. Mackenzie Davis, Alison Brie, Aubrey Plaza, Mary Holland, Victor Garber, Mary Steenburgen and Scene Stealer Dan Levy were all absolute blast.

It's both funny and serious- there's a good balance between the two. There's also a lot of casual queer representation, and it never felt preachy to me (which I guess is what some people are complaining about)? If you're not going to watch for the plot, at least watch for Dan Levy and Aubrey Plaza- they are definitely the best pets of the movie."}, {"id": 60, "text": "Not the holiday movie you need to see. If it weren't for Dan Levy, it wouldn't be worth watching. Just not good writing."}, {"id": 61, "text": "Loved the simple, human concept of telling your parents at Christmas you're a lesbian. I think there were a million fun situations they could have gotten into before they decided to tell them, but her being outted by her sister took away the responsibility of the character coming to her own decision. This does happen and is heartbreaking, but isn't easy to do so in a script that badly needs that moment. The two sisters were kind of throw away c-plots that didn't go much of anywhere... one is getting divorced, one is mad she is getting overlooked/writing a sci-fi book for some reason. The kids that frame Stewart's character just shrug off they stole it and move on without remorse of consequence. The parents go from extreme blamers to totally okay with a new lifestyle rather quickly. While I'm okay with their coming to grips quick due to time constraints of a feel good Christmas movie... the character/plot elements weren't set up enough in advance to make this feel legit. Don't get me wrong... there is plenty to love... Kristen Stewart is always great in indie/low budget work and her character keeps things moving (although it should be both leads that do... maybe that's the real issue). Dan Levy is great, but is on the phone taking care of fish for the first half of the film... we needed him to somehow be along for the entire ride. Aubrey Plaza plays a great role of the ex that takes Stewart out for a good time. These scenes are the real and lively stuff I needed more of.

We can talk all we want about how terrifying it is to come out to your family, and how everyone deserves to do it in their own time, but that's not what this film is about. We don't see the story from Harper's perspective. We see this relationship through the eyes of Abby. As a queer person, it was extremely frustrating and triggering to watch Abby be put through all this, and then having the emotional manipulation swept under the rug at the last second while Harper's parents did a full 180 and turned into understanding people all of a sudden, only so that the screen writer could say that the film had a happy ending.

Kristen being a gay icon gave me life. Aubrey served looks and Dan was great for comedic timing. However Mackenzie Davis, while being a great actress, Harper was not a likeable character. And it has nothing to do with Harper being in the closet. Rather from everything we saw of her, she was a liar and built a relationship based off of several lies. And she really does nothing to redeem herself. Being in the closet does not absolve you of being a bad girlfriend to literally everyone that we were showed that she dated. That being said, I did like the movie and I will be watching it a few more times. I'm very happy that we have it, but we've got to do better with lead characters. Harper made it seem that gay girls should accept whatever from their partner because she's closeted, and that's just not true"}, {"id": 89, "text": "Like others have said, once MacKenzie Davis (Harper) told Kristen Stewart (Abby) that she had not told her parents she was gay I probably should have shut it off. Aubrey Plaza (Riley) and Mary Holland (Jane) were much entertaining characters in the movie. Everyone else and their situations were pretty painfully awkward.

Kirsten Stewart, once one of the highest paid stars in Hollywood, has been reduced to this drivel about her girlfriend coming out to her family over the holidays in a one-dimensional plotline that was fresh 30 years ago, if then. Cartoonish characters, silly plot twists, pratfalls, big misunderstandings, the witty, supportive Gay friend, and, of course, the threat of the BIG SECRET being revealed, which will ruin the family's sterling reputation. Horrors! All set against flat, generic production values that scream Hallmark, with truly awful dialogue, dumb acting, and Stewart sabotaged with one of the worst hairdos in recent memory. The entire project is as cheap as it is jaw-droppingly stupid. If you've been stuck in a cave since the last century and have no idea how LGTBQ characters and plotlines in film have advanced, this is the movie for you."}, {"id": 91, "text": "If you need, in your heart of hearts, to see a queer Christmas movie, this might not be a total waste of your time since it is a queer movie taking place around Christmas time. It's not great...it's not even good, and it's more than a little insulting to think that this is what we might have to look forward to as a community if quality continues to take a back seat (or have to be hitched to a poorly rigged trailer with wooden wheels) to the excitement over representation.The Good - the production value is evident and it looks like people spent money to make what they hoped would be a good movie. Levy, Plaza, and Stewart do what they can and the scenes that include any combination of them and only them are ok. The acting isn't great but I blame the writing and the directing more than the actors so I guess you could say that they did a good job since it's not a complete Transmorphers.The Bad - Everything. The plot is not just cliched but also terribly executed. The writing was so bad that the actors, who are all decent if not outright excellent in other films, are called to do too much to make their scenes and dialogue actually work.In 99% of this movie you are given no real reason to root for Harper and Abby. My wife and I spent most of the time screaming at Abby to leave Harper who is a character with no redeeming qualities. We immediately shipped Abby with Riley but, truthfully, it's for no other reason than the fact that Plaza and Stewart have much better chemistry than do Stewart and Davis. The casual toxicity of their relationship and Harper's continuous lack of respect and consideration for Abby is apparent in the set up.She waits until they are on the way to her parents - effectively holding her hostage and putting her in a situation to make Abby feel like the bad guy if she decides not to follow along. Time and again she does nothing to show Abby that she understands or appreciates that she is forcing her to do something uncomfortable for the sake of terribly ignorant and rude people in her family. Every decision she makes in the movie reinforces her selfishness. She's so bad that you also end up losing respect for Abby, the one you're to sympathize with, because you're frustrated at her obvious lack of self-respect in continuing to put up with it all.The rest of the characters are torturously unrealistic and have no depth because of their mouth-breathingly simplistic use as archetypes who only appear or exist when they must drag you through plots and beat you over the head with themes. I'm Sloane, the bitter older Karen-esque sister. I'm her husband, a pleasant and clean-cut black guy who gave the white conservatives beige prop children. I'm super handsome and popular ex boyfriend who is still into you and has the blessing of the family. The only things you can't predict in this movie are the terrible scenes set up to put Abby's character through cringe.The Ugly - As I noted above, for all the hype about representation, this movie disappoints and disheartens. I can already see that people are cheerily settling for this and geeking out over cast and the implications of the film. The story is bad, the characters are bad, the lessons are bad, and what the industry is likely to take from this is that they can keep serving us up some decent representation and we'll forget that we actually have taste. I'm genuinely frustrated at some of the positive reviews and going as far as offering such hyperbolic praise as this is a movie everyone can relate to.... Garbage. Neither my wife nor I relate to any single scene in this movie and that's saying a lot considering the hectic people in our lives."}, {"id": 92, "text": "I can't be the only person who was sincerely hoping that Abby ended up with Riley, right?

The only reason I'm not rating this more than 8 is because they could have spent 10 extra minutes redeeming Harper a bit more. It doesn't make as much sense for them to just get back together and everything's fine after Harper doesn't even treat Abby like a good friend through out the movie.

Yes, please!I was really hoping for a feel good, happy-go-lucky Christmassy romance flick but I ended up feeling mostly conflicted. Harper and Abby's relationship seemed kind of... off. I was never really sure if I was truly rooting for them. Harper comes off as quite unlikeable 90% of the time and she treats Abby pretty terribly. I mean: you drag your girlfriend of a year into Christmas with the family she's never even met, under false pretenses, forcing her to lie about her identity and pretend to be someone she's not? Yikes... That doesn't seem right. Giant red flag, basically. And that isn't the kind of thing I was really hoping for with this film. I was hoping for humour (there was some, admittedly), some goofy moments, a grand reveal, and a beautiful romantic ending. Genuine and heartfelt emotions. Instead, we get a movie filled with angst and in the end there's a somewhat happy ending, I guess? But I felt like Abby had doubts until the very last moment and that absolutely ruined the romance for me. If you're not sure if you want to be with someone, then I'd say that person is not the one for you. But maybe I'm being too cynical.Like many other people have already said: Abby should've ended up with Riley. They had more chemistry in their few shorts scenes than Abby and Harper in the entire movie. Riley was always friendly and honest towards Abby, unlike Harper. It seemed like they had a real connection, but in the end I guess that didn't matter at all. All Riley's purpose seemed to be was show us and Abby that Harper is actually kind of a terrible person.Ugh. I feel kind of dissatisfied. Can't us lesbians just have a really cute, romantic, stress-free WLW movie for a change?I'm giving this a 7 because the acting in this movie was good and there were some pretty entertaining and funny moments. Kristen Stewart was good in this. Very nice to see her in a role that seemed genuine and heartfelt. Also, Jane and John were amazing characters. Jane's the best. Dan Levy is a delight, as well.

Along the way she tells her that the family doesn't know shes gay or that she's bringing her girlfriend. Funny scenarios as well as heart wrenching ones ensue. The movie is quite refined in the way it explores its subject matter and for that reason, that's what sets it apart. The brilliant Dan Levy of the phenomenal Schitts Creek stars as Stewart's gay bff. Mary Steenburgen (book club), Allison Brie (Glow), Victor Garber and an awesome Aubrey Plaza also star. The film is director confidently by one of my favorite actresses Clea Duvall.

This whole movie was a mess, and it romanticized toxic relationships. I was rooting for Aubrey to get with Harper's ex the entirety of the film, and I was disappointed when she stayed with her manipulative girlfriend. Now I could write an entire essay on everything wrong with this movie. Instead, I'll list several events that triggered my fight or flight response.-Harper waited to tell her girlfriend about her family until it was last minute.-She then follows it up with the statement that she never even came out to her family to begin with. In other words, she had lied to Aubrey before their trip.-Harper's ex's were EVERYWHERE. Poor Aubrey. Harper never once told her ex boyfriend to back off. Rather, she let him get close and touchy all the while knowing that her girlfriend was right there. Yikes. -Whenever Aubrey tried to voice her complaints, Harper would kiss her and tell her not to worry. Not once did she try to have a discussion with her girlfriend.-The children of Harper's sister slipped an item into Aubrey's purse, leading her to get caught. This caused the family to treat her like a black sheep (well, she already was one), and Harper never defended her. She let her family ostrasize her girlfriend. -Harper's jealousy got to be too much. It's okay if SHE hangs out with her ex boyfriend (who is very clearly making moves), but the moment Aubrey hangs out with the ex girlfriend of Harper, it gets to be a problem. Seriously? You treat her like an outsider and get mad when she finds someone to connect with? Grow up.-This follows Harper's jealousy scene. She has the nerve to tell Aubrey that SHE needs space. She gaslit her girlfriend all because she was jealous despite having continuously acting out of line.-This is my last one otherwise I'll write about the entire movie. Everything gets solved with a little speech by Harper. Aubrey is finally ready to leave until Harper talks about how much she loves her girlfriend. And imagine that, everything is solved. Ridiculous.The only enjoyable parts of this movie were the scenes with Aubrey and the ex and the scenes with Aubrey's best friend. The rest of it was just a toxic mess with a sloppy resolution that somehow made up for Harper's manipualtive actions. Everyone is open to their own opinions, but I do not reccomend this movie. Is it too much to ask for a wholesome lesbian movie that does not revolve around coming out? This movie was a joke, shame on the director, and I sincerely hope that this doesn't enforce the stereotype that lesbians are toxic.

Many many times that I tried that it finally got me to a bad situation. I lost all my expectations. I lost the feeling of love. I had best degrees in college but I failed all and came out of college.

It made the ending seem like a fantasy like this is what we all want to happen type ending, but it's kind of the opposite of what I expected. The happiness in the end was forced just to make it a happy ending. I'm not trying to be pessimistic, but more realistic because I don't believe that should've been the ending. I thought Riley (Aubrey Plaza) would've contributed more to the plot, but she was wasted alongside David...I mean John (Dan Levy), who was typecasted.

Its all about ladies, few stupid secrets and several forced scenes that were supposed to be funny.

Schitt's Creek was ground breaking in the LGBTQ+ community. it ignored the trauma homophobia brings. When I saw him in this, i thought oh! this will be good. the lesbian fantasy of my dreams. Not too much conflict, it'll be funny, a romantic comedy right? boy was i wrong. I'm young, im impressionable. im literally in my early teens just barely getting through highschool. i thought this movie was gonna represent us, positively. without the trauma of fearing that our parents wont accept us. (they do, they do in the end and thats great whatever.) but the conflict that this movie had, tore me bit by bit. 1.) Harper is afraid her parents arent gonna love her because shes gay and shes scared things will change. nobody needs to think that, this is fiction. this is literally fiction. its okay to have a movie about just loving. instead of fearing for the fact that our parents might dislike our choice. or our lifestyle. 2.) the parents were overly offensive towards the fact that abby is an orphan. funny or not, i would sob if someone said to someone new shes an orphan nobody really needs to know that. its not the most important thing dude. 3.) the toxic relationships being portrayed in this film jeez oh MAN. none of it was necessary. it literally wasnt. i dont want to sit here, and see that. it gives me the mindset of will, will that happen to me? and i dont want to have that mindset. i want to be happy with my girlfriend without the thought that, oh she might be hiding something, i see it all the time in movies i dont want that. 4.) all of the obstacles that came to harper being forced to come out? what the heck dude, why did that have to be shown? there wasnt a moral to this story. it infuriated me. i literally ran to my bedroom and bawled my eyes out, i just got over a breakup from a healthy relationship. and knowing that, maybe the next relationship i have might not be so healthy, that terrifies me. this movie gave me that thought. and now i miss my ex even more. i just wanted to see 2 lesbians being in love, no conflict, just love. nice hot chocolate dates, going to the mall to get nice gifts for each other, christmas light shows, just love. just normal love. you dont get this stuff with straight people man, you dont. and the fact that we need to have these? its unnecessary. we dont need to have this kind of stuff, we're just people. and the media needs to show that we're no different than the average cishet. we're just people who love people. we're different in our own way. everyone is. but you shouldnt have to represent us and show all of the troubles we face all the time. there are so many movies of us being hurt. i dont wanna get hurt. i dont want my love to fall apart because of what my family thinks or what her family thinks. i dont want that. i just want to be loved. and this movie gave me false hope. and the end was just a normal christmas movie ending, after everything that happened? they just fall back into lesbianism like that? bruh. if that was the case then why did this movie have to have that whole fight scene where the oldest sister tells abby you stay out of this sappho dude i didnt wanna hear that. that literally felt like she was telling me that. why did that have to be in there. but yeah, i hated this movie. it made me cry and not in a good way, i hated how i felt. i feel awful. i had such a bad day and this just made it a whole lot worse. this might make no sense to some of you, but im tired, i cried for 15 minutes, im done. im so done. come back to me when i see a movie revolving around lesbian fairies snuggling on a flower lily."}, {"id": 172, "text": "It's fun, beautiful and different Christmas movie.

Why would writers tell people it's okay to be toxic like that to someone they love as long as they love them. Absolutely disgusting.

IMHO, it's more of a drama with some funny lines and twists, necessary to detonate the actual drama boiling underneath the surface of the holiday season. It is indeed a quite balanced movie complete with believable and also interesting characters, quite a few lovely eccentrics and a plot that does keep you at the edge of your armchair sometimes. The performances range from noteworthy to excellent and the approach to the overused and even abused Christmas movie concept of dysfunctional families coming together is really fresh- not only because the main characters are gay.

There was a better ending to be had, and it was far too long with opportunity for easy cuts (there was truly no reason for those children to frame her for shoplifting).

Oh, and there's a little humor thrown in, and it's mostly forced and banal. When Kristin Stewart shows some cleavage in her butch outfit, it's yuck! She's awkward as heck in this move and so stiff. I enjoyed Aubrey Plaza's performance as usual. She would have been much better in the role Kristen Stewart played, and she was basically wasted here. What a shame.

'Happiest Season' is Hulu's latest loved-up rom-com, but it doesn't exactly stand out above its predecessors. Productions like 'Palm Springs' and 'Love Victor' appear to be a little less cliche than this 1hr 42m lesbian love-story.The story follows Abby (Stewart) and Harper (Davis) as the pair head home to Harper's parents for the holidays, but there's a twist, Harper isn't out to her parents as gay. The two then agree to hide the fact that Abby is Harper's girlfriend by introducing her as Harper's orphaned roommate. As the story progresses, Abby becomes more and more agitated by the fact that Harper won't come clean. After meeting Riley (Plaza), who is revealed to be Harper's first girlfriend, the two begin to bond over their shared relationship troubles. As the film comes to a close, Abby has finally had enough and decides it's time to leave Harper behind and head back home to Pittsburgh. This comes to a head just as Harper is expressing her sexuality to her family, only to be left heartbroken by the one she loves. However, as all holiday movies end, the two finally reconcile and live the happy ever after they were destined to have from the get-go.'Happiest Season''s cinematography and overall appearance is ok. It echoes the modern, contemporary vibe the film gives off. But there's not a huge amount that sets it above every other holiday rom-com, with random cutaways to the house's exterior making viewers feel like they're watching a sitcom, not a feature-length film. DuVall and Holland's script gives off the impression that the two should probably stick to their respective fields, especially when it comes to writing comedy. Viewers will also pick up on the fact that John (Levy) seems to be the only source of comedic relief throughout the entire movie, and when you're making a rom-com the majority of the comedy shouldn't be coming from a supporting character. Despite the flaws, the upbeat, bubbly soundtrack throughout makes you tap your feet without realising you're doing it!The cast is well-rounded, likeable and they all seem to work well together on screen. Viewers will enjoy watching Davis and Stewart on screen together, and it's heart-warming to see their bond flourish over the 102m. If you're watching 'Happiest Season' this holiday, don't expect to be blown away, because even though it's got a unique and promising premise, what DuVall gives viewers isn't exactly expectation-shattering. However, Plaza's performance as Riley is enjoyable to watch on screen. As a viewer, you'll pick up on the fact Riley and Abby have more chemistry than Harper and Abby, so if you're subconsciously rooting for the pair don't worry, you're not the only one!'Happiest Season' is a film that is not produced to deal with one specific theme - more to convey a message. That message is, of course, that you should always be true to yourself and be honest with those around you and if you're not it can result in you losing the ones you hold closest to your heart.In conclusion, Clea DuVall's 'Happiest Season' is Hulu's attempt at providing viewers with a fresh twist on the classic holiday rom-com, and for the most part, they do. So, if you're a fan of Kristen Stewart, Aubrey Plaza, Mackenzie Davis and Dan Levy then you should be adding 'Happiest Season' to your holiday watchlist but if you prefer something a little less hallmark movie then you might want to keep scrolling."}, {"id": 237, "text": "The Happiest Season 2020 12A Director: Clea Duvall Starring: Kristen Stewart, Mackenzie Davis, Aubrey Plaza, Dan Levy, Mary Steenburgen, Victor Garber, Alison Brie, Mary Holland, Burl Moseley, Sarayu Blue etcOverall rating 54/100The happiest season is about Harper (Mackenzie Davis) who invites her girlfriend Abby (Kristen Stewart) home for Christmas to meet her family, except she hasn't told them that she is in a relationship with her or that she is gay, as Abby begins to question her relationship with Harper, she must make a decision on whether being with Harper is the best decision or not. I wanted to Like the happiest season so much more than what I did and it definitely had its moments but for me was a big let down and fell apart as the movie went on.My first few positives would be representation, cinematography, chemistry between characters and comedic performances. It was refreshing to have so much LGBTQ representation for this kind of holiday movie and for me showed that a movie showing relationships like this should be as popular and regularly made as the traditional holiday movies. I also thought the movies cinematography was fantastic, the movies visuals just made me feel warm inside, It was truly visually stunning and every set location and attention to detail was excellent. I also thought the chemistry between most of the characters was absolutely fantastic. Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart had excellent on screen chemistry, their relationship was believable and felt authentic, but the chemistry between Kristen Stewart, Dan Levy and Aubrey Plaza was fantastic, they all bounced off each other so well and were so infectious and fun to watch in every scene that they were in together. The comedic performances were also fantastic, once again Kristen Stewart, Dan levy especially and Aubrey Plaza were just fantastic, Some of the comedic dialogue especially for Dan Levy was so excellent it was brilliant, his comedic timing with Kristen Stewart in her awkward and very animated facial expressions was just fantastic.My next few positives would be the humour, likeable characters and its charming tone. I thought the movie for the most part was hilarious, the slapstick humour was great, some of the dialogue and social commentary on a lot of things was hilarious and the comedic delivery from the cast involved was excellent. The movie also had a lovely charming tone throughout. As a lot of the relationships developed and with the involvement of the holidays the movie did manage to achieve a lovely warmth to it that stayed. There was a lot of very likeable character throughout, they kept the movie watchable as you just couldn't help but just love them.Now time for some negatives. Some of the humour got very stale, there was some very unlikeable characters with odd decisions made, and there was a lack of depth to the conflict. For me not all of the humour connected well enough, at first they were funny but the movie overdid it with some of the jokes and they got really old and not funny very quickly, I thought that there was some very unlikeable characters in this movie. The parents were just horrible human beings and weren't really that likeable throughout, but my biggest issue was with the character of Harper played by Machenzie Davis. She was incredibly unlikeable and absolutely horrible to Kristen Stewarts character, she made so many terrible decision I just didn't want them to be together despite the complicated issues, and how poorly she had treated past people in her life as well, the movie just didn't do a good job at making us sympathise of connect with her as a character. And I just thought the plot decision of Harper inviting her girlfriend home for Christmas without telling her family she was gay just didn't really make sense and put her in a deliberately tricky situation, I just thought it was a slightly lazy set up for the conflict. Adding onto my previous comment there was just really in general a lack of depth to the conflict, the film just played it really safe in terms of its conflict, there was nothing that ever really felt serious therefore effecting the sakes, a movie with LGBTQ themes needs to have depth and conflict and this movie just didn't, there was no signs of the parents being homophobic, and the explanation we got about them being a perfect family for me wasn't good enough.My final few positives would be the good use of characters to create conflict, the uplifting script for LGBTQ themes and the partly heartwarming ending with good character arcs. I thought the movie incorporated characters to create conflict well, the characters played by Aubrey Plaza and the use of ex partners was really well done, you got to learn more about the main characters as well as connect with new characters, and off course they created good conflict because of the connections to the Harper so this was well done. I also thought some of the script was uplifting with its LGBTQ messages, Dan Levy's character in particular had a really heartfelt scene exploring different peoples experiences with coming out and it was a really heartfelt scene and the script was at its best here, its shame it wasn't consistent throughout the whole movie, but I still applaud them for moments of greatness. I also found parts of the final act heartwarming and with some good character arcs, the characters of the parents accepting all their children and them all being a happy family was admittedly heartfelt and at least gave Harper a good character arc with her relationships.My final few negatives however would be the movie poorly handling its LGBTQ themes and its messy final act. I thought largely the movie poorly handled its LQBTQ themes, having characters forcing others to come out really didn't sit well with me, and just how clueless the characters were, the movie played it safe and made the main message for the movie get lost in all the drama and comedy. I also found the final act an absolute mess, I thought having Harper's sister having to out her instead of telling her parents herself was just terrible, And it really made me not want the two main characters to get together, Aubrey Plaza and Kristen Stewart had a lot more chemistry as the movie went on.Overall, despite fantastic comedic performances from Aubrey Plaza, Kristen Stewart and Dan Levy, and moments of charm and greatness, the Happiest season falls flat, due to its extremely unlikeable characters, poor narrative decisions and playing it safe and poorly handling its LGBTQ themes making the message of the film not feel earned."}, {"id": 238, "text": "The only thing that made the movie watchable is Levy's outstanding performance in the few scenes he appeared in.

But it's an okay movie. But I was really rooting for Abby and Riley. 6/10"}, {"id": 241, "text": "It is no Richard Curtis film, but it is fun and entertaining nonetheless. The plot here - the trip home to meet the family where things go wrong/haywire - is quite a common plot in this genre of film, i.e., the Christmas romantic comedy. The writers (DuVall and Holland) also draw on a popular plot device: i.e., deception - the fake relationship intended to deceive family and friends (this year, Holidate and Midnight at the Magnolia, come to mind). The twist in this film, of course, is that it is a same-sex female relationship, where they pretend to be roommates as opposed to a couple. Overall, I thought this worked well. There is a lot of good and funny dialogue in this movie; I found myself laughing quite a bit, at times. At the heart of the humour for me was Sloane and Jane (the two sisters), and Tipper (the mother). The writers did a good job of developing the lines and dialogue here. That said, I thought the biggest shortcoming of the movie was that the writers did not spend enough time developing the relationship between Abby and Harper (the leads) before the trip home, before the deception began. In essence, we get one scene before they are off to visit the family for Christmas. The writers could have spent more time setting up why these two, Abby (played by Kristen Stewart) and Harper (played by Mackenzie Davis), are together, in love as it were. The chemistry between the two is never really established. Because the film spends much of the time playing out the deception, I found myself asking (towards the middle to end of the film): why are these two together? Of course, at the very end, the writers try to sort this out with a heartfelt reveal, coming out, by Harper. But by then, I felt it was too late, I already had a 'bad taste in my mouth'. The acting was impressive overall. The leads both had great performances. I especially enjoyed Mary Steenburgen's portrayal of Tipper (she was very funny!). Alison Brie (as Sloane) and Mary Holland (as Jane) were great too (hilarious in some scenes, I thought). You are in for a treat with these performances. Leaving the shortcoming aside, this is a fun (and at times, emotional) Christmas romcom. I really enjoyed it, thus I highly recommend it."}, {"id": 242, "text": "I really liked this movie.

Kristen Stewart's is ok for the most part and I did like her but Mackenzie Davis' character is quite bad. That is nothing to do with the acting because I think everyone was pretty great it is purely a script issue.The character of Harper is really unlikable. The movie really leaves her out to dry. It is like the writers hated her and because of that she becomes really unlikable for most of the movie. I really think they should have reworked her so she was even slightly more redeemable.That was really my only complaint. I think this movie is charming and cute.

Definitely watch it and support this film existing."}, {"id": 243, "text": "* (Rating 9.5/10) * * There are images during the end credit *The director Clea DuVall and crew brought a heartfelt film and a much needed beautifully full-on representation. I would love to thank Clea DuVall for accurately pointing out the emotional complexities of coming out. This film deeply projects the obstacles one faces of coming out to the family and how one can't be truly happy if their true self is hidden. The understanding and the patience of being with someone who is not fully out was tested, love keeps one together but there is always a limit. The perspective of showing two sides of a person was heartbreaking, how devastating to watch how she treated her love for the sake of keeping up appearances due to her family's reputation, and by hiding, she didn't notice the hurt she was causing. Even though it was painful to watch it was understandable because it isn't easy to say it to the family. This was a meaningful film that gave different points of view for one to know that there is hope and that hope is projected through the relationship between Abby and Harper.I loved this line Everybody's story is different, a few simple words that defined the difficulties of coming out. During that scene, tears began to flow because it explains in detail how terrifying it was when those words come out while not knowing what would be one's family reaction. Acceptance is a powerful word in which many seek, and not every family knows the meaning of loving a child for who they are. It is easy to be out surrounded by strangers but not easy with family, never knowing if it's the last day one can call them family. All those feelings were profoundly placed in that scene and it made me cry so hard.It was very well done to make her family defined by perfection to project as many situations as possible. They wanted to seem perfect but like any other family, they were all struggling to be proud of or to gain love. Everything would be simple if one learns to not let society control one's life and not letting them decide who you are. This storyline tackles every awkwardness, stress, and the terrible pain that causes when one decides to live in a lie.When the high point of the movie came, it was so excruciating, I have cried in many movies but this kind of cry was different. I felt like my heart was intensely crumbling down even as I write this my tears are remembering and I'm so thankful for this movie for letting me cry in this kind of way. I love how this storyline doesn't give a simple solution and doesn't even set any cheesy moment by doing so. The struggle of reaching the limit was perfectly structured by establishing how a secret and denial are two different things in which can have a hurtful consequence.The composer Amie Doherty set beautifully a holiday romantic cheery atmosphere. I love the theme music of Abby and Harper it was so cute and it defines the love they have for each other. The new Christmas song of Tegan and Sara (Make You Mine This Season) is perfect for them and the song was added at the right scene.The entire cast was perfectly chosen and performed magnificently. The main actors Kristen Stewart as Abby and Mackenzie Davis as Harper, undeniable chemistry and their performance brought up a beautifully much-needed relationship to be told. Abby, the one out, and Harper not fully out delivered the meaning of how life brings barriers toward true happiness and the only thing keeping one from being happy is not friends nor family is oneself. I love how they looked at each other, how attentive and cautious they were to not lose themselves over the secret even though it was inevitable. The way both of them cry was more than acting, it felt so true and natural. Abby's story of the loss she had added more feeling of having a family.Victor Garber and Mary Steenburgen as the parents projected the bubble of perfection which blinded them from not really seeing nor feeling the truth about their family. Alison Brie as one of Harper's sisters, I like how competitive their relationship was because most of the time sisters fight or argue and they brought those moments fantastically and with humor. Mary Holland another of Harper's sisters and also co-wrote this screenplay, portrays the invisible sister. My heart goes to her, when there is more than one child and depending on their goals or capacities sometimes there is one that feels left out. She portrayed her so lovingly and when it was time for her to feel noticed my heart sank. Aubrey Plaza is another great representation of Harper's ex-girlfriend. She portrays the feeling of rejection and loved the way she talked to Abby, she really shined in every scene. Dan Levy the best friend of Abby was wonderful and his scenes of tracking and the fish were hilarious. I loved how attentive he was with Abby and how he explained to her about understanding the situation of others.Dear Clea DuVall once again thank you for creating and sharing this film, this representation was a breathtaking masterpiece. There is no other film that could even compare to, there were so many brilliant small details, also it was fresh, and bold in every way.

That's IT!Also, I felt that the two female gay leads were portrayed as excessively girlish and asexual. Their depiction was way too cutesy and sophomoric to be credible, and IMO it was actually offensive.It's as if the film makers felt they had to neuter this lesbian couple to not offend mainstream viewers.Well, that offended me!And again, this movie was just SO terrible in all the aforementioned ways.No matter what your sexual orientation may be, this film deserves a HARD PASS.Maybe next Christmas will serve up some better LGBT offerings.That's MY 2021 Christmas wish!"}, {"id": 246, "text": "In a burst of Christmas spirit, Harper invites her girlfriend Abby to come home with her for Christmas.

Fair enough.But the trouble is, I expect better from Allison Brie, of Mad Men and Community. She's a really good actress, but here her character is just one-dimensional, unlikable, and utterly unrealistic. And that's not her fault. If an actor I know to be talented doesn't shine at all, it's the fault of the material. And this material is schlocky.I appreciate the effort to make a mainstream, Hallmark-ish Christmas movie involving gay characters and complicated families. I suppose in that sense, it succeeds. Happy ending, yay. But it seems unearned, especially given how badly some of the characters behave during the course of the film. I was kind of rooting for a bittersweet ending instead of the usual happy one. Girls, maybe you are just not ready to be together?Dan Levy is a delight, as is the actor/character of the youngest sister. And by the way? Stop treating youngest sisters like dirt, Hollywood.

This dumb and pointless exercise of yuletide fun is absolutely dreadful. It's pure sitcom nonsense about a lesbian couple, Abby (Kristen Stewart) and Harper (Mackenzie Davis), visiting the folks one holiday season. Only the folks are unaware that their daughter is gay. As Abby so astutely says on their drive to their place, It's only 5 days. What can go wrong? Doh...Understatement! Complications will indeed ensue.This is the kinda of rom-com holiday movie one can regularly see on the Hallmark Channel with conventional good-looking straight couples falling in and out and back into love with enough glitzy Christmas decorations to choke a horse with or without its sleigh. The only real difference in this escapism is that two women actually kiss and show affection. Oh, how shocking and (yet relatively tame) for 21st century moviegoers! (The movie might have been ground-breaking in the 80's. Nowadays, it's commonplace, safe, and dull...fortunately.)Clea DuVall directed the movie with no real style. She can barely muster one laugh from her cast as she resorts to jolly Christmas music and silly slapstick humor to disguise this screenplay's inane plotting. The director is also responsible for the inept story-writing. She co-writes the movie with Mary Holland, who has a supporting role as Harper's youngest sister, Jane. Ms. Holland does capture the annoying qualities of her character and then some. (I might urge her quit acting and to stick to her writing skills, but her story is so contrived and unfunny that this advice would be detrimental for anyone, including Ms. Holland.)The film's only redeeming graces in this overcooked Christmas goose are Ms. Stewart who is always a delight and Dan Levy as her gay sidekick. He essentially plays the same lovable if less flamboyant character as he did in Schitt's Creek, but, at least, he does have a nice comic delivery and screen persona. Seriously wasted in their lightweight roles in this alleged comedy are actors who have done much better work: the aforementioned Ms.Davis, Victor Garber, Mary Steenburgen, Ana Gasteyer, and Audrey Plaza. Let us hope their paycheck bought lots of Christmas presents for friends and loved ones.More accurately, Happiest Season is the dumbest of movies. The message may be positive and uplifting, but the whole venture is banal and as artificial as that store-bought evergreen on display. All this film really shows is that gay people, despite their best intentions, can make just as bad holiday movies like heterosexuals with that same purpose in mind. Despite all of its pretty wrapping, it's coal. (GRADE: C-)"}, {"id": 251, "text": "Romantic Christmas movies are usually something to avoid, mass-produced with same formula (cheesy dialogs, flat characters and a direction without any personality) just to make money in theaters. You could argue, watching the trailer or the poster, that this is the exact same thing but gay, but it's not. This is such an enjoyable movie and not because is corny or predictable or cononical at the contrary, this is a remarkably written christmas movie, and there are not a lot of these, that use a simple but effective formula, yes even unoriginal, to talk about serious, important themes such as coming out, being gay and have to live with a determinate type of family, being ashamed of yourself and many more; and it does that without being rhetorical, heavy or detached but with empathy, honesty and sense of humor. It's the perfect example of a movie you can enjoy every year without getting tired of it, like a Christmas movies should be, and sill talk about important stuff and doing it right. Being gay I felt a lot, this was a true emotional experience, I laugh a lot, I was anxious practically the whole time, I got angry and frustrated and I was also touched. And I usually don't feel this way with this type of movie and, again, it's not because it's a gay movie but because it's a well-made one, with heart and personality."}, {"id": 252, "text": "Remember when stars had what they used to call 'the X factor? They may or may not have been good/great actors, but they had a certain glamour or charisma or unique personality that made them watchable, even in sub-standard fare. A real star could dazzle you into overlooking a weak plot or a lacklustre script or even that their character might be, on paper at least, unsympathetic or unlikable. With a Bette Davis or a Goldie Hawn or a Barbra Streisand in the lead the most far-fetched story or the most ho-hum script could still produce a good time. But in Happiest Season the two leading players are Kristin Stewart and Mackenzie Davis - two stars entirely lacking in glamour, charisma, or even much in the way of personality. Neither are bad actors, though it must be said that neither has any discernible gift for comedy. In fact, there are bit players with only one or two lines in Happiest Season who have better comic chops than either Stewart or Davis. It doesn't really help that the movie is otherwise cast with actors who have an abundance of charisma and comic ability - among them the delightful Mary Steenburgen, the under-rated Alison Brie, and the adorable Dan Levy, who totally steals the movie. Ultimately, what we're left with is a somewhat thin, but essentially workable rom-com scenario that might have been elevated into something enjoyable, had it been blessed with two stars capable of distracting us from the script's major flaws - namely that Harper (played by Davis) is essentially unlikeable, Abby (played by Stewart) puts up with way too much before she heads for the door, and that at no point is there any indication that Harper's mildly uptight parents are too conservative, too religious, too parochial, too... anything... to not cope with having a lesbian daughter.

Their friendship (more than the film's core lesbian love story) is what stands out as a truly memorable story arc. The thing about the Caldwell household is that nearly everyone's got something to hide, and that makes it a little easier for writer-director Clea DuVall to collectively provide closure to their issues.Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart share decent chemistry as a queer couple. But I've gotta say those few scenes that featured Aubrey Plaza and Stewart make you feel like they had some totally untapped chemistry. That's for another film to tackle, I guess. Happiest Season is tonally all over the place, oscillating between wacky comedy and genuinely emotional moments.

Aside from Hallmark making an endless amount of them on a yearly basis, mainstream Christmas films are very few and far between. Happiest Season was likely a film that would've made it to theatres in time for Christmas this year, but due to obvious reasons, it's now available to stream at home. I had very little expectations when going into this film, but you can colour me absolutely surprised. I loved watching this film and here's why I believe it deserves a watch.On the opposite side of things, over the last ten years or so, audiences have absolutely been treated to many films based around inclusion in terms of sexual orientation. For that reason, much like how there are many mediocre stories in every genre, I love talking about the ones that stand out. Happiest Season absolutely fits the bill in that regard. Following Harper (Mackenzie Davis) as she brings her girlfriend Abby (Kristen Setwart) home to meet her family for the holidays, many revelations about her family having no idea about her love life quickly come to fruition. From wishing to hide the truth from them to many other family issues happening around her, it all makes for a funny, charming, and heartwarming film to watch during the holiday season.This film is very well-rounded in terms of its casting. From the always great Alison Brie to the underrated Victor Garber, Happiest Season is loaded with talent. The cast around the central characters are all great here, but this is really the Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart show. Whether you're talking about her appearances in massive blockbusters like Blade Runner 2049 or more intimate films like Tully, it's very hard to dislike her performances in anything. Along with her delivering another wonderful performance here, I think this may just be the best performance Kristen Stewart has ever given. This duo together illuminated the screen for me. I normally don't find myself praising Kristen Stewart as the highlight of a film, but she surprised me here.Sure, what I will say is that there are many plot points that you have seen many times, but I feel like that argument is sort of becoming invalid when talking about most movies nowadays because so many of them are being made and will eventually have similarities to others. It really comes down to standing out among the rest and this film absolutely does. I knew where this film would end up, but between the very solid direction by Clea DuVall and her writing the screenplay with much care alongside Mary Holland, nothing about it felt too familiar. You can always feel when a fresh take on a tired story is being explored and I thought that made this movie feel very fresh.Overall, Happiest Season pulls you in with a lot of likeable characters and brings you on a journey that will have some viewers laughing, others crying, and many just sitting there with a smile on their face. The message of this film is all about accepting people for who they are, and even though I said that is beaten to death throughout the majority of films that have done it in the past, there's just a spark here that works. Happiest Season is now available to stream on some platforms as well as being available to rent/buy digitally. I highly recommend checking this one out."}, {"id": 264, "text": "Kristen (from the terrible Charlie's Angels movie that was SO bad it was enjoyable) plus a Holiday movie? Why not....

I'll probably will be seeing more movies with her in it. Her delivery is good, lines and emotions.. She has gotten better over the years. As for Mackenzie Davis, she looks baaaaad. It's her hair.. it's not doing her any favors. It actually might be a character choice.. since she is so dislikable. Visually, it makes it easier I guess. Mary Steenburgen always an elegant lady.

Particularly, when the infatuation ends in a relationship, and a serious inventory of is it worth it? is writ large before you. Making this kind of situation a comedy--in addition, loading the matter of coming out to your family on top of an already heavy subject matter--is tricky. Happily, for us, it succeeds for the most part.Abandoning the familiar mantra all gay people are scolded with we're here, we're queer, get used to it, we're offered a much more realistic situation where proclaiming alternative sexualities isn't as simple--or welcome--in every family. For that alone, kudos.Assembling a crackerjack cast, Clea DuVail tells her own story and just how fraught being yourself can be. A competitive sibling, a family's definition of perfect that quashes any deviance, and a political campaign in a small town leaves the principal character with literally no choice (she thinks) than to hide her partner's real identity, giving her that neutering label: She's my roommate. And the family's unconscious threat also adds, ...she's an orphan. The latter is played with hilarity by Kristen Stewart who assumes the role because, well, she IS an orphan. Stewart keeps adding more and more success to her achievement as an actor. She grounds the film but she also earns more sympathy than the writing perhaps intended. Her partner whose family they've entered really alienates the audience with her partner's behavior. We just don't like her or find her worthy of Stewart's character's devotion. And it makes the film wobble from comedy to some serious thought--at least from the audience--this ISN'T worth it. Even in the early scenes of bliss before they enter the ambush of the family, I thought Mackenzie Davis felt uncomfortable in the role. She was just trying too hard.The rest of the cast shines with substantial support from Dan Levy, Mary Steenburgen and Alison Brie, who really deserves her own film. She can frost a room with the arch of an eyebrow. Too, Aubrey Plaza brings an undercurrent that makes us wish Stewart's character would just pick her, and they could run off and live happily ever after.This is a big, glossy, important holiday release, hoping to garner a place in the pantheon of Christmas classics.

No Home for the Holidays or The Family Stone, and no Imagine Me and You.Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis start out likable and cute, and you root for them, then things take a bad turn, but things wrap up nicely for them in the end, and you root for them again. The real hit of the film was Jane, the quirky sister, and, again, the cuteness of Stewart and Davis as a couple. Dan Levy had some funny moments but his character dialogue was really annoying in some spots, and funny in others. The LGBT community didn't fight for the right to marry so just a few years later some character can drone on about it being a patriarchal institution. Frankly, it was kind of disrespectful and out of touch.For Clea Duvall's second film? It was decent. She's early in her directing career so I'm not going to be super critical. I'm glad it was made. I wish it had been better. It had the elements, just needed to be tightened. The middle was just a lot of stuff happening and not much storyline cohesion. It felt more like watching home videos of someone's life rather than a tidy story. I think the co-writer wrote, The Spy Who Dumped Me, and that film was similar - kind of funny, but just a bunch of stuff happening rather than a nicely paced story.I'll probably watch it again and just fast forward to the scenes I like. Cute but not quite the fun holiday classic I was hoping for."}, {"id": 267, "text": "A delightful holiday romcom.Happiest Season is a nice LGBT twist on the romcom format. Though the cast is chock-full of A-listers, the film felt a bit too surface level. But it's a romcom, what do you expect?The plot is upfront right away. It's an LGBT movie about... well, I won't spoil. But it's an uncomfortable topic for many. The audience has no doubt about the plot upfront. All while having a few laughs between.Abby (Kristen Stewart) does an amazing role starring in this film as she plays a believable lover in conflict. We emphasize the struggle that she faces throughout the movie.The movie moves fast from an idea to Harper's (Mackenzie Davis) house and conservative family. Though the family is a plot device to introduce conflict, they felt a bit too contrived and artificial. Comic relief is too obvious and forced in some places. Though no fault of the actors, more could have been done to the script.Every character has their own hidden secrets and conflicts. For better or worse, they must face these consequences later. This aspect of the film was appreciated as it gave more character development for everyone.Yet, by the third act, the hidden secrets seem to have little to no consequences for everyone. The third act felt rushed and contrived.Thankfully, the cast of A-listers carried this movie. Everyone who watched this movie will stan Aubrey Plaza. She did an amazing job, but Dan Levy, Allison Brie, Victor Garber, among others deserve their own praise. All had stellar performances and did the best that they could with the script.It's a good watch with some genuine moments and highlights. Even with all the positives, I can't bring myself to feel at ease with the ending. If you went through all the struggles that the protagonist suffers in this movie, how would you feel? Sure characters are happy in the short term, there are some real underlying relationship issues that aren't answered. This is true within Abby/Harper's relationship as well as the larger family.3/5. You want an LGBT friendly holiday romcom film, this is it. It's a good idea with sloppy execution. The entire package leaves more to be desired."}, {"id": 268, "text": "Happiest Season has a lot of good moments and works for the most part though sometimes it appears to be a little bit corny and confused whether to be a comedy or romance. The coming out story in a Christmas setting was refreshing, a welcome change from the Love Actually wannabes we get every year never mind how problematic the film itself is.Kristen Stewart effortlessly plays the role of Abby, the matured and brave lover of Harper (Mackenzie Davies) a promises to come out to her parents after the Christmas holidays. Harper takes Abby to her conservative parents' for Christmas and we began to see the unfolding of typical high end family who hide behind masks. Aside from the lead actresses, no one has any significant screen time or part to play. Alison Brie and Aubrey Plaza could have had better roles.Ideal to release it in OTT these times, as its the best for it to get a wider reach in these tough times. Happiest Season clearly shows the path for Christmas movies in future. The best way to save this dying genre is to put some social commentary into it."}, {"id": 269, "text": "Happiest Season is a Christmas comedy filled with heartwarming and funny moments. Where this film shines the most, is being very pleasant. It's fun when it wants to, it's wholesome most of the time, and above all else, it's festive and wonderfully Christmasy.This is exactly the type of film I have come to love this holiday season. A year ago I would've never even watched a film like Happiest Season, let alone enjoyed it. But now, instead of scoffing at another pointless Christmas romcom, I look forward to letting myself forget about the world for a moment while I fall into a what is hopefully a warm and pleasant couple of hours. And for the most part, Happiest Season is exactly that. I laughed often, and generally speaking, I had a really great and joyous time with it. It certainly is exactly as cheesy and predictable as I expected, but then again, that's what it's supposed to be like. How could a movie like this, ever be as enjoyable if I didn't at all times know what is going to happen? Or how could it ever feel so wonderfully Christmasy if it wasn't painfully cheesy? These kinds of films thrive when they feel familiar, and when they give a warm and fuzzy feeling.The story follows Abby and Harper, who have been in a relationship for some time. While Abby is openly gay, Harper still hasn't told her parents, and once she invites Abby over for Christmas, things get complicated. Old acquaintances and love interest appear, complicating things further. Harper ultimately has to decide whether to lose Abby or whether to come out to her family. It's a simple story and if you have ever seen another movie like Happiest Season it's not hard to figure out how it's going to end. The story, while simple, didn't bother me. However, what I found quite unenjoyable, were the characters. In a film that is so intensely character-driven, as Happiest Season is, the characters must be likeable. Unfortunately, they aren't. At least most of them. Abby is great, and for the most part, I ended up feeling sorry for her. She is stuck in a painfully one-sided relationship, and all I wanted for her was to be happy. Jane, one of Harper's sisters, is also fantastic. I really liked her a lot and ended up feeling sorry for her as well. While she is one of the three sisters, the parents never appreciate her for who she is. The whole rest of Harper's family, herself included, were quite infuriating. Although I have nothing against unlikeable characters as long as they are done well, I really would prefer movies like Happiest Season to keep them to a minimum. All I want to do while watching these films is laugh and have fun, feel warm, and maybe even cry a few times. The last thing I want to do is feel frustrated by the characters.While this film is genuinely enjoyable for the most part, had the characters been likeable as well, I'm sure I would've enjoyed it a whole lot more. Happiest Season and others like it rely on being easy to like. There certainly needs to be an unlikeable character so that the main protagonist can triumph over them at the end. But when most of the characters are that way, the film becomes harder and harder to like. Thankfully Happiest Season is otherwise a near-perfect example of how to make a Christmas romcom. In addition to everything else, it also captured incredibly well the awkwardness of having to meet new people through someone close to them, which lead to some very relatable and funny moments that ended up making this film as enjoyable as it is.Although I wasn't the biggest fan of the characters, ultimately this film is exactly what I wanted it to be. It was funny, it was tremendously heartwarming, and it put me right in a cosy Christmas mood. The ending, while easily predictable and cheesy, made me smile and feel happy. And as far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what Happiest Season needed to do."}, {"id": 270, "text": "Like a lot of these reviews, I really wanted to like this movie. Highly promising cast, the story was a familiar trope but with a twist of what I thought would be a truly cute and funny gay couple. Unfortunately this movie never really decided what it wanted to be, moving from cute and silly and then jumping right to drama and seriousness. You never really get to appreciate the main couple before you get hit with the we have to pretend we're straight plot device. That could've laid a path for either a really funny fish out of water/hope they don't get caught comedy or a real deep dive into the reality of same sex relationships and how they effect each other and their families. As it's said everyone's story is different and it feels like a missed opportunity for either really funny family Christmas movie or a tear jerking drama that leaves you sobbing. The bright spots in this include Aubrey Plaza who's delightful and remarkably reserved, you find yourself wanting her to get the girl vs. Harper who never really earns her redemption. Kristen Stewart really shines in this, I was really impressed with her nuance and comedic timing. Speaking of comedic, Dan Levy, to the surprise of literally no one is fantastically funny and steals every second of scene he's in. All in all this is a near miss"}, {"id": 271, "text": "Gingerbread cookie-cutter, I put 100 hours into that painting, and you just destroyed it like it was nothing paint-by-numbers rom-com. Set during Christmas for extra schmaltz. As for the romance and several of the characters being gay, I suppose it's progress that all sexual orientations make equally trite rom-coms. Maybe if it came out a decade or so ago it would've seemed at least daring, but Happiest Season seems to occupy a safe space now. I'm not sure if it's ever even made clear where they travel to for Christmas or whether the father is a Republican. And is it still a tired trope to have a gay friend invested to a disturbing degree in the central romance when that romance is no longer a straight one? That editing back and forth between the inevitable make-up kissing and love declaring and Dan Levy cheering from the sidelines was sickening--just keep the camera on the couple. There is one reason the lesbian coupling works better in this case, though, because they play it straight in front of the family. They're actors playing actors. Most of the humor revolves around this mistaken-identity comedy of errors.It's for that reflexivity that I watched it. Plus, I like the cast--some familiar faces from TV shows and other movies I've seen, and they're all pleasant enough here for the most part. Unfortunately, nothing beyond the obvious family Christmas connection is made of the film-within-the-film, It's a Wonderful Life (1946), that's never shown. Anyways, I tend to dislike modern rom-coms; they're terribly formulaic. This one, at least, doesn't succumb to some of the worst pitfalls. The grand romantic gesture is kept relatively intimate. The Christmas stuff doesn't even get too sentimental. It's better than what a Richard Curtis or Garry Marshall would've done with it."}, {"id": 272, "text": "Happiest SeasonA rather bland Christmas movie that had a coming out story as the present for the supposed intolerant family at the festive break.What was good, we did laugh, there some very funny gags.What was problematic, no chemistry between the two female leads, predictable story, and a ramming home of political correctness.What was bad, everything was presented from a heterosexual viewpoint, sexual expression was dumbed down, we had class profiling and even some tokenism.I did fidget when the predictable ending came into view, and the shock value that it was about two women is pass\u00e9 we are in 2020 and no one is even mildly exercised.I give this a hard 6 for entertainment but alas Kristen Stewart was miscast."}, {"id": 273, "text": "Harper (Mackenzie Davis) reluctantly invites her girlfriend Abby (Kristen Stewart) to her conservative family Christmas. Abby excitedly plans to propose but Harper reveals that she had lied about coming out to her family. They have to pretend to be straight while Harper's father (Victor Garber) runs for mayor. Her mother (Mary Steenburgen) is stressed. Harper is constantly competing with older sister Sloane (Alison Brie). Jane (Mary Holland) is the overlooked awkward sister. Riley (Aubrey Plaza) is Harper's ex. John (Dan Levy) is Abby's friend.This is basically a traditional Christmas comedy with all the rom-com and family dysfunction toppings. It adds the newish lesbian coming out story into the mix. Actresses Clea DuVall and Mary Holland are the writers and filmmakers. Clea is not necessarily an experienced director and it shows in a couple of scenes. Mostly, this is a fun romp with a serious premise. I really like all the actors. Davis and Stewart are good together. I would probably switch out Steenburgen for someone more high strung. She needs to be more Waspy. The comedy is great although sometimes, it needs a sharper pen. There is also the differing tones. Sometimes, they clash. The denouement stretches out a little too long. Not everything needs a wrap-up and the comedic tone fades away after awhile. This is very good all the same."}], "reviews_amount": 274}
