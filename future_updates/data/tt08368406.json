{"name": "Vivarium", "titleId": "tt08368406", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "Honestly, I had pretty high hopes for this film. I really enjoy Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg and I thought they would have some interesting chemistry on-screen. The story seemed captivating enough from the trailer: A young couple meets up with an unusual real estate salesman to look at a house in a picturesque residential neighborhood, and they get trapped into a hellish suburbia where their only chance of survival is to raise a child delivered to them in a box. I was interested to see what direction it would take and unfortunately, it didn't deliver. The movie sets you up for a thrill-ride and just kind of... stops once it establishes itself. Once Gemma and Tom give up and accept their fate, the movie takes a turn for the worse. I feel like there were a lot of missed opportunities in this film for scares and uncomfortable moments that the director just didn't take. The character development (ESPECIALLY Imogen Poots' character) is really inconsistent, and their motives don't make a whole lot of sense. Why is it that Gemma suddenly decides to care about this child? There's really no lead up to her tacitly accepting her role as mother. She just kind of... does it one day, with little to no explanation for her behavior. Why is Tom so set on digging this hole? The ending is painfully predictable and unsatisfying. Overall, this movie reads like a crappy episode of the Twilight Zone. It had a lot of potential, but it also fell flat in a lot of places."}, {"id": 1, "text": "But then came the rest of the film. Tedious, repetitive, dull. I was SO glad when it was over. Ick."}, {"id": 2, "text": "It seems many viewers were so distracted by the style of the film that they missed its substance. To me, the film is not a critique of suburbia or parenting but a horror film about the positive qualities of both. Spoilers are full steam ahead below...Humans are excellent parents. We parent our helpless infants for a shocking long time, we build safe houses for them - rain, lightning &amp; earthquake-proof. We raise them in patterns; sweet quiet streets &amp; cookie-cutter homes, cookie-cutter gender roles as parents. With such bountiful generosity &amp; devotion, with such easily grasped roles, how could a brood parasite not take advantage?The aliens in this film are our cuckoos. They give us their child and we raise it in our own nest. We are trapped by our own humanity. When we see the newborn we feel parenthood instinctively. We cannot crush the newborn's head with a pickaxe, though we know it is not human. We feed &amp; nurture the child - perhaps begrudgingly, abusively, neglectfully - but we feed and nurture it even as it grows larger than ourselves. It takes all our energy to care for it, draining our very lifeforce, but we keep doing it. We can find no other option... We are trapped by our own nature.Other critics seem to think the aliens lack motivation, or that they have totally alien motivation; researcher motivation. I don't think so. Like the cuckoo, they are only fulfilling their own nature. They cannot save their para-parents. They are doing this to survive - it is their role in the circle of life. Why? Perhaps because their life span is so short, perhaps because their extra-dimensional nature makes typical parenting impossible, perhaps just the quirks of evolution. They look at us as we would see a cow. And they know how valuable our milk is. They must drink it to survive, so the baby calf is turned to veal and we eat ice cream on hot days. But are they evil? Not unless your tapeworm is evil. Nature is amoral.It is our own morality - the love for a baby's face - that traps us. We cannot dig out of our morality, or outrun it, or outthink it. This movie is exceptional because it shows us how our freely given empathy could be used to entrap and enslave us. I guess the only escape from this trap is infanticide or suicide - making the brood parasite strategy untenable, but ending our own life in the process. A more cruel trap than Jigsaw ever made. Horror at its finest."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Got a half decent idea for a short tv episode (but hey... leave out the cuckoo opening scenes then, no need to spell out the whole thing beforehand) but as a feature it's just an amateurish mess without much thought, balance in it's storytelling or coherence behind it (and yes it is surreal but that doesn't make it any better)"}, {"id": 4, "text": "The way this movie played out and ended felt very similar to a black mirror episode that felt like it's missing something.... there are a lot of great things in this movie (performance, cinematography, color scheme) but it doesn't make up for the one thing it lacks- excitement. Honestly watching this movie made me feel like I ate a big meal and I'm full from it but it wasn't what I was craving and overall bland. I have this feeling that the point of this movie is to make you feel like nothing. make you feel melancholy and/or depressed. It really makes you question your existence, your place on earth, if perfection is really what we crave and if life really matters, so it did achieve its goal however it probably could have been slightly more entertaining but then maybe it wouldn't have been as effective? It's a tough grey area. I probably wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to someone who's depressed. If you like unique artsy surreal films give it a go but don't expect too much.

There were a lot of breadcrumbs thrown around along the way.Obviously, these are aliens and they are studying our species to learn how to imitate us (notice that's what the kid was doing and his voice was a combination of both parents) to eventually take over the world.Apparently they are a patient species. It looks to me like the world that they created had several levels and there were families on each level.I guess soon enough they'll push us out of our nest much like the cuckoo bird and replace us.The end."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I believe many of the people who have reviewed this movie here really do not understand the message of this movie.This is (and I thought it was pretty apparent pretty early on) a very unique way of depicting the monotony of suburban life in many cultures today. A couple buys a house, they have an unexpected child, that child is a nightmare in their life but is their responsibility (in this case, by force,) the couple begin to fight because the child strains the relationship, the father works himself to death in search of some kind of meaning, the mother dies of heartbreak, and the child moves on to continue his own monotonous life cycle.I believe the movie was meant to be boring because it was supposed to reflect how boring your average citizen's life can be.I agree with other reviews saying there could have been a montage of the couple trying to escape. It would add a bit more substance to the actual plot and could have represented a midlife crisis to stay in line with the overall metaphor of the movie.I really enjoyed this flick, especially considering I've never seen anything quite like it.

This is some kind of brilliant and profound statement about some kind of prescient social issue...and if you complain about it being pretentious, you just don't know how to have fun!As much as some ideas were interesting here, this movie is a dull slog filled with overacting, not convincing special effects, constant waffling on vague philosophy and mostly just bored, grouchy looking people in dimly lit rooms staring into space.The only real attention paid was to making the film look pretty, and it does at times, but the over stylization takes away from any potential feeling of real peril.If it was supposed to be profound, don't make it so silly. If it was supposed to be entertaining don't make it so plodding and self-impressed."}, {"id": 10, "text": "I honestly cannot believe we watched the entire movie but we really wondered how this got decent reviews so we stuck with it. All I can say is the writer, director and Eisenherg had all of their friends and acquaintances sign up and give 10 stars.The movie never goes anywhere and has no purpose. The characters have no purpose and accomplish nothing besides digging a hole. It is so nothing. Lol. I would rather watch the season finale of Lost once a week for the rest of the year than watch this again.It was sooo bad I showed my kid the highlights, took less than 5 minutes.I gave it 2 stars just because it was bad enough where I was inspired to sign up and write this review."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I believe the point of the film is that it's pointless, a gloomy cycle that repeats itself regardless of whatever may try to get in its way. It's nihilistic, but also does not seek to convey anything to the audience. It's an intriguing story that begins and ends, and in the end was nothing more than a thought experiment without merit."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I agree that this movie isn't for everyone - that doesn't mean it's no good. Maybe it's just what I saw in the film when I watched it that made it so impactful. The movie is not called Suburbia - it's Vivarium. That should have given you a clue. To me it's a movie about, for example, what fish in an aquarium or lions in a modern zoo must feel/think while researchers explore and try to understand their behaviour. Extending that further...it might also be what an invading force might do in order to prepare for battle I.e. study the enemy. In that context I think it's a must see."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Don't listen to those dullard consumers that have been brought up on a steady diet of bangs and flashes. This isn't a mainstream film, rather it resembles a play, which gives a nod to Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot. With it's limited cast, static set design and dreamlike colours and soundtrack, I found myself mesmerised by every detail of this surreal little odyssey. It's necessary to absorb the atmosphere and dread of the existential nightmare that unfolds in order to enjoy the way it gets inside your head and alters your mood. Personally this is exactly the kind of movie which doesn't make me feel that I've wasted an evening. You can keep your guns and explosions, this is the closest I've felt to visiting a theatre since it's been impossible to do so. If you enjoyed The Twilight Zone as a kid this will feel nostalgic, though I sense it makes a bigger comment on the psychology of being human, or perhaps isolated... perfect for the times. Well done actors and designers. No it won't be for everyone, but I loved it."}, {"id": 14, "text": "That sums up the movie. Just... what? Okay then.There was no point to this. Nothing. It was just made to be made. Biggest waste of time I've ever sat through in my life. Nothing is explained and nothing happens.Seriously. Don't watch this if you're expecting some weird and bizarre movie with a twist. It's black mirror episode that was trashed and someone found the crumpled up sticky note of it and decided to make a movie with it.You can poke holes all you want into the theme or art of it; the hidden messages or intellectual understanding. I seriously think it was made to just be made.I love weird and bizarre movies. Even ones that are so far out there that many just can't tolerate. This, however, is nothing but time lapsed scenery with actors messing around.It was leading up to an interesting concept, to only leave you off with THATS IT!? It's like a pilot episode to a show that gets you hooked. But there's no following episode to continue the mystery because it's a movie.If you want to see Jesse being Jesse, watch. If you want to marvel at how beautiful and talented Imogen is, watch. All I got out of this movie, if I can come up with anything at all, is, wow, Imogen is a pretty woman and can convincingly act out any emotion well.Don't let people tell you this only for smart people to understand.

It really should have been boring but somehow it kept me interested the whole time. I'm not sure why. And it's the kind of movie I usually hate because you get no real answer at the end. Theres a lot of things that maybe they were trying to say about suburbia life and such, maybe trying to be artsy, but I never really care about that kind of thing, yet again I liked it.Maybe it's got to do with the isolation part.

On the rare occasion where I do dip below 5 stars I most often do what my mother always told me to do. If I can't say something nice...I don't say anything at all. And yet, here I am. Disappointed in the movie after 97 minutes of hoping it would offer some appreciable redeeming or artistic value (I strongly hesitate to criticize its artistic value since I myself can barely cut and paste) only to be sadly disappointed by its emptiness. How bad could it be I reasoned? After all my boy Jesse Eisenberg is in it and most of his movies are usually 8s... Aren't they? Sorry, but I will not take the time to describe the storyline or plot to you.

Quirky, surreal, sci-fi drama is tough to pull off but Charlie Kaufman, Terry Gilliam and Spike Jonze seem to get it. You have to create the story's world with context and textures so that as the characters get trapped, you understand their motivations plus the confinements to be overcome. Opening sequence is beautifully shot and harrowing but Vivarium's story set-up is very abrupt. Five mins into movie, all you know are two young people are to look at a house. You know nothing about them or the world around them but it just goes full bore into this inescapable neighborhood. From there it just falls apart and next 70m you see them flounder in this world full of questions but zero answers. At end, all I can surmise is that raising kids sucks and real estate agents are bad. Art..this is not. It did have potential but poor story writing and direction doomed it."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I liked it, I like that they've shown us something different from the norm, something a little odd.

If you like reading or viewing some of Stephen king now and then, then you too could probably appreciate the movie for its surrealty value.

Not for everyone, because it will let you lay awake at night with grinding teeth obsessing about the cruelty of life. But well worth the watch anyway.Because it has a real clever script. And it keeps your guessing what it's about until it throws you in the pit in the very last scene. Yeah, it's kind of depressing. But it's pretty original too. Some kind of unique satire.

The plot quite honestly creeped me out and gave me nightmares (no kidding, the child in this movie filled me with a nameless dread) but it is absolutely worth a watch, which puts it into a category of about 8% of films on the market (imho). Imogen Poots takes us through the film bad mushroom trip version of what the climax of interstellar was for a good DMT trip, if that makes any sense.

The story of the movie exactly just like the definition of the tittleTHIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY (according to me): Alien (or whatever it is that abducted Tom and Gemma) can't raise their own offspring and need a human couple to help them to raise their own offspring just like the bird at the beginning of the story. And the bird that raise the baby bird (although the baby bird is not its child and this baby bird actually the one that killed the biological baby bird), can't do anything about it.The whole point of the movie explained entirely in this scene when a student of Gemma saw dead birds (The one that has been showing at the beginning of the movie). This is their conversation and the meaning of the conversation and the relation with the meaning of the movie itself:Student: S Gemma: GS: Who did that to the poor baby birds? =&gt; this is we as an audience ask why the story punish both Tom and Gemma G: I don't know. Maybe it was a cuckoo. =&gt; this is the Story explaining itself. The explanation is at the end of the movie when Gemma hit the Yonder's Boy S: Why? =&gt; this is we as an audience ask the reason of that torture to Tom and Gemma and countless another couple in the story G: Because it needed a nest. =&gt; this is the Story explaining itself. S: Why doesn't it just make its own nest? =&gt; This is us again, asking the question G: Because that's nature, that's just the way things are. =&gt; this is the Story explaining itself. We as an audience can't complain because that's just the way things are S: I don't like the way things are. They're terrible. =&gt; This is us again, at the end of the movie, hated the Story so much. So many plot hole (you can read the plot hole at the end of this review) and so many unanswered questions make us feel incomplete when leaving the theater after seeing the movie G: Well... it's only horrible sometimes. =&gt; this is the Story UNABLE TO explaining itself. This is why the logic of the movie is so low according to me. The story can't explain it self and only stating the statement that it's only horrible sometimesThough it's never made explicit in Vivarium's ending, the most obvious interpretation of Yonder and the strange boy that Tom and Gemma are forced to raise is an alien abduction story. The film opens with a shot of a newly hatched cuckoo pushing other baby birds out of the nest. This is a phenomenon in nature known as brood parasitism, in which some birds will lay their eggs in a stranger's nest in order to trick the other bird into raising their young. In Vivarium's opening, the cuckoo eventually becomes so large that when its unwitting adoptive parent returns to feed it, the cuckoo looks like it's about to consume the adult bird's head - foreshadowing the movie's ending.Vivarium takes the behavior of the cuckoo and reimagines it as an alien or extradimensional species that has invaded Earth and forces humans to raise its offspring by trapping them together in a nest (in this case, the house at No. 9 in Yonder). Just as some female cuckoos are able to lay eggs that resemble the eggs of the bird species whose nest they are left in, the boy's species is able to imitate humans closely, but not perfectly. Tom and Gemma notice something is off about Martin as soon as they arrive in the real estate office and observe his strange behavior, and the boy's voice definitely doesn't sound like a normal human child.Compounding the alien abduction theory is the strange alien language that appears in the boy's book and the patterns that appear on the TV, which are clearly communicating to him. At one-point Gemma asks the boy to imitate the person who gave him the book and he starts to transform, with bulging growths on his neck. Later, after she attacks him with the pickaxe, he gets down on all fours and scuttles like an animal - all of which points to him being an alien species in disguise. The impossible space that Gemma stumbles into when she tries to chase the boy at the end of the movie definitely seems like an alien construct, as does the impossible space of Yonder itself.Based on Vivarium's ending, it seems that these aliens age rapidly, growing to adulthood within a year (the boy looks about six years old after just three months) and declining from middle age to old age within the same space of time. They sustain themselves by trapping human couples in Yonder and forcing them to raise their weird children, and when a new Martin reaches adulthood, he replaces the old one. The aliens do not appear to form any kind of emotional attachments to their adoptive parents, and do not grieve for them when they dieTom and Gemma are literally stuck in this heteronormative structure of what a couple is supposed to do as they get older. Against their will, they have been forced into the suburban life, a home they despise, a routine they grow resentful of, and a child neither of them wanted. They are now stuck on a path for life that is both mundane and horrifying - one that ends in their deaths, with their bodies left to rot on the grounds of the house they hated. They aren't alone in this nightmare either, as the parallel worlds of Yonder reveal. This is the world that awaits us all, or at the very least, the white heterosexual middle-class couples to whom this fantasy is primarily sold to.Interestingly, Tom and Gemma never ask out loud why they have been trapped in the world of Yonder and its restrictive rules. They just get on with it because they have to. This is partly what makes Vivarium so fascinating: It is keenly aware of the smothering expectations placed upon people to adhere to societal norms, even as they become more unattainable and less desired by younger generations. Nowadays, we are less tied up by such conventions and it's far more normal for people, whatever gender they are, to remain unmarried, child-free, or off the property ladder, whether it be through choice or financial restrictions. Still, even today, it is that image of the happy suburban white couple with children and a mortgage that dominates the world and is deemed the default mode of life. Tom and Gemma were not picked to become a new part of Yonder for any other reason than because they were there, and that makes their fate all the more terrifying. It could happen to anyone.The most interesting and arguably the boldest aspect of Vivarium is in how it takes on the concept of parenthood. Here, to be a parent is to be forced into a one-sided parasitic relationship that will sap you of your very life essence. It is to be miserable and unfulfilled, to commit to something that will never make you happy or yield vaguely satisfying results. Tom and Gemma did not want a child but the society of Yonder demanded it, and the boy who grows in years as the days pass is unnerving, lacks imagination, and is utterly helpless without them. It's a blunt metaphor for the realities of parenting, but most stories end such narratives in a happy way, revealing how it was all worth it in the end.Vivarium doesn't do that. This is a film with the sheer guts to position the act of being parents as potentially the worst thing one could do with their lives, a mistake they will regret until they die. That remains one of society's last true taboos and Vivarium pulls no punches with it. Even when Gemma shares tender moments with the boy, she absolutely refuses to let him call her his mother. Her dying words to the now-grown boy are just that: I am not your mother. It's a final act of defiance in the face of a world that took everything from her, and one that verbalizes countless people's lives, both within Yonder and in the real world. PLOT HOLE:1. there's no explanation what the Yonder's boy really need actually from the human being. From the story itself, AUDIENCE ARE ABLE TO see that the Yonder's boy actually can raise its own kind. No need to established such a complicated vivarium in term of Yonder neighborhood and put a couple of human being in there in order to raise its own kind. Constant supply of food, electricity, etc., you named it. The Yonder's boy even can understand the TV channel in the other hand, the human couple that raise it, can't.2. there's no explanation why the Yonder's boy need to be exist in our world and what is its purpose.3. there's no explanation how the vivarium established in the first place4. there's no explanation why Gemma and Tom need to dieMajor failure in point number 1 above make the story pointless. Although as an audience we can get the meaning and associate it with our real-life condition but nevertheless, it is still meaningless.Truman show (starred Jim Carrey) is an example of vivarium but it is elegantly explaining the plot. The story (Truman Show) reveal itself and audience feel completed when leaving the theater after seeing the movie; whereas impossible to get the same feeling after watch this so-called Vivarium. Just my 2 cents. Andy."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I had a lot of expectations in the start but as the play went on, things begin to fall apart horribly.

It was slow in many places, I'd even venture to say it's a slow paced film in its entirety, but it only really feels slow in certain places. I'd like to imagine that's what the director was trying to convey; monotony, lethargy, emptiness, but it did drag on sometimes. The ending was slightly anticlimactic in my opinion and in general i felt the story left much to be desired. But again I like the idea of it, it just felt very bare bones like it wasn't fully fleshed out yet. Perhaps it could be better as a book where one can spend more time on the details. Would i recommend this? If you like movies with a hint of sci fi/psychological mind bending then maybe you'd find it pleasant enough.

Her gorgeous 'girl next door' look works perfectly in every frame. Jesse Eisenberg puts in the hard yards as a slightly toned down version of himself.The story starts with Jemma and Jesse accepting an offer to visit some display homes. They follow the salesman to an estate that's so new, the roads don't even have signs yet. The houses are nice enough, but every one is identical. Curiously, they're all painted in the same shades of green. The whole situation is a very weird, but they roll with it until... well, you'll need to watch the movie to find out.Vivarium is arguably the best interpretation of Franz Kafka's work to date, and draws upon two of his most well known quotes:'Better to have, and not need, than to need, and not have.''I am constantly trying to communicate something incommunicable, to explain something inexplicable, to tell about something I only feel in my bones and which can only be experienced in those bones. Basically it is nothing other than this fear we have so often talked about, but fear spread to everything, fear of the greatest as of the smallest, fear, paralysing fear of pronouncing a word, although this fear may not only be fear but also a longing for something greater than all that is fearful.'Kafka himself was a poor interpreter of his own work, which he rarely studied and often misunderstood. This is why films like Vivarium are so necessary.Jemma and Jesse are defined not by their characters, but by their relationship and its uneasy dynamic. The arrival of a newcomer is destabilising because they cannot adapt to a situation over which they have no control. Jemma's realisation of this fact is neatly articulated in Act 2, when she says 'Believing in progress does not mean believing that any progress has yet been made.'It is only much later in the film that they finally realise they are free, and this is why they are lost. As Jesse says in Act 3, 'I am in chains. Don't touch my chains.' It's a powerful and highly relatable metaphor.Vivarium was brought to the big screen by Lovely Productions (in association with Fantastic Films, Frakas Productions, PingPongFilm and XYZ Films) on a tiny budget of $4 million, most of which came from a grant donated by Deutsche Telefunken. Its high production values confirm that the money was well spent.I rate Vivarium at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a Kafkaesque 8/10 on IMDB."}, {"id": 35, "text": "I watched the movie. Then I started reading the reviews and before long. A pattern seemed to emerge. Generally speaking. The people who appear to be the least entertained by the movie also appear to have the most to say about it. I find that rather odd in itself. There appears to be a purpose to every event and object in the movie. Whether over or understated, connected or disconnected. The entire movie appears to nudge and provoke the psych without giving many conclusions and leaving the audience to interpret the movie in a variety of different ways. In other words. Thought provoking. Since there is a trend these days for action movies that are simply exercises in mindless destruction. I'm not surprised it would leave many people cold. Is it a good or a bad movie? I'm sorry but the only way you are going to answer that question is to watch the movie and decide for your self. To the question; does this review contain spoilers?

I can only say indy because it fits into: horror, comedy, drama and sci-fi categories all equally well. It is a weird, disorienting bottle drama that has decent performances from all the (few) actors involved.***SPOILERS BELOW***The story is about an unmarried couple who are looking for a house in an inflated housing market. They stumble upon this new housing development sales room, quickly get railroaded into going for a quick view of one of the houses in this new development and become trapped in a maze of look alike suburban streets. As the story evolves you come to learn that the couple has been trapped and essentially forced into raising.... something. The something starts as what looks like a baby but it quickly becomes something else, a mimic predator perhaps? All the while the couple cope with their captivity and run through a gambit of emotions, hating/loving each other intensely, hating/loving the child they have been forced into raising.The neighbourhood is creepily idyllic, the sky never changes with the same big puffy clouds, all the houses are exactly the same, and never another human in site.Personally I love movies that have their own vision and try something a bit different and don't just trope their way through 90 minutes of mediocrity. I feel some of the bad reviews are because the ending is not a happy one, I've noticed a correlational relationship with small movies on rating and whether it's a happy ending.

In Vivarium, Lorcan Finnegan shows us the sci-fi horror of the dystopian reality for a young couple who believed the hype of boring box like suburbia.Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg want a home of their own and somehow wander into an estate agents staffed by Martin. Jonathan Aris is like the big bad wolf tempting Gemma and Tom to come and visit Yonder. It's a Goldilocks sort of place, just near enough, and yet far enough, and just the right distance. From nowhere? Run away as fast as you can. It clearly isn't what they want looking around the Monopoly green identikit houses in the shop, but they follow Martin out to the estate where No 9 is available. And inside it's everything you expect a show house to be, with the artfully placed lamps, bed throw and welcome pack with champagne and strawberries in the fridge. And a spare bedroom already painted blue. They do want children one day Gemma explains, as they explore the plastic grassed garden. And then they're alone. So they leave too.Except every turn leads back to No 9 in this Escher style estate. And as luck (?) would have it, they run out of petrol right outside No 9, as they drive past once again later that same evening. So they go inside. The strawberries have no taste so I guess they must be Spanish out of season.When Tom climbs on the roof next day he sees nothing but more roofs, so they decide to follow the sun and find their way out. The comedy is black watching them cross garden after garden, always climbing on the same white plastic chair they've dragged across the same manicured green grass, until they finally find a house with lights on. No 9. This is clearly a Truman Show never ending set with Magritte surrealist clouds in the sky.Fortunately a box is always left outside with the same tasteless provisions, for our, let's call them self-isolators of today. Or live lab rats given the actual meaning of vivarium. But tomorrows box is a bit of a kicker. With a baby inside. 'Raise the child and be released' is the included instruction. Maybe all new babies should come with this get out clause. But this alien, the cuckoo in the nest we are forced to accept, is a fast grower and as day 96 passes he is already 7. Played by Senan Jennings he screams at Gemma and Tom until he is fed, like the poor birds dealing with the actual cuckoo in the nest, and watches the only tv channel with its black and white puzzles, even though they tell him to turn it off. And in reality this is actually how some poor parents live.After taking refuge in their car Gemma and Tom are amazed to find the radio still works and dance with joy until their 'son' joins in. Copying their movements he is quite fascinating as all children copy their parents to learn. But with a creepy robotic style voice that immediately makes you wary. They could be any young family dancing crazily in the empty street. In a few months the UK will look like this again.But Tom is the first to snap after these long months. He deals with the monotony by digging a hole in the plastic garden. Their relationship reduced to a few words here and there. With Tom continuously hearing noises further below, maybe a way out if he can only dig deep enough. It becomes a full time job of futility as he grows weaker. While Gemma struggles with maternal issues for the parasitic thing tied to them, and sits by the washing machine that washes the clothes they don't have.It's an absolutely fascinating film, in months the child grows into a cookie cutter callous young man, now played by Eanna Hardwicke, who Gemma follows when he goes out for his Escher style daily walk. She's literally walking around the bend. As our loving young couple fall further into their suburban nightmare.The ending is brutal, a shocking Alice In Wonderland fall to other unseen Gemma and Toms in equally trapped desperate circumstances. What an idea and script by Lorcan Finnegan and Garret Shanley. But I think in this cookie cutter film I would have liked to know who is behind this, and why?

Their different reactions to this burden, and to each other's reactions, give the movie substance. The climax and resolution are splendid, but this is NOT a feel-good movie.I think it's a classic (maybe not just a cult classic),. In his Q&amp;A, writer/director Lorcan Finnegan referred to The Quiet Earth, Magritte, Escher and many more.

There's more hand-me-down genre movie tropes, than recognizable human behavior in this film. And I certainly didn't need a 97 min dose of it. This Irish, Danish and Belgium collaboration felt more like a slow-burn bad acid trip from the 70's. However, the cinematography and score were perfection, as were the stylized sets and performances by Poots and Eisenberg, and my rating going all towards those qualities. If you're a fan of stylized satirical indie arthouse psychological sci-fi noir genres, you will appreciate and possibly enjoy this one.

I accept the fact that it looks a bit corny, but for me this compliments the vibe of the movie. Eisenberg isnt doing anything special or new but that's perfectly fine with the type of character he is playing here. Poots is really pushing a dramatic performance, but in my opinion this movie is so self aware that it doesn't really need it. The performance I liked the most was that of Hardwick, who is making his first steps in the field of acting. Cold and distant, his acting made me believe he really isn't human. The climax, which so many dislike is perfectly fine for me. Of ourse the monologue of Eisenberg was stretched out and we saw his death coming a long time ago, but still the revelation that the child is a supernatural creature holding them there until their deaths worked fine for me. We got a couple of great elements and the whole atmosphere was sweet and warm. Perhaps too sweet for its own good.

Vivarium is the latter.1) That name. Unless you studied Latin, the title makes no frigging sense. You couldn't have used Yonder as a title since it was the name of the neighborhood from hell?2) Tom and Gemma are a couple looking at starter homes when they come upon Martin, this spawn of Sheldon Cooper and Data, who pushes them to browse one of the numerous identical houses when all of a sudden Tom and Gemma are abandoned by Martin and stuck in this 9th circle of bland, no other humans around to help explain this cold prison without bars.3) Soon after trying to escape but stuck running/driving in circles, huge boxes arrive with equally bland food, clothes, even a baby they have to raise in order to be set free. The baby grows to be an Annoying Kid who repeats Tom's and Gemma's mannerisms, screams incessantly, barks loudly like a dog, etc. I'm not one for corporal punishment, but I kept wishing the adults would've smacked that Annoying Kid upside the head. At least he got locked in the car once.4) Gemma tries to unravel the mystery of the really Annoying Kid, who watches black-and-white patterns on TV, disappears and reappears with more boxes of food and necessities. Tom tries to dig a hole to the other end of the earth, but as he gets deeper, he finds a dead body.5) Soon Annoying Kid becomes Annoying Adult and still no resolution, no explanation, no nothing except he still wanders around the empty neighborhood, Tom drops dead after digging the hole to nowhere, and gets buried in the deep hole. Understandably upset, Gemma fights back but Annoying Adult runs away making alienish noises and crawling like a spider, Gemma goes under an opening in the sidewalk and sees previous residents before she's back in the bland house from hell and she drops dead as well. Annoying Adult buries both in the deep hole without a care in the world, leaving to return to find Martin dead and aged. Annoying Adult steals the nametag, buries the older Martin in a file cabinet(?), and waits for the next customers.What was the point of this film? There's NO story. No explanation of WTF Martin and the Annoying Doppelganger were (clearly they weren't human judging from their mannerisms, but the closest we got to a reveal, ANY reveal, was Annoying Kid's bulging neck as he was screaming his head off for the bazillionth time). No explanation of why Tom and Gemma were imprisoned against their will. No explanation of how quickly the baby grew to be Annoying Kid then to Annoying Adult, yet Tom and Gemma never aged a day.

This film, however, while straddling those two genres and including some black comedy, was actually quite enjoyable. Kafkaesque, certainly, as mentioned in other reviews, and a serious statement about suburban life and its repetitive cycle.The film centers around a young couple looking for a home who get railroaded into a showing in a cookie-cutter new development of identical houses. The agent (immediately bizarre AF. I would have noped right the F out of there as soon as he spoke) abandons them in this perfectly staged house, leaving them to see themselves out. Only they can't. There is no out. And regardless of how many times they round the block, attempt escape on foot, or set the place on fire, number 9 still stands. Provisions are delivered by someone unseen, and a second box containing a baby is left on the walk as well....with instructions to raise the child and be released.What happens next, and what is the bulk of the film, is watching this couple in the endless cycle of day-to-day life that only really differs from reality in the way that they are being forced to live this scenario. You watch as Gemma (Imogen Poots) succumbs to the exhaustion of motherhood as she attempts to placate the child and attends to its demands for care. You see Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) attempt to escape his reality by throwing himself into a project that is an exercise in futility, and literally digging himself Into an early grave. You see the frustration in both actors, and you watch their relationship move through the natural course of relationships in this very unnatural scenario; loving each other fiercely, resentment, fury, loving fiercely again.The climax is likely the most telling and relatable moment, as Gemma is somehow traveling through other dimensions where she sees others like herself in the same scenario. A woman at a kitchen table crying while her child watches staticky alien gibberish on TV. Gemma recognizes that desperation in her eyes before falling into other homes with other couples raising other imposters, landing on the bathroom floor of someone who just couldn't take it and decided to release himself early, before tumbling down the stairs of the inescapable number 9. This is what suburban life is like; behind every picket fence and well-manicured lawn is a family going through their own emotional struggles...all wishing they had their s**t together, but no one ever really does. All at some point wanting to run away from it all, but never really able to.And, of course, this cycle ends in the inevitable. Death. While the new generation sets to work quickly finding other suckers to rope in.If you're watching this for what it is on the surface alone, don't bother. You likely won't enjoy it. You likely won't understand the underlying themes.

There is no explanation as to why the neighbourhood is endless or where the boy came from. In my opinion, the setting of the endless neighborhood only expresses how the average, suburban family can't escape from their life. The tasteless food also represents how bland their life is. The guy digging a hole can represent the futility of working, or how by working so much he dig his own grave. I believe many metaphors can arise from this film, which is what makes it worth it: not the plot itself, but what it aims to express. Like Mother!, this film has a load of negative reviews for being metaphorical rather than having a clear plot.

They find a box full of supplies. After trying to burn down the house, they find a baby boy in a box.This is a Twilight Zone episode stretched out into a movie. It is interesting visually. After the weird premise, the story does not really pick up. I also hate the screaming child. It's very annoying. What the movie needs is a series of scenes where the couple is trying stuff. There should be a montage of them trying to escape. They should be tearing through the houses. I appreciate digging the hole but it's not an exciting activity. The ending does have an exciting chase down a rabbit hole. That saves the movie for me.

The first act takes its time with world building and character development. And then it falls flat becoming another run of the mill sci-fi movie. The main characters are basically stuck in in a cookie cutter world by aliens to trap them into raising alien children and to help them adapt for passable humans.This could have been a much deeper study in how we raise our children and prejudice indoctrination and the likes but it becomes an all too familiar story about how much modern society is not prepared for child care and home ownership. Even then, the message could have been better delivered if they had been given any choice in the matter but no, they are given a house and forced to live in it. They are given a child forced to raise it. If you're looking for clever development you saw in the first act then you can forget about it. Like what happened here? With all the care the film makers took into developing the relationship between Gemma and Tom, it falls apart at the first sign of trouble. These two have amazing chemistry from the onset but disappeared into half assed narratives that are isolated from each other without so much as giving a proper send off.Incase you are still confused by what's going on at the end: aliens trapped a loving couple into a pseudo world in order to help them adapt into our world. They don't have the resources to do so given their rapid growth. When the child is mature they destroy the surrogate parents and find new ones. Rinse and repeat. There is no deeper meaning.

It asks the question - is it enough to have all the essentials in a family unit - a house (but not a home), food, a child? The answer is a big NO. You can have all of life's essential components to live, but not really be alive. When human contact with the outise world ceases to exist, our self validation also becomes extinct. When we live in a bubble, whether self made or not, our human senses grow weaker, and we as human's grow weaker. The movie couldn't have been released at a more opportune time, during the Covid 19 Pandemic, when society right now is feeling alone and isolated. Right now the world is in our very own bubble or family unit, deprived of all but the essentials of life. Confined to the 4 walls of the BOX (movie metaphor) we live in. The movie's symbolism of the boy's bed with bars, the ladder that Tom climbs down, all prison bars in this surrealistic world that was built to be a perfect community, that turns out to be a living Hell. This perfect community where all the roads are the same and lead nowhere, and all the houses are the same reminds me of a communistic theory of life, which was supposed to be a more harmonies way of life, but turns out to be anything but that. On another level is this a metaphor for a totally dysfunctional family. A cautionary tale if you will, about a family that desperately wants the American dream. The all American family, and gets a version of it that they weren't counting on. Their child, given to them, not born to them, is not the one they counted on. He embodies all the traits of an autistic child. This movie gives us a glimpse in the mundane, difficult, isolated life of a family trying to cope with an impossible situation with no relief from this horrible existence. This movie shows all the things that can go wrong as we travel along out path in life, seeking our perfect world. Also, the perverbial hole that Tom incessantly digs (reminds me of the dirt mound in Close Encounters of the 3rd kind that we see Roy Neary assembling - he is building, Tom is digging), is symbolic of the idiom you're digging yourself in a hole, or you are digging your own grave. He has gotten himself into a hole that he cannot get out of. As it turns out, he is literally digging his own grave. Let us not forget what the word Vivarium means - an enclosure for keeping animals under semi-natural conditions for study or as pets. This movie is a study of humanity given just enough creature comforts for survival (the strange appearance of boxes with life's essentials) but nothing given for life's enjoument. All of life's joys are deprived - the food has no taste, the clouds have no shape, every house is exactly the same. Their only enjoyment was the one scene where the car radio still works, but that is short lived and distrupted by the strange boy. Vivarium is definately something to ponder over.

Nothing is making sense and by the end there is nothing to fill in the spaces. However, there are some films the viewer needs to participate in the thought process. Sorry to all those who just like to sit back, relax and get spoon fed, but this isn't that kind of film. I suppose the makers could warn people, but the whole idea of a film like this is for people to figure out what they're watching, so a warning would definitely be a move in the wrong direction.Basically Vivarium is a metaphor for life, or how humans deal with life. Most people, in the world, get married, have kids, and so forth, although there are some that don't follow the righteous path. It doesn't really matter that these 2 people are being studied by some alien being. What matters is putting a couple, any couple, into this trap, will result in the same end. We witness life before a child and life after a child. Having children after marriage changes EVERYTHING, and basically starts the second half of life. I think the best and most obvious metaphor was the hole Tom can't stop digging, just like the debt that accumulates after getting married and having kids. One big hole that just keeps getting deeper.Vivarium strips away all the layers and leaves the total monotony of what us humans experience.

After digesting it for a few days I landed upon a bad way. The movie itself has an interesting premise and a bizarre, surreal feel about it, but that can't save the movie from getting lost in the point it's trying to make; children are parasites the suburban life is a wash, rinse, repeat cycle. At least that's what I took away from it. I feel the film suffers because the writer/ director was so dead-set on making that point that everything else became ancillary. I would say the first half of the movie was good. It established the characters and the world fairly quickly and to the point, but then one the kid shows up, it gets weird, the inconsistencies show up as well. The kid was creepy, I'll give them that, but the way the relationship between the two characters and the way they handled the child, especially the woman, became annoying. i'm not your fucking mom. You can't leave him in the car. And then the little things bother me, like they paint HELP on the roof in white paint, then another scene its shows FUCK YOU written on the roof. What happened to the help? Did they wash it off? There was no trace of it. Yes, that's a nitpick, but still, irksome. Then the whole I have to dig a hole plot device just so they could make the point that suburban life is nothing more than digging you own grave so your children can bury you, was quite forced. Then the thing that really bothered me was when he found the body in the hole. I mean, really? I am all for coincidence in a movie, BUT, that one was a little too convenient. Basically, someone else was trapped there, found out the grass was fake, had a shovel, decided to dig a hole, and then died in the EXACT SAME SPOT? Nope. And back to the whole suburbia point; why the hell would the aliens (or whatever) build an entire neighborhood and leave it all empty except for one house? That makes no sense. Again, nothing more than a plot device. The other thing that bothers me is there seemed to be no other explanation for the characters to die other than, Well, that's the life cycle in suburbia hell. That didn't sit well with me either. And then the one kind of really cool scene at the end where she chases the alien into the alternate/ parallel areas where other people are seen in her same situation ultimately delivered nothing. I suppose what bothers me is that there is no real revelation, no reason. Yes, the very end shows the reason why the aliens are doing it, but it wasn't really a reason. Why did the aliens need the humans to raise the child? again, going back to the life cycle, reason and story telling your bypassed to make a point. And from what we get from the movie, this supposedly takes place on earth. How? Where? How could something like this stay hidden and how could only the aliens get in and out? Some kind of reveal or explanation there would have been nice. Something like in The Signal. It would have explained away some of the faults the film had.

Even if there is a hidden meaning though, I don't think it matters that much, as their message is an entirely negative one.There was always the sense of impending doom throughout the movie, you always feel as though something terrible is just around the corner. It made me feel uneasy. I read a newspaper article that said the movie was based on a short - it did feel as though the movie was dragged out unnecessarily. It felt like an agony to watch (maybe that was intended), but there were unnecessary scenes that added nothing of value to the plot (brushing teeth, sitting on the toilet). Maybe that should spark a dialogue about the horrors of suburban life?The movie felt like it was made by someone who really detests children, someone who would donate all their money to Planned Parenthood in a heartbeat. The plot makes it look like there's nothing worse on earth than raising a child. I wonder if the ending had turned out differently if they had showed the child some love? Probably not, but the fact that they dehumanized the child and called it &gt;it&lt; just made both characters unlikeable to me.The alien part is just exaggerated and made me roll my eyes. They're all evil and out to get us for sure... it's such a clich\u00e9.

When Gemma gets up in the morning and barely squirts the toothpaste onto her toothbrush I felt the hopelessness and saw myself in that moment. How many times I (and others) have played out countless similar scenarios in daily life? Then I find out it's sci-fi and these two characters are actually lab rats. It probably is still a metaphor. But they are both amazing in this movie. I've admired them immensely as actors for years. Tom's digging of his (and her) own grave is a poignant moment only realised when they are being dragged to it in the final scenes. Only then does the frightening reality of the whole setup begin to unfold before Gemma and the viewer. And the reality is...terrifying beyond imagination. At least to me. I wonder if this is the kind of existential nightmare that lab rats are faced with each day of their life...at least on the same level as their level of consciousness allows them to experience. Makes me wonder if our universe is a vivarium of sorts under eternal observation, only broken up by the existential crises we all seem to face day in day out.

Even the couple's drifting apart doesn't really create any tension. After half of the movie I didn't care if they live or die. When finally some more movement comes into the matter, it is so confusing that it brings no satisfaction. The end is to be expected and therefore hardly surprising.

The ending was very underwhelming."}, {"id": 485, "text": "Vivarium follows a young couple who are looking for their first house together. They're looking for the perfect home they can settle down and have kids in, that will last them decades to come. One estate agent in particular pushes them to look at a property immediately, and the couple find themselves stuck in a never-ending residential area. They're given a baby to look after, and told if they raise it, they will be set free. The child ages rapidly over the course of a year, Tom dedicates his time to digging a hole in the front garden for...reasons, and Gemma reluctantly raises the difficult and alarming child to adulthood. And then they die, and the cycle repeats.If that sounded a little dull and anti-climatic, that's because that's exactly what this film is. Worryingly, I think that may have been the point. The director has gone on the record to say that the movie is a metaphorical criticism of capitalism and suburbia, where we move into a house that looks like everyone else's, work meaningless jobs until we die, and are pressured to have kids to make sure the cycle repeats itself. That's just life. Life is dull, repetitive, and anti-climatic. That's what this movie wants to say, and yet it's not really what it ends up saying at all, at least not to my own interpretation.Instead for me, the movie was a harsh criticism of children. Children are horrible. Don't have them. They will trap you and ruin your life. As a father of two boys, this is of course a point I strongly disagree with. Children are great. They're fascinating, curious, and offer an unrivalled sense of accomplishment. Without my children, my life would be all the more dull, repetitive, and anti-climatic. Of course they're challenging to raise, which this movie has no problems exploring, but they come with a wealth of positives as well. The film has no interest in that. These brood parasites are just horrible to the bone, and the only answer is cruelty and neglect, apparently. We watch this couple abuse this child over the course of a year, which is understandable considering the circumstances, but still a disgustingly cynical viewpoint of humanity's default reaction to troubled children. The fact Gemma is a nursery/primary school teacher just makes her actions even more insulting and inconsistent.As for Tom, he dedicates his time to digging a hole until he dies of, presumably, exhaustion. Metaphorically this is of course to show how we work ourselves to death. We dig our own graves by giving our efforts to the man and not to ourselves. But why is he digging a hole from a narrative standpoint? What's he expecting to find down there? To what end does he keep digging this hole? Who knows. We need a metaphor to explain capitalism forcing us to dig our own graves, so we'll just have him literally digging his own grave without knowing why. Sure.So who is the kid? Who is the estate agent? Why are Gemma and Tom trapped here? The answer's pretty obvious to anyone paying attention. The film literally opens with a montage of a cuckoo kicking eggs and fledglings out of a nest and reaping the benefits from it's unwittingly surrogate parents. This is almost literally what the child does. The estate agent gives the couple a nest, and fills it with his own offspring (not literally, I don't think, but offspring of his species), and expects them to raise it for him, which they have no choice but to do. Gemma remarks at one point about how the boy is a mystery, and she's determined to crack it, but she never does. Maybe this is meant to be another allegory for suburbia quashing our dreams and hobbies, but it results in a movie shockingly unsatisfactory at its most shallow level. They're a race of interdimensional beings that can manipulate space and time, and they live among us in order to abduct young couples to raise their young...and that's it. That's all we get. All that aside, there is something deeply Lovecraftian about this, in the most modern way. The idea of being trapped, alone, in a vapid existence, with an alien child, is truly terrifying. There's no way out. There's no end. Just rows and rows of duplicate houses and depressingly perfect clouds day in, day out. It's an idea, and an execution, that tests the limits of human sanity. And honestly, that's low key what I hated most about this movie. The manufactured, duplicated houses under a perfect sky is truly nightmarish. I feel uncomfortable enough walking around somewhere with no horizon; just rooves as far as the eye can see, and that was almost all there was to this movie. An endless nightmare of claustrophobic repetition and duplication with no end.This was not a movie I'd recommend, which coming from a big fan of the surreal, the artsy, and the metaphorical, says a lot. I don't need things spoonfed to me, not least because I have demonstrated in this review how well I understood this movie both metaphorically and literally, but I need more than this. I need a satisfactory ending. Closing the movie with And then they died... is lazy and makes me feel like I just wasted my life watching this it. They arrive, they attempt to escape, and then they give in, do as they're told, and get no closure. It's dull, it's repetitive, it's anti-climatic, and it goes on way too long. This would've been great cut down to a lean forty minutes to an hour, like the episode of a horror anthology series or something, or if it had delved further into this parasitic race of interdimensional beings and actually given us something to chew our teeth into beyond the obvious 'capitalism is bad, life is meaningless' message they're trying to push. Imogen Poots was the only saving grace, carrying the entire movie on her shoulders, but even then it wasn't enough. The film largely achieves everything it sets out to do, but what it sets out to do just isn't very interesting.

All of these things in this movie are only bad if you aren't ready or don't want them to happen, having a home isn't a bad thing, having a child isn't a bad thing, but they certainly can be if it's not what you want but it's what you think is expected of you."}, {"id": 494, "text": "I just wasted my precious time seeing this.

In this movie humans are facing cuckoo-like beings that abduct human couples (instead of placing their children in their nest) and take them to the nest of their own. Apparently, these strange entities do not leave their offspring to fend for themselves and they provide them with enough education through a weird TV channel and a book with another-worldly alphabets.

The child as this force which is taking all the energy from the parents for him to find gasoline, the energy to transport himself out of suburbia only for him to find a new couple to repeat this whole bourgeois suburb life.

Don't be fooled by the cuteness of the lead actors, the film is not funny. It is very depressing and disturbing. But not bad. I will talk about this later. But let me tell you this; in fact I could have given a higher note to this film because there is no specific fault in it but somehow it is difficult to rate higher. Maybe because of the fact that it is pointless. And I am not saying this as an insult. The film itself is saying that right from the start. The little girl in the school yard was asking why? and her teacher answered that it is the nature. The same thing can be said regarding the motivations of the aliens (I presume) in the film. Actually their actions are the mirror images of the bird in the opening scenes. So this film is not a mystery, it is an open book. There is no great philosophical meaning behind. It is just their nature to behave this way. I guess if one tries really hard, they can find symbolism here and there but to me the main theme was only this.And as a low budget - low concept science fiction film it is rather successful in its genre. However, oh boy, it is so depressing. So long. Excruciating in some ways. If it were a short that would not help much either. Because the idea is so unpleasant, it would still create the same negative sensation. To sum up, it is not bad, just hard to look at.

Chilling atmosphere throughout the movie and really makes you think about the cyclical nature of existence that humanity brings upon itself and calls it living.Some reviews say that the beginning is boring and unnecessary, however this is because they can't comprehend that it actually sets up the psychological horror perfectly through a continuous metaphor. For example, cuckoo at the beginning in the nest, forcing another parent to raise its young, perfectly alluding to the rest of the movie.As well as the parasitic nature of the child/estate agent, but that if it had been parent living the same day in their boring, manufactured house with their own kid, it would be seen as normal.The child's species is like a termite, simply there to reproduce then die, which is what we are also designed to do, but that we trick ourselves into seeing ourselves as more important and that is what makes the concept of being nothing more than a termite scary to some people."}, {"id": 581, "text": "A waste of eisenberg's talent.

And basically, from what I understood, that Mormons are evil. ..Oh and they are aliens!Now take what I'm posting with a grain of salt, since I was doing computer work while watching this, so I might have missed something. But I got the gist of what happened!It starts off showing this baby bird killing other baby birds, so that it's the only bird in the nest, so that the mother has to feed it. And it continues to force the mother bird to feed it, even after it is old enough to get food on its own. Then the title appears. This was creepily done and sets the tone for the movie.Then a couple are walking around town and happen to walk into an office that sells people on buying a new home. He dresses and comes off as a Mormon. They feel this is weird, but he talks them into following him to check out one of the houses to see if they would be interested. They follow him in they're car for a ways before arriving at this subdivision of houses that are all green and look alike, with clouds that look like out of a painting.Then he shows them around, acting weird, then suddenly disappears! So they get weirded out and get in they're car and try to leave. At this point you kinda figure out something is very off. After driving in circles they keep arriving at the same house they left at. Eventually the car runs out of gas. They try they're cell phones, but no signal. So they decide to give up and go inside. The next day, they try walking in one direction, and end up back where they started.Next someone leaves a box of vacuum bagged food for them. The husband decides to burn down the house, hoping it would attract attention. It burns to the ground, yet no one arrives. After the smoke clears, the house magically reappears. At this point they don't know what to do. And at this point I was really invested in this crazy mystery!!Next another box shows up with a baby, with a note, Take care of the child, and you may leave. Here's where the movie goes into Stephen King territory.At this point the movie asks the main characters to actually take care of the child, and he talks with a weird voice! Almost like an alien trying to mimic a humans voice. Side note, towards the end, they straight up tell you this child is an alien! They go back and forth treating it like it's they're child and hating it and wishing it would go away. Unfortunately the movie doesn't try to show the audience what would happen if the child were killed or ignored. And the child keeps watching a channel on tv that is similar to Hypto-toad from Futurama. Like the channel is feeding the child information or something. But they never show the other two trying other channels or even watching tv..Then the husband is smoking outside and flings his cigarette at the grass and it burns away in a manner, almost like watching stop-motion in action. So he gets the idea to start digging. And he keeps digging. And every day the child magically gets older at a faster rate.And then the husband mysteriously dies, although they show a scene where he starts to have leasions on his back. Is being there, the cause for them to slowly die from some kind of radiation? I dunno! Because she also mysteriously dies as well. But they clearly show at the end, that these Mormons like beings are aliens and they trick humans to go live at this house. And play mind experiments on them to be parents to these creatures, and eventually die to have the alien take them out like trash, and replace the Salesman at the office. Why?!?! What's the purpose (other than to have humans raise a alien child as a humanoid)?!? How has no one else found these houses?!? I dunno! The movie doesn't give more information than that! They just state it's an endless cycle, and that's it.I kinda liked it!! Minus the vague ending. My only odd gripe is Jesse Rosenberg, doesn't come off as someone who can play this character like how it should have been played. He is supposed to be a construction worker or electrician or something (since he has a ladder on his vehicle). But he just doesn't look like someone who would be in this profession.

The genetically engineered animals are bred to each other to create animal models of different human disease like autism, ALS, different types of cancer, kidney disease, etc. So, this was it! It was trying to convey that message. I am giving four stars for the idea, but since they even failed to keep me on board and their pup was a really unacceptable outcome, a mental disease presented in a negative shade, I even might come back and remove couple of the stars!

I thought the production value was great, and don't really understand others' comments about it being low-budget at all.I appreciated the opening sequence and thought it added a nice flavor of foreshadowing without ruining anything. Obviously some people need to be spoon-fed an idea in order to even get a movie like this at all. Despite the strong start and eerie setup to their predicament, they allllmost lost me at 28 minutes in when stuff starts to get really weird, but if you can handle the pitch out in to left field it does get better. Just don't be on the lookout for a happy ending. Definitely not a waste of time as some classify it. I would watch again honestly. **Spoilers ahead**Some have mentioned this movie should have been a short or a TV episode, however I thought it fit well into the 1 hr and 38 min runtime, and actually would have enjoyed a little deeper dive into what the couple felt and how they dealt with the initial arrival of their second package, as well as Tom's reaction to Gemma's discovery about the book and the boy's non-human qualities.The ending could have been a little stronger, but I did feel it wrapped up the story and didn't leave too much unanswered. It doesn't make sense, however, that there is one host life cycle just repeating itself, especially with the theory that this is the beginning of some alien takeover, even if there are multiple experiments or whatever going on at the same time. Why replace when you could replicate and populate? I would have liked to have seen how the man escaped the neighborhood in the car, maybe having the road in front of him lift up like the curb did, and an alternate ending idea could have been Gemma waking up to another baby being delivered to the house, maybe this time making it a girl?

No but seriously, this oddly timely film is a strong recommendation for me. EI would say my main criticism of this is that it tries to play it a bit too smart (cute) for its own good. There's a thin line between legitimately, intensely smart and a kind of Webster's defines... faux intelligence. The title (umm, do you know Latin??) broaches this territory as do some of the fiercely transparent metaphors.This film enters the metaphysical very quickly. Perhaps too early? I felt that way in the moment, but seeing how things play out, I feel it really works. And I don't care that the demon/quasi-satanic stuff is half-baked at best; that's weirdly kind of a positive for me, actually. Much of this movie is played out at face value. And since that face is the very definition of surreal, anything COULD happen next. The film, however, loses its sense of mystery in this regard, and that's undeniable.Vivarium isn't deep or hard to figure out. It's more horror than sci-fi, though it would devotees of the latter would likely balk at that. What it does and does very well is encapsulate a mood inside of a succinct and lovely visual style (sickening little clouds as they're described by Poots).

From here on, I grabbed my popcorn and looked forward for a rollercoaster. Sadly that is not what I got. Instead I got a dull boring movie if nothing. Absolutely nothing. I still cannot wrap my head around, how an director can make such an empty movie like this. It is slow and boring as hell. The kid is annoying and WHATEVER WOOF WOOF. The movie isn't exploring anything(I now it is limited in the area). Many weird and surreal things happen, that are just to random or abstract for the general viewer. The ending is cynical and leaves me with a lot of unanswered questions. I don't know what the director went for with this movie. Maybe it is a matter of perspective. I think this movie is mostly based on philosophical topics such as existentialism, Kafka's ideas, and so on. There are many metaphors and symbolism, that can be interpreted in many ways. Minimalistic in it's dialogue, for you to analyse them carefully. Visually It is great. The acting as well. Special effects are amateurish.

The last 20 minutes or so explain it very easily ..Vivarium features two worlds .. The first being ours .. We only get a glimpse of it at the beginning and end of the film where at first we meet Gemma and Tom, a thirtyish couple who seem to love each other very much .. our heroes for 90 minutes and very well portrayed by these two talented actors .. but very soon, a second little secret and bizarre world is introduced to us by Martin, who works at the realty company. This is where the entertainment starts - He shows them unit #9, a furnished condo style unit that is identical and attached to hundreds and hundreds of others, forming a little green community .. After some inspection of the condo, Tom and Gemma find that Martin has left in his car and disappeared .. Martin has planted them here for one simple reason: The SURVIVAL of his secret world .. He is the entrance to this world and like our own world, he has a life span .. He will have to be replaced either before or (spoiler) during his death ..The couple quickly learn that they cannot get out of their community and always end up back home at unit 9 .. someone secretly delivers food and picks up their garbage by the sidewalk .. Very quickly afterwards, they discover a box with a baby boy in it and the words Raise The Boy and You Will be released. printed on it .. We quickly figure that if they raise the child, they will find their way back to their real world .. WRONG ..We've all watched the movie here .. the boy grows incredibly quickly into a man .. he's definitely strange .. he repeatedly calls Gemma Mother, something she dislikes but she eventually shows him some love while lying with him one night when he goes to bed .. all part of the plan of life .. just like the real world .. this is just one of the metaphors used in unit 9 ..Tom becomes obsessed with digging a hole in the front lawn and almost lives in it until he discovers a body .. someone has been here before him and Genna .. there are many similarities between this secret community which is implanted in the real world .. survival, birth, life, love and most importantly, children who carry life on to another generation ..The strange boy becomes a man ready for just about any task and after Tom dies without any look of aging, so does Gemma .. the boy/man has supplied them both with body bags and thrown them into the pit that Tom dug in the last half of the movie .. he then fills and flattens the large hole and suddenly grass covers the scar on the front lawn .. He and Martin are both a part of the cycle here .. the cycle that keeps this creepy little life force alive .. Somehow the boy/man knows Martin is dying and pours some gas from a hidden gas can into Tom and Gemma's car and drives out of the community straight to the realty office where Martin is close to death in his chair .. The boy/man promptly takes Martin's name tag off and pins it to his own shirt pocket, slides him into a body bag, stuffs him into a large file drawer and sits in his new office, smiling. He's ready to start his new career; Making certain that he can create one more cycle of life in his insane world .. and he sees success as a young couple walks into his office and starts looking at the pictures of the little green condo community ..I absolutely loved this movie ... Martin is the gateway to this insane little alternative reality and he ages extremely fast (Reason why Tom and Genna both die in less than a couple of years without aging if you watch the growth chart of the boy/man on the white pillar in unit 9) .. Martin's sole purpose on earth is to replace himself with a new man that is raised as a baby (Don't ask where the baby comes from as this is Sci Fi ..) by a normal couple that he lures and locks into unit #9 and when the baby is able and ready to replace him, he does so, and repeats another cycle like the dead Martin did by simple repetition ...How a lot of what happens in this alternative space is clearly left up to the viewer .. Best left alone as it is the real entertainment .. And I thought it was GREAT .. but the cycle of survival to unit #9 is SO OBVIOUS .. It makes me wonder if many of you aren't paying attention, especially to the ending ...

Moreover, this movie describes human life as a foolish tragedy: we live just to raise our children. Once they have become autonomous, our existence makes no longer sense. The only thing we can do is die. Seriously? Come on, this is too exaggerated.At least, the man's behavior is consistent with its character: he spends all his time by digging in the hope of finding a way out. The mum's mother instinct is sometimes high, sometimes understandably non-existent. Should we interpret this as if fathers don't have any aptitude for family life and mothers are there just to feed us? Again, seriously?Now I try to neglect the moral of this story.

I really like some of his more out there type of movies with a few being some of his most underrated but also being some of my all time favorite movies ( The Double, America Ultra.) Eisenberg and Imogen Poots bring their A Game to what is basically a two man horror show with some big laughs and some even bigger scares.

But it's concept is quite Nightmarish! :o"}, {"id": 740, "text": "Film: Vivarium Year: 2019 Director: Lorcan Finnegan Writer: Garret Shanley Starring: Imogen Poots, Jesse Eisenberg and Senan JenningsReview:This was a film that when the trailer was shown before quite a few movies that I saw with Jaime, I knew that I wanted to see it. With the pandemic and the Gateway Film Center being closed, I was bummed that I wouldn't get the chance to see this on the big screen. When I saw it was on VOD, I checked in with the lady to see if she was interested. We did give it a watch and I heard another podcast host briefly cover this as well. I've also given it a second viewing to see where it would land for my end of year list. The synopsis is a young couple looking for the perfect home find themselves trapped in a mysterious labyrinth-like neighborhood of identical houses.Now this movie has a creepy scene of seeing a bird's nest. There's one that is bigger than the others and it slowly pushes them out. We see that this bird grows to be larger than the mother that comes back.It then shifts to inside of a classroom. The teacher is Gemma (Imogen Poots) and the children are pretending to be trees as the wind blows around them. Outside, the children are being picked up by their parents and there's a young girl Molly (Molly McCann). She's looking at the dead birds. Seeing them is upsetting and Gemma tries to give a bit of a lesson about how nature can be cruel at times. It is here that I learned it was the cuckoo bird that does this and the girl is sent on when her mother calls. There's then a kind of funny scene where Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) messes with her. They're dating and in the market for a new house.The couple goes to an office for a development called Yonder. They meet Martin (Jonathan Aris) who wants to take them to a unit to show them around. Gemma doesn't really care for the models and Tom really doesn't want to go. Martin is quite convincing and gets them to check it out.There's something off about Martin, but he is nice. Tom keeps making sarcastic comments and Gemma is doing what she can to make it less awkward. Things take a turn though when Martin disappears. The couple tries to leave, but no matter which turns they make, they end back up at Unit 9. They decide to stay the night and the next morning, Tom uses his ladder to climb up to the roof. What he finds is chilling. There's no end to the development in sight. There's something not right about the sun or the clouds.Tom then makes a drastic decision, but no matter what he does, it doesn't make a difference. That next morning is when they find a box with a baby inside. There's writing on an inner flap stating if they take care of it, they'll be able to go. Much like where they're trapped, there's something not right about this child and Tom continues to try to find a way out.This is where I want to leave it, as I don't really want to spoil the movie. I do think there's a lot to unravel here. Something interesting about this movie is that we don't get a definite answer. I did look up an interview to find that the director, Lorcan Finnegan, as well as the writer Garret Shanley. According to them they did this on purpose. They do like the different concepts and theories that have come up. I have incorporated some from them what I think into my interpretation here as well.I'm also going to try to do this without spoilers. There will be a section at the end as well as a review on my podcast Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast where I'll delve into this as well. The first thing is that the opening scene of this bird nest is quite important. All I'll say here is that the boy they have to raise is like the cuckoo in that, he drives a wedge between them and takes over their lives. I also feel there's a bit of sucking the energy from his 'parents'. The longer they are there, the more haggard they look.It was interesting to read that this story was inspired by housing developments that popped up in Ireland right before the economic collapse that happened in the late 2000s. This does translate well over to the United States, where I'm from, in the fact that we've been seeing these since I believe the 1970's. Heck, this is part of the concept for the original Poltergeist. These houses are pretty much carbon copy of each other as it cuts down on costs and drives up profit margins.Going from this, there's a bit of creature feature in this movie. We first get introduced to it with Tom while he is digging. He hears a creature faintly and thinks that if he keeps digging, he'll find it. The boy is watching things on television that are in black and white, with an eerily similar noise emanating from it. When he gets older and is portrayed by Eanna Hardwicke. He comes home with a book with similar images from the television. There's a scene with the boy and Gemma where he mimics this sound and it legit chilled me to the bone. It is one of the scariest parts for sure.The last thing I want to talk about when it comes to the story here without spoilers is that we can clearly see they're living in a world that looks like ours, but it isn't right. The houses are all beige. There's no real color. All of the food they eat is similar to what we do, but it is bland and flavorless. The art in the house is just paintings of the room it is in or the outside of the house. The sun isn't right and the clouds look fake. It is just being in a world that is a mimic, but doesn't have the heart that humanity brings. The boy doesn't really know how to convey emotions either. He asks and inquires about them, but we can see he doesn't really understand.To shift this over to the pacing of the movie, I've heard a lot of people saying this should have been 40 minutes like an episode of something like The Twilight Zone. I do get that, where although I did like it, I do feel that it is a bit long. The movie runs 98 minutes, where I legit think that getting this down to 90 and probably even closer to 85 might have tightened it up. I come in with this as the movie doesn't really give us a definite ending and it does get a bit repetitive. I like the open-ended aspect where I can make my own conclusions, but if that's the case, I think it should be trimmed then.What didn't disappoint was the acting. Poots is really the star here. I've been a fan of her for awhile and it is interesting as she doesn't do a lot. I don't think I've seen her in a bad role aside from Black Christmas from 2019. I don't necessarily blame her there though. She has the most depth here and really makes you question what you would do. Eisenberg is interesting as he pushes her humanity and she is saddened by the rift that comes between them. I thought his sarcasm adds to his character for sure. Jennings, Aris and Hardwicke were all solid. There's something off about them all and it really made me feel uncomfortable for sure. I'd say that overall the acting for this movie was good.Taking this to the effects, we don't really get a lot to be honest. I love how they made this set feel like we're in something like The Truman Show. We know there's something off about it, but here we don't really know what it means. Most of the effects seemed to be done practical, which is always a good thing for me. If there is some CGI, it was seamless. They do have some really good cinematography and the use of color late in the movie is great to signify different things. The devoid of color for most of it makes sense as well.The last thing to go over would be the soundtrack. We get a few indie songs that I had never heard of, but I really like their sound. It brings an interesting vibe to the movie and just fit for what they needed. I'd legit consider adding these to my playlists. The rest of it also fit and helped to enhance the scenes they were used.Now with that said, I really liked the concept of the movie and the story they're presenting us. We get some interesting social commentary here that I can appreciate. I thought the acting was good across the board with Poots taking the lead. The effects we get, the use and not using of color was strategic. We get a solid little soundtrack. I'd have to say that this is a good movie and one that I would like to check out again. It really made me uneasy feeling and I'd actually recommend this to horror and non-horror fans alike as well. SPOILERS:What I wanted to delve into here is what I think this movie is about. We have Martin who needs to bring a couple to a house in order to raise another child like him. They grow quite fast, make a loud screaming sounds that are annoying and really just mimics his 'parents'. As I said above, he is driving a wedge between Gemma and Tom. I also think this is an allegory for young couples having children before they're ready. Tom is kind of a jerk here and rejects the child flat out. Because he sees it as a creature, he is willing to starve it until it dies. I guess you could see this as an abortion of sorts. Gemma isn't prepared, but she feels a kinship to it as time goes on and can't just let it die. I feel this is the other side of Tom.The boy is a monster though. We get an odd scene where Tom throws a cigarette down and the artificial grass disappears. He starts to dig. Because this world isn't quite right, his body bruises and the food he's eating aren't giving him the actual nutrition that he needs. He breaks down and wastes away. The constant digging doesn't help. He does find something in the hole and I think that it is a former occupant of the house. Like the cuckoo does, the boy is taking the life away from these two people until he's ready to go into the world. What I did pick up on from a podcaster in passing is that this is also an allegory for capitalism. The body that Tom finds is his own and through work he's digging his own grave."}, {"id": 741, "text": "'Vivarium' was a delightful sci-fi horror, a macabre version of 'Groundhog Day'.

I can normally get on with a film that might be a bit cynical, but the underlying allegory in Vivarium felt a bit basic and a little too miserable to enjoy.The movie sees Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg play a couple who, on the hunt for a new house, go with a strange realtor to an even stranger neighbourhood for a showing. Once they arrive, the realtor disappears and they find themselves trapped in the pale-green, suburban nightmare. If that wasn't bad enough, they soon find a baby in a box that rapidly ages into one of the most annoying little brats I've ever seen in a movie.Eisenberg's not my favourite actor, some movies I've really enjoyed him in, others he's almost insufferable. Thankfully, he doesn't really fall into either category here and just sort of cruises along while Imogen Poots does all the good bits. In fact, if it wasn't for Poots' performance, I think this would've been far less watchable, especially since it's pretty obvious what's to come as soon as you see Senan Jennings' character for the first time.Jennings plays the kind of creepy, but mostly annoying, kid that Poots and Eisenberg are forced to raise. I can get past the shaky acting in some scenes because he's just a kid, but the multiple bouts of screaming were too much for me. One thing I will say, I didn't think I'd ever enjoy seeing a grown man body-slam a child, but there's something Vivarium's good for.The logistics of how the movie's cyclical events unfold are all well and good, but there's no explanation as to why they're trapped there and being forced to raise this inhuman child. I think the film's too focused on getting the allegory across that it forgets to explain itself sometimes where it probably should.You can work out where the film's going long before it even thinks about coming to an end, but it's surreal and intriguing enough to still be watchable. There's not much payoff which is unfortunate, but I'd say this is still worth the watch. One scene I did enjoy was when Poots chased the now-grownup version of the kid under the curb - the way he scampered away was pretty creepy and it really fit the surreal tone of the film."}, {"id": 750, "text": "Not the most pacey of sci-fi movies but, hey, it's kind of a thriller. Very well shot. Plot is fine. Acting was good. For dystopian film lovers such as I it works. And afterwards can make you wonder what would I do?.

I mean, they made it pretty clear that this situation is inescapable. It makes sense for the story, of course, that they weren't the only people drawn into this and they wouldn't be the last. It's implied that whatever it holding them captive is some kind of alien life form that relies on another species (humans) to raise its young. It's a good premise.Still, the ending has left me in a bit of a sour mood. I don't know, it might have been na\u00efve of me to expect this mostly bleak movie to have a happy ending.

They are simply discarded when their function is ended."}, {"id": 762, "text": "The film shows us the behavior of cuckoo chicks. Beside undeniable similarities, the story of the film is somewhat different.Here, a couple is taken hostage in a world that defies the laws of physics to some degree. The whole point is that the couple is to rise the offspring of some unknown species. The offspring obviously has the desire to imitate, but it doesn't seem to understand the human behavior sometimes. The offspring is eventually raised to a level that allows it to enter human society and recruit more potential parents for more offspring.The beauty of this film is not that we get shown some fancy alien world, but instead everything seems familiar but actually isn't. Food does not have taste, clouds look too much like clouds, walking towards the sun always takes you back to your own house, etc. Things are only slightly off, which just adds to the insanity.In spite of its low budget the film is well done. We get to experience the growing insanity of the couple. Imogen Poots gives a solid performance. Jesse Eisenberg is great as usual when he plays a slightly unlikable character.

For me, it's slightly a hit. Some things worked well, and others things didn't work so well. A lot people dislike Vivarium, and I can see why, it's not exactly an enthusiastic movie; it tries to break down the audience. And I think they did a fairly well job at making the audience feel the same moods as the characters.The story is really good in the first act; there's a lot of interesting and confusing things that happen. Then the plot the slows down and focuses on the characters, and that's where the plot loses me. It got boring because the pacing was so slow compared to the first act. Vivarium also has one of those endings where it's profound and delivers a message. But the ending was very predictable because of the whole loop plot that has been done so many times by now. Vivarium does have some replay value because there's a lot of great foreshadowing, for example, the TV looping is a metaphor to the looping plot.The acting was also very surprising. I first thought that the acting was going to be subpar, but it was solid. Jesse Eisenberg delivered an okay performance, but Imogen Poots was the real star of the show. And because of the acting being so good, it actually makes Vivarium watchable, because without the great performances, Vivarium would seem like a cheap YouTube movie.Vivarium had a great concept, but the interest was seriously lacking after the first act. The pacing is fairly slow and it gets boring real quick. But the acting really makes Vivarium stand up. Vivarium isn't one of those movies where it's a must watch; no one is going to miss out on anything important by not watching this movie."}, {"id": 764, "text": "That was weird and kind of long and I wanted more of an explanation at the end, but still it had a great mood and great acting.

The other actors were really great too, but extremely bizarre.Anyways, I rating this movie a 10, for how strange and bizarre it was, but I would not want to watch it again."}, {"id": 766, "text": "Loved this movie during the first half and was going to recommend it to my friends. Finished the movie and I can't recommend it.Jessie Eisenberg's already brittle voice gets weaker and weaker toward the end. This is not an artistic choice of an actor--he just has the same creaky, weak voice in every movie.Many things are left unexplained in the movie. -Where do these realtors come from? -Why in the movie does Imogen Poots walk like a man and dance like a man, what does this mean? -What is the house made of? -Why are the clouds cloud-shaped?The ending was unsatisfying. Many reviewers have said that it lacks meaning. I don't know what the meaning is, but my biggest gripe is that it was unsatisfying. Throughout the movie I wanted more and more for somebody to kill that thing. Then at the end, the thing kills all the characters and we can see that it starts the cycle again with a fresh crop. (spoiler alert)Interestingly, halfway through the movie I almost turned it off because I liked the movie so much (this has never happened). Unfortunately I watched it till the end and was hit in the face with a huge disappointment.In conclusion, the weakest parts of the movie are: 1. Jessie Eisenberg's strained acting (he's not cut out to be an actor because of his weak voice) 2. The middle through ending, where we see all the main character's actions being futile and even counterproductive (Jessie digs his own grave for most of the movie; I never saw that coming, probably many others did. (spoiler alert))The strongest parts of the movie are: 1. It's a beautiful movie, all the houses are color coordinated. 2. The acting from the bad guy...especially the first evil realtor Martin. That was AMAZING acting and I've never seen anything like it. Martin was played by Jonathan Aris, and he was the BEST part of the movie. 3. This movie is Kafkaesque, plain and simple. I used to love Kafka and Kafkaesque stories.

This makes sense, and I think it's a reasonable direction for the movie to go based on its premise. But while the first half is *fun*, the second half is very much not, and that feels like a bit of a bait and switch.The movie is also, at an hour and a half, too long. It's basically an extended Twilight Zone episode that takes one concept and explores it. There aren't really twists per se, we never learn much about this world, we just see how these people's lives unfold in this bizarre situation.Ultimately I'm torn between rating this 6 or 7, since parts of it are quite good.

The latter proved to be an entertaining and thoughtful parable in the atmospheric and thematic traditions of The Twilight Zone, yet not without its flaws and misses.Vivarium is almost entirely based on a metaphor/s, a parable of an often-used theme, a story that knows what it wants to say but, despite a nice flow of inventiveness, can't keep it consistently substantial. The vert first minutes, the intro sequence, heavily foreshadows what ideas are to follow without even using any characters yet. Later on, there are points where the commentary is perhaps too obvious and spoon-fed. Rushed-in family-hood, the challenges of parenthood, ownership and more similar ideas are presented and worked into a dystopian, lab-rat-like environment. There's a decent dose of humor injected in it as well, the more grim kind. The movie plays off its cast's content and realistic little performances, a top-notch, eye-pleasing production design and various atmosphere-setting devices, trying to be an intriguing survival drama that's swimming around the surface while continuously hinting on a something deeper. The deeper never truly comes. Vivarium succeeds at being a drawn-out episode of what could be an anthology horror series, but as a full feature it lacks additional components. For the most part, it is enough with the presented themes, the distressing and messed up character's new routine and the fantastic, mysterious elements surrounding it, but... Vivarium has got style, but half-way through it slowly ceases to be enough &amp; as a climax we receive... even more style. Basically, as far as atmosphere, special effects and indie arthouse creativity goes, Vivarium is a great little flick worth seeing, but chances of eventual underwhelment are there.For anyone who loves oddball indies, mysterious concepts, metaphors, borderless creepiness and what people call Twilight Zone-esque, Vivarium is a journey worth taking.

I hope people with more rational minds can ignore the cancel culture reviews, use better judgement as to whether this film is worth their time or money and give equally fair reviews.That being said, I've given this a 7 (a 'good' but not 'great' in my personal estimation, your mileage may vary) and recommend this highly to lovers of noir fantasy/science fiction parables, or bleak social commentary framed in a Carrollian/Kafka-esque/David Lynch set-up. Many others, like me, may probably like, enjoy or appreciate it to varying degrees, but shouldn't 'hate' it.The two leads (Eisenberg and Poots) are quite up to the demands their predicament puts on them, and show a varied range of emotions and states. The supporting child actor, however, gives me the willies! If that wasn't his normal voice I was hearing, his mannerisms, posture and acting were still scarily on-point. (If that was his voice, however, his career should skyrocket.) As a 'family' their dynamic is both an exaggerated mirror of modern unprepared families, as well as a starkly portrayed descent into madness.Set design and overall production quality was obviously low-budget but very effective nonetheless. It perfectly evokes the subliminal nausea that modern suburbia often instills. You are asked to pay more attention to the tasteless food, the cookie cutter clouds and the pictures on the walls to better understand the complete lack of emotion or creativity of the antagonists, how completely different a species they are.The script is the only thing I knock a point off for. While it didn't do anything 'wrong', per se, I can agree with some reviewers that maybe, just maybe, some kind of clarification, exposition or slightly less bleak ending would make it more palatable to a much wider audience, but then we would be as remiss as if we asked Picasso to paint the whole face, or Jackson Pollock to join some of the dots up and give us a clue...

I don't want to put any spoilers in this comment, but the ending is specifically made as it is so that the viewer his or her mind has an opportunity to shift to another place. Not many will be able to experience it, but I surely did and so it clicked.When I finished watching the movie, and I had watched it late at night in a totally dark room but the television screen, I must say I felt pretty empty, but a bit later, laying in bed, something shifted... suddenly the part of me that lives through identifying with this empty, life-draining, stuckness routine the movie portrays, just dropped away... and I came into a tranquil state where all the worries related to this (silly) prison-like life fell away and left me feel very free in fact.Would the script have given more explanations, and therefore being less open, surely my mind would have taken that information and place it somewhere in its framework so that life is explained and I would stay stuck in that mindset.This is TRUE ART!!

It means you're never sure what is around the corner and you are in the same boat as the characters where everything is new and confusing. I also like these types of movies because it gives the characters so much room to wiggle in. How screenwriters portray their characters reaction to this scenario is crucial. 'Vivarium' does a really good job of this. Both of the lead characters are fascinating to watch as they handle the situation in their own unique ways. While it may not have stuck the landing as well as I would've hoped, this is still a very good film.The scenes before the events begin to happen in this film are crucial, where we meet our main characters and see what they are like in normal life. Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg had a surprising amount of chemistry. Their acting skills are on full display throughout the film in fact. Poots in particular impressed me. She is a very watchable young actress. I also loved how creepy the film seemed capable of making a character. Both 'Martin' early in the film and also the young child that is in the film for a long period were crafted really well in that respect.The film's let-down is probably the ending. I don't envy the screenwriter's job of having to tie it all up nicely into a bow. Interestingly the ending he went with was an exact scenario that I ran through my mind as being the ending early in the film, not that I'm calling the film predictable, just that it made sense.

This is either a sign of a brilliant film or of one so stupid that people don't believe it was just that.To me, it was a fast forward through the story of a couple that want a child and a simple life, then realize what a horrible mistake they've made when that child sucks the life out of them and moves on without a care. But that's just me. The creators admit this is an extended version of an idea they had when they were making a short, so if you feel it takes to long to get anywhere it's also because of that and not only because you are an information junkie trapped in your own little tasteless world.Bottom line: it kind of pulls you in and keeps the tension going, mainly through the actors doing a very good job expressing the emotions of the trapped couple.

Vivarium is a strange yet compelling story about a couple who are lured into a labyrinth like neighbourhood of identical houses by an odd real estate agent with otherworldly motives. What lies beneath this wildly uneasy premise is a pessimistic allegory on the suburban life cycle. The downright bizarre nature of the films narrative does inevitably spawn complications in terms of plot, and the conscious decision to not reveal answers towards the resolution has the potential to alienate its viewers. However, the film does invite audiences to engage in conversation and to speculate theories on what it all meant. I love how the film trusts our imagination to fill in the gaps while still feeling complete for what it was trying to achieve.What really stands out is the world in which the film creates. The uniquely mundane production design and attention to diegetic reality assists in creating a dread inducing atmosphere. The mind bending dream logic adds to the feeling of hopelessness and isolation. This is also accomplished through the Stylistic choices in editing and cinematography.I found the role of Jesse Eisenberg's character to be a somewhat refreshing detour from his usual annoying antics and Imogen Poots really steals the show with her gut wrenching performance. I have read reviews criticising the concept to be in the likes of black mirror or a twilight episode and is much rather suited for a 30 minute short, which is fair enough but a 30 minute duration just wound't do the film justice. I preferred the slow building of tension and unraveling of plot. Most importantly I was invested throughout the entire runtime.Ultimately Vivarium is a very creative experiment on the human condition and does provoke thought with its outlandish ideas. Its difficult to express my opinion without spoiling the movie, I will recommend movie-goers to go into the film blind and refrain from watching the trailer or reading into the synopsis. It will for sure divide audiences and is by no means for everyone."}, {"id": 846, "text": "Vivarium is a good film and I can recommend it to people who might enjoy a more colder and cynical approach to life.I had only two major complaints about this film, sometimes it is too literal and tries too hard to explain what it is doing, and the acting is not always that good.Other than that it was good, maybe I enjoyed it a little more than other reviewers because it is more relatable to my perception of life, who knows.Anyway, it cleary is not as horrible as people say and it is far from being called a waste of time.Do you ever think about your life as a line on the axis of coordinates? Do you ever think about how your life is shaped by what the society and your close ones expect from you? Do you ever think about your legacy?

I don't think it's a fantastic movie or something, i would prefer a darker surreal tone if that's what they wanted to make.

I'd imagine most people if placed in a situation like this, would react exactly how Eisenberg plays his character.I don't have much more to say other than that I was engaged the entire time.

I thought Jesse Eisennburg just didn't fit the role...he's just too goofy to really convey terror as an actor IMO. Imogen did a lot better IMO. Also, aesthetically, some of the presentation was a little heavy-handed.That being said, overall, I really liked the movie. For me, it's an allegory about Society with a capital S in all it's abstractness and impersonalness. And the suburbs are the perfect representation of that.....the 'alien' force in the movie represents Society as an abstract, impersonal, top-down weight on the individual which doesn't really care about what makes the individual an individual, but rather only views the individual as a fungible entity that needs to fuel society and civilization's incessant reproduction, even when it doesn't actually serve the individual human beings it uses as fodder. The alien or monster in the movie just wants any warm body to play the part by following the typical path, i.e. move to the suburbs, raise a child, and then die and be discarded. The elite at the top of society that control housing, food, healthcare etc. just want to keep the illusion of life perpetuated, even when upon a closer inspection, it really has a deep disdain for real human beings and just sees them as a means to an end, not an end in themselves.That's also what the son/child represents. Its existence and presence is forced onto the couple, and the child's alienation from the parents represents the alienation inherent in the social life and the generational gap within the inorganic communities of the suburb/shopping mall/corporate office cycle of life etc.To summarize: the movie starts with a hopeful, romantic young couple looking to purchase their own home....but when they enter the suburb real estate office, the company representatives just see prey, not real human beings, and the couple is immediately thrust into the terror of being just a cog in the machine."}, {"id": 852, "text": "This is a brilliant piece of work but nihilistic, and people need to be prepared for the horror they are about to see.The opening certainly offers more than foreshadowing. it is the film.Reading some reviews and ratings it seems some people don't get this movie, or refuse to, are emotionally contra prepared to.This movie is about the terror of existence.

A young couple named Tom and Gemma (excellent performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots) are looking for their forever-home. Tom is a landscaper and Gemma is a school-teacher. They are brought to a brand-new housing estate called Yonder by a strange salesman - strange is actually an understatement. Yonder is typical suburbia. But it looks weird. The houses - hundreds of them - are meticulously placed and clones of one other. They are painted a green colour that lends them a further surreal quality. Gemma and Tom are shown around the house. Again, it is your typical suburban home, but this fella is far from your typical salesman! He freaks them out, so the couple call it a day and go to leave - just after they go out into the garden and come back inside to find the salesman is gone. They get lost trying to drive out of the estate. Every road leads them back to the house they were viewing. Then the car runs out of petrol and they are stranded... worse is yet to come, when a baby is left at their doorstep, with instructions to raise the child, in order to be released.Young Senan Jennings officially portrays the creepiest and most annoying child to ever grace the screen! What a performance. The sense of dread and the feeling of being watched carries throughout the film, very well directed by Irish director Lorcan Finnegan. As mentioned earlier, Eisenberg and Poots are excellent and do well conveying the sense of complete anguish and bewilderment that their characters face. Yonder looks amazing; a surreal nightmare of meticulous driveways and lawns, under a dreamlike sky with strange clouds. I loved that aspect of the film, along with the metaphors; ultimately, the film is about the milestone step in a relationship when a couple commit to a home together, and with the fear of parenthood hanging over them, and whether or not they want to go down that road or not.

The plot starts with a young couple approaching a real estate salesmen to ask about buying a first home. Apparently the couple has never had an independent thought before, because they seem totally disinterested in getting a suburban home before meeting this guy yet they go along fully with the over the top-weird salesmen who just stares at them, makes weird noises, and then suddenly declares I'm selling you this home now and the couple just shrugs and agrees to buy the property despite zero discussion.Now it starts to get really ugly. The director clearly wants/tries to pivot the movie into a horror/surreal drama once the salesmen suddenly runs away after dropping them off at the home. So the couple then launch into some of the most unbelievable dialogue and poor acting I've seen in recent memory. They try to leave the community, and after driving down one street and getting lost the man freaks out and acts like they've been stranded for days and screams at his wife as he demands to drive out of there himself. His emotional breakdown is so sudden and undeserved I just cracked up laughing. And because of the terrible cinematography and editing choices we never get to feel like this moment is authentic escape from anything. A crappy drone montage tries to show them driving against a inescapable suburban maze but it's shot with the same two blocks rotating around and then cutting to a bland shot of the two in their car, so we never feel any tension or belief that they are actually stuck in this surreal maze and not just being idiots.The rest of the movie is 1 hour of tedious dialogue, little tension, and laughably try-hard attempts at intellectual symbolism around a message that modernity is an inescapable hell full of fake people, fake communities, and alienated families toiling purposely in a consumer society.I'd rate the movie a 3 but the point of the movie the director attempted to covey is so poorly done that I decided on a 2, not even mentioning that the message itself is a dumb sophomoric take on life. Director needs to realize most people over 30 move to suburbs for a reason: ie they are affordable places to enjoy a easy going life of family, saftey, privacy and leisure. Reminds me of when I was angsty about modern life/capitalism/traditional lifestyles when I was in college and thought everyone in the suburbs was secretly drowning and miserable when really it was mostly just me.TLDR: a bad CGI satire of suburban community with dumb writing and little dramatic tension.

But its slowness is intentional and effective, so long as the audience recognizes that the film is not a bloody horror with jump scares, or a thriller that will keep your heart beating, or a dark comedy that will tinge your sadness with laughter. It is a film driven by the gut-churning performance of Eisenberg and Poots, whose fracturing relationship anchors the emotional turmoil central to this film. We are misled to hope that the relationship will flourish, even in that lonely dismal house and forced to raise a seemingly unlovable child. But the true horror of this film is that, for all their trying, the partners cannot learn to love themselves or each other again. It seems many viewers have missed this point. The audience is given plenty of time to meditate on all the tragically subtle, surreal moments in this film, and to feel the dread that slowly creeps into the protagonists futile lives, destroying them. The film is a warning. We, of course, will die as well, and many of us live similar lives, much of which we were pressured to live or didn't choose at all. We are encouraged, even in the face of a slow, creeping kind of terror, to remember that what we love most might still be with us, and even if it isn't, we should try our hardest not to become lost to ourselves.

It's true, a few scenes could have been trimmed, and some important reveals are passed over too quickly, but overall the pacing and length of the film are acceptable. While Eisenb is competent enough (I imagine he can choose to be in any film he wants) his performance is muted and he doesn't really shine. Maybe this is a director thing. Poots, on the other hand, is amazing, well worth watching the film just to see her performance as she goes down into the depths of her soul. She has a wider role to play than Eisenb and she is the star of the show. Reminiscent of Dogville or Cube with their minimalist sets, the setting for Vivarium also provides a chilling canvas against which the characters are seen to strugggle. There is little distraction from the inner turmoil. Categorizing this pan-European production (you know the film is going to be different when you see the opening credits and who was involved in making it) is not easy. The genre 'comedy' as appears in IMDB is whimsical to say the least. Sci-fi/drama, though horror - not in a traditional sense- could also be used.

If you didn't spend your whole life under a rock, this one will be an injection of Zs."}, {"id": 868, "text": "Vivarium has some of the widest range of interpretations and feelings towards a movie I have ever seen, the only other one I can think of that is similar in it's opinions and interpretations is Zardoz or even Midsommar, all of these films baffle people, but explain themselves within their own context relatively well. Go read them yourself! Some people think it is a critique of traditional family roles, some think it critiques capitalism, and others interpretation of how animals feel(which if you've kept animals, it is absurd to ascribe human emotions and thoughts to them, though to certainly have feelings, they are different), the list goes on and on. I would argue that people think the movie is about these things, because they believe them and are transferring it into the film(I can say this pretty authoritatively, I have read actual interviews with the director, go look him up in a search engine, you'll see), not because it is actually the message of the film, much like an obtuse, but provocative painting. It seems to have a fairly straight-forward message, but because of how it is presented, I suppose, people keep putting their own ideas into it.As one can see from the reviews, some people hate Vivarium, some love it, some are indifferent but appreciate it's artistic aspirations. All of this makes Vivarium the best indie artistic film to come out in recent years. Despite it's straightforward message(as seen in interviews with the director), because of it's high-art aspirations, it is truly is a case where you decide what the movie is to you and whether it's good(I'm not implying the movie has a non-message and no message, it does as already stated), but it utilizes surrealism, and I would argue expressionism as well, to great effects.I only really enjoyed the first half, I found the second half morbidly exhausting and very unsatisfying, though I see it's appeal to some, I suppose this actually the point the director was attempting to make by the end; what is it all for? I can't say I want more answers or not, I don't know what more I would want from this film or story to be honest. I think it resolves it, tells a complete story, and ties up it's threads pretty neatly, but that doesn't make it any less baffling in some of it's choices. There is no doubt it is exceptionally well-made, calling this movie bad is lazy, it is not bad in any way, you may not like it, but that doesn't make it bad, it means you don't personally like it.While I'm not sure i actually like the film, I found it sad, disturbing, and intriguing at times, well-crafted to a T, well-written, great set designs, well-directed, beautiful cinematography great acting by all, and good sound; all across the board well made. I do believe this is a film I will remember in 5yrs, it is quite unique for better or worse. Given it's technical proficiency, it's shortcoming for most people is it's lack of explanations, but is this really a shortcoming? Or is this more indicative of a person's likes and dislikes in storytelling? If it were to wrap things up with a tidy explanation, explain how that would make this exact story better?Let's say it had a more straightforward narrative, would that enhance the story being told, or would it make it even more obvious, hamfisted, and irritating? It is already a bit heavy handed in it's delivery, given it's early analogy of the cuckoo bird, do we really need to make it more belittling to the viewer? Because of the approach the film makers took with this premise, it was likely the best option to explain only what was actually pertinent to the plot, merely leave clues and symbolism that we can piece together ourselves for the rest, and there is definitely enough symbolism here to work out your own answers(if you want the obvious answers look up interviews with the director, he spells it out). It doesn't come across as lazy writing, it is clearly done with painstaking detail and attention, so that is absolutely not the case here.While $4,000,000 is low-budget when compared to a Hollywood film, I regularly review films costing several hundred or a few thousand to make, most people call those micro or no-budget though. Go read my other reviews if you somehow think my review is fake. A review you disagree with does not make it fake.Vuvarium is totally worth watching, but if you have a hard time with unanswered questions, or movies that are more allegorical, surreal, or expressionistic in nature, you will likely struggle through this and hate it. If your idea of the best film ever is a Marvel Movie, Disney, or Transformers, why are you even looking at this film? You will hate it, it truly is a piece of art, for better or worse.God Bless ~Amy"}, {"id": 869, "text": "I personally liked this film, quite a lot actually.

The film is just too strange and bizarre for the casual viewer, so if you are one of them, maybe give this one a skip. If you are a more in depth viewer, and more specifically like thrillers and strange movies that don't answer all the questions like Donnie darko and the lighthouse, you might like this film. And the final person who might like this film are those just looking for an experiment piece. I'm sure a film student would love this film to death.

I would challenge any viewer to work with the details and revelations given piecemeal throughout the narrative to create anything more captivating or satisfying. The film rarely bores from start to finish and every insight into the mystery before them feels as though it raises another question in its wake.The majesty of this film is in its callous disregard to the viewer.

I had never heard of the movie but it was new and looked different and creative. First of all I need to say this was a sci-fi thriller missing any real horror elements. There were many missed opportunities for a darker turn into the horror realm but I feel the producers were going for a different vibe. It was not scary however it was weird and interesting. I'd say for the most part the movie had a great concept but ultimately was produced before it had time to properly simmer in the brainstorm of the writers and become balanced. I liked the eerie style and loved the use of color. It reminded me of the classic days of Tim Burton films before Disney ruined him and let CGI rule his movies. Overall the movie has a lot of build up but the climax comes crashing down to an abrupt stop just as things are starting to be revealed. The film's arc was bent in a way that there was so much slow build up then suddenly too many things happening at once. Before we could indulge in all the crazy new twists the characters give up and we are left with so many questions.Vivarium was a captivating title and it perfectly describes the couples experience. I had never heard of the word so I had to look it up. If it weren't for the opening bird sequence the movie would have left even more loose ends. Some people like movies with a bit more mystery (Donnie Darko Theatrical vs Director Cut). I want an explanation of the why, when, and how because so many of those details are completely left out like the director expects us to not ask these important questions. I read one review that gave this a 9/10 and they were clearly full of their own BS.

Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg are a young couple looking for their first house when they come across a seemingly idyllic community. They soon discover their fortunes have changed drastically.What starts out as an intriguing mystery with funny clouds eventually devolves into a monotonous and achingly vacant story of imprisonment in an endless maze. Although the idea itself is not at fault, its execution most certainly is. For a film that chooses to be such an ordeal, there is quite a lot that is never fleshed out. There is a fair chance you will make it to the end wondering what the whole point of it actually was. Is it a tutorial on the challenges of young parenthood? A case study on Stockholm syndrome? A horror story on the housing market? It's anyone's guess as to what this film is even about. But searching for any concrete meaning here might be just as foolish as the protagonists' decisions.

Without the typical scare thing (things that pop out, people react, whatever). Just creepy. You've probably read the plot already, no need to recap. Kind of like a demented Truman show.While I've never been a big Eisenberg fan (there's just something quirky about him to me) he was good in this (and his Zombie flicks). Funny that this role almost went to Corey Feldman. Whoa.For me, the kid (Senan Jennings) and the 1st realtor (Jonathan Aris) steal this movie. The kid is so darned creepy. No Damien, No Linda Blair Exorcist, no Children of the Damned - those were gimmicky and pretty silly by today's standards of scary kids. This kid and the way they wrote him and the way he delivered his lines and did his VOICES was superb to me. So 'OFF' that it was guaranteed to rub one's scary spot without the splatter. It was such a great casting decision.The 1st Realtor, in a very different way, also had a similar vibe, but he was more robotic. Normally not good. But here, it was a great touch. Saying stuff and acting in a manner that just didn't fit in the normal world worked beautifully here. Between the kid and the realtor being weird and the 2 main characters being pretty normal, it created a great juxtaposition.There were some things that would've been nice to explain (the TV, the book) but BECAUSE they remained a mystery, it ADDED to the story in my opinion.If I had to cite one 'miss' it would be for the grown boy. He acted a bit sinister where he really shouldn't have. After all, the first realtor wasn't like that, nor was the boy. (I mean they were sinister, but not in an overly intentional 'scary' way).The fact that people complain that it's slow or no action... I miss the days of long attention spans.BTW- Check out the Trivia on IMDb about this movie. Have a look at the Avian Brood Parasite passage. It explains the movie and the opening bird sequence really well.Finally- Dear Movie Makers... Is it REALLY NECESSARY to have your logo animations and then the text for those animations at the start of a movie? This movie had like 20 of them. I'm waiting for a movie of just logos. If there's an animation, why list it again right after.

The director succeeds in implementing that vision and praise must be given for that.However, the thing that truly annoys me about this film is its third act, it seems to be a film that stacks all these dominoes and you're waiting for all of them to fall, but they never really do, leaving us with a lacklustre ending, where it seems the director was trying to leave the story up for interpretation, but in the meantime, it doesn't feel as if it has earned that right yet, as they don't really give you enough information to go off to give a decent interpretation. I appreciate the risk that the film was attempting to take but it falls short of being truly captivating and giving us something to spend hours talking about, instead giving us an experience that was decent but doesn't transcend that barrier.Overall, Vivarium has decent performances, cinematography and world building but the storytelling falters, making me underwhelmed and wishing it had been just a little bit better, where it could have been truly great.

Imogen Poots is becoming an indie film queen. She's always fantastic in whatever she does and she's usually a strong indicator of whether I watcha film or not. With Vivarium its a wonderful idea, that feels like something out of the Twilight Zone. However, it would have worked better as a short TV show episode rather than a 90 minute film. The film is about a young couple who are looking to buy a house together. They meet with a weird and off putting real estate agent who introduces them to a house on Yonder which is a housing development that is the stuff of suburban nightmares. Every house is identical. The couple find that they can't leave their home. No matter what they do, they also seem to be the only ones in the development. They soon realize they must raise a child given to them to leave the house. The film also stars Jesse Eisenberg, and interestingly this is the second time I'm seeing the two leads pairing after The Art of Self Defense which was absolutely amazing. The set up for the film is amazing. Like I said earlier, its so reminiscent of a very good Twilight Zone episode for the first half and hour or so. The idea, atmosphere, and setting is so good. Once the couple receive the baby the film soon becomes flat and feels like it was drawn out. The film has a really annoying child actor, which is fine because hes the absolute devil. Everything else just becomes repetitive (especially with Jesse Eisenberg's character) and I feel like the script ran on fumes for a while. I was fine with the ending but the uneven nature of the film hurt it from being much better.This seemed perfect for me because I love dystopian films with elements of horror. This was fantastic for a third of its running time and then needed much better writing. I would still recommend watching it. I'm sure others might really like it as a whole and I think the idea itself it set up well so its worth checking out. Lets just hope Ms. Poots gets better work because shes underrated.

This is not my beautiful house. Talking HeadsVivarium should be dedicated to all the couples who have ever searched for the perfect home. Too often the house turns out not to be perfect, and the additional turn of the screw is that sometimes it's in a remote suburb because that's where they can afford. As this challenging horror dramedy shows, the cost for the isolation from society may be too much to bear.Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) and Gemma (Imogen Poots) meet a strange broker, Martin (Jonathan Aris), who takes them to an eerie tract of affordable homes that digitally stretch for miles in equal measure in every way. It's almost as if Rod Serling were there to warn the couple that they are entering the Twilight Zone. Poots' naturalism and Eisenberg's nebbishness keep the audience guessing how this Everyman and Everywoman can escape such a bleak world.Not lost on the multi-interpretive side is the feeling that this chiller could have been made in the last three months given our quarantined worlds confined to four walls and designed by an unforgiving virus. The uniformity and monotony of the houses and the landscape presage a loss of sanity for this otherwise normal couple, if not the audience.Director-writer Lorcan Finnegan and co-writer Garrett Shanley are careful not to closely imitate Serling's pacing and not to overplay the allegorical implications. The story does unfold slowly, a distributed exposition so to speak, wherein each small detail helps create a dread from which the couple may not be able to escape. They can't find the exit and end up back at # 9. No exit.Not only does the motif of the imprisoning suburbs emerge, but also the arrival of a baby out of nowhere (like a Fed Ex or Amazon package), begins a veiled argument about babies imprisoning young parents. For a hip couple, tending the baby is a chore, especially when he grows up to become morose and eventually life endangering.While the filmmakers of this slow-burning dramedy succeed portraying the banality and danger of suburban life, at the same time the audience can identify with the couple enough to wish for their release.

When the agent disappears, the couple is trapped in Yonder, where no matter how many turns they make, they forever go back to house No. 9, to which someone or something punctually delivers a box of groceries.

And far enough. Just the right distance.During this Corona crisis, watching a movie was an impossible task for me. Let alone that I could write down a sensible word to form an opinion. But now three weeks later, the urge to watch a movie once again came back. And I could focus on the movie without my mind wandering off to some disaster scenarios. Apparently, my doom thinking disappeared. And hurray. Even the traditional formulation of an opinion was possible again. Only the choice of film was a bit unfortunate. Vivarium isn't exactly a movie that'll make you happy. It has many similarities with the situation people in the world are in today. Isolated and tied to one specific living space. No contact with others. And a feeling of powerlessness, fear, and despair. However, it's not a deadly virus why Gemma (Imogen Green Room Poots) and Tom (Jesse The Social Network Eisenberg) are in this situation.Let me warn you first. Vivarium isn't exactly an everyday film. It's very confusing and probably boring to some. Not only because of the painfully slow pace. But also because of the repetitive character of the film. And mainly, because of the completely surreal and absurd theme of this film. To be honest, from the start I had the feeling that I was looking at a surreal painting by Margritte. Those artificial, unnatural looking perfect clouds against a clear blue sky. The identical row houses in a distasteful green color. Everything looks artificial and unreal. As insignificant and abstract as the name of the neighborhood itself: Yonder.Gemma and Tom, a young couple that wants to settle down and are looking for an affordable home, end up at a real estate agency one day. The eerie-sounding and unworldly-reacting real estate agent invites them to visit a house in a suburb that's just been built. At first sight a well-kept neighborhood. But at the same time a frightening neighborhood where all houses and gardens look identical. While Gemma and Tom visit the house, with house number 9, they've actually made a decision already. While viewing the nursery, bright blue and therefore already intended as a boys' room, they suddenly realize that the real estate agent Martin (Jonathan Aris) has vanished into thin air. And after a while they discover that they're not getting out of this maze of identical houses in any way. They have to accept that they are forever trapped in this artificial world.From then on, Vivarium becomes an uncomfortable film. As a viewer, you feel the despair and watch the youthful and lively couple evolve into an apathetic and indifferent duo whose daily routine consists of eating tasteless astronaut food and caring for a bizarre child. They found the boy at their front door in a cardboard box. Raising this child would be an opportunity to escape, as the message reads on the box. Only this toddler creates a conflict between Gemma and Tom. Not only does the boy's behavior create tension. Their relationship with this strange little boy is also different. The little fellow seems to be not of this world, as well. His growth pattern isn't normal. His behavior and way of communicating (he speaks with the voice of Gemma and Tom) are both absurd and annoying. The psychotic shouting until he gets his way would make me go ballistic for sure. And that's how Tom responds. While Gemma, as a kindergarten teacher, creates a stronger bond with the nasty little boy, Tom reacts hostile and turns to digging a bottomless pit. Probably to find a way out.Don't expect a conclusive explanation at the end of the movie. To be honest, there were as many open questions at the end of the movie as there were at the beginning. The final message was not really clear to me. Is it about the colorless and monotonous, routine life that some of us lead? Is it an indictment of our modernist and materialistic society? Or a satirical view of that society? Or are aliens using humanity to breed their species in an infinite cycle? Like the cuckoo at the beginning. Maybe I expected a little more. But in the end I thought Vivarium was an intriguing movie with an exceptional set-up, kind of unusual images and yet some admirable acting. In particular Imogen Poots left a lasting impression.

The beginning of the movie pulls you in using odd behaviors from an introductory character and a very strange setting. The movie takes place mainly in Yonder, a neighborhood which, at first glance, seems to be a bizarre mix of something from Stepford Wives, Edward Scissorhands, and The Truman Show. Once the couple nears the end of their house tour, the movie just gets more and more strange as the minutes pass. The plot itself resembles the weirdest of fever dreams, with a lot of questions being raised and only a few of them being answered. Poots and Eisenberg are absolutely the highlight of the movie, their sublime acting carrying my rating from a 2.5 to a solid 4. The cinematography is also note-worthy; as confusing as the movie is, it certainly is nice to look at. While Vivarium isn't necessarily bad, it also isn't great. It's weird enough to keep you interested throughout, but fails to give the audience a satisfying ending. I personally walked away asking the same questions I had at the beginning of the movie. Why?

There's no real logic to what happens or answers given to the WHY or HOW, it just is what it is.

I'm still confused by the casting of Jesse Eisenberg. The character he played and the overall tone of the movie didn't fit with his acting style at all. Perhaps my brain simply can't disconnect between him as the comedic, goofy nerd guy that I've seen him play so many times. Weirdly, this movie is labelled as a comedy, but it's NOT. I'm as confused about that categorisation as I am by Jesse Eisenberg being casted...The best part of the movie is definitley the concept. It would've worked perfectly as an Inside No. 9 episode (conviniently, the mysterious house in the movie is number 9). It doesn't have enough story to sustain it for a 1 hour 30 minute movie, it would've been much more effective if it'd been condensed down into a 30 minute TV episode. The twists would've been much more effective, the lack of plot would've been easier to forgive and overall, it would've been much more entertaining."}, {"id": 890, "text": "I have never written a review for anything in my life so the fact that this movie has made me want to write one must mean something.The first half of this film was amazing I was very intrigued as to how it was going to pan out and Imogen was absolutely amazing in this, could not fault her, however (and I hate to say this because I love Jesse Eisenberg) but she really showed him up here, he just did not compare to the range of emotions she was able to express and it just did remove some of the value of what this could have been.The second half, not so good, I feel like I was constantly waiting for an explanation that never came and once the credits started rolling I felt pretty disappointed. I'm not sure if that was the whole point- that in life we just don't get an explanation, and that it was just 97 minutes trying to convey some deep meaning about life and suburbia and if it was then I guess they did that.Even though I feel overall pretty annoyed and can understand why some people hated this movie, it did really grip me in in the beginning in a way that a movie hasn't for a while, and the concept was very unique and that in itself nowadays is impressive.

However, there's a certain serendipity to the timing, with Finnegan crafting a story that is wonderfully bleak, totally unnerving, and incredibly prescient for the times.For those who are curious, the word vivarium refers to a place such as a laboratory where animals or plants are kept under conditions simulating their natural environment so that they can be observed, typically for research.While Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots represent the proverbial labs rats in this mystery-horror-thriller, it's the impotency of adulthood and cracks in modern society that fall squarely under Finnegan's keen eye and sharp filmmaking. Covid-19 has already dimmed a lot of light in this world. If at all possible, don't let 'Vivarium' be yet another example.

I followed their on screen chemistry in two previous films (The Double and Art of Self Defense) and found them likable as a couple in both of them.This led me to see their performance here as well.Before I go over my criticisms, I will say that this film really tries to be different from the norm. More than sci fi, I would say this film borrows more heavily from the philosophical ideas of Spanish writer Jorge Luis Borges. Borges would often allude the idiosyncrasies of daily life to fantastical and impossible scenarios. He was also quite fascinated with the theme of infinity or redundancy in his short stories. Without going into spoilers, I can say this film follows a similar theme of infinite repetition of life, equating the daily problems in rearing a family to the myth of Sisyphus. There is no respite from it. Also, I liked the look of the film. The colors they used sort of helped accentuate the sensation of vapidity in the lives of the protagonist. In fact, besides the two human characters played by Imogen and Jesse, the vapidity of living in a society as a family is personified as a third character.However, I fell that given such an interesting premise, the writers could have worked a bit more on the material. Both Jesse and Imogen felt like blank slates. We knew nothing about their characters before or even after the end of the movie. It would have helped to get some context on their relationship and their own personal motivations . I was seven more confused with Jesse's role. I think he wanted to shake off his nerd image and be more of a butch in this role; however it comes off as being very confusing. Is he supposed to be assertive or mild mannered, smart or dull. I really couldn't get a grip on his character.Also, at the end of the film, even though I got the film's central message, I still didn't feel I got a well earned satisfying conclusion. And I think this ties directly to the notion that the two characters were underwritten. If they had personal good arcs, maybe I could have appreciated the film more."}, {"id": 893, "text": "When I watched the trailer for Vivarium I was immediately intrigued. The concept was definitely enticing, it seemed fresh and unique, and I do love Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots. The concept, admittedly, IS both enticing and unique- the issue lies not with the central plot or themes, but, unfortunately, with the execution of the story.Any good story is dependent on one thing: yes. The characters must say yes, literally or figuratively, to their surroundings. Yes to fighting their individual battle. Yes to acknowledging their circumstances. Yes to each other, whether or not that means supporting each other in their decisions or simply acknowledging that they are taking place. Vivarium is a story full of no, and that is its ultimate downfall.No is not a compelling story arc. No is boring. No not only stops plot development in its tracks, it stops the audience from caring a lick about the characters or what happens next. I can't imagine how much more interesting and compelling this moving would have been had either of the main characters decided to acquiesce to their surroundings, even falsely or superficially, to pay attention to the incredibly simple directions they were given of raise the child and be released. It seems like a no brainer that they were being observed or tracked after a certain (very early) point, yet they seem to rage against that reality constantly. I can imagine resisting for the first bit of their time in this strange and isolated environment, but to constantly maintain their denial is not only totally unrealistic, it is objectively boring.Film writers who write characters which are made to seem smart, yet constantly make incredibly stupid decisions, alienate their audiences.Fantastical sci-fi narratives, especially when they feature human or humanoid characters, still need to be rooted in realistic human emotion. That's what makes a story about aliens or fairies or wizards relatable. It makes a totally unrealistic narrative something that people can place themselves in, which keeps us invested. This movie was centralized on two people who continuously made the most nonsensical, stupid decisions at every turn, which, in my personal case, made me feel completely alienated from them. I didn't care about their emotional arcs because they were so lazily touched upon. By the end, I really couldn't have cared less about what happened to them, because I was never given a reason to care.Vivarium was a wonderful concept executed lazily and haphazardly, a waste of two phenomenal actors, and a waste of my time.

I don't share this point of view but the story told in the film was fun to watch.The story is told quickly and full of story twists which makes such a dark theme relatively light-hearted and fun to watch. I myself wouldn't put the film in the horror genre more in the mystery.If you like art-house movies then this is could be a classic in the making.

Actually, everything that this movie attempted to communicate could have been best portrayed in a 25 minute Twilight Zone episode from the sixties, apart from the colors, visual effects and technical aspects of course, which are nice but did they help?

This could have been avoided by rewriting the start of the film, but alas, it is what it is.The whole movie could have been compressed into a TV short, with nothing lost.You would be much better saving an hour of your time by watching the vastly superior 'La Cabina' by Antonio Mercero which has a similar 'twist' at the end - though much more horrifying and it doesn't give the game away early on.'Vivarium' is not the worst movie ever made, but it could have been so, so much better."}, {"id": 901, "text": "Pros: 1.

It follows a couple as they look for a perfect home, only to find themselves trapped in a seemingly unending series of identical houses.Plotting is mainly a metaphor, but has some serious high points. Tom (Eisenberg) and Gemma (Poots) are looking to buy a house. The couple meets Martin (Aris), a realtor who seems a bit off. He takes them to Yonder, a quiet series of identical homes that are reportedly very popular. As they tour house #9, Martin leaves and the couple decides to leave Yonder; although they find out that they cannot, all roads lead to house #9 and their car runs out of gas. They burn down #9, and they get a baby in the mail with a message telling them to raise it in order to leave. After a few months, the baby (Jennings) has grown exponentially. As the boy grows, Tom and Gemma become distant. After the boy disappears and later reappears with a book containing a revelation. The couple reunite and make a last ditch effort to escape Yonder.Characters are thin, but have some good aspects. Tom is some kind of construction worker with knowledge of nature, which does surprisingly come into play in the story; his presumable previous job giving him a purpose in the new, otherworldly neighborhood. Gemma is a teacher, with probable aspirations to settle down with Tom. If the couple were given a bit more time to develop, and the time spent in Yonder was shortened by 5 to 7 minutes, the movie would be a lot better for it. Martin is an effectively unnerving segue into the bizarro suburban environment, and the Boy is good in his own surreal, sociopathic way. Performances help to save the movie from itself, Eisenberg and Poots show good chemistry in the first few minutes, which visibly deteriorates as they spend more time in Yonder. The usually energetic Eisenberg becomes dead-eyed, and Poots goes from happy and delightful to anxious and alone. It's very good work from both of them.Vivarium's message is sent with deadpan, often black delivery, and satirical horror. The whole suburban life will suck you dry bent is familiar, having been done in movies like the 'Burbs and the Jonses. Still, the movie does provide some solid moments of both comedy and horror. A fantastic scene involving the couple, the Boy, and their car is scary, yet has humor running through it. And another when Gemma and the Boy play pretend; the scare is foreshadowed, but what happens is so bizarre that it retains its effect. While the message is clear and has its high points, it does overstay its welcome; having to watch Tom and Gemma as they go through a routine for so long gets monotonous. Surely the point, but said point has already been made. It also seems condescending coming from Hollywood, the home of many stars, multimillionaires, and corporations trying to tell a large portion of its audiences that their living conditions suck.Technically the movie is very good. It is a good tutorial on how to make a movie that has very few locations feel like it has even less, and to great effect. Set design is pristine, glossy, and lifeless, keeping with the theme. Lighting is a strong point of the movie, the setting sun and dark nights look beautiful with the golden yellows and oranges and deep blues and black contrasting with the drab greens and greys of Yonder. There are major pacing issues though. The second act feels too long, going through the same motions the movie went through one day on repeat, if there was a bit more variance this could have been resolved, as well as offering a brief reprieve from the single joke/scare the movie has going for it.While the message is clear and has several high points, Vivarium suffers from its single purpose. A fantastic start, some genuinely effective moments, and solid performances keep the movie interesting for a while; but it can feel mean spirited and condescending. Nonetheless, a majority of the movie is involving, creepy, and funny.63/100"}, {"id": 903, "text": "Vivarium: A strange horror satire which basically portrays real estate agents as parasites. Something like an idea thought up by Ballard and fleshed out by Philip K. Dick. A couple, Gemma (Imogen Poots) and Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) are brought by a creepy agent to a new housing development, Yonder. The agent disappears and the hapless duo find that they cannot escape from the Yonder either by car or on foot. Seemingly endless rows of identical green houses, a sky dotted with cotton wool style clouds and they are trapped in number nine. Food arrives in boxes when they are asleep, then a baby is delivered in a box with a promise that they will be released if they raise it. The boy grows rapidly, after 98 days he is about 8 years old. He is quite literally a little monster and the couple deal with the strangeness in their own ways. Tom literally digging himself into a hole and Gemma alternating between hating the boy and becoming his stepmother. Most of the horror is prosaic, gradually building up to an existential sense of panic as the months go by. There are some shocking scenes though and while not everything makes sense on a surface level there are hidden layers to this story. Good acting by Poot and Eisenberg but the standout performance is by Senan Jennings as the boy.

Incredibly unique, often stunning, and full of all out performances- Vivarium gives a truly original glimpse into a new kind of horror, which may prove to be a bit formulaic at times, but is for the most part, absolutely groundbreaking. Vivarium is a very hard film to talk about. Experiencing it for myself, I hardly knew what to expect as the minutes passed by, and didn't entirely grasp the full measure of what had happened by the end. Needless to say though, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and felt a need to discuss its strengths and flaws. Vivariums biggest flaw I would have to say would be its mechanics of storytelling, with it seeming a bit overly formulaic towards the beginning (the set-up of the film) in order to get things started. However, eventually, Vivarium finds its own unique footing to carry itself throughout, and what remains from this truly original work is something oddly brilliant. Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots are very talented as always in their performances, but it's the minor roles in the film that truly make the movie as suspenseful and thrilling as it is. As I won't go much further into detail, I can say that all the cast, although it isn't very large, deserves credit for their work in the film. The atmosphere in the film conveyed fits absolutely perfectly, as well as the way it looks, feeling incredibly artificial and yet so menacingly real all at once. It's mind bending, interesting, entertaining, and quite stressful to watch in the very best of ways. Vivarium may ask more questions than it is able to answer, but I was blown away by the pure insaneness of this film, and I hope that director Lorcan Finnegan has more up his sleeve for future horror projects, because I honestly can't wait what he thinks of next.

This is a wonderful mix of tropes. There is a prisoner / abductee trope, there is adoption of a strange child trope, there is a troubled couple trope, there is even a mystery trope.I'm fully of the opinion that the right thing to do in any abduction situation is to not reward the criminals with what they want because there is no reason that while they have all the power that they're going to do anything to benefit the victims. We get see an exploration of what people do in a dire situation and given a task, similar to a couple different Twilight Zone episodes.The production value is clearly here, and while they appear to have saved some money on limited locations, it clearly put to good use as the movie delves deeper into its story.I can't recommend this enough, please give it a shot all the way through."}, {"id": 908, "text": "Vivarium was an interesting film.

All the disturbing Tim Burton-esque visual and fantasy influences can't keep this project afloat. The story lacks in coherence and, honestly, it was dreadfully boring. At approximately 2 hours in length and packed with long drawn out scenes of basically nothing, it felt like an extended, albeit, uneventful episode of The Twilight Zone. The story made no sense whatsoever. It was full of plot holes that made me shake my head in disgust. As for the genre, is it Sci-Fi? Horror? Thriller? Drama? It's both all of those things and none of them. The film lacks a sense of urgency that is found in most typical sci-fi, thrillers and horror movies. OK, they're in this community and they don't want to be there, but they're not being threatened, they're not in danger, they're not even in fear of risking their lives. They're just in a community...full of green houses...with no explanation as to why they are there, and so the film relies heavily on the psychological state of the characters to keep the audience engaged. What sense of urgency the film lacks is compensated for what the viewers themselves, in a state of confusion about what is actually happening, project up on the film. In the end, this can be cataloged in the art film genre, mostly due to it's presentation.

It is visually stunning and well shot, taking you into the characters and the annoying kid that grows up watching his parents as if it's a creepy version of Data without any of the charm. I felt as if I was an observer as well, rooting for them but hoping someone would explain what was going on.

The story revolves around a young couple that is looking for a house. The warmhearted school teacher and the sarcastic gardener meet with a strange realtor named Martin. He makes them visit a house at Yonder, a brand-new suburban community. The weird realtor mysteriously disappears during the visit and the couple decides to leave. However, they soon realize that they are trapped and unable to leave the community. They try to walk away, drive away and even burn their house but they always end up returning to house number nine. One day, they receive a package with a baby boy. A message tells them that they will be released once they have raised the baby. It soon becomes obvious that there is something amiss about the boy. He only repeats things his foster parents have told him, is unable to dream and imagine things and seems to be meeting a mysterious stranger in the abandoned community. The foster parents try to find out about the boy's secrets but the isolation slowly takes its toll on their physical and mental well-being. Will they be able to find out what's going on and make it out of the community alive?This science-fiction movie has a few positive elements. The story isn't completely new but intriguing and mysterious enough to keep you guessing until the end. The settings are particularly colourful and lush. The deterioration of the two main characters is fascinating to watch as is the rapid development of their adopted son. The soundtrack is diversified and vibrant. The surreal special effects are scarcely employed but integrated with care.The movie however also has a few downsides. Its pace is at times excruciatingly slow despite a rather compact running time. The deterioration of the main characters feels a little bit rushed. This is the case for Imogen Poots' character in particular. The dialogues, like the one written above, are at times repetitive, shallow and unintentionally funny. The movie's conclusion isn't bad but one could have expected something more surprising after a build-up that took eighty minutes.In the end, I would recommend Vivarium to fans of arthouse cinema and dystopian stories.

Forever.. What follows is some sort of commentary on the hetero normative ways of living that comes back to bite us in the ass.Lorcan Finnegan's film (which he co-wrote with screenwriter Garret Shanley) doesn't give our couple much to do, beside roaming the empty streets of suburban purgatory in a depressive state of mind, until a baby in a cardboard box gets dropped in front of their new home. With it, there's a note stating they'll have to raise the child in order to be released. The child grows rapidly and is definitely a caricature on how annoying children really can be. Screaming and mimicking their voices like some sort of small alien demon, it mostly gets on Tom's nerves, who escapes the dreadful long days by digging for clues in his own front yard, looking for another way out.It's mostly Poots who does the heavy lifting here in which she interacts with the child when it's not looking at some mysterious Videodrome-esque tv-screen, who's mysteries never get revealed. While Eisenberg slowly gets turned into a one-dimensional being, the film drags further to a somewhat surprising twist that doesn't explain a thing, but leaves you thinking about the way we are all just numbers and in the end just get replaced, whether that may be in the workplace or in our personal lives.Lorregan has a vision and executes it well, although his suburban nightmare never gives a direct answer to all the questions you might end up asking.
