So many reviews rating this movie a 1 and claiming that there is no point to the movie. A lot of Lovecraft's work is centered around how terrifying the unknown is. You are supposed to feel unnerved and confused, you are meant to ask yourself What the hell is going on? No this movie may not be a 100% pure adaptation to the original story, but any Lovecraft story will need some tweaks to translate to film, that is just the nature of his stories. They are meant to tap into the limits of your imagination. That is harder to do with visual movies. Anyway, if you enjoy Lovecraft them give this movie a watch!"}, {"id": 1, "text": "This is a real Lovecraftian delight in the most weird and wonderful scifi horror mashup. A truly disturbing film with the grotesque body morphing elements of John Carpenters The Thing coupled with a menacing and highly charged time-warped atmosphere of dread, disgust and plain acid tripping weirdness! I loved the directors other movies especially Dust Devil and this movie has the same air of mystery and palpable horror interwoven in perfect symmetry!The concept of a colour than cannot be seen by the human eye being a time-warping, shape shifting invasive alien life-form is just pure genius - sad to see some reviewers do not have a mind capable of expanding and appreciating genius writing that was Lovecraft or a movie that is truly new in concept; a veritable orgy of the visual and truly terrifying!In short this is not for everyone but true Sci-fi buffs and horror fans alike will love this adaptation of HP Lovecraft's amazing short story and translates it very well indeed!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "Considering how difficult the source material must have been to translate to a visual medium, they really knocked it out the park.

It's not only a great suspenseful horror, that manages to keep you engaged and interested through the well paced build up. But the visuals and sound effects will stick with you long after, as will the creepy, shocking and gorey moments. It's a Lovecraft adaptation (if it's Lovecraftian, think eldrich telepathic tentacle creatures from the cosmos). The story gives enough for you to follow and understand, yet be left thinking about what you've just watched. The acting from Nicholas Cage and all the rest of the cast is fantastic too.

An impeccable conception, followed by a meticulous direction and cinematography, alongside with a simple but never-tiring acting and a screenplay written as it should be in honor of the work of Lovecraft. Film that will remain in the annals of this genre and that surely captures one of the best essences of horror in general."}, {"id": 8, "text": "What in the hell is going, how do these films get made?

This travesty of a film could have been so so SO much better. I had to laugh a few times at the poorly written script and horrendous acting by everyone on the movie.There was probably 20 minutes left in the movie, but I couldn't take any more. The writing, editing and acting were plain awful. Nicholas Cage is a really bad actor, in almost every movie except Moonstruck and Raising Arizona. But I think this may be his worst."}, {"id": 10, "text": "This was simply an interesting but very odd movie.

And since this is the third collaboration between Cage and XYZ films, (the awesome Mom And Dad and Mandy), the expectations were high. The expectations went further high as this is directed by Richard Stanley (Hardware, Dust Devil n The Abandoned) but the end product turned out to be boring. Nic Cage goes crazy aft 60 mins n that's when the movie picks up for few mins and then goes downhill. It has lots of colors, lots of flickering lites n lots of hazy n blurred scenes."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Richard Stanley's comeback to feature cinema is an equal-parts breathtaking &amp; terrifying experience, highlighted by gorgeous cinematography, overwhelming dread and of course a bizarre Nicolas Cage performance.

If you go into it knowing it's not a huge budget movie, the material, you'll appreciate it much more."}, {"id": 15, "text": "If you enjoy films like Mandy you'll love this. Its Lovecraft inspired, so be prepared for visceral and difficult scenes you can't look away from. I love the way this closely mimicked an hallucigenic trip, where the colours seep in slowly at first and everything's filled with beauty and wonder. Then it hits fast forward and the colours and scenes are like bombs that just explode around you and you start to lose control and it turns into a bad, bad trip. There are some scenes that stayed with me that were really difficult to watch, not dissimilar to The Thing when I first watched it, and I can still hear whimpers and guttural sounds of pain from that scene now. Richardson was a welcome edition to this, and she played a completely different role from what we normally saw of her, and she did a great job. Nic cage is his usual crazy, loco self but it's great to see him in roles that are actually watchable instead of the dross he's been doing for the last ten years. I really hope he continues to work on cult classic material, as this is his new niche. I'd love to dissect it more but I don't want to spoil it for any one."}, {"id": 16, "text": "This movie is a perfect example of lack of talent at every level. The script is pathetic, and doesn't even contain an actual protagonist. Cage's acting is horrible, and nobody else is much better. Dialogue made me wonder if it was written by a high school student. What a sad pathetic waste of money. No, it's not an Arthouse movie or a wonderful cult classic. Just bad."}, {"id": 17, "text": "In a long, long time I haven't seen something worse.

The CGI in this movie is excellent and in particular, the sequence near the end where the home world of the entity is shown for a short time - writhing masses, strange machinery, tendrils, gloom under a black sun, foreboding - absolutely epic and true to what HPL would have envisaged in his mired imagination.The soundtrack is also exceptional, as is most of the acting. And Tommy Chong is in it as a hermit philosopher stoner type with pounding psychedelic 1970's music emanating from his hut. Overall, there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best adaptation of any of HPL's stories yet, by far, and I've seen them all - having been an aficionado of the mythos since my early life back in the 1960's. This director has done an amazing job of bringing this most difficult of concepts to the screen and I wait for more from him and his team.A final word. One of the reviewers gave this movie a poor score based partly on a perceived similarity with Annihilation. Well, the similarity is because Annihilation, just like the Blob and many others, was influenced by HPL's 1927 story and this movie is a faithful adaptation of that same story. And, Annihilation was also an excellent movie - as is this movie."}, {"id": 19, "text": "How is it possible that such an unbelievable mess is rated a 6 or anything more than a 2 at the absolute max.

I used to love Nicolas Cage movies but they are definitely not the same any more. This one was like an old school X-Files type movie (you remember how bad some of those were right?)The acting in this movie was very low quality - kind of the way Christian Slater or Steven Seagal movies went. The story seemed like it could be okay - but all the intertwined stories didnt make sense - the Wiccan goddess by the river, the Scientist who looked and acted like a teenage boy, the hippy in the woods who didnt trust anyone (Its like Tommy Chong's contract is basically - will only play an off-his-tree stoner part no matter what the movie).Joely Richardson's part was also bizarre - some kind of FOREX broker who doesn't understand whether she is dealing in Dollars or Euros who complains about her intermittent phone connection - none of which helped the movie. In fact the disparate parts almost felt like everyone was doing Improv.Near the end when the boy and Joely were mushed together by some kid of alien ray all the family cared about and talked to was the Joely mush - no-one tried to comfort the boy side of the mush even though his face was visible and could be talked to. If that was my boy I'd be more concerned with his well being than the moms.So yeah probably one of the worst movies I've seen since the last Transformers movie. If this movie was filmed on someones credit card for $50k we'd be like - pretty cool effort for a B movie - but for a professional movie with supposedly quality actors this one is definitely one to miss."}, {"id": 26, "text": "People giving 8 9 or even 10 stars to this movie either have money in it or are being payed to make this review to make the movie interesting so you will pay to see it.

The daughter being into black magic and the alpaca humor was unnecessary additions that muddied the focus of the story, and as much as I love Nick Cage, it felt like he was only there because it'd be funny. He hurt the immersion of the film and the creep factor for sure.The final part of the film is really quite different from the books and I found it to be far less effective.It's a probably one of the best lovecraft adaptations we can get in terms of sincere effort and production value, but it still fluffs some key things that keep it from being a truly great horror movie."}, {"id": 48, "text": "Am I the only one here who thinks Nicolas Cage has some really poor acting skills?"}, {"id": 49, "text": "I lost a few IQ points that I can't afford to lose after watching this.

It's based on a Lovecraft short story, a notoriously difficult material to bring to modern audiences. It stars Nicolas Cage, which is like a dmg modifier: either makes the movie greater or it brings it further down. Finally, there is no other well known actor in this whole movie. But I am happy to report that the film is actually good. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it achieves several things. It stays close to the source material, without making it all feel old and out of date. It doesn't shy from the horrible, with The Thing and Annihilation style special effects. It keeps the characters (and actors) in check by focusing on the overall weird rather than dragging it on with personal experiences that wouldn't matter at all in the end.Bottom line: for a jaded horror fan, it might feel like a jumble of other movies, good movies though.

Very Lovecraftian but with elements of Carpenter's The Thing and other Sci fi influences, this film is visually stunning and becomes more and more psychedelic as it progresses. With a strong cast, a sense of mystery and some genuinely creepy scenes, this will not be for everone but those with a Lovecraft bent will probably love it."}, {"id": 86, "text": "TLDR its not a 1:1 retelling of the original short story, but it uses that to its advantage to show the horror in a way that wouldnt otherwise be possible in a film about fictional colors. The comedy falls short, as does some minor aspects of the acting. But overall its a great watch for any fan of cosmic horror. Or person who hates jumpscares and wants some real tension.No spoiler section:Nicolas Cage, in a H.P. Lovecraft story? You must be joking... and what , a story about a color that doesn't exist?! How do they plan to adapt that in a visual media!? Was my first reaction apon learning about this movie. It took a long time for me to get around to watching it. Now im a big cosmic horror fan, and so I do adore my Lovecraft stories, but I honestly did not believe a story like this would be possible to adapt. But they did, and it somehow worked.Needless to say this is a story I think the less you know about the better, being that fear of the unknown is kinda the whole theory of Lovecraft's horror. So here is what I can say without spoiling anything, The film is not a 100% accurate adaptation, and I think that's mostly a good thing in this case. The book relies heavily on using your imagination to scare yourself, more then actual horror. Where as this film uses its visual media to scare you. That being said its not all jump-scares and eerie music like most terrible horror flicks you see pop up. There is literally only one jump scare in the entire film (I guess they just really couldn't resist) And instead relies more on building up of tension with a bit of shock horror that the cosmic horror genre is familiar with. That being said this is no The Thing or Alien when it comes to quality of film or quality of horror. Of course knowing the jest of the story it would of been hard to scare me, but even so I think both previously mentioned films are still very far ahead of this as far as the usage of tension, and the buildup and release of said tension with horrific moments. However this is kinda a rare breed of film, Lovecraft's works are rarely mimicked directly, and even rarer are they adapted, And even rarer still are they adapted well. This is an example of a well made HP Lovecraft adaptation and so therefore I have to give it a thumbs up, If your a fan of cosmic horror, HP Lovecraft, or just get tired of the same old haunted doll jumpscare fests that most horror films are nowadays, Id give it a shot! SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS:So this story changed a good bit from the original work, but as previously mentioned I think most of it was for the best. They changed the dynamics of some of the characters aswell as the main story arc itself. The meteor still lands in a farm , stuff still goes all wibbly wobbly ultra-violetty and madness does still ensue but the main perspective of the story has shifted from an outsider, to the actual farm family themselves, making it a much more personal story. I do feel however the horror of the thought of the tainted soil and land getting spread by the final flooding that is mentioned in the books and in the film wasnt nearly as leaned into as it was in the books. Which is unfortunate, because that lingering thoughts of Lovecraft's protagonists at the end of his stories, wondering about how such horrors may spread or happen again, is kinda a hallmark of the stories to me. They also (probably smartly) didnt lean into the actual color ironically enough. They only really mention its difficulty to describe once in the whole film. But instead rely on giving it more traits that are easier to mask in film, having it effect each character differently. The Father smells this horrid smell he can hardly describe until the end of the film where he describes it as being the same terrible smell he remembered from some memories with his father that he hates. The children all have moments of hearing this sorta ringing in their ears, or the thumping of what sounds like a heart beat. These all work to inform us the audience they are experiencing the side effects of the color, and give us that sense of wrongness about whats going on that the book gave us by simply describing the foreign hues of the plants and environment. Also by setting the story in a more modern time, we see how the color effects the TV, Cell phones, Cameras ect. And altho I think the scenes of the scientists studying samples of the rock being replaces by some simple water studies was lackluster, I also dont think it degraded the feeling of supernatural phenomena that lovecraft was going for in the book much.Outside of the adaptation itself as others have already mentioned there is some really bad comedy in the story, and some of the character interactions feel a bit forced. Specifically to me the brother-sister relationship between the two teen kids really didnt feel realistic to me. I could see what they were going for, having them insult each other and such, but then turn to each other in their times of need, but it just didnt feel natural, it felt like two young actors saying lines at each other.THE HORROR: So here is the most subjective part of the review, my review of the horror itself. Now as I mentioned, it would be hard to scare me I think considering I already knew most of was likely to happen. I knew the mother was going to end up all messed up (altho I expected her to be more a zombie who turns to dust and less a Cronenberg with her son) I knew the water was going to be the thing messing with them, and frankly I knew by the end of it all of them were going to be mad or dead, and that the only one to survive would be the scientist character. But that being said the sense of tension building was there regardless. You know something is going to happen, but you dont know what. And I think they actually did this surprisingly well. Never before was I on the edge of my seat watching someone cut carrots before now. But seriously they did a pretty good job here. I will say the body horror and  The Thing esque monsters they added to the story were kinda creepy, but maybe its because im desensitized to those kinda things because of their recent popularity in horror. But I just didnt find them that scary. That being said the actual effects were really good. Im not sure how much was practical and how much was CGI but I would guess at least a good bit was practical, due to the way they shot it (and well literally shot it too) but I would guess most of the effects with the mom were CGI where the Cronenberg Alpaca was probably the source of most of the practical effects.There was also some nice subtle choices they did to show the characters going mad without having to beat you over the head with it by having people saying HES GOING CRAZY WATCH OUT! or whatever. A great example is early in the film we see the Father talking to his wife, and he mentions how he hated how his father used to talk to him and then gives a brief demonstration to her. This didnt feel out of place and just seemed like a normal piece of dialogue until later in the film when he starts going crazy he starts putting on that same silly voice and talking like his father. Or how in that same scene its setup that he hates his father, yet later he asks Isnt that right Dad? while sitting down next to a photo, almost proudly exclaiming in a way you would hear anyone who had great admiration for a father. The way im explaining it here makes it seem more clumsy then it was in the film. Maybe it was a bit on the nose but overall Ill take any form of subtle nod to that rather than have someone spout exposition at me for 5 minutes just to tell me a character is going crazy.Overall as an avid Lovecraft fan I must say im impressed.I rate it 7 for G-spot not being the most offensive name for a pussy cat in a Lovecraft story, out of 10 ;)"}, {"id": 87, "text": "Good adaptation of the lovecraft short story.

Lovecraft foundation source material with the director's own touch it's far from mainstream. Interestingly actor Elijah Wood is one of the producers. With practical effect visuals reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) and Brian Yuzna's Society (1989) it excels Huan Vu's 2012 impressive low budget film adaptation.

Elliot Knight plays hydrologist Ward Phillips, who knows there's something wrong on the property, Tommy Chong as Ezra, aptly the pothead hermit and Josh C.

Brendan Meyer plays Benny but it's young Julian Hilliard that steals the show as Jack who can hear the alien.Some of most creepy scenes include the siblings especially the well staged black hole cosmic meteorite crash. Lavinia has a terrifying memorable attic scene where she comes face to face with her mutated mother and younger brother. Stanley offers strange coloured vegetation, a smelly glowing pinky purple meteor.

Stanley and Scarlett Amaris script possibly could do with some more meat on the bones as the dialogue is sparse. That said, Stanley naturally goes for the subtle, intelligent filmmaking route, at times ambiguous rather than a spoon feeding.It's a fine looking film with Steve Annis's cinematography, there's vibrant special effects and a complementing eerie soundtrack from Colin Stetson, it's also dark, terrifying, emotional and gut wrenching at times. In true Stanley style it's expectedly arty but there's plenty there for diehard horror fans too.Colour Out of Space may not be Stanley's The Island of Dr. Moreau remake we've been waiting for since 1996 but it's a solid H.P.

Now, the first of three proposed H.P Lovecraft films by Stanley has arrived and it's everything I ever wanted it to be.Nathan Gardner's (Nicolas Cage, of course, nature made for a movie with Stanley) life is in transition. His wife Theresa (Joely Richardson, sister of Natasha, daughter of Vanessa Redgrave and stepdaughter of Franco Nero; she's astounding in this) feels mutilated after her recent mastectomy and is losing clients because their internet is so fragile out in the country. His daughter Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur, Big Eyes) has turned to Wicca to heal her mother and escape her life. His son Jack is withdrawn and only takes to the dog. Another son, Benny, years to escape with the drugs he smokes with a hermit named Ezra (Tommy Chong). And he keeps failing as he attempts to raise alpacas and tomatoes.That's when a meteor crashes and changes everything for the worse.Ward, a scientist, tries to warn them not to drink the water that the meteor has contaminated. But it's too late. Too late for the alpacas, which have become hairless monsters. Too late for the wifeand young son, who are fused into one being. Too late for his other son. Too late for Nathan, who is driven insane by the color itself. Too late for even the young hero, Ward, to save the girl who has scarred symbols all over herself as she collapses into ash in his hands, but not before sharing a vision of the world that this color has come from, a place that destroys minds.This was obviously a personal film for the director. His mother as a huge Lovecraft fan and read the story to Stanley when he was 12 or 13. He claims that the story has always been a part of his psychological makeup. As his mother died from cancer, he would often read the author's stories to her. And if rumors are to be believed, Stanley and Swedish filmmaker Henrik M\u00f6ller performed a ritual to the Lovecraftian god Yog-Sothoth to get the film made.Every frame of this film shows that Stanley is a master. In a world of people creating content for the machine, he remains a unique artist.

Director Richard Stanley must be quite a fan because he nails the Lovecraftian mood well, especially past the halfway mark as the film climaxes in an orgy of mutations and body horror. Overall mood is ominous and creepy throughout, from the first frame of trees in a forest to the final shots of waterways, reservoirs and dams. But what elevates this movie to another level is surely Nicholas Cage, in prime bug eyed crazy mode - it pushes the already bizarre goings-on into a truly surreal nightmare. Nic Cage, bless his soul, although he is not one for being selective of his roles (resulting in many recent somnambulant turns for an easy paycheck) but every now and then you get Nic Cage in full bug out mode, and it really puts the icing on an already very slick and polished sci-fi horror film. His deadpan lines of dialogue in this one include gems like It's time to milk the alpacas! and She aint my family!. A shout out for a loopy Tommy Chong as well, including a great moment when he talks of aliens under the floorboards (or something).If you liked stuff like In the Mouth of Madness, and got a huge kick out of Nic Cage in Vampire's Kiss, you won't go wrong with Colour out of Space."}, {"id": 101, "text": "This was sooo good and sooo well made.

Obviously in a movie about Colour there would be clear symbolism in its uses. I'm surprised to see few people making reference to this in reviews. The colour blue is used often to represent, what I think, represents humanity and earth, in stark contrast to the stunning salient magenta. You'll see blue everywhere from clothes to vehicles to wallpaper. It's stunning how much of it was there. For example, the Hydrologist was wearing a blue jacket and has a bright blue vehicle. Every member of the family wore blue at some point. When Cage fell off the deep end he was wearing red.Also prominent are many other Lovecraft references. Triangles, for example, are a prevalent symbolism. In Lovecraftian lore they are often gates or windows. I'll leave you to spot them all.We also have stunning visuals and effects. Every horror in this film is stunning, frightening, and well-realized. The pacing and tension until they start to truly reveal these creatures was perfect.Overall one of the best horror movies of the past decade."}, {"id": 103, "text": "Okay, so not only do we get to see Cage rage level at 110%, but it's also a great attempt at bringing back the nostalgic feel of 80's sci-fi horror, and placing it with modern beautiful cinematography.

The production design is pretty and peaceful to take in, but still ends up being dangerous and psychologically destructive to the odd-to begin with family. The characters are all so bizarre, it makes the craziness happening around feel even a little stronger. You'll find yourself thinking, that's messed up... but I guess I would and could react that way if I was in that situation? There are some disturbing images throughout, but the 80's visual effects help tone down the over-the-top horror. Overall, if you want to be entertained questioning what the heck is going to happen to an already-bizarre-family in an even more outrageous-visually-appealing situation, you'll be in for a fun-cage-rage ride."}, {"id": 104, "text": "In the 1990s director Richard Stanley began making a name for himself with two films that reinterpreted the horror and sci-fi genre. HARDWARE featured a killer cyborg that kept rebuilding itself to carry on its threat to those it encountered and DUST DEVIL featured a mysterious killer with supernatural tendencies. He then began work on THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU in 1996 with Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer only to be fired the day shooting began. Stanley disappeared from feature films after that incident, chronicled in the documentary Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau. Only now has he returned with his take on the H.P. Lovecraft tale COLOR OUT OF SPACE.The Gardner family has moved to a country home after the mastectomy of mother Theresa (Joely Richardson). Nathan (Nicolas Cage) feels it will be a more wholesome atmosphere for his family. Daughter Lavinia (Madeline Arthur) disagrees and misses her friends. Her brother Benny (Brendan Meyer) just wants to get along. And youngest Jack (Julian Hilliard) is oblivious and enjoying himself. Each of these characters has issues and they all come to play as the movie progresses.Their secluded existence is shattered one night when a mysterious pink/purple meteor crashes on their property near their house. Emitting a glow unlike anything they've ever seen, Nathan contacts the local police to check it out. When they arrive the meteor is beginning to deteriorate and seep into the water table. On hand to learn something about it is Ward, a hydrologist whose been surveying the water table in plans for a hydroelectric dam. He take samples to be tested and Benny suggest they also talk to Ezra (Tommy Chong).Ezra is a stoner who lives in a shack on the property. When Nathan and Ward visit him he plays them a recording he's made, talking about creatures moving underground. They pass this off and ignore him as he continues to listen.Jack has become fascinated with the nearby well since the meteor struck. He insists he keeps hearing a man inside the well calling to him. At the same time the vegetation around the well takes on a life of its own, growing into unknown plants all with that pink/purple tint to it.As the residue from the meteor seeps into the ground water and the family drinks from it, they also begin to change. Nathan becomes prone to violent outbursts and nonsensical rants. Theresa seems to completely zone out. Only the teens begin to see something is happening as the cell phones stop working and other strange occurrences take place. Unable to figure it all out, the viewer is left to wonder what it was that came from the meteor and if the world let alone this family can survive.This Lovecraft story has been filmed before in different ways, first with the Karloff classic DIE MONSTER DIE. In 1987 it was turned into the film THE CURSE. Then in 2008 it was used again in an Italian version of the story. Now Stanley has returned to film his version.The movie looks amazing, especially when you realize that the budget couldn't have been much. That's not a slight but a fact with the production company not creating big budget films. The same would hold true of trusting Stanley to helm a new movie after all these years. And yet both risks seem to have paid off with a movie that's fascinating and hold your interest start to finish.The appearance of the film is outstanding and the cinematography, production design and special effects are top of the line. The coloring decisions used are gorgeous and help add to the mystery of the film. The effects at moments reminded me of John Carpenter's THE THING but I'd rather not go into it for fear of ruining the film for those who have yet to see it. Suffice to say the effects are handled well.Stanley appears to have redeemed himself for the self-imposed exile he took on after MOREAU. That's a good thing to see as my guess is he has more movies that need to be set to film. His ability as a director hasn't shown signs of weakening and watching this film will only make fans anxious to see the next release he has planned.On the whole the movie will entertain and hold you in its grip from start to finish.

I had never heard of Stanley prior to viewing but I must say that the film ended up being one of my favorite Horror films from the 1990s. A short time later I came across another of his films Dust Devil1992 and that's when Richard Stanley was forever intertwined with my Horror radar. I admit that when I found out about Color Out of Space it was practically at the last minute weeks away from the DVD release however fortunately I had the best of luck and was able to lock in the one and only showing of Color Out of Space here in Anchorage, Alaska.

Like most others, it seriously misses the mark by not getting what makes Lovecraft unique. His writing combines profound dread with alien strangeness. It's dark and extremely atmospheric. It would seem perfect material for film adaptation. But one big problem is the author's language--we do get a taste of that in the brief narration in this movie--it's over-the-top purple prose much of the time. Lovecraft used words like eldritch and cyclopean as though they were heard everyday by any reader. As compelling and downright haunting as his best work is, it really lives in his language, in his descriptions of cosmic horror, of unnameable things, of ancient, malevolent beings who see humans as mere pawns in their attempt to regain control of the Earth. That said, it's not a film maker's fault that it's impossible to bring language, words on a page, to life on a screen. This is because Lovecraft doesn't describe action so much as he does psychological states or feelings of horror and dread. So a film maker has to visualize Lovecraft's concepts and it's not easy. THE COLOUR OUT OF SPACE is a standout in the author's work, not necessarily because it's a masterpiece (which it may, or may not be in one's opinion) but because it has only tenuous connection with Lovecraft's major conceit which became known as the Cthulhu Mythos. It's up to a reader whether it's part of that group or a standalone story. To me it's standalone and that could make it a good choice for movie adaptation, since it doesn't need to show us the gigantic, monstrous beings waiting in space, or in the depths of the ocean. It's about an unexplained meteorite that crashes into the yard of a New England farm in the middle of nowhere and turns everything and everyone into something alien. You may say, well that's what happens in this film. On the surface, yes it does. But there is none of Lovercaft's poetry in this movie--and I don't mean his language, but rather the dark, brooding atmosphere of dread that sticks in the reader's mind. This film is brightly lit most of the time, there are surprisingly few night scenes. It's beautifully shot, often striking in color (yes, an attempt at one no human has ever seen) and compositon. The special effects, while not exactly original, are alright. But many people are loving this because they like seeing Nicholas Cage go berserk...and indeed he does, if that's your thing. The screenplay is not terribly well written and there are lapses of continuity, as though cuts were made for time in a rush before release. The acting in general is ok at best, with no standout.

A intangible property that cannot be described. Richard Stanley has gone a long way in achieving just that in Color Out of Space. The HP Lovecraft short story is a marvel of conveying the descent into madness caused by the inescapable decay inflicted on a family by an alien entity. First the trees and plants, then the livestock and finally the people succumb to the colour. This film captures the essence of that story perfectly. As adaptations go this is as faithful as we can expect. Remember this is cinema, not literature and so a visual license is allowed. The llama-thing in the barn, the fused bodies in the attic, the perversion of nature; all valid Lovecraftian images thrown into the pot. The kaleidoscope of horrific images and indescribable colour set against the deep green of the forest where no axe has fallen make the progressive madness all the more pronounced. And of course there's Nicholas Cage. You either like him or don't. I think he's great and his mad-as-a-box-of-frogs performance is perfect for such a situation.

Ever.Wow, this film is a Cronenberg/Carpenter-laced trip. And that means bad, BAD news for the characters. I dunno. As I get older, I become less tolerant of Godawful things happening to just random innocent people for no discernible reason. In times past, in media like TV shows and movies, bad things would tend to happen to actual bad people, or at least people who were morally tainted. Nowadays, though, everyone seems to be fair game, including little nerdy kids and moms already suffering with cancer.It's really ugly what happens to this family, particularly the mom and her youngest child. While all eventually fall prey to the meteorite from hell, what happens to the two of them is indescribably brutal and VERY hard to watch. This might've been less of a blow if the mother had been revealed to be abusing the kids or something, but she's just trying to telecommute and get through the days while dealing with an unnamed form of cancer. And the kid is just a kid who doesn't even squish ants for fun.The other family members are just as virtuous, if a bit squabbly. The worst thing that's revealed is that the older son smokes his share of pot supplied by Tommy Chong's squatter hippie character, but is that even a negative in this day and age? The Hellraiser Rock spares no one a painful and violent death, including the local animal population, except for a comically young hydrologist scientist taking water samples.And then there's Nicky Cage, hootin' and hollerin' as he's want to do. Compared to the others, he actually gets off with the equivalent of a wrist slap. Sure, he's consumed by the Lovecraftian light at the end, but his suffering is mostly mental, not physical (save for a rash), which gives him ample opportunity to go crazy in the way that only Cage can pull off. It's not Wicker Man levels of ridiculousness, but it's up there.The movie does take its sweet time before going completely bonkers, so it's not a rollercoaster from start to finish. However, that finish...wow. If that's what a bad LSD trip looks like, get it the hell away from me.I don't know much about HP Lovecraft other than what I've remembered through casual osmosis, so I can't comment about the film's fidelity to the original Colour story. However, I can say that those last 10 or 15 minutes should elicit a jarring response from just-about anyone.According to the stats on here, this film only cost a paltry $6 million. I can easily see that being recouped and then some, even when advertising is added to the final production tally. Richard Stanley surely must know he's onto something by pursuing Lovecraft's mad, mad genius, so I'm confident we'll either see a sequel (if that's possible) or an unrelated entry further exploring the unknowable cosmic horrors that occasionally brush against our fair Earth.A film NOT for the kids, nor for the faint of heart."}, {"id": 173, "text": "These progressive rethorics, laying beneath the scenarios, again and again.

They have a plan, and it's not the aliens from space, it's the ones that are outside the national borders, and the empathy is omnipresent to convince the feeble mind."}, {"id": 174, "text": "Color Out of Space (2019)Saw this with Richard Stanley in attendance at PDX Hollywood Theater and H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival.I went in cold, not knowing much about Lovecraft, and knowing nothing at all about the story. I had heard that Stanley was of some renown for getting sacked from production of Island of Dr. Moreau, with Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer and others, and that he invoked voodoo upon the production out of mischief. If you read the wikipedia entry, Lovecraft's story itself sounds pretty good.Too bad the movie scrambles it up into a tedious admixture of contemporary fear of mixed ethnic mating, cheezball humor, and Cage's now-overworked histrionic raving.It appears Stanley has compressed Lovecraft's epochal tale into a slice-of-life couple of days in the lives of some non-descript city folk turned sheep farmers. Lovecraft's rural homestead is cast as a pastoral bourgeoise retreat with a fine wine cellar, color tv and poor internet service, which is ruining Cage's wife's work as an finance / investment analyst. Her complaints about the internet gets dropped so many times in the script you expect Wall St's bull to appear as a monster, but it's ultimately an inconsequential detail.The tale is pegged to the emotional straights of a pretty goth-occult (Wiccan? Someone behind me in theater grunted nerdly recognition and approval at some distinctive category of her magick that fandom sees as determinant, but like the mom's profession is another inconsequential plot detail) white teenage girl who-while inexplicably casting spells near a lake on her family's property-encounters a handsome black hydrologist (surveyor). This is also inconsequential to the plot. Why is this man there? In Lovecraft's story he's an observer who helps the reader make sense of the odd effects that occur upon the landscape as a result of the meteor impact.In this adaptation, could this man be imbued with a wizardly understanding of the sexual contours of nubile girls? If only... Because as you will see, the entire movie is built around her purely passive, innocent sexual attraction to him somehow splitting the world asunder, rendering the homestead, and destroying them all. That's pretty much it. IOW the contents of the story is nothing more than the slightest potential of a mixed ethnic young love affair destroying the world. The meteor is just a supernatural mcguffin.Meanwhile a bunch of silly stuff occurs. Sadly for the viewer nothing else really happens.The psychic dimensions of the meteor intrusion go totally unexplored, with the events of the plot, alternately disjointed and spuriously interconnected by weak dialog serving no purpose other than to get from one scene to the next, which in the long run serves no point at all.It's a remarkable visual experience, I suppose. But it feels designed for the psychic aptitudes of 12-going-on-40 year olds Cthuhlu nerds-who btw must have very sophisticated visual pattern matching capacities because all manner of intense camerawork and vfx are deployed to try to hold audience interest in a plot that's going down a dark road at the 45-mph maximum speed of Cage's 80s vintage Volvo station wagon.In place of drama, exploration and suspense, you'll see psychedelic vfx ala Annihilation, body horror ala Mandy and a procession of jump scares bookended by old Nick Cage's pro forma crazy-ase hamming.A solid hour of churning monster mayhem and a iridescent light show leave the hydrologist as the last man standing. He looks across a blighted ruin of a landscape turned to ashes by a teenage girl's amorous histrionics, and wonders aloud about the effects of color on the world. I am not making this up.I doubt the director is a bigot, but watching this movie in a sea of Portland Cthulhu hipsters and considering Lovecraft's misanthropy and deep strain of white supremacy / xenophobia, I noticed how much these monsters are simply sprouts of unexamined libido rooted in the acrid soil of America's origins with the rapacious empires of Europe, Puritanical new world flight, the North American genocide, and the lingering scars of the Civil War. Portland is a very white and rejunevile city, and this culture is fit for an episode of Portlandia. Never mind that the movie was made in Portugal.At Q/A after show, Stanley said if you kill a dog you've got a B movie. Well you can get B movie many other ways and dropping Tommy Chong's weed-addled old visage into the mix for no reason is another.Yet the audience seemed to love it and gave a standing ovation. Maybe more out of appreciation for Stanley's appearance at the festival than because they loved the movie?And it's not a good movie. There's some memorable imagery, and some cinematic craft in keeping with this technical age of the movies, but nothing to go on about. The whole effort felt forced.Nobody at the Q/A gave a flying F about the medium as an avenue of cultural exploration re Lovecraft's latent racial politics.I find the mysterianism of the Necronomicon and the rest of this sort of pop occultism tedious, notwithstanding its purely anthropological features.To his credit, Stanley remarked that his teleplay was informed by his great personal fondness for Lovecraft's work and his awareness of Lovecraft's misanthropy and racism. That comment spared him from a pointed question I wanted to ask about the absurdly trivial racial dimension of the plot re mixed ethic love.The festival presentation met the basic parameters of fun but was a typical PDX circle of banal hipster fetish and minor celebrity with the movie less a main feature of the event and more a prop for the fetish.Stanley seems an intelligent and interesting guy and he's worth looking into, esp per the documentary on his de-railed adaptation of the Island of Dr. Moreau and some documentaries which will be difficult if not impossible to find.I hope he keeps making movies so that he can someday redeem the promise hinted at by this competent if not compelling production."}, {"id": 175, "text": "The latter proudly presented by Nicolas Cage.

Bizarre dialogue, over-acting by Mr. Cage, the escalation to full-on insanity happens fairly quickly, but then pauses as we see what the Hydrologist and the town is up to, while the Alpaca Farm goes full magenta gore-fest.

There are a few plot details that are kept, such as some huge, inedible fruit, but that is about it.I was intrigued by the similarities to a haunted house movie like The Shining or The Amityville Horror: the invisible friend of the youngest child, the static on the phone, the descent into madness of the father, the delicate subject that affects one of the characters (breast cancer), the father who still haunts Cage's thoughts, the characters not being allowed to leave (according to the daughter), and even The Necronomicon.While Cage does overact, the children are sympathetic. Unfortunately, though, the characters do some stupid, only-in-a-horror-film things. After everything that has happened and all that you have seen (including horrific, mutated animals), you hear your missing dog's bark coming from the bottom of a strangely-lit well and you climb in to rescue it?Between the overacting and the foolish decisions of some characters, I wondered if this was supposed to be a comedy."}, {"id": 226, "text": "... but not to everyones taste.

Been trying to find a movie with real disturbing creatures since watching Thing and The Void. Something along the lines of DeadSpace creatures. This just didn't do it for me.The flow of the story didn't capture me either. It was over-shadowed by bad acting. Or acting that didn't make sense or go along with the scene/mood. It was almost like they were playing people who were acting, if that makes sense. Nicholas Cage's acting just wasn't good and way too over dramatic to looney. Especially his political change in character when he would act out in rage.The CGI and rushing of story just kind of made this movie seem like it was made in a day. Like everyone involved just did it for fun with no real expectation of the outcome.Perhaps with more budget, the movie could have been longer and made with a more in depth story. If you liked the movie Annihilation (2018), this might entertain you. If you didn't care for Annihilation, like myself, you won't find this much better.

A young girl casts a spell to save her mother from cancer, and is interrupted by a traveling hydrologist who inquires about the property they find themselves on. Nothing about the dialogue feels right. Are they flirting, or are they uninterested? Are they relatable, or are they caricatures? Stanley walks the razors edge between self-aware camp and poorly executed story telling for the rest of the film. Nicholas Cage delivers another one of his riveting performances, and the film is replete with one liners that you will be reciting in the car all the way back home. But this is not a developed horror film, nor is it a movie whose drama invites the viewer to participate in otherwise heart-wrenching and surreal moments that the family must endure after the arrival of their colorful, space creatures. The reason for that, if Stanley had succeeded, would be that genre horror does not need to provide anything aside from visual thrills for its audience. I think there's something to that, and I would hope that can be reflected in this review. A film not rising to above an average quality does not make its value less than average. Stanley has a good grasp of how to dress his characters. A highlight for me was Tommy Chong's back woods character. Instead of being over the top, Stanley's affection for that personality came through Chong's limited screen time.

There isnt any structure to the dialogue after the 40th minute, which renders it completely unnecessary. There are a few hints of intrigue, but thats more because of Lovecraft and less because of Richard Stanley.The premise of the story isnt entirely clear from the beginning and that works well for the movie. The dynamic gets faster and faster the further the story progresses. One of its weakest features for me was the development of the characters or the lack of it. I cant imagine someone being really invested into the struggles of the Gardner family. What keeps us interested is the hope of learning more about the mysterious light and why does it work the way it does. But as you know in the end we are left with a simple platitude about the limitations of the human cognition. That would be fine if we saw a masterfully executed movie, from a technical and creative perspective. Instead we see something reminiscent of a b movie imitation of a Cronenberg film."}, {"id": 254, "text": "Many horror films focus on scaring the characters to the point of either hysteria or resolve, but this fear is less interesting to the viewer because it is flat. Maybe the source of fright is tailored to a psychological event in that particular character's past, essentially pressing the wound. If the good outcome where they overcome their fear is 'green,' and the bad outcome where they succumb to it is 'red,' Colour out of Space ends up as 'orange with purple polka dots.' This is because, although certain elements of the family are distorted through the colour (e.g. the melded statue in the living room possibly influencing the fate of the alpacas, or more obviously Nathan channelling his father's mannerisms), the source of their torment is foreign and probably uncaring as to whether it scares them or not. This allows for a broader range of reactions than the typical screaming and running since the family interacts with the colour like it is a character itself. Sometimes it is curiously beautiful and benign enough not to bother questioning too deeply: the new flowers near the well. During the lightning storm it is like a dream that is forgotten for its singular peculiarity the next day. And when it really starts to mess with the family in life-threatening ways, it doesn't seem like it wants to do this-it is only being itself-but the family's difficulty lies in how they can deal with this new reality, not only psychologically but as humans.Certain scenes standout for their delivery: the immediately engrossing introduction, the reveal of Theresa and Jack's condition, the final visit to Ezra's shack, and the last scene with the dam. It seems like there was fun and creativity from the filmmakers in getting these just right. The soundtrack was also on point, crucial in telling the story, and can be suggested as night-time listening in a dark room.On the first viewing I thought this film had interesting ideas and was reasonably well made, with Cage's acting being the weak point (seven out of ten). I viewed it a second time and saw some more details in the first act and realised there was not much that was unnecessary. I remembered that Nathan went into the accent not because it was poorly done sarcasm but because it was his father's condescendingly intellectual accent.

The average 6.2 IMDB rating is a travesty--COoS is worth, at a minimum, an average of 7.5-8 stars. What the 'Mandy' team pulled off with this HPL adaptation is phenomenal, and the production values are a top-notch effort at bringing the lyrical terror of the HPL story to life.Nicolas Cage's acting is a bipolar rollercoaster and probably COoS's biggest flaw in an otherwise consistently mesmerizing movie. The first and third(final) acts of the film are where Cage's acting is strongest. The intermediate act before Cage and his family fully devolve into madness is definitely Cage's weakest part of the whole film. He has this bizarre east coast accent that almost sounds feminine (probably as a way to mock Lavinia?) and it just sounds cringeworthy and unbelievable. Apart from Cage, I felt that the supporting actors did a great job at their consistency and presented a rather believable spiral into madness.The movie is somewhat ambiguous in its explanation for what actually happens, so I'll give you my interpretation of what happens: The rock is the fragment of a star that has gone supernova somewhere in the galaxy, and it lands in their backyard before it goes full quasar. The massive energy from this star fragment is responsible for the radiation contaminating everything, and since we've never actually been able to experiment what the effects of such an energy source would have on human beings due to the impossibility of orchestrating such an experiment, the scriptwriters were given a huge amount of creative licensing to create their own possible scenarios. In the case of COoS, it's an atomic quantum nightmare from the cosmos.The film itself is somewhat of a slowburn, but the payoff is stunning. The last 20ish or so minutes of the film are searing, and the Alpacas and Lavinia's Mother will probably prove to be two indelible elements from this film that you'll never forget.Worth watching.

Very few of these big-budget stinkers actually give us more than 2-3 basic colours hence most of them look awful, bland, glum. So this was a bit refreshing. Not a brilliant-looking flick, but much better than the standard fare.As for Cage and the rest...1. Cage makes an appearance. Movie is telling us it doesn't want to be good. It's telling us to check our brains at the door.2. Cage comes on to his lovely wife Joely. These two fondling each other is the first horror scene and it's doing the film no favours, not to mention how utterly irrelevant it is to the plot.3. Cage actually volunteers the information to the mayor and the sheriff that he was having sex when the meteorite fell. Is this a bad comedy or a dumb sci-fi? They should have made a decision and stuck with it. I'm not a fan of movies that are a bundle of genre confusion. There is only so much you can do in 120 minutes in one film, and trying to cover all genres isn't a smart idea at all.4. The Cage family needs a scientist to tell them that it's a meteorite. What else would it be? A stray NBA basketball dipped in LSD?5. Cheech (or Chong) plays a generic, clich\u00e9 hippie. Not funny, not interesting, though definitely a pointless character. Perhaps the writer/director is a fan of Cheech (or Chong) hence wrote him into the movie by force, disregarding how that would affect the movie.6. Joely is apologizing to her daughter after she made a totally harmless comment about the scientist, but the daughter is crying like crazy. Why? Joely said nothing wrong. What a useless, pointless scene.7. Pointless and stupid alpaca-milking scene. Probably Cage's own idea. Hey, man, how about if we add a really funny milking scene, dude? I am pretty sure Nick says dude or bro in every sentence. Except when he is doing interviews; he'd been briefed about that often by his hard-working PR team.8. Joely gets transported to the hospital after cutting off 2-3 fingers. Her daughter's reaction after they drive away? Not really bothered, showing no distress, casually chatting. Yet earlier on, she performed a witching ritual to save her from cancer. How do those two scenes gel? They don't. What do these two versions of the girl have in common? Nothing. Or perhaps Joely has her fingers cut off monthly, perhaps it's more common than it appears, so everyone is used to it.9. The next day the girl is wondering why the alpacas are eating, moaning to her brother why he didn't feed them. Doesn't seem too concerned that her mother lost several fingers just the night before. Makes sense...10. More sit-com nonsense with Cage making ha-ha comments about his TV interview. Terrible! he says. No, he wasn't commenting on his bad acting, just his bad wig. Some MST3K riffing and this scene could be truly hilarious.11. Lovecraft is spinning in his grave, wishing he'd never written his story.12. The stupid conversation between Joely and Cage on their way back from the hospital. Includes Cage doing more extraneous sitcom nonsense by imitating opera singing. Funny, no. Cringy, yes. Pointless, yes.13. Cage comes back from the hospital and thereon starts his legendary overacting. He is doing a sitcom version of Jack Nicholson from The Shining.14. Yet when he finds his wife and son merged into an alien creature, he starts underacting! Go figure. Or perhaps he is used to alien monsters, just as their daughter is used to Joely cutting off her fingers.15. Or at least more used to aliens than to the car not starting. That gets him back to overacting mode. (Which studio head OKed this script, and which glue was he on?)16. By the first hour, Cage looks like a cross between Marilyn Manson and Gene Wilder. And this is not the aliens' fault.17. Cage's mood-swings, caused by alien presence, are unconvincing and badly played by Cage. Everyone is going insane, but these transformations aren't handled well either in the script or by the director.Essentially, the film has a reasonable premise, but the casting of Joely and especially Cage, a lackluster script, and too many boring alien-invasion clich\u00e9s cripple the movie's potential. The key premise, the whole shtick about colours, should have been explored in depth rather than just vaguely and briefly mentioned in the last scene. Furthermore, the stereotypical modern-American-movie ha-ha-funny nonsense should have been cut out of the script entirely. Hollywood sci-fi and horror films have been greatly suffering in the last few decades, partially due to this asinine need to inject cheesy unfunny gags into them. Did Alien have sitcom moments scattered around? Was The Exorcist littered with cheap sitcom jokes? No, and that's partially why these films work. There are no such movies these days. Not from Hollywood's big studios anyway.Contemporary Hollywood and its slave-directors, however, haven't a clue how to tackle sci-fi and horror. An over-reliance on CGI made directors and writers complacent. Ironically, a lack of special-effects technology can produce amazing results, exemplified by 1972 Solaris, in which there are awesome scenes of the alien ocean. This ocean looks more impressive, even today, 50 years later, than all the glitzy-yet-boring special-effects in COOS combined.I find it in very poor taste the way Joely and the youngest child were harmed and then killed. There are unwritten rules in cinema, just as in everything, rules which only lunatics such as Jodorovsky are expected to break. But when mainstream directors break them, in big-budget movies intended for the masses as opposed to just a small select audience, is when things get problematic. Not only does the movie kill off the young child, but it does so in a way that reveals the all-encompassing decadence that is now part-and-parcel of increasingly criminally insane Hollywood. Nothing is sacred anymore, hence we can soon expect even more perversion and depravity. Perhaps one of the next alien-invasion movies will show the cannibalization of little children in graphic detail?

The first poor creatures on the farm that get zapped by the alien Organism are the Alpaca's, turning them into a hairless joined together mass of pink flesh, after going out to investigate Nathan's wife (Richardson) and youngest son (Hilliard) also get zapped by the alien pink beam and also end up as a hairless joined together mass of pink flesh, surprisingly Nathan doesn't seem too bothered by this and thinks they will be OK, and can't understand why they are making groaning noises. Nathan (Cage) then decides to get in the car and go and get help, unfortunately it won't start because the battery has become drained (strangely no other vehicle or way of charging the battery is available on the farm) This is the point where Cage gives one of his most over the top performances, probably surpassing his Wicker man performance. Nathan (Cage) then decides to take his anger out on the mutant Alpaca's by shooting them several times, unfortunately during this he becomes engulfed by a pink Alpaca fart that ends up poisoning him causing him to lose his sanity (so not much of a change really) To cut a long story short the hero of the story local hydrologist Ward Phillips (Elliot Knight) who we saw talking to Nathan's daughter Lavinia at the beginning, turns up with the Sheriff (the poor Sheriff doesn't last long) to save the day, believing that the family's illness is caused by contaminated water, but soon finds to his Horror that it is something far more sinister, at first he tries to chat to Lavinia by the well, but finds out she has a bad case of Pink eye (or pink eyes) at this point and he ends up getting zapped,when she touches him, but rather than end up as a mound of hairless pink flesh his mind is impregnated with some horrifying images and the Color shoots out of the Well and into the sky, Ward ends up hiding in the cellar and climbs out the next morning as the soul survivor and sees a type of ash everywhere and the Color nowhere in sight.

Neither character deserved the amount of time spent on them. Ward being present during 'The Strange Days' didn't make any sense. He was notably far too young to be a hydrologist to be sent by the state to survey the land. If it were me deciding who to send, I'd logically pick someone older and more experienced than someone fresh from school. The water safety of an entire town is way to important for such a chance of amateurish error. Why was there a romance subplot between him and Levinia? It wasn't even used to force emotional strain during her death, or blatantly failed to do so if that was the intention. I'd like to specify why Ezzra is so needless, but there's really nothing to elaborate. He did literally nothing whatsoever. One conversation and we're supposed to care about him?There were far too many subplots that didn't do anything, and far too many emphasized details that served no purpose. Part of the the story's mysteriousness was that the general public watched the Gardner family fall into ruin, but the movie chose to focus more on Levenia being a cultist, and Nathan's wife (I forgot her name) being a successful businesswoman, which really didn't mean anything at all. I'm not even sure what her occupation was to be honest.Although I did like some reference to other H.P. Lovecraft's works, like the forecast announcer mentioning Dunwich was fun. But others were forced and actually felt wrong. The strongest example is Levenia just owning a paperback Necronomicon. Anyone who knows Lovecraft's Necronomicon know you don't just buy one at your local Barnes And Noble. Then Levenia does some uninspired ritual using the book to do what? Frankly, I don't know. It's sole purpose has always been to summon the Old Ones, not to curse someone with boils or the like. I just don't understand why it's included at all.The movie is also far too tunnel-visioned. As I've already mentioned, the outsiders view of the Garnders' downfall was half the mystery; not knowing just what is wrong, and what is the color doing to them. However, the movie solely focuses on the family themselves. They hardly even mentioned the farmland or the animals until the later 2nd act, but it's those details that made the color such a mysterious force. I wanted to know how others saw their descent to madness to make the very same insanity real. Until the bizarre fusion (which I did enjoy to an extant) between the young boy and his mother, the mental decay is only represented by a family yelling at one another, which isn't really abnormal for households under stress.Overall the movie felt rush but filled with too much fluff which certainly strained the movie's runtime. There were very specific moments I enjoyed; the aforementioned Dunwich referance in the weather forecast, and the light pouring from the well were well done, but I craved more concrete moments. For example, perhaps the family having waking and screaming nightmare in unison would've been nice, since it's said in the book that the Blasted Heath isn't a place for sound sleep. Maybe the family couldve displayed more abnormal moments. I liked how the Wife waved happily after slicing off her hand. Similar events could've solidified her mental decay. Frankly, being angry and stressed doesn't equal madness. Being calm and happy after you've severed half your fingers, that's freakishly insane.In conclusion, I felt the fluff replaced details and possible alternative subplots, and held this movie back from being a fantastic H.P. Lovecraft adaptation."}, {"id": 308, "text": "First of all, my review is biased by my expectation at a close adaptation. I do understand it would have been extremely difficult to pull. I was hoping for the theme of the short story to be respected.Alienation : In the original story, everything that happen turns to ashes, the only good thing that can happen to a character of the story is if nothing happen. The Colors falls from the sky and protagonist gets a bit of notoriety than it turns to gossiping and abandonment. This is shown a tiny bit in the movie when we see the character of Nicholas Cage somewhat lost during his interview as well as his interaction with the officer at the end.Ignorance : There is no one who is educated that bother to help them, no one knowledgeable to explain what is going own and to offer a possible solution. The character are completely on their own. On the other side, in the movie, the girl knows of witchcraft and owns a copy of the Necronomicon. She cast spells to help. There is also Chong who knows things, and share is knowledge in the end.Isolation : The family being consumed by the Colors is on its own, in a remote farm. No one is there to help them, no one wants to go that far to help them. It is a trip to go there and the officers need to be guided there by the narrator. This is really hard to do in this day and age. That is why I consider the movie pulled it off rather well ! The isolation is shown by difficulty to travel from place to place, the Colors rendering this simple act dangerous by the mutated trees. There is also the issue with remote communication being affected.Powerlessness : In the story, plants, insects and animals touched by the Colors turn lush with life and vigorous, than get consumed by it and die while in the movie, they mutated and acquire predatory traits and increased aggressiveness. It is as if the Colors as an agenda while in the book, it appears more to be a victim of circumstance as well. My understanding of what happened in the book is that the Colors fell on Earth and then consumed something from living things from its surrounding and left Earth when it was readied.Also, in the story, once the Colors touched us, we are aware that something bad is happening to us, that something is taken from us be we cannot do anything about it but remain in complete apathy, wait for our ineluctable demise. Even though the characters seems to stop being themselves in the movie, they are not powerless as they start fighting to achieve some sort of agenda by the Colors. We have a diametrically different energy from the characters, specially from Nicholas Cage.Indifference : In the story, nothing indicate whether the Colors an intelligent life form or if they consider us intelligent. There is no attempt to establish communication with us nor if they have an agenda. They are just here and need to use something we have, something we need in order to return to space. In the end, the officers and narrator simply run off from it as it leaps from the ground to the trees and into the night sky.In the movie, the Colors communicate with the little kid, they lure the oldest brother, they share vision with the girl, they mutated all living things they come across. They acknowledge we exist and they seems to want to subdue us. In Cosmic Horror, Humanity's existence does not matter what we do or what we want. Those of us following entities are just deluding themselves. We are either not acknowledge, toys or tools to be used and discard. It is the polar opposite of Classic Greek Art where humans were the central measure of the Universe.Therefore, the themes are alienation from your community, ignorance and lack of understanding of your circumstance, isolation, powerlessness from what is happening, indifference from the Creature that simply needs to consume. Of all of those theme, only isolation is well carried (and it is no small feats !).All in all, it is an extremely difficult story to realize and maybe a theatrical released movie was not the proper medium. Should you manage your expectations, it will be a very enjoyable movie.Nicholas Cage's energy clash with some of the ambiance of the original story. I would have love to see him in a story where a character lose his sanity rather than a change in the character to cater to his play still. I think Christopher Heyerdahl would have be a better fit for the original ambiance of the story."}, {"id": 309, "text": "I had high hopes for this movie and fortunately, it turned out to be pretty good.

The visual effects, the lighting and the music created an almost dreamlike, fairytale look and atmosphere. There were some rather generic side characters and a few actions that didn't make much sense, but nothing too bad. However, one thing almost made me turn it off early. They added this completely useless character, a young African hydrologist, and made Cage's teen daughter fawn over him while wearing conspicuously revealing clothes.

There are other Lovecraft stories that are far better suited to TV/Film (A Shadow Out of Time, At the Mountains of Madness, Call of Cthulhu), so why in Nyarlathotep's name choose this?Ultimately the film bears very little resemblance to the original story or any Lovecraft story for that matter.

The characters are so silly and have almost comedically over the top traits such as the dumb stoner gamer and the magic ritual girl who carves symbols into her body for no reason, other than dragging out screen time. Everyone fails to make any good choices and noone seems the least bit surprised when the weird stuff starts happening like when the whole yard turns into pink fairyland. The father doesn't seem the least bit fazed when his son and wife are zapped into a gruesome amalgamation in agony and dying, however when he decides to kill his mutated alpacas, that is the one and only time he actually expresses sadness. Ridiculous characters that have no sense or consistency. Cage's acting in almost every scene fails to convey appropriate emotion. Only towards the end when he is suppose to be truly crazy does his acting work. The amount of disbelief you are forced into takes away any ounce of potential horror. The one shoehorned jumpscare is cheap, pointless and annoying. You as an audience couldn't care less if any or all of the characters die. This movie must take place in an alternate dimension where everyone has an iq of 50 and the emotional intelligence of a half-brained ant. The movie is so insultingly stupid and impossible to take seriously that the only horror in the movie is how boring it is. The only emtion I felt was boredom and regret for watching.

The family clearly suffers effects on their minds but moments of clarity come through for some of them. Yet they still don't have an even remotely fight or flight moment, which was very frustrating to watch. The most pathetic response comes from the hydrologist, Ward, who we are led to believe is not suffering from any psychological effects. He knows that there is a contaminant in the water and sees the daughter clearly exhibiting symptoms, as well as everybody else for that matter. Yet, Ward makes no effort to do anything drastic or call any kind of authority. Very cool film; there is a psychedelic quality that makes you feel disoriented. I just wish it didn't use the all too common trope of making characters completely inadequate in order to advance its plot.

The visuals were really good, the acting was decent (Nick Cage reminded me of a poor man's Jack Nicholson. Maybe it was the plaid shirt), the sound design and music were good, too, but the dialogue and overall narrative kind of fell apart when the mother and son are affected by the color. There was some good, practical special effects but they did not really add much to the film for me. The major set piece, where Cage shoots the Alpaca monster played as a crappy allusion to The Thing (1981), but an R. J. MacReady, Nick Cage is not. My main complaint, as is often the case, was the lack of narrative direction, sensical character decisions, and an overall point to the story. It really feels that the starting point, and end point of the film, should have been different versions of the Lovecraft story. It's no Mangler 2, but a true genre masterpiece, this film is not.

The children not so much, but they are nonetheless passable.One issue is that it all moves far too quickly and shows far too much, with additions to the original story that shouldn't have really been there.

But is ruined with the typical everything is destroyed for a five mile radius... but the hero survives hiding under a cardboard box type ending.. shouldve hid in the well!!"}, {"id": 432, "text": "Written and directed by Richard Stanley (his first film in 25 years, after he was infamously fired three days into production on his long-gestating dream project, The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996)), Colour Out of Space is a modernised adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's 1927 short story The Colour Out of Space, and takes a good stab at depicting one of Lovecraft's most oblique entities. Mixing humour and body horror (perhaps weighed a little too much towards humour), the film gives Nicolas Cage another opportunity to go full-Cage, and boy does he lean into it - this is the most ludicrous, histrionic, and borderline farcical performance he's given since Vampire's Kiss (1988), and how much latitude you give him may well determine your opinion of the movie.Just outside the city of Arkham, MA (the fictitious setting of many Lovecraftian stories), Nathan Gardner (Cage), his wife Theresa (Joely Richardson), and their children Benny (Brendan Meyer), Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur), and Jack (Julian Hilliard) have moved into Nathan's deceased father's property, with Nathan embracing rural life by raising alpacas on the property's farm. On an otherwise normal night, the sky fills with pulsating light and a meteorite crashes onto the Gardners' land, and as time passes, the Gardners start to experience ever-more bizarre events - unnaturally localised lightning storms that seem to come from nowhere; huge fuchsia-like plants that seem to grow overnight; a horrific odour that only Nathan can smell; a gigantic purple mantis flying around; radios and the internet cutting out more than normal; the water turning strange colours; the family's dog, Lavinia's horse, and Nathan's alpacas starting to acting strangely; even time itself appears to be corrupted. And soon enough, the family members themselves begin to show signs of unnatural change.After some basic narrative preamble and a contemplative sub-Terrence Malick-style voiceover, the film features one of the most inorganic expositionary scenes I've ever seen, as Nathan and Theresa stand on the porch, and spend a good five minutes telling each other things that they both already know. Thankfully though, the clunkiness of this opening isn't a sign of things to come, and one of the film's most consistent elements is the subtlety with which Stanley depicts the entity, or rather, doesn't depict it. Lovecraft felt that if humanity were ever to encounter real cosmic beings, they could be so unlike anything in our experience as to be impossible to describe, or even process in our minds, and one of his aims with Colour was to create an entity that doesn't conform to human understanding - hence the only description is by analogy, and even then, only in relation to a colour beyond the visual spectrum. With this in mind, Stanley wisely keeps everything as vague as possible - vibrant, modulating pulses of light that seem to be emanating from somewhere just outside the frame, vaguely-defined spatial distortions, colour manipulations with no obvious source, etc.Important here is the colour itself, and instead of attempting to create the indescribable colour featured in the story, director of photography Steve Annis chooses to go the route of not settling for any one stable colour - every time we see the effects of the meteorite, the hue appears to be in a state of flux - so although we can say the colours are recognisable, they're never identifiable as any one specific colour, which, is probably the best choice the filmmakers could have made.As we get into the third act, the film abandons all sense of restraint and goes completely insane, with the body horror which has threatened to break through from the earliest moments finally unleashed, foregrounding the exceptional work of special effects supervisor/creature designer Dan Martin. These scenes are heavily indebted to David Cronenberg, especially his earlier work such as Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), and The Brood (1979), although the most obvious touchstone is Chris Walas's work on Cronenberg's masterpiece, The Fly (1986). A lot of Martin's creature design also seems inspired by the legendary work of Rob Bottin, and there's a direct visual quote of one of the best moments in John Carpenter's The Thing (1982).It's also in the last act where Cage is turned loose, signalled by an epic meltdown when he discovers Benny hasn't closed the barn door and the alpacas have gotten out. From there, it's Nicolas Cage unrestrained. There is a problem with this, however. Full-Cage has been seen in films such as Vampire's Kiss, Face/Off (1997), The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans (2009), Mom and Dad (2017), and Mandy (2018), but each performance has felt fairly organic, never becoming self-conscious. In Colour, however, to an even greater extent than in the virtually unwatchable The Wicker Man (2006), Cage crosses into self-parody, with his performance having as much to do with people's preconceived notions of a Nicholas Cage performance as it does with finding the character. There are a couple of scenes here that seem to have little to do with legitimate character beats and more to do with Cage winking at the audience.Which might be entertaining and all, but which doesn't serve the film especially well. For all its insanity, this is a relatively serious movie, but Cage's performance is so manic, that it affects everything around it. For example, after the aforementioned meltdown (Don't you know how expensive those alpacas were), which just about fits with what we know of the character, as Nathan is walking away from Benny and Lavinia, he stops, turns, pauses, shouts ALPACAS, pauses again, and then walks away. This got a huge laugh at the screening I attended, and it was undoubtedly funny. But does self-reflexive humour by the leading man help tell the story or even create the right tone? No, not in the slightest. In essence, this scene marks the point where the character ceases to be Nathan Gardner and becomes a version of Nicolas Cage.The other characters all have a kind of internal logic to their crumbling sanity; the meteorite affects each of them differently, with their minds disintegrating in different, but consistent ways. With Nathan, however, Stanley seems unwilling, or unable, to establish the parameters by which his mind is breaking down, seemingly going for laughs rather than something more cogent.This issue notwithstanding, I enjoyed Colour Out of Space a great deal. Stanley's return to the director's chair is to be admired for its restraint and how faithful it remains to the very tricky Lovecraftian original. The body-horror in the film's last act will appeal to fans of the grotesque, whilst others will take great pleasure from Cage's insanity, as narratively unjustified as it is. The film is ridiculous on many levels, but it's extremely well realised and well made, and is to be applauded for not trying to attach an explicit meaning to a story which avoids any kind of thematic specificity."}, {"id": 433, "text": "We were all excited about this year's H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival (HPLFF) and the Pacific NW premier of Richard Stanley's colourful Color Out of Space adaption of Lovecraft's famous story.Color shows why Stanley should do more feature films (hopefully more Lovecraft or weird tale adaptions) as his passion and his knowledge of the source material shines through... much like Lavinia's forehead. It is also a very personal film for Richard as it touches on elements from his own life.Over all the film is solid and I think the cinematography is great with very well-done CGI. Richard focuses on the family as he should but it feels like the movie has been edited down as we have gaps in the appearance of certain characters who only appear in the first and last acts. The most creepy and unnerving scene is with actor Tommy Chong near the end of the film... it is really perfect. The weakest part of the film for me is Nicholas Cage ... he is okay but distracts from the film at times. I would have preferred to have seen more of Madeleine Arthur as Lavinia Gardner.Overall I am giving this an 8 since it is a serious attempt at a Lovecraft adaptation and hits the cosmic horror nail on the head... however I think most mainstream viewers won't get the love to source material and give it a much lower rating.It was just a colour out of space - a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes. -- H.P.

Cage is his usual self, very believable despite his frequent overacting, as well as all the others excellent cast members . Some CGI could have been better, some humor felt a bit out of place but overall it was an excellent effort and surely Richard Stanley's best movie to date.

It premiered at TIFF last year but had a brief wide release this year. Lovecraft movies are very hit or miss. Aside from the films of Stuart Gordon, like Re-Animator and From Beyond, no one has really succeeded in making a really good one. His stuff is hard to adapt because a lot of it is short, not easy to adapt into a feature. Also, a lot of the imagery in his stories is intentionally impossible to visualize. That, and his stuff has tons of casual racism in it, even for the time it was written. Color Out of Space is one of the better Lovecraft adaptations out there. It updates the story to a modern setting and it adapts one of his least racist stories, like Stuart Gordon did with Re-Animator. However, unlike Re-Animator, I don't think this movie will be remembered as a classic. The acting isn't that great, with the exception of a good old crazy performance from Nicolas Cage. The effects are well-done, it's bloody and intense and of course it's very colourful, but overall there just isn't really much that's memorable or stand-out about it. It's a solid horror movie, but that's about it. I hear the director wants to do other Lovecraft adaptations like The Dunwich Horror and I think that's great. The movie actually kind of sets up a possible Lovecraft cinematic universe that could be worth exploring and I will gladly watch out for, but I still don't think this movie is the masterpiece that Lovecraft fans have been waiting for. While I don't think it's great and I don't think people will be watching this movie over and over again like Re-Animator, I think this is still worth checking out for horror and sci-fi fans, especially Lovecraft fans."}, {"id": 436, "text": "Color Out of Space is one of the darkest, most sadistic, goriest, and creepiest films I've seen, and that's why it's one of the best horror films ever. Any adaptation of a story by HP Lovecraft is prime material for horror and this one takes the cake. While Stephen King gets all the attention, Lovecraft practically invented horror, and he now needs as many adaptations as he can get. There would be no King without Lovecraft. Nicolas Cage chews the scenery in the best possible way; either he's a maniac or the best method actor possible, we'll never know, but it's brilliant. The rest of the cast perfectly exemplify anxiety, tension and give us the creeps for two straight hours. It oozes creepiness from top to bottom, start to finish, with the most cringe-inducing sights and sounds I've heard in a horror movie. It's the perfect horrific atmosphere and compelling descent into madness. If The Thing had a baby with Annihilation, this would be it, in all it's deformed glory. Richard Stanley seemingly appeared out of nowhere, after a long absence apparently, and brings us this gem. If that's not a great comeback, I don't know what is. He says he's planning to make a trilogy of Lovecraft films, and I just bought my ticket years in advance to see them. Richard Stanley, after directing the infamous Island of Dr. Moreau, then landing in some filmmaking purgatory, shows everyone how it's done, giving us the gold standard for recent horror movies. This film pretty much feels like a big slap in the face to all the stupid ones coming out. Everyone, take notice from Stanley, he's back on top in my book.

Looking forward to more."}, {"id": 437, "text": "TLDR: The Color out of Space is a wild, heady, over-the-top, and terrifically satisfying movie. While flawed, it works almost as much because of its flaws as in spite of them.Adapting Lovecraft to film tends to require a certain amount of interpretive dance. His stories don't always have much dialogue and are often missing the descriptive beats that are now virtually an inviolable law in prose storytelling.That said, every Lovecraft fan has a good idea what should be present in a film adaption, even if he's not sure what needs to be added.Richard Stanley evidently has some very good ideas of what to add, and which actors might be qualified to carry it off.While sticking to the fundamentals and broad outlines of the original short story, he supplies his movie with gorgeous visuals and sounds, relatable characters, and enough crazy behavior to move his audience from the picture of an idyllic Alpaca ranch (yes, the main characters actually raise alpacas) to a hellish landscape of madness, deformity, and desolation.I've seen my share of Lovecraft adaptations. I'm thinking this one might be the best. Unlike the others, it doesn't forget what makes Lovecraft interesting, while still offering its audience (including the people who don't know Lovecraft from Lieber) an exciting and atmospheric experience.I saw Color on Wednesday the 22nd. While not a laugh-out-loud kind of guy myself, plenty of people there were, and showed it. It is, at times, a very funny movie. Until it's not. Then the theater got very quiet. There were reasons.So is Nicholas Cage as over-the-top in this movie as you'd expect him to be? Sure, more or less, at least some of the time. But I can't help feeling he found a very good place to do it.The Color out of Space is a wonderful movie--uneven, mesmerizing, surprising, beautiful, and a really great time. If you like horror (or Lovecraft or Cage or Stanley), you should definitely see it--now, while it's on the big screen, sounding and looking as large as a Lovecraftian horror should."}, {"id": 438, "text": "Color Out of Space starts with Lavinia, the young daughter of the Gardner family, conducting a ritual to help her sick mother and to get her out of her secluded farm, out of coincidence or may be it was summoned a a strange meteorite strikes the farm which has along what it carries an apocalyptic effect over the whole family and maybe the whole world.A decent modernized yet disturbing adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's The Colour Out of Space, as well as the horror factor I believe the film touches some humanity aspects as well in a family relationship and connection. The acting was aqueduct by all, I give the filmmakers props for painting the scenes with the colored effects of the meteorite which seemed flowing out. I believe it's a shame not to pay much attention for the the science behind the events e.g., the sound effects of the crash which felt off, the meteorite size compared to the impact crater.Yet by the ending of this cosmic trippy horror whether the audience loved it or loathed it, it's hard to deny that it's an interesting visual ride which floats the movie over its B Horror roots."}, {"id": 439, "text": "First of all it is absolutely essential to establish initially that this movie is in no way a lovecraftian movie but rather advertised as one.People who expect something remotely reminiscent of Lovecraft will be absolutely disappointed by this movie.I was excited to hear about it's announcement and shocked to see who was the protagonist.I could hardly imagine an actor more unsuitable for the role than Cage.Of course anyone who's ever read Lovecraft could tell you the same which in turn shows that the director has absolutely no clue about his subject.That was the first clue of what was about to come.Still the colour out of space is one of my favourites novels and i tried to keep an open mind.Let's start by the positives.The movie is visually perfect. The special effects are stunning and the scenes depicting the colour are flawless.Unfortunately this is where the positives stop.The movie fails in every other aspect to be not just a decent lovecraftian movie but also just a decent horror movie.The plot is slow which is not necessarily a bad thing but the action is stagnant.It has no climax.You don't feel like the horror and anxiety are actually escalating partly because the main protagonist fails horribly to deliver a performance that reminds us of all the terror and uncertainty a lovecraftian character feels and partly because the plot doesn't help. You see the thing about the plot is that there's hardly a plot.A very small part of the movie actually has to do with the plot which is very sloppy since no effort was put on it.Instead what you'll mostly see is the desperate attempts of the protagonist to fit in the shoes of a lovecraftian character trying to emulate a feeling of terror which he has never been able to accomplish in his entire career as an actor and some flashy special effects which in the director's mind are more crucial than building a plot .But although the plot is hardly relevant to Lovecraft's work the worst by far is that the movie fails spectacularly in the most crucial part of actually being a lovecraftian movie.At no point in the point it makes you feel the terror and escalating madness that Lovecraft's works are notorious for and Cage's attempts are hilariously inadequate to mimic the feeling of helplessness that Lovecraft's protagonists have in his works.The absolute terror that they feel when confronted with something that is not only greater than them but also incomprehensible to them and the dive into madness they take when they realise how small and irrelevant they are in the face of Lovecraft's eldritch abominations.To sum up this movie failed because of a director who completely neglected or made an effort at all to understand his subject and because of his bad choices regarding actors as well as his inability to present a plot that was already written perfectly for him.Somehow Lovecraft's written work seems more alive and impactful on generating feelings than a high budget movie made in 2019.There are plenty of movies made regarding Lovecraft that although they were made 30+ years back are actually closer and depict successfully his dark and twisted world managing to enter deeper into the writer's mind that this movie would ever hope to do.Movies like from beyond and Re-animator which although old would eat movies like this for breakfast with their majestic plot progression and flawless and meticulous look into the very essence of Lovecraft's work.We can only hope that the director of this movie won't attempt to murder Lovecraft again for the third time!"}, {"id": 440, "text": "With Lovecraft Country in my recent memory, it seemed like a good time to watch an adaptation of one of his actual stories. Color Out of Space is a modern retelling of the short story of the same name and I genuinely can't decide if I hated or really liked it.A Meteorite crashes on the grounds of the Gardner family's woodland homestead. Though it quickly disappears it appears to have a profound effect on both the nearby organic life and localised electrical fields. The effects eventually reach the family affecting their perceptions of time, colour and in some cases reality. Are these changes really happening, or has something leaked into the groundwater and is slowly poisoning the Gardeners?So many Lovecraftian stories aren't adapted into films and shows because their narratives, and in particular their resolutions, in which characters, and often the narrators, descend into madness is difficult to translate. Color Out of Space works (or perhaps doesn't work) because it decides to show that spiralling confusion and psychosis. The producers landed on the natural leading man for showing this, and Cage doesn't disappoint. Initially a slightly bland protagonist, the meteors effect on him is demonstrated by him doing a dead-on Donald Trump vocal impression before locking his family in various rooms, shouting at them, insisting that everything is OK and talking to people who aren't there.As the story runs on, aspects of Cronenberg or perhaps early Peter Jackson body horror come into the film, these are some of the most successful moments in a film that is visually striking all the way though. The effects appear largely practical and a game Joely Richardson must have wondered what she'd signed on for at certain points.Those looking for convention, either in horror or just storytelling, are likely to be disappointed and I can't help but thinking I too would have been more satisfied with just a little more understanding of the rules of the film, i.e. what the color can actually do as opposed to just everything - but I was certainly never bored and am still thinking about the film a couple of days later."}, {"id": 441, "text": "There are these two horror writers I love and admire - Stephen King &amp; H.

I'm happy to say that Color Out of Space might just be the best Lovecraft screen adaptation ever. Also being a huge fan of Nicolas Cage, this project was on my radar from the very beginning &amp; above all, it's the resurrection of Richard Stanley's career.Color Out of Space is a visceral, eerie and, well, quite the bonkers horror movie with all kinds of oddities, awesomeness and even humor sprinkled all over it. The movie starts off (and ends) with a narration by the character of Ward Philipps (see what they did there?), the first half might seem a little too slow for some, but it's a pretty crucial mood-setter. We get introduced to the Gardner family, each of their wishes, ambitions, problems, emotions, soon enough the meteorite comes and all slowly goes to hell. Masterfully so. Plot-wise it's not very substantial and thank god for that - Richard Stanley tried to harness from Lovecraft's story all the right ingredients, the irrational fear, sticky atmosphere, the eeriness and limitless void of the unknown. The cast provides great performances, especially the man of the hour Nicolas Cage, the role fit him like a glove. For everyone who likes the crazy Cage, Color Out of Space is a must-see. And, of course, a must-see for all the Lovecraft admirers as well. Richard Stanley's first full feature since 1996 also stands out in the technical and aesthetical departments, the cinematography, editing &amp; production design provides a vivid, visceral and just plain beautiful visual atmosphere, topped off with the talented composer Colin Stetson's (Hereditary) haunting score. And mad props to the FX team, both the practical parts and the cgi was nailed, given the fact that this is indeed an indie horror, a top-tier B flick.Of course, in full honesty, while Color Out of Space is undeniably awesome, it does have its flaws, the pacing might be a little too slow at times, maybe too much comedy on Alpacas, but my only personal complaint is that slightly annoying feeling somewhere in the back of the mind that states the movie's true potential wasn't fully realized. But the fact remains that this is an amazing and important addition to the Lovecraft's movie niche &amp; if you didn't know it yet, Richard Stanley has promised to make a whole universe of Lovecraft movies.

Obviously long gone are the days of big blockbuster films where his star-power was enough to carry a film all by itself, but much like Shia LaBeouf what he is doing currently looks a lot more fun and up his alley. He seems to love the freedom to go absolutely crazy with a role and basically do whatever he wants. He's not bad at it either. He was quite captivating to watch in 'Color Out of Space' as were the entire cast for that matter.This is an extremely visually unique film. The use of colours in the film (a part of the plot - sort of at least) is incredibly beautiful and makes the film very distinct and memorable for that reason alone. Also the film is a lot darker than I expected it to be. Around the halfway point in the film something happens that really took me off-guard and and took the film to another level in terms of brutality.I feel like Stephen King would like to have his name to a film like this. Back in the day when he still cared about his writing this is the kind of story he would've created. The only downside of the film to me was the ending. It felt a bit flat and uncreative, almost like they couldn't think of a proper and fitting way to conclude it.

I have heard some elaborate explanations of how it's some sort of ultraviolet or something but that's honestly nonsense. It's pink, the audience experiences it as pink and Nicolas Cage even acknowledges it being pink in one of the scenes. Furthermore the writing, acting and ESPECIALLY the special effects are very weak and make it feel like a TV production.

Pink trees, mutated animals, unexpectedly abundant harvests, that sort of thing.Among the afflicted is Cage himself, who revels in the chance to amp up every last one of his craziest on-screen tendencies. My god, what a Cage-being-Cage film this is. He's howling, he's gesticulating, he's painted in blood and cackling, he's... suddenly and inexplicably changing accents? I'm not sure how much direction he took here, because it looks like they just focused the cameras and kept rolling while their star actor did whatever felt good, with the occasional interruption from family members or special effects showcases. And, as perversely entertaining as that can be, it doesn't merit a film unto itself.The scraps that surround those indulgent bouts of overacting are awfully scant, narrow and underdeveloped, like the worst '80s straight-to-video productions. It's trippy, but pointlessly so. We get cryptic prophecies and arcane imagery as props, mere window dressing that's waved around and then forgotten. Even the visuals can seem laughably dated, particularly the goopy, absurd creature effects.

Aside from the kids and Ezra, the other cast is kind of hit and miss, but they are not present in the movie for too long so I can give that a pass.There is effort put in how this movie was directed, visualized and even the sound made scenes very unsettling. Some scenes could have used more work, but I love the fact that the story takes its time to invest you in the characters. Even the Alpacas were a sweet touch.Since this is a Lovecraft movie, we all know that there is no happy ending here and that the creature just exists without even realizing humans are around it.

Even the great Stephen King has borrored generously from his work, and many movies have been spawned from his legacy. By far the most have been more indirect references, while only a few have been direct adaptations. While many of them (as is par for the course in all genres, but in horror in particular) were not at all that good, many of them were very well done and have inspired, scared, and delighted moviegoers for decades to varying degrees. Movies like Midnight Meat Train, The Void, In the Mouth Of Madness, Reanimator, It, and even Hellboy owe a great deal, if not all, their inspiration to Lovecraft's work.For all this amassed body of work, few movie makers ever try to stay very close to the actual Lovecraft work, and there are arguably some good reasons to do so. To depict madness inducing multidimensional realities, largely atmospheric details based far more on feelings and descriptions than on actual monsters and events... to try to capture in image form DREAD which is far better imagined than shown, is a task that is daunting at the very least.I must say though, while definitely not strictly adhering to the original text in making a modern version of The Color Out of Space, this version is one of the truest adaptations of any Lovecraft tale I have yet to see, and easily one of the best. It has enough flash and modern context to bring new viewers to the Lovecraftian ethos, while still keeping the core atmosphere and subject matter of the story alive. It is delightful to see such a reverent interpretation of a story that I, in absolute truth, cut my teeth on at the beginning of my lifelong enjoyment of horror. it is also great to hear the director, Richard Stanley, is planning on tackling more Lovecraft tales soon.This story in particular was a memorable one for me as a kid... and I am glad to see it given its due. Only one other adaptation is better in my opinion... and if you liked this version and would chance to see an even more direct (albeit also a slightly more artistically abstract) version, I would HIGHLY recommend you see Die Farbe (aka The Color), which is a German version from 2010.Happy viewing.(PS, I know of an Italian version as well that i have yet to see.

Stanley as a visionary (and he is) is out to be creepy while also indulging in creature fx that is mostly impressive and only disappointing when it involves some of the CGI monsters (the praying mantis alien is a stand out though) - and the plethora of purple lines), and I enjoyed seeing his enthusiasm for Lovecraft and letting his cinematographer and lighting team go  manic here. He's going for shocks more than dread het there's some of that too - and sometimes it's funny, too (who let Chong in? Hey why not)Did I mention this is Cage going Full Cage? It doesn't seem that way at first, even with the Alpalca milking... And then halfway through it seemed to click as he reached into his reservoir for freak outs, slow moving panic bouts, and shotgun blasts. I'm not even sure if it's entirely a *good* performance, and his character's motivations are all over the map, and at the same time Im just happy he's having fun with it all. It's a performance that has the context for it to go off the rails, and as a contrast to the relatively normal work of the younger performances.Bottom line, this is grisly, weird, and charged with terror.

The thing is, that's the point. It's very similar to the mythos of cthulu, a ''thing'' from ''somewhere'' that we cannot comprehend or overcome. It's not something you can beat or stop. Nothing will get in it's way, and the only thing you can do, is get out of it's way. It makes for a terrifying horror film, where you hope for every character but you don't have a lot of hope.As for the casting, everyone does a good job, there's no distracting performance in my opinion except the ever controversial nicolas cage. Again, this is a personnal choice but I think he's perfect. It remind me of Jack Nicholson in the Shining. It was a perfect cast because he's supposed to be creepy and go crazy, and Jack had pretty much played the creep all his life! Nicolas Cage is similar. He's supposed to go nuts and, well, he either is or acts it damn well! I truly believe he's deeply in love with his wife, he acts very well through emotional scenes and when he goes crazy, he plays perfectly. He's perfect for the part.The set and cinematography are also great, the color is great at being beautiful one second and terrifying the next. It's perfectly eary and always feels a bit off, which is the point. The whole movie is shot very, very well. It's great at hinting at things in the dark without revealing too much, yet can still capture beautiful scenery with detail whithout boxing you in a spot.

Lovecraft's short story. There are shades of The Thing, Videodrome , Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers and even Poltergeist in this film but they contribute to a synthesis which Stanley can claim as his own. Nathan (Nicolas Cage) has moved his family to a remote farm where he raises alpacas and grows tomatoes. Each member of the family are unhappy in their own way: Nathan is a frustrated artist who drinks too much; his wife Theresa (Joely Richardson), a financial adviser has had a mastectomy, she can't get a good connection with the wifi; daughter Lavinia (Madeline Arthur) turns to Wicca and performs rituals to cure her mother, older son Benny (Brendan Meyer) smokes pot, younger son Jack (Julian Hilliard) is introverted and only relates to the dog Sam.

Soon local flora and fauna are being affected, this is no ordinary fallen stone. Ever been menaced by a mutated moggie? Even stranger things happen to the alpacas, as for the tomatoes, they give Cage an excuse to chew up the scenery. It also becomes obvious that humans are coming under the control of a malign force. Also involved in this mess are Ezra (Tommy Chong), a tech savvy hippie who lives off the grid and realises all is not well along with Ward (Elliot Knight), a hydrologist who notices that the water is contaminated. Nathan's incompetence as a farmer is the butt of many jokes, when a TV team come to report on the meteorite he is described as an amateur farmer and bourbon connoisseur.But there is little other humour in the film apart from Cage going crazy, he starts off being a bit cranky but ends up not just chewing but literally devouring the scenery. This is a disturbing film, the menace starts off slowly but Ward's voice-over of the strange tree and hills and glens of the country near Arkham sets a sinister tone. The ineffable colour itself provides the Lovecraftian tentacles here as they reach out, smite and coerce. Scenes of savage violence and grotesque horror predominate in the latter part of Color as it proceeds to a grand guignol finale . Not a film for the squeamish or faint of heart.

H.P. Lovecraft's original short story, The Color Out Of Space, is motivated by mood, not character, which makes it a difficult story to adapt. Stanley gives a careful and meticulous adaptation of Lovecraft's story, even though the film does not take itself too seriously at all.He uses the core story from the source material and adds autobiographical elements and his own sense of humor to it. It essentially fills out all the other colors in the spectrum for the film, pun intended. For example, Lavinia, the daughter character, is a Wiccan; Richard Stanley practices witchcraft in real life.There's a strange in-joke going on with Alpacas and how the majority of people are oblivious to them being a source of milk. Every time Nicolas Cage utters the word alpaca, there's an over-inflection on the word and it's delivered with this wink to the audience like they are in on the joke. That aspect of films having obscure twisted messages hidden by the director for people to find is something I gravely miss from films now. That's the kind of humor this film is operating on and I ate it all up.The final results are part H.P Lovecraft, part Richard Stanley, part B-movie midnight horror and part Nicolas Cage. The strongest parts were all in the first half where the film was building up its mood and delivering a sense of foreboding. You don't know what's happening and there seems to be a bigger mysterious force at play beyond the characters' comprehension, and it's effectively creepy. The short story reads that way as well and Stanley does a great job recreating that creepy slow-building mood for the screen.The choice of bright magenta for being the color is a great choice. In the short story, the color is described as indescribable and is outside the visual spectrum of humans, which is quite a conundrum in a visual medium. Magenta is not the color I would associate with being scary. Whenever magenta shows up, things get both trippy and unsettling as it burns brightly and screams onscreen.When the chaos starts happening, the film was less interesting because it felt like glimpsing behind the magician's curtain, seeing what was going on and losing a sense of the mystery. That's where the B-movie horror element comes in and while some of those gore moments are darkly funny, things become predictable. The laughs undercut the scares at times, but I suppose it's part of the impending insanity of it all. Watching this film with a midnight madness audience would gravely enhance the latter parts, so I do recommend seeing it with company.Nicolas Cage incorporates an array of acting styles, starting off more nuanced at the beginning and tunes it to theatrical as his character Nathan descends into madness.When Cage goes full Cage, he redoes a familiar craziness by whipping out that weird faux American British mixed posh accent he did in Vampire's Kiss. It is self-parody but a planned intentional self-parody. It is as if Cage is drawing upon one of his famous performances to build a language with the audience on a whole another level.The standout is Madeleine Arthur, who plays the daughter Lavinia, who acts as the emotional anchor and the glue holding the film's various tones together. Arthur's genuine reaction to the meteor and the strangeness that's happening around her keeps the film moody and scary.Color Out Of Space will probably play best for midnight madness horror fans with popcorn tossed in the air shrieking and laughing through it together. While I suspect it's not where Stanley's true sensibilities lie, the B-movie midnight madness horror is a great way to package his films as a commercial element and it fits his fort\u00e9 very well. For the H.P. Lovecraft fans, it will be a question of whether they can go along with Richard Stanley and Nicolas Cage's quirky sense of humor.Film fans who are unfamiliar with Richard Stanley's story can check out Lost Souls: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley, the documentary about the disastrous 1996 production of The Island of Dr. Moreau. Stanley was fired off the film, lived in the Australian jungle, and snuck his way back into the production as an extra.Stanley is a fascinating writer-director and it's great to know he's making feature films again. In the film festival press circuit, he spoke of wanting to adapt two more H.P. Lovecraft stories and make his own H.P. Lovecraft trilogy as his next future project.

His writing is mostly description and explained by a narrative voice with little dialogue. Writer-director Richard Stanley does a fine job of creating characters from a piece of fiction that offers little to extract in terms of characterisation, while updating the source material for the modern era.'Color Out of Space' is a slow-burn, easing you into the lives of people whose existence will soon be altered forever by something otherworldly and hostile. The landscape becomes drenched in pink; a colour that has never looked so hypnotic and malevolent before now.Thanks to strong direction and terrific sound design, this science fiction horror establishes an atmosphere so thick it's almost choking. The film builds towards an unforgettable conclusion of Carpenter-esque nightmare fuel, complete with gruesome body horror and a sinister synth score.Overall, 'Color Out of Space' is a treat for genre fans, featuring a typically crazy Nic Cage performance (who's in his element when descending into insanity), a well-crafted narrative that creeps under the skin and stays there, and grotesque imagery that just gets nastier as the film goes on.

I don't know if I would have even heard of it if not for the cross section of two of my passing interests (H.P. Lovecraft and Nicolas Cage) happening to get some Venn Diagram synergy bonus to my perception check. I'm not enough of a fan of either of them for this movie to blip on my radar but with both of them coinciding it flew just high enough to get my attention.It's weird. It's trippy. Strange creatures, body horror, and cosmic glimpsing despair all add to its disturbing, intense, and skin-crawlingly discomfort and terror. It has Nic Cage doing both serious and insane acting and Tommy Chong (Up In Smoke) playing a hippie dude who seems right at home, squatting on Nicolas Cage's land in this film. The sound design churns and scrapes your nerves raw like chains dredging up a river for a dead body. It simply delivers everything I was hoping to find in this movie.I feel like I could end my review right there and the target audience will recognize this film for what it is... a transcendent exploration of the terror of the unknown in an indifferently powerful universe. So let's break it down now into what I think makes this film so special out of those above superlative compliments I just lay on so thick.Starting with Nic Cage (Army of One), I'll say that this is one of my favorite of his performances in recent years alongside the insane film Mandy. Cage has a long history of acting insane on and off screen but also being a very good actor. He may make wild choices but that is because he is trying to push the boundaries of his performance the same way an athlete might push how fast they can run or high they can jump. Sure they may not always get a personal record but if they don't swing for the fences they never will. Cage swings hard every time and this film is no exception.In fact, I would say that this film is a great showcase for Cage's range.As his normal world unravels around him, his wife, and three kids, he runs the gamut from awkward dad of teenagers, loving and dutiful husband, angry and impatient father, fearful protector, crazy murderer, desperate whimpering fool, and of course, the weird crazy acting that Cage has occasionally allowed us to glimpse in films like Vampire's Kiss. If you like Nic Cage for his range, insane tendencies, and interesting film selections then this one won't disappoint.When it comes to the way that this film induces terror, it doesn't rely on cheap tricks to make you startle although it doesn't eschew the practice entirely. Instead it uses a variety of methods to create an atmosphere that feels completely uncertain and wild. Just when you think you have a handle on what kind of insanity this alien presence is unleashing upon our family, the film surprises you with another level of unexpected strangeness that has you literally grabbing the arms of your theater seat when the scene changes as you wonder, Oh great! What's going to happen NOW?!I'll admit this may frustrate some audiences. Many times when I read or listen to people discuss horror that speak at length about how horror should be grounded in rules that are clear so that the audience knows what to be afraid of. If you don't know that a monster, for instance, can eviscerate you, then you won't be as scared if you do. This movie throws that kind of thinking out the window and says,  Well what if there is no monster and what happens to you is so foreign and unknown that evisceration seems too grounded and familiar a thing to actually be scary anymore. There are moments in this film where you fully believe that the characters would take a known quantity any day of the week over what is happening, maybe not happening, or perhaps has already happened to them.If this seems like a scattered thought, that is somewhat intentional. It's scattered because it is about the unknown and it would be sort of silly if I was really able to nail down something like how this film tackles the unknown. Being able to speak clearly on it would be a clear indication that the film didn't really accomplish its goal.My favorite ways, and the ones that will probably get the most attention online, are the blending of special and visual effects, creative lighting, and fascinating sound and score mixes. If I could compare it to another exploration of insanity and isolation The Lighthouse this film is in many ways the opposite of that one. In The Lighthouse, Eggers employs mostly traditional camera techniques and lighting language to communicate the story of a man's unraveling sanity. He strips the film down till the tension is created mostly by the brilliant performances and stark setting. It is terrifying because it is so raw, real, and stomach dropping as realizing you are on an island with someone who is totally willing to kill you.Color Out of Space on the other hand pumps the film full of color and sound that whirls in unnatural and unpredictable ways with just enough grounding to convince you it is real. The colors remind me of Nicolas Winding Refn's Only God Forgives or Harmony Korrine's Spring Breakers but the sense of insanity is more about how ungrounded it seems to be. It's not the fear of being killed. It's the fear of something worse than being killed happening to you. Something you can't even begin to fathom or imagine.The film unfortunately does have a couple weaknesses. The daughter, Lavinia, played by Madeleine Arthur (Big Eyes) is great in the latter half of the film but I really didn't care for her in the early stages of the film. I just found her way less believable as the pseudo Wiccan googly eyed crush driven brat that she is trying to play in that part of the film than the terrified little girl just trying to make it out with her family.There were also a few moments where the CGI didn't cut it for me. Not in the spectral universe exploration sequences or even the environmental and light effects but in some of the rendering of body effects that were either not done practically or sweetened enough in post that they lost their realistic grounding.Ultimately, these are nitpicks, though. None of these moments last long and there is so much going on and whirling in your head by the end of the movie that a few bad 3D models or a slightly wooden or under affected performance moment will hardly pull you out of the movie very far.If you are one of those people who are looking for an alternative to the popular horror, slasher, Conjuring 5: The Annnabelle Con-Nun-drum fare of the American cinema these days, Color Out of Space will have you rubbing your eyes squinting as the house lights come up and thinking I don't think I've experienced anything quite like that before."}, {"id": 462, "text": "This movie is 100% the movie they wanted to make.I have read some Lovecraft but this was not one of the ones I have read.From the trailer I thought it would be similar to the 2000 Japanese horror film Uzumaki where people are menaced by the geometric concept of spirals. I thought people in this movie would be menaced by the color Pink. And they more or less are, but it is just so much more. So much more.The cast does a really great job the whole time.Tommy Chong is very Tommy Chong, and yet adds levels to it not seen in That 70's Show or the Cheech and Chong movies. I have met people like this character.Nicolas Cage is a very Nicolas Cage father. The mother, the kids and the Water Surveyor are all great.They keep calling the young son Jack Jack. So thinking about the Incredible superhero baby is a happy thought to hold on to in a reality warping horror movie.The colors and effects are all spot on and great. Other reviews I have seen have likened it to a 1982 movie by John Carpenter and that comparison is apt.The January 22nd 2020 screening I went to included a video at the end from the Hollywood Premiere where Oswald Patton spoke with Nicolas Cage and Richard Stanley about the movie and Stanley said this was the first of a series of Lovecraft films from him. The next being The Dunwich Horror, which is great news. This movie was amazing and I am super down for more."}, {"id": 463, "text": "REVIEW - COLOR OUT OF SPACEI saw the trailer for this film quite a few months ago about a metior falling to earth and making the family who's land it had fallen onto act strangely.I thought initially that the film was just going to be a horror movie but after watching the movie its a whole lot more.The premise of the story is excellent, whatever life forms were on the metior trying to terraform earth into their own planet by playing with matter and time but.........The movie itself is so boring, dragging it's self from the start to finish with no real essence to the film which is such a shame because this could have been the Omega Strain of the 2000s.What a wasted opportunity to make an excellent film but one which was thrown away.So yes the film was so much more than a horror but more bad than good.Rating 3 out of 10"}, {"id": 464, "text": "In my opinion Hollywood has a less than stellar track record when it comes to adapting the Cosmic Horror of H.P. Lovecraft. I think that the theme of human insignificance in the face of the incomprehensible and unknowable must be hard to portray in a visual medium like film. After all, contact with this terrible knowledge results in insanity or death.That said, I think Richard Stanley did a credible job in bringing this story to the screen. He stayed pretty close to the source material with the exception of an additional character. Set and setting were updated to a more modern time without damaging the integrity of the story.The visuals were well done giving an hallucinatory feel to the sense of dread and doom.Even the casting of Nick Cage was not fatal to the film as I had anticipated. He did well portraying a man losing his grip on his known reality in the face of an incomprehensible and terrifying one.I very much enjoyed this film and really hope the talk of Stanley doing a trilogy with The Dunwich Horror possibly being the next one comes to pass."}, {"id": 465, "text": "I first became a fan of Richard Stanley because I found myself utterly addicted to his cult film called Hardware (1990) which I thought was aesthetically special, bombastic, and a kick ass cyberpunk cinematic experience with fun music. I also loved the style of the film so I was looking forward to enjoy this for a while. Richard Stanley's comeback, with Color Out of Space.Where do I begin, Well first of all, HP Lovecraft is cosmic horror royalty. We know that. but Richard Stanley is back, the 80's called, and have a left over relic undiscovered until now with a love letter to HP Lovecraft, and where that page left off on was a fascinating trip to pick things back up on. From here on this page. The cosmic nature has no mercy. This is more eccentric art horror than it is drama. Of course it has it's cheesy bits, some that could have been less rough around the edges, but it cuts it's own path. The cgi is a little heavy-handed in some parts, mainly the filters that borderline on cartoony at times. But the aesthetic and bright pink and purple is easily forgiven as a call back to Lovecraftian neon horror like From Beyond (1986).But the execution here is something to appreciate. Not with out flaws of course. But it is there to have fun and ponder the perils of Lovecraft through Richard Stanley's vision, the Lovecraft adaptations are getting more distinct with this entry in the Lovecraft cinematic universe that has evolved.The MUSIC score is an incredible part of the experience and worth mentioning and deserves praise for stealing the power of some of the ambiance and making it all *work*.Lovecraft, the writer who barely made money while he was actually alive conjuring up these wonderful cosmic horror stories; To see how his art has impacted the world and not to mention translated and kickstarted a whole genre -that is something so much more... Is the stunning truth of the nature here.Damn. This is not a perfect movie to watch over and over, but it does Lovecraft a bit of due time! I read the short story before watching, and yes, it is quite faithful but also takes it's own liberties for sure and can borderline on forgivable cheese.Howard Phillips Lovecraft brought me here, and I was not too disappointed. It's unforgiving, haunting, grisly. and a decent small bite."}, {"id": 466, "text": "So, I finally got to watch and enjoy a faithful HP Lovecraft adaptation. Richard Stanley is (in)famous for heavy use of fluorescent and bright colors in his movies, like Dust Devils and Hardware. This movie has all his standard trademarks, but is not marred with a slow, convoluted story or troublesome production and studio interferences. This is a simple story that gets infused with cosmic horror/terror. This might be his best work to date.The cinematography, music, sound design, screenplay, even the acting is all on point. Nicholas Cage does a good job, and he goes full Nic Cage only when the movie needs him to. Tommy Chong is fantastic, as is basically every character. The colors are all turned up to 11, making for a unique cinematic experience that every movie/horror/sci-fi/HPL buff needs to make time for. It's like 'Mandy', but with stronger and more trippy colors.Glad Richard Stanley is back to making the movies he wants to make. Loved that it was more focused than any of his other movies I've seen. 110 mins quickly flew by and I wanted more. I was never bored. It's already one of my favorite 2020 flicks. It's far from perfect, but it does a great job. This will go mostly unnoticed because regular moviegoers now only care about bland popcorn flicks, i.e. movies for mass consumption, but I'm thrilled movies like this still get made."}, {"id": 467, "text": "I don't know an awful lot about H.P. Lovecraft's written work, but 'Colour Out of Space' is based on one of his stories and I can't say how faithful it is, but it certainly is 'out there.'Nicolas Cage plays the father of a family living in the middle of the woods whose lives are severely disrupted by a meteorite landing in their back garden. Naturally, things don't go well as this lump of rock contains a lot more than they bargained for... namely a lot of 'purple.'The film comes in at about one hour and forty minutes and don't expect too much in the way of horror or monsters in the first half. It's all about building the characters (quite slowly!), but don't turn it off in disgust as it sure picks up in the last act. It's a kind of psychedelic horror film with plenty of gross effects and excellent computer generated weirdness. There seem to be a lot of 'practical' creature effects mixed with some great use of computer-generated graphics where the colour purple swirls around our human landscape.Nicolas Cage is possible the film's major selling point when it comes to 'star power' and he does his best to 'dial back' his natural tendency to 'chew up' the scenery. He plays quite a muted character (by his own acting standards) and only really hints at going 'full Cage' towards the end.It's quite a slow film, but ultimately if you like your creature-features then you'll probably find it quite rewarding in the end."}, {"id": 468, "text": "If you know anything about the movie going in, you'd know it's a science-fiction horror film staring Nicholas Cage where in a fallen meteorite causes reality to go sideways on a family farm. That's pretty much the movie. I haven't read the short story by H.P. Lovecraft in years, so how faithful it is I don't know off the top of my head, but it hit all the right marks. Mystery, aliens, strange colors and sounds, and a family situation going south real fast.I think the most positive thing I found in this, honestly, was that none of the characters irritated me. Everybody was pretty well put together and believable. The movie was devoid of stupidity. I can't stand sci-fi horror films filled with idiots. I was locked in for the run time and was almost just creeped out enough. It's more scifi than horror so the film is largely devoid of any, edging around corners, anxiety inducing, moments or jump scares. The sounds and cinematography were well done.I have mixed feelings about Nicholas Cage's character as the father. Nick seems incapable of delivering normal human speak so he's either mildly weird or he's at an 11/10. This time around his normal is within reason so I found him tolerable and his crazy person fit the film perfectly when it was time to do that. In my head I can picture a couple actors that might have done a better job of balancing the normal and crazy, but would they have been able to bring the crazy like nick? I'm not so sure.I wanted to give this movie a 7/10 because I'm not leaving the theater feeling like it made an impression me, but a 7 feels low. I would say if you like this kind of thing its an easy 8/10. If you're taking a chance and you're not familiar with Nick Cage being Nick Cage this is closer to a 7/10."}, {"id": 469, "text": "Wow .. imagine the apocalypse - but not in bleached out and bleak colours, .. but in highly saturated colours.

The cast is great with all quality performances. The look of the film is fantastic and creates a surreal, thick atmosfearI really loved this movie and give it a 10 to help balance out the neigh-sayers,Treat yourself to some old school cosmic horror.It was just a colour out of space - a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes. - H.P. Lovecraft, The Colour Out of Space"}, {"id": 471, "text": "Based upon a famous story by American horror author H. P. Lovecraft, Color Out of Space is the first full length movie directed by South African filmmaker Richard Stanley since mystery thriller Dust Devil twenty-seven years earlier. This is supposed to be the first movie in a trilogy of films based upon Lovecraft's writings. This experimental horror film has already gained an underground cult following and there are numerous reasons why any horror movie enthusiast should watch this outstanding movie.First of all, the mysterious plot takes its time to unleash its creepy vibes and gets increasingly intense leading to a memorable finale. The film doesn't need lazy jump scares or gore elements but convinces with gloomy atmosphere and witty storytelling alone.Secondly, the visual special effects are absolutely outstanding and are truly otherworldly which suits the science-fiction horror theme of the story. This might actually be one of the most visually appealing horror movies ever made.Thirdly, the settings are perfectly chosen from the remote camp in the forest over the seemingly beautiful stable and farm to the gorgeous architecture of the family home.Fourthly, the acting performances are second to none. Nicolas Cage convinces as caring family father who slowly but surely goes insane. Joely Richardson plays his physically sick but mentally ambitious wife. Brendan Meyer delivers the goods as neglected son who hangs around with a strange hermit and starts consuming drugs. Madeleine Arthur is the charismatic family daughter who is interested in the occult. Julian Hilliard plays the youngest son who is withdrawn and only interacts with the family dog. Even the side characters are very convincing but the five lead actors and actresses have particularly outstanding chemistry.Fifthly, the plot itself needs to be pointed out. It tells the story of a meteor that crashes in the family's front yard and gradually modifies the animals, landscapes and even the family members in abominable and mysterious ways. Telling you anything else would spoil the outstanding movie that might be best enjoyed if you're not even familiar with Lovecraft's original story yet. The movie might however inspire you to read the fascinating story afterwards.In conclusion, horror movie enthusiasts should definitely watch Color Out of Space that can be considered one of the very best horror films in recent memory. It's refreshingly different from other contemporary horror movies that rely on shaky cameras, jump scares and lots of gore. This horror movie is old-fashioned without being boring, limited or predictable at all. It recalls classic horror movies like The Shining and deserves more than its underground cult status. The upcoming two Lovecraft adaptations by Richard Stanley can't come soon enough. On a closing side note, you should listen to the song Color Out of Space by Japanese heavy metal veterans Ningen-Isu who managed to adapt the fascinating story into a gloomy masterpiece of about six and a half minutes."}, {"id": 472, "text": "Great horror movie.

Richard Stanley has proven that he's a visionary (Hardware, Dust Devil) and has made so few films it's nice to see him take on a passion project and translate Lovecraft as few have done before. Color Out of Space is not perfect but it's few faults are easily overlooked in favor of some truly otherworldly cinema. I would have preferred a period piece versus this modernization and the presence of Nicolas Cage can be distracting at times but he's not entirely unwelcome. Depicting a color you cannot see or describe sounds impossible but Stanley's shifting palette and distortions convey Lovecraft's creation aptly and the combination practical/digital effects are quite admirable for a mid-budget affair. This film may not appeal to those uninitiated (or unimpressed with) weird fiction. If you're a Cage-hater probably avoid as well. But if you have an open mind and want to see something different, that pays proper homage to a master of weird storytelling told by another master, I can highly recommend this film."}, {"id": 474, "text": "Based on a classic slice of short fiction by HP Lovecraft, this long-incubating adaptation is an overly flashy, effects-laden blend of sci-fi and horror. Nic Cage plays a semi-retired family man whose isolated upstate farm is struck by a meteorite, which then evaporates and causes all sorts of bizarre changes in the surrounding environment. Pink trees, mutated animals, unexpectedly abundant harvests, that sort of thing. Among the afflicted is Cage himself, who revels in the chance to amp up every last one of his craziest on-screen tendencies. My god, what a Cage-being-Cage film this is. He's howling, he's gesticulating, he's painted in blood and cackling, he's... suddenly and inexplicably changing accents? I'm not sure how much direction he took here, because it looks like they just focused the cameras and kept rolling while their star actor did whatever felt good, with the occasional interruption from family members or special effects showcases. And, as perversely entertaining as that can be, it doesn't merit a film unto itself. The scraps that surround those indulgent bouts of overacting are awfully scant, narrow and underdeveloped, like the worst '80s straight-to-video productions. It's trippy, but pointlessly so. We get cryptic prophecies and arcane imagery as props, mere window dressing that's waved around and then forgotten. Even the visuals can seem laughably dated, particularly the goopy, absurd creature effects.

Color Out of Space delivers a faithful rendition of Lovecraft's short story and is well worth the time for any fan of the original.It's founded on two very talented leads who know their craft and give sound performances as people slowly, gradually, losing their minds and their humanity. The small supporting cast do a fair job too, there are no weak links here. Even Tommy Chong's performance as, well, Chong, isn't too big a disjointPacing is fine, with just the right amount of scene setting and character introduction to give you a reason to care about them, and a long, gradual ramp up of the titular eldritch color corrupting the backwoods setting. There are some genuinely unsettling scenes that achieve their impact not just through visual effects, but also disturbing diegetic sounds.What I really appreciate is that screenwriter / director Richard Stanley and co-writer Scarlett Amaris clearly get Lovecraft, and fully commit to it. The great thing about the Cthulhu mythos is that it just doesn't care about humanity or our delusions of significance, and Stanley nails that here. Nothing protects you: not being a cute kitty, or a good doggo, not being an autistic ally, not technology, not nature worship, not even magic. This is Lovecraft done right.Where it stumbles just a little is towards the ending which is slightly too overblown and effects heavy.

It's a type of cosmic sci-fi/horror that I don't see much lately, but which always gets me intrigued and craving more. The film is incredibly creepy. It doesn't rely on gore and guts so much but rather on atmospheric tension, which I really appreciate. The special effects are....just amazing.

We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.As a fan of H.P. Lovecraft's work, I was often spell bound by how much creepier and frightening his works were to most modern day author's(even Stephen King admits to being spell bound by Lovecraft.), the concept of horror's beyond imagining where often hinted to and described to the best of the author's ability but what really scared the hell out of my was how he managed to encourage or even force the reader into imagining what the unknown may be like and further more how much you really may not want to know what it is.There was an uncertainty and almost scary realism to his writings. While they were works of fiction, they felt as if possibility was lurking just beyond a veil that we the readers could not see or feel, but of which was there waiting to come forwards and bring with it untold horrors beyond imagining.This film really brought that forward and I found myself spell bound by the horror that resulted mainly from the pure ignorance of the people who refused to believe it was happening until the moment it was to late.The fate of the daughter character was particularly freaky as it's not sure if she actually wanted or perhaps started the incursion into a dimension we as human beings were without doubt not supposed to see or even know of.Seriously superb adaptation of a Lovecraft classic that's got me wanting to read the original story pronto.Amazing performances by all actors. What's got me most thrilled about this movie is that it's one I'm going to want to watch again and again as there's bits and pieces to be enjoyed over and over again, if not the whole film for it's scary view into a dimension no human being should ever mess with.If your a Lovecraft fan, your going to love this, if your new to Lovecraft but love horror films, there's bound to be some goodness to be found here. I started off not being overly thrilled but by the end I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and will be watching this one again.Any movie that makes you want to watch it more than once is already 5 out of 10 stars there, but coupled with spell binding special effects and attention to the freaky details, I can't fault it for what it is.Enjoy."}, {"id": 480, "text": "I have never read Lovecraft's work, but I really like everything that was inspired by it. If you have ever played Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice or watched Stranger Things or read Euron chapters in Song Of Ice and Fire series you're in for that kind of experience. You really understand why the word Lovecraftian was invented. There's good way to describe it.The story: It's just really gripping, tightly knit story. It feels really refreshing. In most movies today you have to turn off your brain and don't think about it. It flows very naturally, it's paced well, it keeps the suspense where needed it builds characters well and does it seamlessly.The acting: Nicolas Cage might be kind of a meme. He's starred in terrible movies, but in this one he works really well. The girl - Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur), she was amazing. The actors really all did a great job.VFX: You can obviously tell which scenes are VFX, because of the fantasy element. I really like the art direction though. It's job was to portray gross, unreal, supernatural things.

The film has a pretty decent cast, with Nicolas Cage obviously being the biggest name of the bunch. There was one moment in particular that I couldn't necessarily take his performance very seriously (a certain car scene), but for the most part he proves to be really good and chaotic throughout the film. Other standout performances include Madeleine Arthur, Elliot Knight, Tommy Chong, and Joely Richardson. This film is bizarre, to say in the least of words. What transpires throughout this film is truly a story unlike any other, and a sci-fi mystery setting that truly is interesting and unique to explore. There are similar formulaic tropes found throughout this film no doubt, and you are left with a bit more unanswered than truly solved, but I couldn't help but enjoy the flick and its qualities, especially its ambition alone. The magenta coloring pictures throughout is truly beautiful, horrifying, and breathtaking somehow all at once- and I admire the look and atmosphere this film develops and sets up, never feeling like the same film after each scene. Always growing, always changing. It's not for everyone, there are moments that are tough to follow, but somehow, though it has its challenges, I find this unique magenta nightmare quite enthralling to watch- and I hope to see more like it in the future.

It's not perfect in terms of story (unfocused and trying to have everything at once), pacing (slow/fast, random jump cuts), and has some character issues (no main character, randomly abandoned some of them, etc), but overall it is very atmospheric and immersive.It was beautifully shot, the soundtrack was great, the practical effects were good (while being very reminiscent of The Thing), cool sound design, and production design in general (courtesy of User T38).H. P. Lovecraft's adaptations are not the easiest ones to get to the big screen, mostly because of his concepts of unspeakable horror and the overall theme of something incomprehensible by the human mind. Color out of Space is very much such a concept. The film handles it rather well, but it still feels like more should've been left to the viewer's imagination just because you can't visualize something like this.The only real issue though was Nicolas Cage. I never thought I'd say this, but he felt miscast, annoying, and weird for the sake of it. I know that Nicolas Cage can't be unweird, but still. The family is supposed to change under the influence of the meteorite, but Cage's character is already inhuman enough, so he doesn't really change throughout. Also, lots of scenes and dialogue felt like they were written for Cage to specifically riff off them. Stuff like Everybody loves ducks or You have to be very gentle..with..the...eh...boobs in the alpaca milking scene is probably fun in a different situation, but not in a Lovecraftian adaptation.An ok film, a great experience, a weird aftertaste."}, {"id": 483, "text": "An isolated family is intruded on by a water scientist during his field work for a dam project, but then suffers a greater intrusion when something from space lands in their front yard ...The last time I looked through my fingers at a Lovecraft movie was Dagon, with Barbara's severed arms dangling gorgeously over the Cthulhu pit. So this time I was expecting something equally cheap and pointlessly mystifying. Wrong and wrong.This production has all the marks of quality, with a Spielberg-like set up of a lively family headed for horror in an American paradise. The cinematography is magnificent, the Color of the title radiating throughout, and the music and sound design awesome, starting off with a doom-laden, bone-crushing blast from a cosmic battle horn.The plot is arrow straight, and it's really the concept and technique that gave me stuff to chew over. Performances are good, and I do think Cage is suited to this: weird and wild, and if that's not your thing, then who invited you? But in the end I found, for all the production values and skilful editing, I still couldn't sit through the whole show in one go.A couple of things I only picked up on afterward. The colour magenta is a figment of our brains, completing a loop where nature has left it open - so it provides some deep cinematic content, but can't affect our experience of the story. And even if it did, the message is that we create the horror within ourselves - a very deep point I agree with, but not what this story seems to convey.Something more effective, though, comes in a scene toward the end, where the father appears to have lost his mind as he introduces his family in the living room - keep an eye out for a later scene in the same location, and it helps explain the nature of what's happening, and how the story twists time. And maybe the use of the magenta figment reinforces that point.I'm not a Lovecraft fan, I think because his stories leave humans passive and helpless, and so there's not much drama for me to get into. This movie helps by giving a conventional, although well made, set up; plus a firm outsider point of view; and the possibility of this thing being holistic - the intro puts science and mysticism in parallel, but then weaves them through the experience of cosmic what-the-hell.There's enough environmental references to suggest an angle on what is called the Chthulhucene (sic), which is basically an attempt by science and the humanities combined to get a handle on the great crisis we've brought on by our messing with nature. So the sequels to this will be even more interesting if they follow that line of thought, which would make me very happy to mark the whole thing up a notch or two.Overall: Accessible and incomprehensible."}, {"id": 484, "text": "In COLOR OUT OF SPACE, Nathan and Theresa Gardner (Nicolas Cage and Joely Richardson) and their three kids live on a huge plot of forested land in the middle of absolutely nowhere.

Lovecraft short story. Director Richard Stanley is a big fan of Lovecraft and wanted to show a worthy implementation of the material. Since I am not a Lovecraft reader, I cannot judge very much in this regard. But what I can judge is the result and how much it entertained me ... The story is quite simple: The Gardner family moves from the big city to the country. Life could be perfect if it weren't for a meteorite that crashes into the Gardners front yard one night and from then on changes the life of the family fundamentally ... Admittedly, the film starts off promisingly, the atmosphere has something sinister about it, and Steve Annis' camera work is also very solid. Colin Stetson's synth-inspired score adapts well to the action, but it doesn't take long for the film to evolve into the cheapest trash. I am aware that director Stanley wants to celebrate and quote typical horror films and their tropes from the 80s, but in my eyes he unfortunately fails completely. Every shocker ended with a hearty laugh from myself. Unfortunately, I would not call The Color Out of Space a film that is so bad that it\u00b4s good... No, it's rather so bad that you laugh at it and immediately forget it. Sometimes it really frustrated me. Why?On the one hand, the script is really weak: the characters are badly and one-dimensionally written and explain every crap to the stupid audience. Oh honey, isn't it nice that we can live on my father's ranch and escape the city? ... Dialogues like this have nothing charming or real but is just cheap and forced exposition. In my opinion, almost all actors are unable to authentically sell this crap. Nicolas Cage has his fun, but at the end of the day he is simply Nic Cage himself. The scene with the tomatoes and peaches is very funny, apart from that, unfortunately, only Cages over-acting comes through. The rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. In my eyes, everyone is not particularly good, especially the three kids are sucking a lot of potential out of the admittedly good basic idea. For example, I hate it when someone who is close to a character dies and in the next scene the same person acts as if that death never happened. A prime example of unimaginative writing.Furthermore, there are many plot lines that are going nowhere. This can work in a more realistic horror flick, but here it looks like they just wanted to get to the creepy and bloody scenes.Finally, the effects: Of course, a movie with a budget of just $ 12 million must make certain restrictions here and there, but there are so many films that have achieved great things with their small budgets. A great example of this is The Void, also a horror-movie (which even has a lot of the Lovecraft style). The Color Out of Space unfortunately looks very cheap. The camera work is pretty solid but the CGI-effects, which the film unfortunately uses far too often, look laughable. There is just no horror for me. Playing with the extraterrestrial color is also quite nice, but in my opinion not used very creatively.Conclusion: The Color Out of Space is a big disappointment for me. Nicolas Cage had won me back with Mandy, but here he shows that he also needs a talented director. The cast is weak, the script sucks and the effects are laughable. Disappointing!"}, {"id": 486, "text": "It was nice to see the young son from the excellent B-movie THE GUEST again, but overall the cast and all of it's characters leave a rather bad taste in your mouth. Because the characters are so vapid and unlikeable, all the character development in the early parts of the movie feels like time wasted, and thus so does the entire first half of the movie.The movie reminds me of Donnie Darko in the sense that if I had seen this when I was an 18 year old stoner, there's a good chance I would have found it really profound and would have convinced myself there was a lot more to take from it. A meteorite lands in this family's yard, but other than that there is virtually no plot, and there is never anything more than takes form, so I can't really sing accolades for the writing either. Nothing that happens really ties to anything else, and not much makes sense. Nothing about the cinematography, directing, pacing, or acting really stands out either.The one strength the movie does carry, which is enough to give it it's niche 6 out of 10 rating, is it's blatant ambition, mostly carried out through some really wild special effects and almost Clive Barker-esque mutations. There were some genuinely impressive and disturbing looking images which most will not forget. And yes, you get a whole bunch of Nicolas Cage acting like a complete mad man, but it's almost too expected - it gets chuckles but it is not exactly a standout performance for him.I am kind of surprised this made it past the SyFy original circuit and into theaters, but I'm not complaining - it's nice to see any sci-fi/horror getting pushed. It's an excellent sub-genre which there is not nearly enough of being produced nowadays in general.

Something from the unnamable beyond will do what ever it does, and there is no escaping the influence of ... we know not what. I wondered as a kid what would happen if a droll wit like James Whale adapted this popular story. It would be hard to get closer than this mix of humor and horror. Sometimes you have to let really crazy situations be funny, if just for a moment. Toward the end it is just good Lovecraftian bizarreness and pretty fun. Tommy Chong, all-purpose entertainer, delivers strange dialog straight (?) from the story to very good effect as things start to come apart. The entire cast is good.

I think there is a part where Nic Cage is talking to his kid, and he says some line like, get the f^@% out of my face...ya know what Ill help ya out, because i'll get the f%#$ out of yourssssss and it was so out of place that Cage must have improved his lines, did one take, and called it a day.

But this was a Lovecraft adaptation, so it had to be watched.And I am glad that I did. Despite having Nicolas Cage in the lead, I will say that director Richard Stanley really managed to pull together a blast of a movie. The story starts out slowly, setting the mood and introducing the characters. And gradually more and more layers were added to the story, that being after the impact of the celestial object, that is. And I loved the subtle changes that took place both in the environment, but also with the characters. It was so nicely done, very subtle, but still very noticeable and enjoyable.I was very entertained with Color Out of Space and the movie really turned out a lot more enjoyable and entertaining than I had anticipated.Nicolas Cage acted well enough in the movie, although there is that classic and archetypical Cage style to it, for better or worse, like it or not. The movie held some really nice performances by Joely Richardson and Madeleine Arthur. And as for having Tommy Chong in the movie, well... I will just let that be up to you to judge upon.Now, Color Out of Space had some impressive special effects, and the CGI team really managed to pull it off quite nicely. The special effects were really good and helped bring the movie to life on the screen in that particularly cosmically dreadful manner that was needed to carry with it the Lovecraftian feel.If you enjoy the Lovecraft story, then I can warmly recommend that you sit down and watch the 2019 movie adaptation.

Nice camera filter, vivid colours, very atmospheric, with a very ominous and somewhat off beat tone. The story is not original per say, we've seen variations of this before but this one still pulls it off very well and adds it's own twists. It's great cosmic horror and highly entertaining. People complaining about the second half most likely wanted some answers because people seem to lack imagination and creativity and refuse open-ended or somewhat vague endings. I was perfectly fine with the second half and actually prefer not having everything spoon-fed to me. Overall a nice addition to the cosmic horror genre.Nicolas Cage is his usual weird self and fits perfectly in this film. As a matter of fact, I have seen a string of Nicolas Cage films from the past 3 years which I have fully enjoyed. Mom &amp; Dad, Mandy, and now this one. Nicolas Cage has always been nothing but a joke to me. I've never been a fan. I've seen people say that he is in the twilight of his career and has been taking ridiculous roles and what not, but if you ask me, I'd say he's just NOW found his niche.

On its own merits it is a fun, eerie horror film that has enough gore to be gross and enough suggestion to be unnerving. It has a gonzo Nicolas Cage performance and the effect work is really nice. Stanley hasn't lost a beat on technical direction. Even at the script's worst moments the film looks polished and is visually compelling.With that said the script really needed to decide if it wanted to stay with Lovecraft's story or instead tell a different tale inspired by it. It tries to do both and suffers for it. The modernization in itself is fine but the Gardner family being city-dwellers trying to get back to nature adds a bunch of subtext-ecological fable?-that isn't present in the original. And this angle does not add anything. Likewise, the film resists giving an explanation/intelligible character to the color-it is as alien in the film as it is in the story-but the film *greatly* condenses the timeline which largely wrecks the atmospherics. The movie is missing the slow burn of the original story. The film trades subtlety for gore while retaining the alien-ness of the color. It ends up being an uneasy marriage.On the visual color itself the film adheres to the story's description the best it could. (it is impossible to come up with an unseen color) I like the neon lilac they selected and they shift the presentation along a spectrum.

Then one night everything changes as a meteorite falls in their yard, not far from the front porch. The noise and the exotic hot pink and purple glow gets everyone up, they find a glowing mass half buried in the dirt.Well the glowing mass isn't just your ordinary meteorite, instead it is vanishes overnight and turns out to be a very menacing type of alien life.Horror movies are not our favorite genre but we watched it all. The cinematography and special effects are very well done and there is a certain satisfaction in watching it even though it doesn't turn out to be a very hopeful outcome.

When the film ended, I wasn't sure if the conclusion I got was correct.I wasn't expecting this film to be as disturbing as it was, but to it's credit, it did legitimately make me uncomfortable (in the way it was supposed to). If such disturbing imagery is your thing, I think the film does a decent job in that aspect. The acting is good for the most part, although I thought Nicholas Cage went a little overboard at times, and I was confused as to what to think of Cage's character, especially in the last 30 minutes of the film.I kinda feel bad after reading all the positive reviews, but I sincerely just didn't grasp the film that well. I'd like to read the story and see if it will maybe connect some things better. For what it is as a movie, I think Color Out of Space has some very neat, also unsettling things during in it's run.

That's where I gave this movie its stars.To ANYONE saying this is a good Lovecraft movie; this movie has NOTHING in common with Lovecraft writing or style of writing and I highly recommend you pick up a book containing his stories and read this story before saying this is good Lovecraft. It's a very short story, but extremely rich in visual detail and rich in storytelling of a different kind. I have read almost ALL of Lovecrafts stories, most more than once as well. I have seen the b-horror movies. I have played video games with the style and have even taken part in the Cthulhu Role-playing game (pen &amp; paper). I do not claim to be an expert, but I know enough of his style to know this movie does NOT fit the bill.They could not even reproduce the style of speech and writing Lovecraft was famous for... it's a real pity.This movie is pretty much an extremely watered-down modern re-interpretation of a very popular 'short' Lovecraft wrote. The problem with this movie, is the problem with so many modern movies and the way we watch movies or the type of content we westerners watch. It has to have action and overly-exaggerated sequences. The problem is the overly-exaggerated sequences and scenes are not the way Lovecraft write or expresses emotions, reactions or actions.To make a Lovecraft story reproduced faithfully, a movie would have to come closer to the style of 2001: A Space Odyssey / Interstellar. In other words, a slow-paced movie with a more artful approach, rich in eerie visuals and mysterious characters. You need to FEEL a kind of encroaching doom over the period of the story. Details and the way Lovecraft expresses locations or characters is slow and descriptive. You have to have time to feel the heaviness of what he is trying to portray.Lovecraft stories are NOT about action and action sequences, nor monsters you can shoot. Not only that, but why the HECK could they not make the movie in the same time period the story was taking place in? Wouldn't that have on it's own added a little more mystery and helped create the atmosphere Lovecraft is so famous for?And as a horror buff, mainly supernatural and psychological horror, this movie doesn't even fit the bill. There was no tension, no mystery or dread. Every scene was clich\u00e9 and taken from popular mass-produced tropes we have seen so many times. The twist in the movie, with the twisted and messed-up creatures just looked too much like they tried to gives us some The Thing.Is that really the best the writers could come up with? Did they even read the story? or did they skim through the few pages at breakneck speed just to come up with a theme for their basic and over-done twist on a great writer?I guess I was just expecting something Lovecraftian.... instead, I got something very basic and riddled with popular mass-marketed horror.Now, if you say you like Lovecraft, people will think of this failed attempt at a Lovecraftian movie."}, {"id": 495, "text": "If you scan IMDb reviews you'll see a lot of polarization over this movie.

You can't just throw together random bits of plot and random secondary characters (alpaca farming, a hydrologist in his mid-twenties hitting on a 17 year old - ew, a pot-smoking hippie dippy guy who lives in a shack), combine it all with wildly inconsistent tone, and call it clever.The only reason I'm giving this movie two stars instead of one is that there are a couple of visually clever moments.

The mysterious rock seems to sink into the Earth, and hereby seriously affecting everyone and everything around it - including time and space.If you're a fan of some bonkers sci-fi horror that mostly doesn't make sense, you'll dig all of the craziness that's waiting for you. While nature and animals mutate into bizarre deformed creatures and spout purple rays of radioactive light, this family has to fight separately and save themselves from killing each other under the influence of this color out of space.There's some awkward exposition regarding the family in the first half hour of the film that just doesn't work as an emotional back drop. The film would've worked better if the story focused more on the daughter of the house, Livinia (Madeleine Arthur - To All the Boys I've Loved Before), who has an interesting back story that involves an obsession with witchcraft and the Necronomicon. Instead we focus a bit too much on the bigger star of the film, Cage, who doesn't really bring anything else than his crazy shtick, which felt much more deserved and honest in 'Mandy', but doesn't really fit here, and becomes a bit tiring at a certain point. It goes completely off the rails when Mr. Gardner's newly adopted herd of Alpacas seem more important than his own children, while putting up a weird Trump-impersonation. If this was intentional, job well done, if not, it was too much.Joely Richardson as the wife/mother is clearly miscast and can't keep up with Cage's level of insanity, as soon as their house gets surrounded by this mysterious cosmic cloud. There is a moment of body horror in which she gets to shine, and can count as one of the more shocking scenes in the film.The film's tone feels too uneven to be considered enjoyable, even to the extent of becoming frustrating with a running time of almost two hours. Colin Stinton's synth-score shamefully gets buried by the extreme amount of sound effects. While there's no doubt a lot of the budget was spent on the impressive set design, it's no excuse for the cheap looking VFX which really take you out of some of the more scarier scenes. This would've been so much more effective by the use of practical effects.Sci-fi horror has seen a resurgence in recent memory with hits such as Annihilation and Prometheus, but this trashy B-film doesn't work as a whole.

My expectations were unrealistic. Whenever I read the words H.P Lovecraft adaptation, I dream of stumbling upon another Re-Animator or From Beyond. But, in fact, these two are the atypical Lovecraft tales. The actual style and stories of Lovecraft are atmospheric, mysterious, nightmarish and cosmic instead of gooey and outrageous.With Color out of Space, the eccentric filmmaker Richard Stanley (Dust Devil and a partially shot Island of Dr. Moreau) attempts to combine mysterious with gooey and outrageous, but the emphasis nevertheless clearly lies on the cosmicsism. To illustrate this through the case of Color out of Space, we all have a cliched and banal interpretation of an extraterrestrial invasion. We promptly think of space shift and odd creations, but in Lovecraft's universe it's a string of strange and complex events the human brain can barely even fathom.A kind of extraterrestrial invasion is what overcomes the already struggling Gardner family. Father Nathan desperately hopes to make his alpaca farm profitable, mother Theresa (no pun intended) slowly recovers from a terrible illness and teen daughter flees into spiritualism. When a meteorite crashes into their backyard, their lives turn into a living psychedelic hell. Color out of Space is definitely a visually stunning experience.

Lovecraft, which details the events of a meteorite crashing into a farm, bringing with it something not of this world. The original is one of the most well-known stories by Lovecraft and probably one of the easier ones to adapt to the silver screen.In this filmization, directed by Richard Stanley, the events are moved to modern day Massachusetts. The inimitable Nicholas Cage plays the lead as the father of the family and owner of the farm, while the lead supporting role probably goes to Madeleine Arthur as Lavinia, the daughter of the family.Richard Stanley has good eye for visual spectacle. Visual effects are utilized with tasteful hand and the colour palette is suitable outwordly and spooky. And when the horror starts to crank, it looks disturbing.As for the story and acting, they're honestly nothing we haven't seen before. Both Cage and Arthur are enjoyable to watch, being far more kooky than their peers, but that just means that all the rest are rather bland in comparison. Likewise the story chucks along on fairly predictable tracks, and while that's true for most horror films, I ended up hoping for some kind of twist that would have made it feel fresh. Now it ends up being a clich\u00e9d film, albeit one that's executed better than most.That being said, I enjoyed seeing it. Not the best horror film ever made by any means, but it had its moments."}, {"id": 501, "text": "Nathan Gardner (Nicolas Cage) owns an alpaca farm in the woods.

Lovecraft story, it's relatively simple in plot but fascinating in designs. I love the monster designs which remind me so much of the 1982 The Thing. Cage does almost screw this up. He's been doing his wacky crazy characters for so long that he has become a cartoon character. The role would be far superior played by a more fatherly figure. Someone like Michael Shannon could give it real intensity rather than Cage's cartoonish emotions. A much smaller problem arises from the high pitched squeaky sounds. It's too close to fingernails on the chalkboard. I'd prefer a different sound to denote the alien invasion.

If you're going to make a modern adaptation of a classic tale, make sure it doesn't suck, and 2. I'd you're making a movie starring Nicholas cage, make sure it doesn't suck! This filmmaker followed neither... Meteors from space crashes on earth and brings a Pink Floyd light show full of special effects creatures from The Thing...It was probably scary 50+ years ago, but these days it just seems lazy and contrite. The characters were terrible, they had no chemistry or believeAbility as people, even less as a family. Cage phones in his typical I'm a babbling weirdo performance, which grows more painful to watch every movie. In this movie he's his typical unhinged, unwatchable self. The only actors worth watching in this were the unknown water surveyor guy and tommy Chong, who played his stereotypical hippy dippy weirdo. I can only imagine any positive reviews must have come from reviewers paying respect to the tradition of the story itself, because the movie was visual and audio garbage. For all the trouble this alien seemed to have went to getting to earth, it basically kills a few folks, then beams itself back into space...the end makes no logical sense, it was just an exercise in how special effects creators could imagine what it would be like if they had been cool enough to take hallucinogens. There is no real end, just flashing lights, then the final character smoking a cigarette and babbling profound nonsense. Bottom line, this movie was painful to watch.

All of which makes Color Out of Space a huge letdown, right from the surprisingly inept opening scene: a flat, forested landscape of tall, healthy timber, one that looks nothing like the sinister hills and dark narrow glens with sloping trees being described in the voice-over.And what a shame that Stanley made the setting modern, and couldn't resist inserting a black hero (HPL is spinning in his grave!), and chose to make the family at the center of the tale middle-class, educated, and hip.

It's a sci-fi horror movie about some sort of space rock that crash lands in the back yard of a family living out in the middle of nowhere. It's one of those domestic stories where a crisis faced by a family highlights the already strained relationships they all have to one another and skeletons tucked safely away in the closet will no longer stay in hiding.

I found myself praying for the quick and swift demise of the characters... Not out of spite, but rather mercy for themselves. It felt like watching someone navigate a room full of upward-facing thumbtacks while blindfolded, except also oblivious to both the blindfold and whatever obvious mysterious danger lies around them...In general, the film just feels confused about itself...

One of it's more enjoyable elements is the chilling and somewhat suspenseful build-up here that focus on the strange vents they experience. After the fateful encounter with the meteorite, the build-up moves from simple forgettable manners about what chores they have to do or hearing odd noises around the farm to strange full-on accidents including the situation with the mother. Far more chilling and creepy is the youngest son who's infatuation and near-catatonic state around the well offers a far more compelling piece about the buildup around the house, which is the same for the constant magnetic and electrical disturbances that occur throughout here. As well, once the film goes into the second half where it really gets unnerved and has a lot of thrilling elements on display. Going for more of a body-horror route as well as a psychological one with what happens here, including the strange mutations that are shown with the fruit and animals grown on the farm but also the continuing behavioral changes that take place creates a rather enjoyable time. When those changes start to become physical with the skin-rash or the stellar idea of the fusion attempts that happen to feature extremely goopy effects work throughout here, this one changes tone and feel into a much darker and threatening experience. With a tense finale that offers some enjoyable and thrilling action, these here are what hold this one up for the most part. There are some pretty big flaws featured here. One of the biggest issues is the overlong running time here that comes along due to the series of early setups that aren't that interesting. The family life before the accident is necessary to get an idea of what drastic changes are made once they get corrupted by the meteorite's influence but the problem is that these scenes are played out at a dull tempo that isn't all that exciting. Rather than ramp the intensity factor up considerably after the incidents that are shown to take place, the laid-back pacing that carries on here removes a lot of the tension which is a big reason why this one runs on way too long for its own good. The other detrimental factor here is the inherently and wholly stupid actions throughout here that keep everyone in danger for no reason other than gross stupidity. Hardly anything that happens here, from the arrival and sudden disappearance of the meteorite, the near-constant flashing of the strange lights around the farm that are never investigated or explained, or the mutations that occur to the flowers and wildlife ever raise any kind of urgency or sense of investigation into what's going on. Even the fusing of their own family members into a single entity propels them towards wanting to leave and it feels unrealistic that it would occur in this manner, generating less sympathy for them through this.

It's like a straight to video rip-off of the far superior Slither (2006), which actually succeeded as a gory, clever, creepy, and even funny sci-fi horror film. This adaptation of Color Out of Space, however, was a slapdash hot mess, possibly geared toward audiences with the attention spans of adolescent gnats and the IQs to match. A few quotes from Lovecraft's classic short story are thrown into the mix, and are also used as bookends in an unsuccessful attempt to lend the film some coherence and gravitas; they just end up sounding like they belong in a better movie (probably because they do). This movie also marks a new low (in a career comprised of desperate plunges to unsounded depths) for Nicholas Cage. While all of the other actors attempted to play it straight (necessary to connect viewers to stories this out there), Cage seemed to be performing in a completely different film: a comedy, perhaps (though not a very good one). He spent his screen time munching scenery in a vacuum, connecting not at all with any of his co-stars. It was impossible to look at or listen to him for even a moment without thinking, this is an actor trying to act. (Almost nothing takes me out of a movie faster.) There was no humanity at all in his performance; it was an embarrassingly bad SNL caricature. Some might maintain that the role demanded a certain remote zaniness, but at this point in time, horror film aficionados have seen many a movie maniac portrayed by actors who deftly manage to make connections, spark some chemistry, or at least create some much-needed tension with their scene-mates. Cage's performance in this movie was a joke, rarely even unintentionally funny. I don't often write reviews, but as a fan of both horror films and Lovecraft's stories, I had to at least post a warning in light of all the oddly effusive positive reviews this has gotten. I'm not a snob when it comes to horror flicks; I often give these movies a pass if they can provide just one or two good chills; or if they can establish and then stick with their own rules. This does neither. There are a few strangely dated looking gross-out effects, but the only truly scary thing about Color Out of Space is that this is apparently just the first of several Lovecraft-inspired films planned by the same director. If you do want a gross and gooey alien invasion movie that actually delivers, take my earlier advice and check out Nathan Fillion and Michael Rooker in James Gunn's Slither; don't waste your time or money on this boring, messy garbage."}, {"id": 511, "text": "I must say out of all the movie adaptations of Lovecraft's stories this is one of the best. But that's not saying a lot. Because, there really have been so few. I just don't know if it's possible for any screenwriter or director to successfully bottle one of his narratives into the confines of a movie. But some have come close, and this is one of those.Lovecraft's cosmic horror doesn't follow the simple path of problem, struggle, solution, resolution. In the Lovecraftian universe there are no happy endings. He plays with themes and ideas that man has no hope of overcoming, understanding, or solving . That makes him somewhat unique among western authors.The production value of this movie was pretty good. But in my opinion some of the acting was a little over the top. Most notably Nicholas Cage's character. I don't know if that was Cage's fault or the director's, but his character was just the most off of all the cast. The entire family that was at the center of this movie were mismatched and odd even before the odd things began to happen. I think it would have been more powerful had the screenwriter or director chosen to make them more mainstream in the beginning and let the events of the movie change them into what we see in the second and third act. Cage's character seemed to have a couple of bolts loose from the very beginning. ...maybe that's the way they wanted him to be played, but to me the performance felt overplayed and a bit awkward. .If you are looking for a movie that is going to tie everything up in one neat package, don't watch this one, because you will be disappointed. That's simply not the way Lovecraftian stories work. If you like Lovecraftian cosmic horror then go for it, this one won't disappoint you, beside some of the character performances I think it does a fair job adapting the major themes from the original story."}, {"id": 512, "text": "There have been several films adapted from Lovecraft's story, the most famous being Daniel Haller's 1965 Boris Karloff starring DIE MONSTER DIE!* Director Richard Stanley's modern take does have a decent build up. With co-writer Scarlett Amaris, the script shows a family on an isolated farm in New England (but shot in Portugal!) who's fairly tranquil (if oh so quirky - hey, the Dad is played by Nicolas Cage!) lives are disrupted by a meteor crashing on their front lawn. Strange pinkish purple colors flash all around them with swirling bursts of light. Not surprisingly, all kinds of strange sights, sounds and physical manifestations soon follow. A young hydrologist Ward (Elliot King) happens to be taking a water survey in the area, and since he's the only scientist around, he's called upon to explain all the cosmological and biological happenings. The Mom (Joely Richardson) is already sporting an illness and becomes increasing skittish. The Daughter Lavinia (Madeline Arthur) is a Wiccen who tries to ward off the weirdness with her powers. The older son Benny (Brendan Meyer) is a stoner, while the younger boy Jack (Julien Hilliard) seems mesmerized and possessed by the force. Oh, and there's a very old hippie (Tommy Chong - who else?) squatting in a shack on the property. Oh, the family is raising Alpacas. The first half is admirable in taking the time to set up the situation and the budget production design and effects are effective and quite...uh...colorful. There are a few misteps with some phoney scares via inanimate objects as opposed to the more explicable organic ones, but, still palpable enough. Unfortunately, it seems as if Stanley had his eye on his stopwatch, for almost exactly at that halfway point he realized...Nic Cage hasn't gone over the top yet! And, then BAM!!! Full on Cage Craziness ensues. Some of it, as always, is fun, but the film's tone never recovers. All the careful accumulation of suspense goes out the window in favor of over-acting, dopey dialogue and as much CGI and mechanical creature effects as they can afford (parts of resemble an ad hoc remake of Carpenter's THE THING). Cage's transformation into Crazed Cage is somewhat explained by the plot, but, it still doesn't work to the film's benefit. COLOR OUT OF SPACE has some interesting visuals along the lines of the superioir ANNIHILATION. The concept of the force being able to bend time is a good one, if never fully explored. Cage is good in the first half and Richardson is affecting even when smothered in makeup. The rest of cast is okay within the confines of the screenplay.Richard Stanley's comeback after the ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU debacle in the 90s has it's merits, but, the second half of the picture doesn't fulfill the promise of the first - tonally or substantively. It would have been preferable for it to have all have been of one piece - either the fairly sober one of the first half, or the gonzo second. Half-Crazy Cage is a compromise. * I got to see DIE MONSTER DIE! on the big screen in 35mm this February. It's pretty much as I remembered it from the old Creature Feature days - a slow moving film styled after AIP's Poe films. Only the ending really evokes even a bit of Lovecraft. I also saw 1985's THE CURSE, which until I was just reminded of, is also based on the same story. That film was so unmemorable that I had completely forgotten it was based on Color Out Of Space!"}, {"id": 513, "text": "A vivid nightmare mostly true to Lovecraftian roots, Color Out of Space begins on a rather interesting note but eventually loses its way to finish as an ambitious yet not entirely fruitful attempt at adapting the real horrors of H.P. Lovecraft's works. It is strange, it is surreal, and the ride comes laced with a strong psychedelic kick.Directed by Richard Stanley, the film is way more effective in its quieter attempts at horror than when indulging in its otherworldly imagery. Its uneven narration &amp; sluggish pace further undo what could've been a vibrant yet vicious cosmic terror. And though it goes full bonkers in the finale, it is still unable to leave an indelible impression.Nicolas Cage is very much in his element here, and his Cagey act only escalates as situation worsens for his character. The inputs from the rest is serviceable at best. The old-school aesthetics, radiant hues &amp; precise lighting do leave their mark but what started as an artful attempt at embracing Lovecraft is reduced to a B-movie pulp in the end.Overall, Color Out of Space works in bits n pieces and is surely destined to delight Nicolas Cage fans but the characters don't have enough meat on them to make us care. While the film has its moments, its treatment isn't up to the mark, the script isn't polished enough, and the experience of sitting through those alluring visuals isn't mesmerising but mediocre &amp; forgettable."}, {"id": 514, "text": "Now I will admit I had seen a different adaptation of this H.P. Lovecraft story from Italy. That one had a much smaller budget and was called Colour from the Dark. I hadn't read the source material before my first viewing and have since before this second viewing. I did watch this with Jaime and she didn't know what to think. Regardless, this one excited me and I got the chance to catch this at the Gateway Film Center when it was in the theater for my first go. The synopsis is a town is struck by a meteorite and the fallout is catastrophic.We start this with Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur) as she is practicing what appears to be a Wiccan ritual and this is an interesting way to show that she wants out of this small area. She lives with her family out here. Her mother had cancer that caused the family quite the scare. She is doing this by a river that attracted Ward (Elliot Knight). Before we actually see Lavinia and what she's doing, there's a narration showing us the woods in the area and showing its haunting beauty. It explains that this is placed in Arkham which is a fictional area in New England portion of the United States.When he arrives, he spooks Lavinia and explains he's a hydrologist there to study the water table. Later there's an interesting reveal as there's a major project to create a dam and reservoir providing drinking water to a large area hence why he's there to test the water. Lavinia and Ward hit it off before she leaves on her horse and goes home.It is there we meet the rest of the family. Nathan (Nicolas Cage) is the father. They're living on the family farm that his father owned and raising alpacas. His wife is Theresa (Joely Richardson) who I'm assuming is a freelance investment banker that works out of the attic of this home. Benny (Brendan Meyer) is the eldest son and he's a bit of a pothead. There's finally Jack (Julian Hilliard) who is the younger son. We get a glimpse of their family dynamic over dinner.Things take a turn that night though when a meteorite hits in the front yard. It affects the family differently. Nathan starts to smell something that reminds him of the ward his father died in. Theresa starts to lose herself, Jack is drawn to it and then the well, thinking he's hearing someone talk to him. Ward gets involved to test the water and this brings him to encounter an off the grid hippie, Ezra (Tommy Chong). This meteorite brought a color that Nathan couldn't describe, but it also brought more than that.Now I wanted to introduce enough in my recap without spoiling this movie. I think that most people who are coming into this, have a rough idea of what could happen here, just maybe not necessarily how this movie is going to play out. I think through the screenplay and how things are introduced, we have a pretty deep story here that I dug.This version of it is closer to the source material in that we see the meteorite as it crashes here. After it does, the next night has a pretty strong storm that comes through. Lavinia is getting rained on and watching it. This draws her father outside and we see that the lightning keeps striking the meteorite, as if it is drawing it. This happens over and over again to the point where it's no longer there. We then see that it has contaminated the water in the well and from Ward discovers the whole supply.This is a fitting time for this movie to come out with this concept as well. I don't really want to take it political here, but it is fitting that at the time of writing this, regulations on testing water and certain precautions were lifted by the government. We briefly meet the mayor, Tooma (Q'orianka Kilcher) whose big plan for her term is to get this reservoir built. I love this apocalyptic backdrop that if what is happening isn't contained, it will spread. At the crux of this, we have kind of a body snatcher/alien takeover, infection type film. Not so much in the sense that they're trying to take over the world, but it is effecting all those that come in contact with it. It does change them as well.What I did like about this movie is that it briefly establishes the 'norm' for the family before things change. I think that quick baseline works. I hate to say this though, the only person I didn't really care for in this movie was Cage. I think he went too over the top too early and then he just gets weird. I do like that he's going back and forth as what this entity is doing is messing with him, but I feel he should have been a bit more normal. Lavinia is interesting as I saw some of my childhood in her where she is gothic-ish, but likes normal things. It is legit a phase for her in my opinion, much like for myself. Theresa is an odd character as well. I like they established her sad back-story, but I don't know if it is Richardson's performance as just too subdued or what, but she kind of fades into the background.Since I've already went into this, I did think that the rest of the acting was good. Knight is an interesting character for sure. We get a lot of fun Lovecraft references for those familiar, which includes Ward wearing a Miskatonic University sweatshirt, a Re-Animator reference. His name could reference Charles Dexter Ward and they're also in Arkham. I like that he's here as our investigator. I did have an issue is there's a long stretch where he disappears where it is established early that he's our 'hero'. Chong was fun in his appearance as Ezra. I like to think this is Cheech &amp; Chong character who retired to this area and he's scared of the government while just living off the grid. Sheriff Pierce (Josh C. Waller) becomes important later in the movie, but he's never established which I found to be odd.Something that I hate to have to say is that after this initial viewing, I think that it runs a bit long. It gets right into introducing us to the characters and the event that changes everything happening. The movie really has a surreal feel to it and I'll get more into that during the effects and how this shot. I just felt the film meanders for a bit during the later second act. I like where it ended up though and the ending is interesting. Even after a second viewing, I think that it runs too long. The story is interesting, but I feel that there's just too much here that is unfocused for me.Since I touched on this, I thought that the effects were great. We get a lot of practical stuff which I'm always down for. I was so glad that Stanley was the director here, as I've seen his other two films Hardware and Dust Devil. Both of them I could see led to some of the odd creatures we get here, mostly from the former. There's a lot of CGI, but I personally thought it was used very well. We get electricity that is attacking people. We get some The Thing references with some creatures we see and the use of color is amazing. I wonder if Arthur was selected because normally she has beautiful eyes, but they're highlighted here later in the movie as well. The cinematography is also on point with all of this and I have to give a lot of credit there. Being this is same studio that did Mandy, I don't get a lot of those vibes. How this film looks when the entity is doing things, that's where I would reference it only.The last thing to cover is the soundtrack and sound design here. The big thing that struck out to me was the use of sounds for this entity. We get a scene with Ezra being on the ground claiming that he heard something talking in the night and then recorded it. It comes off as static and loud noises. What I like about this is that we are introduced to this with Jack. We take it as gibberish and nothing, but they're relaying that it is more. Later in the movie we get some music that made me feel uncomfortable and the scenes worked very well in conjunction with it. There are also animal sounds that draw characters which also worked for me as well.Now with that said, this is a movie that I really liked while having some slight flaws for me. I really like Stanley taking this Lovecraft story and adapting as he did. It is quite creepy the route that he took it. There are some slight issues I have which some from the acting and the pacing for a stretch of this. It does do some really good things with the concepts and social commentary. I thought the effects are on point and it is beautiful at times as well. The soundtrack and design were really good. I've already heard some people stating that only the pretentious will like this, but that's fine. It is still good in my opinion. It has come down for me after the second viewing, but still one of the better films of the year in my opinion."}, {"id": 515, "text": "The treatment of the story of this movie shows the natural connections between humans, Nature, and Angelical Forces extraterrestrial who are all linked in the milky way.

These flows, like the running out of control from the flood of a river, formulate an elliptical distorted temporality which devors itself ; as a metaphor for the humanity self destruction, and materializing the string theory of quantum physics, it releases the passage to another dimension, the opening to a different world born in the past of the universe, in the origins of creation and becoming the future for humans who play wizards with physical, chemical, environmental and spiritual matters. This movie is a very entertaining and philosophical existentialist science-fiction horror movie."}], "reviews_amount": 516}
