The only way humans have a future on this planet is to reverse the damage we have done to our ecosystem. Repairing anything requires first understanding it, then you have to do what that understanding tells you. There is no ecosystem anywhere on earth that does not include animals, so animals will have to play a part in the regeneration of our planet. Any system of agriculture that does not include animals is destined to fail. Thank you very much to the entire team behind The Sacred Cow, and all the farmers around the world who are helping in the fight to save our sacred planet."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Dear Diana and Rob. And all the people involved.What an amazing, sober, informative, thought provoking and giving film you have made. I am proud to have supported you and will gladly share this essential message to everyone I know. Also the vegan ones \ud83d\ude0a. I look so much forward to this spreading across the world. It's a really important message and I sense you are driving one of the most important movements in our time.Thank you!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "This documentary is a must-watch for everyone as it will help you understand the food-chain process. I liked the way this documentary is compiled, answering all the contradictory issues step by step. I would recommend this film to be shown to school children as well to help them understand the source of their food better."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The film perfectly reflects the contradictory views in the public consciousness. It is not easy to navigate between them, in this it helps to find the right path, following the principle of striving for balance in nature."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This movie debunks the Vegan propaganda about animal agriculture being the biggest culprit behind global warming &amp; land desertification. The truth is that ruminant animals revitalize &amp; restore land damaged by industrial farming &amp; help sequester carbon in the soil. Several farmers &amp; even some prominent ex-Vegans are interviewed in the documentary. Facts are provided to show that meat IS a healthy choice for human consumption -- we've been eating meat for more than 3 millions years! Animal foods contain at least 10 essential nutrients that are simply not available from plants. But you have to raise those cows, pigs &amp; sheep outside on pasture, the way nature intended, in order to regenerate the land &amp; produce healthy, nutritious meat for us to eat."}, {"id": 5, "text": "A must see for anyone interested in health, lifestyle and saving the planet."}, {"id": 6, "text": "We watched this film for a homeschool lesson to coincide with a habitat, ecosystem, sustainability unit for my kindergartner and 4th grader. We live in a dairy/cattle farm community and this film really wrapped a nice bow around all the things we are learning about in a way that my kids can apply it. It was very informative. I've been anxiously waiting for this to become available. Thank you for bringing this to the world."}, {"id": 7, "text": "This documentary explains regenerative farming and how it's actually good for the planet. I had heard about Polyface Farm before and was glad to see they were represented. We have got to do better for this planet by supporting farmers who practice regenerative farming."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Grateful to the farmers forging new ground in responsible farming practices and for those willing to participate in telling their story. The work is grueling and high risk: we are the beneficiaries. Thanks for the efforts of the producers to get this project completed."}, {"id": 9, "text": "If the world watch this, the world would change. There is so much hope when we see so many people doing such incredible things to heal the soil and thus heal all of us. We have to use this type of knowledge to demand change. Not just for those who can afford it, but for all. Thank you Diana for producing this. You have done an incredible thing."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Such a well done movie that shines a light on an industry that's basically a mystery. I used to be of the school of thought that all meat was bad, but I found my way back to meat, and wanted a better understanding of meat and all it's components. This movie presents an informative snapshot on some of the pressing issues and actionable steps. I'm a big fan of regenerative farming and will continue to support regenerative meat. Thanks for this movie!"}, {"id": 11, "text": "I am so grateful for the important work of the producers of this documentary. I just read the book Sacred Cow and the documentary succeeds in portraying the essence of the book. Our future depends on regenerative farming practices, both for our nutritional health and ecology."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Very happy to watch this documentary! The promise of regenerative farming is amazing but talked about very little! It exposes some of the flaws of the veggie movement without being all aggressive and the movie itself isn't super depressing as some of these documentaries can be. I liked it!"}, {"id": 13, "text": "I'm a vegan and I loved this film because it thoughtfully addresses several of the things I'm concerned with; climate change, food nutrition/quality, compassion for animals, and family farms. Regenerative farming is a key to a sustainable future. Thank you for spreading the word about regenerative farming."}, {"id": 14, "text": "This documentary really resonated in me. The interviews, scenes and explanations really make clear sense to a natural way of proper farming practice with livestock being a key part in restoring nature and soil, improving our climate, justifying some nutrient myths and misconceptions of ethical meat production (it's way more different to conventional meat, which is wrong). The messages are very clear to me, and seeing sceneries of the regenerative farming practices are emotional and empowering. I'm really glad that this documentary was produced because the world needs to understand our needs for regenerative farming with livestock, how this practice can correct the climate balance and soil health can be restored and why we eat high-quality, ethically-farmed meat. That goes for both people who are meat-eaters on one side and vegans on the other side as there are commonalities looked at."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Finally a science based program that highlights how regenerative ag is a key part of feeding our future and that we require a balanced science based approach to agriculture. Very well done! We need more like this one."}, {"id": 16, "text": "A brilliant and thought provoking journey. The importance of the subject must not be underestimated if farmers are to continue to be able to feed the world. Of concern is the narrative being pushed those with vested interest in the artificial meat business, including politicians. Thank you for putting out this film."}, {"id": 17, "text": "If you watched and liked The Big Little Farm, then you will definitely enjoy Sacred Cow. We need a lot more educational information like this to reduce processed food and eliminate single farming. Great job."}, {"id": 18, "text": "The past 20+ years we have been improving our soil by Carbon Ranching-practicing agroforestry in the tropics. Sacred Cow dispels the myths that have resulted from lumping all animal agriculture as one. Successful farmers are diversified farmers!

Insightful and visceral."}, {"id": 21, "text": "They did a great job in collecting data, stories, and experts. I thought it was a little poor to only talk to 1 (ex)vegan and not go into more detail on how people can actually do quite well as vegetarians. also there seemed to be a slight idea that its either pasture reared meat or chemical agriculture. you can grow food without animal inputs it just takes more cover cropping and the correct climate or rebuilding fallows. The message is good but might be a little polarizing and I was asking myself could a vegan watch this and not feel patronized and I wasn't sure. If you are vegan... watch it and leave a review! peace and climate justice for all. well done on the movie."}, {"id": 22, "text": "This was an incredibly well done film highlighting the importance of animal nutrition and the REAL impact both conventional and regenerative ag has on the environment, and the potential for regenerative ag to save our planet. It was refreshing to watch a film on this topic that felt objective and presented facts and realistic solutions instead of the typical myopic vegan propaganda films like cowspiracy and game changers etc that want everyone to quit eating meat like that will solve all our problems.Big ups to Diana and Robb and everyone involved in their film, the book, and the regenerative ag movement!!"}, {"id": 23, "text": "Everyone who values health, preservation of the environment, and animal welfare should watch this documentary. There's a lot of misinformation and outright lies about the nutritional qualities of meat and animal fats floating around, and this movie is excellent in presenting an all-encompassing view on the subject. I hope many people will be able to see this and get a chance to question the prevailing narrative that's been dominating the mass media and government's nutritional guidelines all over the world."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Very well done and an extremely important message. Everybody needs to hear this."}, {"id": 25, "text": "An interesting film. As a meat lover, but also sometimes wary of where my food is sourced, it was wonderful to see that, even though there was a matter-of-fact attitude that the animal was to be killed and consumed, that the welfare of the animals was paramount. There was a lesson. of sorts, to be learned from the slug lady, but a little tenuous."}, {"id": 26, "text": "I enjoyed this documentary a lot. It impacted me so much that at the end I told myself when I'm done with my corporate job, I wanna be a farmer. It was full of useful information, coming from trusted sources (for example, scientists, research etc). The story line was well structured. I hope this documentary reaches as many people as possible!"}, {"id": 27, "text": "Having seen this film twice now and each time feeling hopeful for the future. This film needs to be seen by everyone not just people who already lean in this direction. City people have lost their connection with where food and nature come from and this film tries to bring that connection back. Looking forward to seeing it many more times."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Sacred Cow is the key to a sacred and everlasting Earth. This is an excellent documentary, and a must watch for anyone interested in preserving a healthy and sustainable way of life, not only for us in the present, but for the future.

You won't be disappointed."}, {"id": 29, "text": "A must watch for everyone, carnivoes, vegans and everyone in between, if we want to fix the problems that plague us all. We can save our planet and ensure better treatment for animals whilst preserving the health of humanity. The book is just as brilliant."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Nowadays it's easy to look anywhere and find a ton of problems with society and the way we are interacting as humans.

But I have to say, the movie delivered very well, super high quality."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Well thought out, well produced and full of great info. Sacred Cow will open a lot of eyes and help create a more sustainable future for our planet. Thank you."}, {"id": 33, "text": "This film is a perfect representation of how human ingenuity is often a Trojan horse for hubris. There's no need no to reinvent the wheel when it comes to nature's balance which has been fine tuned after millions of years. All things must die. The world is binary. There are predators and prey. We must chose to live in harmony with reality or drive ourselves into extinction.

We really enjoyed watching it and it is very informative."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Thank you for giving the information we all need. So helpful to balance the story's we are told from the media. Facts are what is needed and action is required. Seeing real families and individuals working was very impactful."}, {"id": 36, "text": "Sacred Cow joins the other high quality, high fit and finish documentaries which may be able to save the planet from the current war on the earth method of agriculture embraced worldwide.Livestock isn't the problem, livestock on the land is the cure.

I shared the invitation to view all over the place. Common sense and nature instead of extremism."}, {"id": 38, "text": "Very interesting and inspirational. There is hope for the planet. Thanks for all the work to make it. I am a carnivore and buy my meat at our local butcher."}, {"id": 39, "text": "Regenerative farming s the answer to the threat of not being able to feed the planet. This movie shows beautifully how properly managed ruminants like cows and sheep restore dead and depleted soil. It shows that nurturing Mother Nature's cycles builds soil and creates high-quality food. The scene with the business card and arable vs. non-arable land was particularly useful in solidifying the concept that we need to create food on non-arable land, and this is where the animals thrive. It also addresses many of the difficult questions around ethics of eating meat. Highly recommended!"}, {"id": 40, "text": "Honest, thoughtful, well put together. Compelling viewing"}, {"id": 41, "text": "A very clear and easy way to understand where our food come from and how can Farmers contribute to the healying of the planet by, in the meanwhile producing secure and good quality food. Also show the respect that it is needed to animal food production.

I have and will continue to recommend this film to anyone who will listen."}, {"id": 43, "text": "A positive film exposing the folly of the black and white arguement of meat or no meat. It's how we treat the meat - and as a consequence how we nurture our soil and how we provide nutrition not just fodder to humans. This film is eager to share so much information it is a bit bitty in places but the overall theme is so positive. Agricultural practices can be the solution not the problem to our environmental catastrophe. Animals (ruminants) have been part of our world for millennia and we need to mimic nature to save nature. The film also debunks the health scares surrounding meat. As Zoe Harcombe says - surely our modern diseases of diabetes, cancer and obesity are more likely to be related to modern foods than meat that we have been eating since Homo sapiens evolved!"}, {"id": 44, "text": "This film brings an important perspective to the discussion about sustainable agriculture but leaves out many important arguments and other sides of the story. Would suit it very well to adress all aspects of the issue."}, {"id": 45, "text": "Excellent film documenting how important it is for us to understand why humans eat meat. I didn't know protesters were bullying small business, ethically minded butcher shops. The ignorant continue to create a culture of intimidation and refuse to learn from others. I love how this film highlights small farmers and their methods of treating the animals and land with respect and gratitude. This is a film which calls for healthy people, healthy animals and a healthy planet, through the lens of reality and not some fluffy fantasy world where everything is unicorns and rainbows. More people need to see this movie."}, {"id": 46, "text": "Such a touching and educational film about the truth around pasture raised beef and regenerative agriculture."}, {"id": 47, "text": "Honestly, when I watched it, I thought that nothing in the film is out of ordinary. Growing up with farmer grandparents in 80s and early 90s Poland, I've ran from cows and was attacked by poultry - but I've heard a lot about crop rotation, seen the cows grazing and all that stuff - something that disappeared in the meantime.Many people eat meat but at the same time agree with everything they are bombarded with by the media and they are baffled when someone starts talking about it. The vegan ideas became normal, while defending meat seems wrong and people don't understand what is the point. The film is a very good starting point, synthesizing the simple arguments. It is US-centric, obviosly, but unfortunately the US leads the way whether it's right or wrong."}, {"id": 48, "text": "I totally agree with eating meat raised in a Regenerative way. I have chickens and rabbits my chickens free range and go in a coop at night my rabbits are in tractors that I move daily. I throw all my scraps from my kitchen in my coop. Twice a year my husband cleans the coop and everything goes on the garden in the fall and spring. Ive been doing the no till method for about 3 seasons. My soil has tons of earthworms and looks so much better! We have more of a homestead then a farm. We have 2.59 acres that have wild chives ,grapes, blackberries, autumn olive, and tons of edible and Medicinal plants growing. I eventually want to rotate goats also at some point. I believe in this style of farming and think it will save the soil and our future. People are opening there eyes slowly but surely. I really hope the Subsidized farmers jump on board. Great movie! its people like you that are saving the planet!!"}, {"id": 49, "text": "Considering how potentially inflammatory the subject matter of this film is, Sacred Cow is accurate, thoughtful, balanced and devoid of sensationalism. It looks livestock as an integral part of the planet's ecosystem and biodiversity, and how regenerative agriculture reverses desertification and sequesters carbon (amongst other things). I completely recommend the film to everyone, particularly those who have watched and believed the inaccurate and manipulative vegan propaganda films such as What the Health, Cowspiracy, Game Changers etc."}, {"id": 50, "text": "Congratulations on a great film - very well told with the origins of industrial agriculture and the implications well spelt out. Then moving through to Regenerative Ag. with all the benefits - probably could have been told a bit more strongly- nutrient density and soil capacities to hold water and nutrients, but with a strong focus on animal welfare and environmental benefits of having cattle - especially the new work and re think on the impact that methane has on global warming. I really want everyone to see this film!"}, {"id": 51, "text": "Whatever you choose to eat it's important to understand the system that produces that food. The body of science on regenerative agriculture has been expanding very quickly. What we thought was the responsible thing to do in 2005 is quite different in 2020. As long as humans have been on the Earth they have been eating as have all the animals, insects, fish, anything that is alive. How we eat affects the systems we are a part of. Understanding how we affect those systems will affect our choices. Making a choice before you understand the system becomes foolhardy as we face a rapidly changing planet through the climate crisis. You don't have to eat animals, but animals must be part of the system if humans are to continue on the planet."}, {"id": 52, "text": "I loved the film and feel that it is a wonderful, thoughtful documentary. I am a huge fan or Diana and Robb. They have done a wonderful job with this film. I know from consuming their other content that they are passionate about helping people and communities. The film covered so many critical aspects of the meat discussion and provides excellent solutions. The information presented is measured and easy to understand for all audience levels. My only concern is that the content containing animal production including slaughter will deter inquisitive vegans from viewing this valuable content. But I don't think the film would be the same without it."}, {"id": 53, "text": "I've been following the authors of the book for years. Eagerly I waited for the film to be released. It absolutely exceeded my expectation. More often than not movies based on a book are disappointing. This is a case for a movie fulfilling the book. It's not only educational, but a story of renewal told eloquently and captured my attention to the very end! I hope everyone takes the time to watch it - more than once! So much information is packed into this documentary."}, {"id": 54, "text": "A wholistic and integrative look at food production and consumption, a far cry from the dogmatic and simplistic meat vs vegan war fueled on by corrupt media and corporate interests. A humbling but inspiring look at the place of humans in nature."}, {"id": 55, "text": "The movie was wonderful.It explains how, when, and why the food supply chain is the way it is.It exposes what is wrong about the current agriculture processes and what their damages are.It provides example of how livestock farmers' ideals meet those of vegans, and that sustainable, humane farming is the only way to treat an animal with dignity and respect.100% would recommend. Should be showed in schools!"}, {"id": 56, "text": "Like the Sarengeti Rules, another must see documentary, this film lays out plainly the argument that ruminants can regenerate the planet and keep humans fed. It isn't livestock farming that is the problem, it is all factory farming. The answer is regenerative farming. What is that? Watch this beautiful, inspiring film."}, {"id": 57, "text": "A well researched film and a much needed balanced perspective to eating meat. Definitely helps to have the science to back up the discussions that meat is not the cause of the end of the world. Will be getting as many people as I can to spread the word."}, {"id": 58, "text": "Such great information. Well balanced. Well done.need movies like this. Even if it is against the grain we need to be able to see evidence and have intelligent conversations about things. Not one way is right. Let's talk."}, {"id": 59, "text": "A beautifully made film and clearly presented argument in favour of regenerative agriculture to heal the earth and our bodies. It debunks so much of the false narrative around eating meat. I loved every minute of it. I highly recommend reading the book as well."}, {"id": 60, "text": "I'm so happy you've created this amazing documentary style video. It's easy to watch and understand and nails home how critical animals are to ensure a balanced eco system.Regenative Farming is the only viable solution moving forward."}, {"id": 61, "text": "Loved this film. It's so exciting and inspiring to see that the land will respond when you give it what it needs. I'm in awe of the farmers who take such pride in what they produce. Their work is gruelling, and society seldom gives them the support and plaudits they deserve.Sacred Cow was a valuable education in just an hour and twenty minutes. I was very happy to see the first farming couple on screen return at the end of the film with a new approach and sense of fulfillment in their work."}, {"id": 62, "text": "This film is chock full of important information on how we can restore our precious topsoil by returning to the practice of growing animals on grass. I'm a former vegan whose physical and mental health suffered on that diet. Returning to a traditional diet of meat and veg restored me and has helped me successfully endure cancer treatment and enabled me to quickly recover from COVID.The film is also beautifully shot and I loved learning more about small farms. These farmers truly love the land and animals and respect the natural circle of life. Great job!!"}, {"id": 63, "text": "A must watch doc! Beautifully written and produced, this riveting film lays out a compelling case for cattle production via sustainably managed grazing."}, {"id": 64, "text": "This is an absolutely critical film in a world with so much conflicting, inaccurate, and dubious/insidious information (and films). Sacred Cow takes a completely fair, balanced, and fact-supported view of the nutritional, environmental, and ethical case for better meat. A must watch for carnivores, omnivores, and vegetarians/vegans alike!"}, {"id": 65, "text": "This show is so very needed now. It challenges assumptions that meat is unhealthy and somehow less virtuous than plant foods and shows the harmful impact of the myth that animal agriculture is hurting the planet when in fact, it is the answer! The movie is logically and seamlessly composed, visually stunning, and presents solid science rather than relying on sensational, emotional arguments. And then, of course, it has that beautiful human touch that makes it relatable and stirs consciousness. Thank you Rob and Diane for this labor of love! I wish it was required viewing! I know my kids must!"}, {"id": 66, "text": "We need more films like this, that aim to set the record straight. There is so much one-sided information being promoted by so-called credible sources.

Great work Diana Rodgers, Robb Wolf, etc."}, {"id": 67, "text": "Very informative and well put together documentary. Unlike the recent vegan propaganda films backed by big food corporations, who claim eating vegan will save the planet, this film points out the actual science behind regenerative farming and debunks big food's spin on it. There was nothing i didn't already know in this film but can now use this to point my friends in the right direction to see how they've been previously brainwashed."}, {"id": 68, "text": "Working with nature and mimicking natural systems that have been in place for eons makes perfect sense. People who are so out of touch with nature and have no understanding of what goes into producing the food that they eat tend to believe that technology can solve all of the world's problems. This film highlights the environmental and ethical benefits of regenerative agriculture. True grassroots funding as well. I really hope that this film will reach far and wide to move regenerative agriculture forward."}, {"id": 69, "text": "I wish this was a mandatory watch over a mandatory vaccine."}, {"id": 70, "text": "We've used managed grazing principles on our ranch for 35 years and have seen first hand the ecological benefits of doing so from increased water infiltration, to increased wildlife species to increased native diversity. This movie does a great job of explaining agricultural problems and solutions that affect human health in a way that everyone can understand. I like that it tackles all the angles: nutrition, environment and animal rights with compassion and sensitivity. I wasn't done watching it and I sent the link to urban friends who I know are concerned about good health, both personal and planetary. The book is also excellent--very well researched and documented. Highly recommend both!"}, {"id": 71, "text": "I really enjoyed Sacred Cow and learned a lot about the history of farming as well as our current problems and the science behind some solutions to being making farming more environmental, sustainable and ethical. I especially appreciated the interview with the couple who owned a local butcher shop and who reached out to some vegan protestors, pointing out that they really were fighting against the same enemy. I can't wait to watch it again, take some notes and discuss it with friends."}, {"id": 72, "text": "This lovely film has gorgeous images of peaceful cows, lush pastures, and explanations by grounded, practical, and knowledgeable people who are finding a way through our environmental crises. This film conveys immense hope and reassurance. It is as satisfying as if finally satisfying one's red meat cravings after being vegetarian for many years with eating a regeneratively-raised beef burger."}, {"id": 73, "text": "Very well put together and easily digestible by any viewer.

It's a complicated issue for many, and I love how it deals with the ethics of eating animals and the health of the planet. Those two issues matter to me and were pushing me towards being a vegetarian for many years. It's important to put both issues in the proper perspective and not just follow propaganda that is in the media. I also was not doing my body any favors and was becoming quite unwell. Putting the life of an animal above our own well being is backwards thinking. I love that we can treat animals as sacred by providing a beautiful life for them and also respecting our own needs, and doing both with dignity, just as the indigenous cultures did, long before this land was colonized. People forget about the millions of bison that lived on this land and kept it verdant until they were destroyed.

WE HAVE THE POWER, SCIENCE, and EVIDENCE to turn this train wreck around. We can support local, we can educate ourselves, and we can honor our food. This concept is not strange, think about our ancestors and the Native Americans who honored the earth and the animals that provided them sustenance.

I feel like evangelising for it all over because it's a disturbing fact how much veganism is growing like a cult and harming many people and our environment.I like the way the movie showed real, compassionate people practicing animal agriculture. Quite a significant amount of information was presented in a short amount of time. There were two small changes that I would have liked - a longer interview with Lierre Keith of The Vegetarian Myth. I thought that more needed to be shown about the importance of eating meat for our health.The other thing, is I was concerned about all the visuals of raw meat in the beginning of the movie - I was concerned it would put vegans off and they wouldn't continue to watch the movie. I showed it to my older kids as they're all for veganism although they don't practice it in my house - they have chosen not to inconvenience me. They still weren't convinced because the vegan propoganda is strong in their age group, but...the environmental information really opened their eyes and I think it did get them thinking. I'm hoping that it will prevent them from making that unhealthy step in the future. One of the most vital pieces of information shared was how mass crop agriculture also requires death and that you can't get away from it, so it's better to do it compassionately and ethically instead of chopping up mice and rabbits in combine harvesters.

Thank you for getting this conversation started."}, {"id": 164, "text": "The film does a good job of showcasing some of the environmental benefits of regeneratively managed livestock when grazed in an appropriate setting. It also contributes to the ongoing public debate around the ethics of our food choices by highlighting some of the false dichotomies that grow out of a disconnect between consumers and the food systems they both rely up and critique, while also showing how, despite wider criticism of farmers for failings of land stewardship and animal welfare, many of those embracing regenerative agriculture are driven by a desire to address exactly these issues..However, some of the good aspects of the film, were overshadowed by the attack that is mounted, on several fronts, against people who choose not to include meat and other animal products in their diets. As well as drawing attention away from the more interesting parts of the film, it also trades on over-generalisations, errors, and equivocations (an example of the latter being the strand of argument that turns around the claim that all life depends upon death).Ironically, a number of the central arguments raised in the documentary, including a number that form part of this 'anti-vegan' thrust, also work both ways - but the film's producers either do not notice this or choose to overlook it.Because diet is such an emotive issue, whether we're vegans (who the film target), vegetarians, omnivores, carnivores or whatever, that often becomes an important part of our identity, which can make it more difficult for us to accept evidence that contradicts the beliefs that are tied up with that, and make us more susceptibility to things like confirmation bias. Sadly a growing number of people within regenerative agriculture feel pressure to define themselves in relation to vegans (often a proxy not for activists who oppose the killing of animals, which would include many vegetarians as well, and members of the food industry pushing plant-based foods, ostensibly on environmental and ethical grounds, but in reality for purely economic reasons)..I do not feel that it is uncharitable to say that that is also true of those who made this film.The film rightly pushes back against accounts of the environmental impact of different diets that vilify livestock - and ruminants in particular - while failing to distinguish between those managed regeneratively and those in conventional, industrial animal agriculture. It also highlight some of the big problems with monocrop agriculture in non-mixed systems, when they are heavily reliant upon environmentally harmful inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, etc.). But when it comes to cropping systems, it also fails to distinguish the good from the bad, the monoculture field-crop systems from the more sophisticated and environmentally regenerative permaculture, agro-ecological, agro-forestry or indigenous systems that don't necessarily incorporate livestock. We see a similar failure to think beyond the industrial agricultural paradigm in Frank Mitloehner's claims that you cannot grow crops on the two thirds of available agricultural land defined, under current systems, as marginal or non-arable - a claim which, anyone who has looked into the reasons that land is classified in the way it is, or has studied alternative and indigenous food systems, can see is clearly false..Finally, after deconstructing the narrative that red meat drives various health problems and rightly shifting the focus onto highly processed foods instead, the film goes on to include spurious and inadequately evidences claims about plant-based diets being de facto bad for people's health. Many people can get benefits from the inclusion of some meat in their diet, but there isn't really any solid data that shows that everyone's diet MUST of necessity include meat to satisfy their nutritional requirements, or to support Zoe Harcombe wildly exaggerated claim that, it's 'only a matter of time before something in vegans' health suffers'."}, {"id": 165, "text": "Don't forget to 'like' Ray's Paleo Pittsburgh on facebook!"}, {"id": 166, "text": "I would love to see this documentary watched far and wide, especially by youth who have not yet been brainwashed!

Monocrop farms are quiet and the only life seems to be the one plant that the farmer planted in his ploughed fields, every other animal or plant is an enemy to the farmer and is a problem that they want to remove. I wish the documentary could have shown the sugar cane farms I have been to. They do have small animals running around in the dense underbrush between the cane stalks despite the farmers best efforts to remove them but when they burn the field for harvest, all the animals get burnt to death in a ring of fire and it creates a huge column of smoke that can be seen for miles.

Every student should watch this, as our youth will be either the harbingers of doom or catalysts of positive change.

I am sympathetic to the regenerative agriculture movement. I think this film does a decent job of explaining that animals are part of natural nutrient cycles.

Where the film fell short for me was addressing the methane emission issue - I think this issue was glossed over. Evidence does exist that raising livestock using regenerative methods can at least break even with respect to carbon emissions. But overall I think the film is a great contribution to the debate about meat vs. meatless diets, and regenerative agriculture. I think that vegans can be a little divorced from reality, which is that all animals kill to survive. This film makes that point especially well.

In Defense of Paleoesque Diets - While Kresser and Wolf are, imho, well respected paleo research warriors, having mostly them two, plus the single woman with the health problem / vegan conundrum, is a tiny sample - but I realize it's tough to cram all that data driven stuff into a 1.5 hour movie.2. While I really liked the footage of Joel Salatin using multi-animal synergistic mobbed grazing, him flipping out over Beyond &amp; Impossible burger got kind of conflated in there with the idea of 'lab grown meat'. The majority of humans probably don't know that there is a race to produce true 'meat' from cell cultures right now, in a lab, that is biologically as identical to actual meat as possible. This is different from the conjurings of veggie-style-processed Beyond &amp; Impossible Burgers. He's right that from a sustainability standpoint, the Beyond &amp; Impossible Burgers have the same problems as any other veggie grown thing, but the cost of true lab grown meat, while presently super huge, is something that scientists are trying to overcome. Would it be safe? Unknown.3. I know this movie is about why having sustainable animal raising &amp; eating is good for humanity, and there is mention of monoculture = bad, but surely there is some other type of veggie-based food growing option to consider. Hydroponics?4. Sort of feel like the movie should have been called 'Sacred Grazers' instead of 'cow'. : ) Although I presume this is because there are places cows can graze nutrient content from that other animals cannot - like the gentleman who did the cool paper folding demo of total Earth land that (according to him) cannot be used to grow anything else, plus the benefit to the land as a result of their grazings vs say, pigs or chickens or antelope."}, {"id": 287, "text": "Sacred Cow is a refreshing look at our food systems where meat, specifically beef, is concerned.

There was no rotational grazing, just feed the cows, milk the cows. I'm sure if the science were around back then our country would not be in the condition it is today.

Feet of topsoil washing off into the creeks and rivers. Destruction of pheasant habitat by removal of sloughs and fence lines.

I am particularly alarmed when high school and college kids--who are notoriously lousy and inconsistent eaters--completely eliminate animal products from their diets in response to one of these movies. To be a healthy vegan (and not everyone can be; this is highly individual) is to be very disciplined and focused, and to have access to supplements that you remember to take on a regular basis.

I could no longer listen to the propaganda after the young farmer described his assisting a sow in birthing after watching a Youtube video -- talk about an experienced/qualified source to speak about farming -- who then went further to say that all organic farming uses animal products for fertilizer. Having come from a farming family, farming in the sixties involved the use of crop rotation and cover cropping, not bone meal. The local organic farm near me now uses those same time tested methods along with animal manure, not bone meal, chicken feathers, blood meal, etc. It's this type of poorly researched programming that calls into question the validity of all documentaries and leads to further public confusion."}, {"id": 460, "text": "The movie was just facts on top facts without a good storyline to get and keep attention of the viewer.

No mention of what percentage of livestock rearing is done via regenerative agriculture and so the message just came across as 'keep eating meat' even though the vast majority in not done in such ways. Suggesting that scientists are so dumb that when they do studies linking red meat to certain cancers and heart disease that they don't take account of other factors. Ridiculing all the peer review studies that show that meat is not required at any stage in life for health and growth. No mention that even is all livestock rearing goes the way of regenerative agriculture then either far less meat would be produced so people would have to cut down their meat consumption, or that far more land would need to be used, that goes against all environmental principles. There is a reasonable message woth regenerative agriculture but is not to be found in this film. It is just a way to put doubt into people's minds so they keep eating vast amounts of meat..."}, {"id": 462, "text": "I thought this film was beautifully made, however the content and message seemed to be quite one-sided and reactionary. To me it seemed to be a simple attempt to attack anti-meat messaging. While I understand why the regenerative farming industry would feel the need to do that in light of recent trends and ideologies, I felt it went too far one way and as a result, did not appear objective. I am a huge fan of regenerative farming and totally agree that it should replace intensive farming but presenting it as the only way forward seems unreasonable. While the film decried the notion that anyone should even consider reducing their meat intake, there was no evidence presented that suggested this system could meet the world's current (let alone future) demand for meat. After looking at food sustainability for a number of years I now, I really believe there is a place for many solutions to exist alongside each other. These include: 1) A reduction of global meat intake - particularly among the highest meat consuming countries and socioeconomic groups. This will involve accepting that people can live very healthy lives without consuming meat if they wish to. Meatless Monday IS relevant for the many people who were brought up eating meat 3x day and 7 days a week. 2) Substituting monocropping with sustainable vertical farming systems where possible and where regenerative farming may not work 3) Supporting the development of sustainable meat alternatives such as plant-based and cell-based, to augment supply. (Cell-based meat is not in production yet, so to say it is unsustainable is premature - especially as sustainability is a primary goal. There are many methods and approaches being investigated in this field that were not covered in the film) Regenerative farming is an infinitely better way to farm animals than is the norm today. However, it is just one of many approaches needed to make food production, particularly meat, more sustainable and reduced consumption is one of these. While I know the vegan, anti-meat lobby can seem very intolerant and one sided, fighting back with the same singlemindedness has reduced the impact of the film for me.

I speak to you as an ex-vegan who had been influenced by what Nina Teicholz's paradigm shifting book The Big Fat Surprise has shown to be pseudo-science; the fallacy that meat is harmful. I still at times struggle with the reality that industrial livestock operations are extremely harmful to both cattle and the environment, and it's a moral tradeoff at times.

But it also shows us there is hope for the future.Smaller, bio-diverse, farms using greater, organic based, regenerative farming and grazing practices, and less chemical fertilizers and pesticides, to produce good healthy food, can survive and flourish and re-invigorate our rural communities.The free range, pasture fed cow plays a vital role in getting the carbon out of the atmosphere and back into the soil to a greater depth (ie. 1-2 meters, instead of 20-30 centimeters), greatly increasing it's fertility, water holding capacity and the number of micro-organisms, necessary to grow healthy, sustainable food.Since buying my small, run down farm in Tasmania 2yrs ago I've been tapping into the many resources (in Australia and around the world), out there to follow regenerative farming and grazing practices, to improve the bio-diversity of my soil. It's already paying dividends, my paddocks are thick and lush, and my cows are fat and happy. I rotate my whole herd as one group, around seven paddocks (a different one each week), mimicking the migration of a wild herd of buffalo, and after the cows have moved on, that's when the magic happens. The earthworms, dung beetles and micro flora and fauna do all the work, sequestering the carbon, but they couldn't do it without the cows.I can testify that regenerative farming works. Mother nature's been doing it for millions of years, we just have to stop working against her and help her do her thing. A marriage of our husbandry of the land with nature, and the love and respect for the plants and animals in our care.I don't know any local farmer or grazier that doesn't care greatly for his land and his animals. But I don't know a large corporate company that does. You can make a difference by supporting your local farmers and producers.I sold my house in Canberra two years ago and bought a small 92 acre farm in Northern Tasmania, to try to survive the inevitable, oncoming ravages of global warming.

All conflicts are eventually solved by dialogue and some give and take. The plant based activists need to realise that there is an environmental cost, a loss of life cost and a personal health cost to their diet, and that eating small amounts of meat that was raised in a natural environment is actually a win on all of these levels.From a farming perspective, farmers and more importantly governments and multi national corporations need to realise that how a large proportion of farming is currently being done is also wrong from an environmental perspective, from a loss of life perspective and from a health perspective. So when you look at these opposed stand points, the negative realities of both sides are actually very similar.So if you could stop the gesturing and pontification, the solution is fairly simple - produce food as nature intended, let nature repair the environment, stimulate life and provide healthy nutritious food regardless of whether it is plant or meat based.

Recognizing that whether the industrial system is used for plants alone or for all forms of food, that animals do and will suffer as their habitatis are eliminated with massive industrial ag.

To eliminate ruminants from the food chain is not good for them nor our health, but simply a misplaced idealism based on isolated, disconnected naivity from disconnected (though caring) citizens who have lost perspective on nature, traditional agriculture and the needs for nutrition. worldwide, not just in rich countries.This film does some heavy lifting that society needs desparately in order to work through the food and farming mess we are in.

If you have any radical vegans in your life and need an argument to try to persuade them to abandon their lifestyle or accept yours, this film is it. I was hoping for more of an environmental analysis of regenerative farming, and unfortunately this film comes up shallow. There is only a small section on the carbon impact of beef (and nothing comparing it to other forms of meat eating). And although there is some good footage of regenerative grazing techniques, the film doesn't look at the resources consumed by beef farming or at alternative uses of resources and land. Perhaps this is necessary. The film covers a good deal of ground, from obesity to humane slaughtering techniques to restoring the Chihuahuan desert to 3rd world malnutrition. But for each topic, I found myself wanting more depth. It's hard to talk about the demonization of meat and fat in the American diet without talking about our overreliance on corn and sugar. And is veganism really the same problem as eating too much Fruity Pebbles? Is eating Fruity Pebbles the same problem as factory farming? Is factory farming the same problem as the paucity of nutritional supplements in the 3rd world? Is the paucity of supplements the same problem as using fossil fuels? Instead of a detailed look at how we might solve any of these problems (e.g. land regeneration, obesity, malnutrition, climate change), we just get a panacea: eating meat is good for everything if you do it right. That's a necessary argument if you're confronting an extremist who wants to eliminate all meat from Berkeley, CA by 2020, or if you have someone who needs reassurance that eating even a grass-fed, sustainably raised burger won't damage their enviro street cred.

We will always need ruminants to keep our soil viable. That much is obvious and the large CAFO operations need to become a thing of the past. The real problem is with the existence of food corporations which create, market and sell food-like products to our children and all of us who are forced to shop in markets full of nothing else. It is very possible to not only survive, but thrive (children included) on a vegan diet as long as it comes from whole foods. Millions of people all over the planet have done it successfully for hundreds of years. The choice is between real, whole food and non nutritious products that only make us sick.

Sacred Cow addresses the fat phobia that has made us afraid of meat at least one day off the week, leading us to exclude a nutrient-dense food from our plates. The horrors of industrial animal agriculture and production for maximum profit have made us question the ethics of eating any animal product whatsoever, even honey. What this documentary does is help us see the relationship between animals and the land and how that can be managed for the benefit of both.

The presentation of the facts was rigorous and it took the time to present the opposing arguments coming from the vegans and then deconstruct them.A butchers near me got attacked with graffiti labelling him as a murderer scrawled all over his shop so the only criticism I have is that at times more could have been said about the cult of veganism and the actions that some of them go to in order to defend their ideology.

To get an entire nation on board with this excellent concept, the regenerative stock raisers will need to find ways to achieve economies of scale to bring prices down in order to compete with and supplant big corporate farms and their supply chain of gigantic, unsanitary feed lots that are geared to meet the daily demands for meat by millions of Americans.To achieve these economies of scale, the huge agribusiness corporations raising and selling the most meat today will have to be shown that it's in their best financial interest to switch to better ways of raising beef. Since this is a public health issue, causing illnesses that cost Americans billions in healthcare owing to poor nutrition, the federal government could consider developing supported programs to convert the millions of Midwest corn and soy fields from cattle-feed operations to using those rangelands in a regenerative way.I'm from Nebraska, with ancestors who began farming in Nebraska Territory in the 1850s. In the late '40s &amp; early '50s I spent summers on my great grandparents farm in Seward County. They had a Farmall tractor but still plowed with draft horses, had kerosene-lanterns for light, had well-water pumps in the kitchen, a wood stove and no electricity, and a miserable outhouse. As a kid it looked like living the dream to me, until it later dawned that farming is a tough business. Even today farmers plowing in air-conditioned tractors with stereo music and computers with satellite connections still deal with the same challenges to stay profitable with whatever economies of scale are at hand. These modern-day farmers too will need convincing that regenerative techniques are the best way to preserve their land and still turn a profit."}, {"id": 476, "text": "Hi Diana,I loved your movie!

I and my animals eat only organic also raise bees. My neighbours to the north and east of me are conventional farmers. The neighbour west of me is almost organic. He doesn't use GMO and uses Joel Salatin's method of pasture rotation. A few years back my neighbour to the east of me sprayed all his hay with round-up and killed my 14 hives outright. I was devastated. Within a few weeks I started losing cattle. It seems as if they were all directly sprayed. Even though there is a buffer zone which is a hedge, it's never enough. The wind of course came from the east. Within 2 months we lost a calf, then her mother ( my trained Milker) a bull and 2 more cows! I have since talked to the neighbours wife (who has thyroid cancer) given her a tour of my farm and gave her some honey. Showed her the hives and explained what happened. She was shocked and said of course it was not her husband but an employee. I approached the situation with love and did not accuse. Nevertheless the damage is done, they have returned the field to hay and haven't sprayed that field since. I'm sure there are many stories out there.Thank you for your determination in coming out with a movie like this.

But I'm seriously wondering who this documentary is aimed at. I'm pretty sure most vegans will switch off after the initial few scenes from inside of a butcher shop. Yet the film continues to show vegans demonstrating, the harmfull production of fake meat and an interview of an ex vegan. There are some valuable insights here, no doubt. But obviously the production of mono cultures is also an important step in the very harmful practice of factory farming. While this is also illustrated in the film, it fails to communicate how much of an impact factory farming has. Veganism seems to be just a symptom of a malfuctioning system of food production. People new to the matter won't grasp this I'm afraid. Furthermore I think this documentary could easily be cut down to an hour. Some content is repeated or does not have any informative value. Of course I don't expect documentaries to be dispassionate but I don't like that the film wants to guide you to a certain opinion using emotional music in the end. I see that music is a powerful tool to lead emotions in movies but it always feels cheap in documentaries. And I feel like there should be another whole documentary explaining how these ideas practically work for the masses. They just claim it will work but not exactly how it will work. How to support regenerative farming if you're living like the majority (poor and in a big city).

Personally, though I didn't see it so much, she did feel it was a bit heavy on the one-sided bias. Even though she agreed with most of what she saw, she felt that the vegan/vegetarian aspect wasn't presented as a legitimate other side of the argument.

I very much appreciated the interview with the former vegan who stated that being a vegan was an identity and being exposed to other viewpoints resulted in very uncomfortable cognitive dissonance. I would have liked the film to have dug deeper on how plant based foods processing is destroying the land through monoculture. Many will disagree but showing humane slaughter of animals at the new abbatoir they profiled would have further supported the focus on humane raising of livestock. Many vegans have watched the inhuman slaughtering on YouTube; they need to see the other side. Vegans that I know also focus on premature deaths of animals not realizing the consequences of letting domestic animals live out their lives debilitated by degenerative aging diseases. (Compare wild animals.) All in all this was an excellent film and I realize that they did have to cut out a lot of content but a little more length would have given some of the issues more teeth.

There was almost zero new information in this film for me, but I felt and appreciated the care and respect and ethical integrity to its subject, interviewees, conflict, and viewers, all.That was my biggest concern going in (especially with a provocative name like sacred cow): I am utterly and completely tired of people using documentary to distort, reduce, scapegoat, inflate controversy and associated egos. And I feel relieved to report this, much like the recent Gather, about indigenous food sovereignty, is not one of those documentaries... you know the ones that leave you feeling a little ethically disgusted for having consumed them, like junk food marketed as a health food. Nor was it vapidly uplifting, like noncaloric sweeteners. This documentary is nutritional polemic, and the more of it you digest, the deeper you go, the more it will nourish you, us, and the planet. They pull us in the opposite direction of the Race to the Bottom of the Brainstem (ref Center for Humane Tech).I have no affiliations whatsoever with the film makers or anyone interviewed, though I know about and have come across several of them independently.

Minimally-nutritious processed food has overtaken the grocery store based on being cheap and convenient. Monocultures are the scourge of the earth. Animals should be eaten but in very sustainable, ethical and balanced manner. By balanced manner I mean as it relates to the food pyramid. I that I have had access to a lot solid science over my 35 year career and I believe that Americans eat way more meat than is what nutritionally needed and that was not addressed in the movie. What does the film team believe in regards to this?I am also an environmentalist and some of the messaging in this movie falls a little short in my opinion. Are we to embrace all of this pasturing and grazing in lieu of native animals and ecosystems? Do deer and moose and elk and buffalo and apex predators have a place in this vision? Our continent evolved with these animals as part of the chain and I felt that this was not explored. The heartwarming critter cams showing coyote's and skunks are one thing, but those animals actually thrive in suburban and urban areas already. Rural America was home to other species that I think still lose in this cow-centric model.As an animal welfare advocate and a factory farm/corporate ag hater, I do believe that the movie addresses these issues very well. It was my main reason for the high rating. I struggled, however (as it appears the film makers did as well) with whether to show the actual kill step in the new, humane meat processing plant. At age 23 I spent 30 minutes on a kill floor in a downtown Milwaukee kill floor; from stun station to tripe washing machines. That always stuck with me and for the last 37 years I have continued to eat beef despite seeing it. I feel blessed to be able to make this decision with full disclosure of the behind the scenes peek at slaughtering. Does the film aim to avoid backlash by not showing the first 4 steps in that slaughter house? Are they afraid they will lose their viewer by showing the truth of what that looks like? Avoiding that pivotal part of the conversation does not show courage.When covering the whole methane conversation, the light hearted approach rubbed me the wrong way. Showing scientist laughing at people who have embraced this apparently-incorrect belief doesn't help the cause. Discuss it seriously. Also, even as a scientist, I did not understand the argument about petroleum-based methane somehow being CHEMICALLY different than cow-created methane. I still feel like methane is methane, until you explain this more, and forget the scoffing and laughing in the conversation.That early segment on the food industry making foods so flavorful that they are like a drug is a bit out of place. What does that have to do with cows? Using flavor potentiating ingredients could actually be part of the solution. You can use less meat and more of these umami, satisfying flavor ingredients to make up for eating less meat. Many of them, such as yeast extracts, are primarily protein and extracted amino acids, and not artificial nor hocus pocus.Overall this film gives me the permission to eat sustainably raised, local beef; something I try to do anyway. It doesn't, however, touch upon the sub-topics listed above and it doesn't give any solutions for at least reducing our amount of beef in order to re-establish more native ecosystems, complete with large mammals that would compete with cows for resources and allowing for predators that might impact herd yield."}, {"id": 483, "text": "Hi DianeI really enjoyed your film - thankyou for all your hard work! I myself studied Agribusiness at university and until recently was a beef farmers wife! Regenerative Agriculture has been something I have taken a keen interest in for a long time and am always being met with resistance whenever the topic is broached with conventional farmers.If I may offer one piece of constructive feedback for you to consider for future films..... All of the interviews with small scale, tree changing farmers (as they would be called in Australia) dont add a lot of value even though their individual stories are great and positive. My reason for saying this is that commercial farmers...and the ones needing to change the most, will not do so by seeing small, intensive farmers demonstrated.There really needs to be a focus I believe on the larger commercial farmers and how they have transitioned from conventional to regenerative...what were the challenges and what were the triumphs and how has that affected their bottom line? I believe this is what commercial farmers want to see. They dont want to hear this from me as I am not farming and they dont want to hear it from tree changers they want to hear it first hand from those that have done it on a big scale.I love Joel Selatin and how he demonstrated what it means on his farm with the way he uses tape to move the cattle around in small paddocks etc and how the other animals follow along behind. More of that would take this movement to the next level I believe. Even if your second film was all about that.....what several large scale farmers transition etc....that would be phenomenal.Cant wait to see more of your work.

Sustainable farming simply follows nature's example by moving cattle around pastures in a similar way that bison roamed freely in the past, naturally fertilizing the soil as they go, encouraging regrowth and eliminating or reducing the need for chemical fertilizers that are often used in corn and soy production. Cattle can also be kept on land that is not arable and cannot be farmed with crops, so they are not taking anything away from crop-farming.As noted in the documentary, meat eaters want the ethical treatment of animals too.

Meat has been a part of the human diet long before the advent of modern agriculture and the food industry, yet it is demonized as unhealthy and damaging to the environment. It is clear that balance is a defining principle in most aspects of the physical world and that we have generally forgotten the important role of grazing animals in the maintenance of healthy soil that promotes the growth of crops that are nutritionally replete. It is the cycle of life that has been going on since well before humankind came along to provide modern tweaks that have generally led to practices that increase crop yields but add toxins to and reduce nutrients in food. With the advent of modern agriculture, food has been more abundant but less nutritious than ever and the food industry has promoted many food products that are contributing to the explosion of obesity and chronic diseases. It was very interesting to see the juxtaposition of vegan activism with the farmers and butchers who take such care of and have such reverence for the animals they raise and butcher for their sustenance. No matter whether it is an animal or a plant, we must kill something to live and many animals are sacrificed to ensure good produce yields even they are not directly consumed.

Furthermore, we the consumer are largely responsible.I would like to think that if vegans saw the connection between factory farming and their plates they would choose differently.

It did start to shift some of my concerns about the impact of meat on climate change and the environment. The documentary was relatively balanced, not a one sided propaganda piece. Great to see also the issues of livestock raising in Africa/Kenya. What could have improved this documentary, and information to viewers would have been addressing three issues. One is cutting of rainforests in the Amazon and elsewhere for cattle production. Second is whether current and growing demand for beef can be met entirely through grass-fed operations. All those huge concentrated feedlots briefly shown in the film, if they all close, what will happen to prices and availability, especially with rising demand in developing countries? Third is a deeper discussion of the effect of burbing/farting cows releasing methane into the air. All very good to say it is a natural cycle, not as bad as release of CO2 from digging up fossil fuels, but would be good to cite studies if grassfed operations are neutral or net contributors to global warming or not. This was not clear. Finally, I was skeptical of the assertion that grassfed beef would be on land not suited for agriculture, which is a larger area than crop land. Although briefly mentioned, a better argument is to shift to mixed farming where animal production is integrated with crops and trees, and where animals do not compete with crops. This should have been given more attention."}, {"id": 489, "text": "Even for those who live in this vineyard, Sacred Cow delivers. Emotionally, the flow of young farmers around the world producing grass-fed meat had the biggest impact on me. The facts and science throughout the film are sound, although of course not complete. Only so much can be covered in a one documentary. The reviews to date provide ample reasons to expand viewership, so I want to flag two other considerations. First, the film could give rise to the notion that converting worn out farmland and range to healthy, productive pastures and fields is easy. It is not. It takes time and capital. The path is tricky, and mistakes will be made. For every farmer in the US that has gone down the road and benefited and persisted, several more have tried and been unable to bring land back. For this reason, both markets and policy will need to provide helping hands if the transition is to occur on a large enough scale to deliver the food-nutritional value, animal welfare, environmental, and rural community benefits the film highlights. Second, there are bound to be many people in the Biden Administration who get it, and who will deploy their skills to try to change the the playing field. One essential step is to stop propping up failing CAFOs. There is zero chance that regulation will meaningfully hasten their being put out to pasture (pardon the pun). Only raw economics will get this job done. And this will happen only if taxpayers stop subsidizing their largely futile efforts to deal with waste, crowding, and inhuman conditions for both animals and workers. A second essential step is to forge a bipartisan agreement around redirecting a sizable portion of current farm subsidies to a national soil health and soil carbon sequestration program. A new deal for an age-old problem, but one path almost everyone recognizes as vital, and one that will deliver many other benefits over time.Chuck Benbrook"}, {"id": 490, "text": "My wife and I watched the film. I appreciated the hard work and thoughtfulness put into this important topic.My wife has a tendency toward being a vegetarian, so learning from her experience of viewing the film was insightful for me. The video did encourage her to decide to include meat in her diet a little more often. The part of the video that showed the way livestock are generally handled today was upsetting to her, with the hope that adding respect into the cycle of life was vital. The closing comments from the young farming couple from the NE and their reverence for their animals was encouraging. My wife and I have talked about the value of adding livestock to our land management strategies on a full-time basis versus a seasonal approach so the film encouraged this direction. In this regard, I would say the film was a success in getting a message across.For me, I have been involved with this work for 40 years now. I also do consensus building work. My takeaways were that there was too much emphasis placed on the issue of the vegans versus ranching. I think it would have been a stronger story if less power was given to ideology versus to rational thought. I do fully realize that there is an ideology issue, which the film brought out, but there was too much power given to that issue. I think the important components of the story, and the storytellers' messages, many who are friends from over the years, were good. I just think not focusing so much on the vegan movement and more on why the earth and humans need this component of life could have been more powerful.Of course, the video is done, so not sure how valuable this input is. All in all, it's a great video and I hope that it circulates well.

I researched the same topics as the movie and soon I switched to eating meat once again but this time getting it from local, sustainable small farms. At the same time I stopped eating any kind of processed food completely. I really got touched by this movie as it depicted my own personal journey so well. It gives a clean summary of what went wrong in our world and how we can heal it via going back to the traditional and harmonious relation we once had.I think the movie tries its best not to be offensive towards vegans, but it still fails to do so. Furthermore, it could have diferenciate between the vegans who eat clean only and at least directly are not responsible for animal killing and the increasing number of vegans who goes right away into substituting their meat intake from fake unhealthy ultra-processed foods. Being vegan in its purest form is not easy for many, for all those people who cannot simply give up on meat getting their meat from sustainable sources is just so much more healthy and wiser than supporting big food conglomerates and buying their products made of toxic cheap garbage.The movie raises one main question: what do we want?

This is a valuable resource both for every person, from carnivore to vegetarian, to help understand not only where your meat comes from, but where your vegetables come from."}, {"id": 499, "text": "Ms. Rodgers, Well I just finished watching the film and it was informative, joyful, inspiring, and a pure joy to experience. My hopes are for you and these wonderful humans who participated, worked, and supported this needed reset of our worlds ways grows to the point of encompassing the earth and healing our lands, people, animals, and God's entire creation. Bravo on just an excellent job capturing a fair assessment of where we are at and more importantly where we should go firmly yet, gently. I loved all of those people in the film each connected together by heartstrings and felt their passion and dedication in their expressions of reasons to work in this field in this way. It affirmed their love for a kinder, more ethical approach to raising food, and a truer sense of love of their neighbors and planet. Well done! I have a request that via this e-mail give each and everyone of them a heartfelt hug from me. They deserve as do you as many hugs as you need to continue on. I did miss seeing more of White Oak Pastures as they are very dear to my heart in what they do and have a lot to offer as I would imagine almost all involved have. May you all have the courage to continue as this culture climate, Great Reset, by the globalists will oppose you as this is more a people for the people and people for the planet kind of thing and though they talk the talk and quack like similar ducks as those impassioned folks in the film they are not. May the good Lord watch over you all!Sincerely,Mike Moore"}, {"id": 500, "text": "As an Organic Regenerative Farmer in the Scottish Borders, I found this movie managed to highlight some of the key issues that need to be considered by all in relation to our food systems. It also makes them understandable for people from all walks of life. In my first class at Agricultural College in 1978, the first words I heard were :  As Farmers and Land Managers you are Stewards of the Land and you have a responsibility to make sure you leave the Land for the next generations in a better state than when you started. This movie guides us in that direction. With widespread distribution ,it may help to reconnect those that are so disconnected with the land and food production. We all need to again become, as Slow Food manifesto explains, co- producers, by helping us make better choices in our food consumption and drive change in our food production.We are part of an ecosystem which has got out of balance. This movie helps demonstrate that.Well done to all that have put positive effort and energy in making the movie and Good luck in bringing it to the attention of many more people. We shall be doing our bit at Peelham Farm"}, {"id": 501, "text": "I'm not a farmer or rancher but this book/movie makes me want to be. I watched the documentary but am not yet finished with the book. I hunt a lot and my dad preached conservation since I can remember. Hunting (and fishing) are how 80%+ of my family's meat is sourced. Knowing where your food comes from and how it makes it to your plate is one of my favorite things about hunting. I respect and honor the animals I hunt, so I can easily relate to the folks in the video who speak with such deference about the animals they raise, knowing they will eventually harvest them for food.The amount of research and rationale that went into Sacred Cow is impressive and I can't fathom how (or why) someone would challenge it. In recent years, I've seen a movement in my community (East Texas) toward locally sourced meat and produce, to the extent items are available. I love going into a butcher shop and knowing a neighbor sourced the beef or pork. And I've noticed the crowd at our local farmer's market grow in recent years. Change starts in your own home and smaller communities, so keep spreading the word! I'll be recommending Sacred Cow to anyone I have the opportunity to share a meal."}, {"id": 502, "text": "Thanks Diana and Robb for this work.Starting from the scientific givens and cultural history, and working towards solution suggestions that work in the modern era, the film is an engaging treatment of one of the defining problems for the 21st century: how to use the single planet to feed its human crew and their future generations.While most of the film used examples and contributions from USA - Africa and Europe were also represented. Since lower-tech, human-society-centric farming is the answer, the candidate solutions were scalable across the globe.I found it balanced and restrained, pointing out the consequences of the various ideas, from vegan to omnivore. The scientific contributions were of high quality and thought-provoking.A worthy addition to the discussions."}, {"id": 503, "text": "Full disclosure, I did not learn about regenerative agriculture from this movie, I was one of the thousands that contributed a small amount to help make it. My hope, however, is that others will come to understand just how important this solution is for the health of our soil and planet and ourselves.The makers of this film went out of their way to make the arguments for regenerative agriculture and the role of animal products in our diets without punching at the opposition. It would, no doubt, get more attention if the makers played the game the way some on the other side do but they smartly recognize that we all have the same goals and need to engage not enrage.The movie is intelligent, nuanced, and on the right side of history. We need this information now more than ever. Solutions are hard to come by these days but that's exactly what the approach is here. Please watch it and decide for yourselves."}, {"id": 504, "text": "This wonderful film is a much needed weight to counter the media-heavy narrative carried by plant-based and heavily processed foods.It leaves one with bigger questions. How do we use policy to enlarge grazing tracts so that they become viable for managed ruminant movement on scale?How do we re-integrate wilderness into these spaces?And how do we begin to prioritise the supply of nutritional foods to those who need it? We can no longer be satisfied with the poorest eating a bowl of rice or pap.And how do we ensure the quality of life and quality of death of each animal?We need to manage our land better. We need to manage our population better."}, {"id": 505, "text": "Nice cinematography. And now the issues with this film. A lack of interviews with experts and scientists. A lot of farmers and and the token ex-vegan who never really was. The film provided good coverage of a limited scope of arguments/topics, conveniently ommitting to include those that don't agree with the message of the film, to the point where this should be considered propaganda. The spin applied to chosen topics was at times humerous. The film didn't deal with scalability of high welfare animal farming, or talk quantatively about the output of it's proposed solutions, or the economic consequences of abandoning the high efficiency of intensive animal farming. Nor did the film talk about the general ethics of animal husbandry, in any form. Nor were any scientific studies mentioned in rebuttal to the new wave of pro-plant based studies the film talks about, neither were the accusations of disease risk in meat properly addressed. My only conclusion is that this film seeks to validate the middle class hypocrisy of paying more for better meat, while leaving the global equitable food system problem to anyone not trying to boost falling meat sales. Don't take my word for it, this'll surely be debunked elsewhere."}, {"id": 506, "text": "There were some good bits in this film, and useful contributions from farmers and food producers who are doing their best to do right by animals, their communities and their environment. It was only a handful of contributors that let the film down, but they are the ones that revealed the true motivations and left the less informed viewer with a false impression.Full disclosure, I eat some meat, and consider it a valuable contribution to my diet, but as an environmental and health scientist - some of the claims of this film are tenuous - at best.Granted, many claims by vegan societies are misleading, especially if you are based in the UK like me where our animal health and welfare standards are higher than in the US. And it's also fair to say that some parts of the media like to sensationalise findings about the health impacts of certain things in our diet, including meat. However, that's no excuse to dismiss it. There's no doubt that most of us in the West would benefit from more vegetables (as said in the film), but it's also true that many of us would be healthier if we reduced our meat consumption. This film skirts around that - giving the impression that health problems associated with excess meat consumption can be pinned on processed foods and sugars. And while I accept that not everyone suits a vegan diet, and that a healthy vegan diet can be very hard work, the impression that it's automatically very bad for everyone is false.The presentation of the fast vs slow carbon cycles was also misleading. Yes, some sustainable farming practices will lead to carbon sequestering, but mass meat production, including the production of feed stocks, contributes massively to climate change, and excess water use. Greenhouse emissions from most meat production vastly outweigh any drawdown. That the cows are younger than the plants that created the oil is irrelevant when there's more going into the air than coming out of it. Even when methane breaks down (half life is 9 years, so considerable) it breaks down into carbon dioxide and water, which are also greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide has a half life of 100 years in the atmosphere.The idea that it's dangerous for schools to adopt Meat Free Monday was the biggest red flag about the insincerity of the documentary. It may be fair to say that for the poorest people in developing countries the benefits of occasional meat, eggs and dairy are considerable, but to segue from that into saying it's essential for every school meal to contain meat is nonsense. If a person eating meat is malnourished, the problem isn't a shortage of meat.The truth is that if we want to follow a diet that's kinder to our own health, and the planet then as a population we should eat less meat and only meat which has been reared ethically, and in a way that supports, not degenerates the environment.This film would have been much better if it had been more honest and admitted we need to limit our meat consumption and encouraged viewers to ditch the mass produced stuff. It left me thinking that the film wasn't intended to promote ethical meat production, but was using ethical meat production to greenwash all meat production.I had high hopes for this film, and think it's a shame that an opportunity to present a positive message was wasted, except it's become obvious to me that the point of the film was to encourage meat consumption. No wonder people are so sceptical of the food industry!A better film for those with an interest in the environmental benefits of soil health and regenerative farming is Kiss the Ground."}, {"id": 507, "text": "While this documentary (and the accompanying book) does a good job of gathering and presenting information regarding an ideal (and globally unachievable) better meat model, be warned that the package it comes with is filled with convenient half truths and distortions of facts designed to fool less informed viewers.More than a few items jump to mind (as someone who has spent the better part of the last year informing myself on both sides of the meat debate): a) the meatless movement DOES NOT seek to disfranchise poorer nations and communities who depend on meat consumption for nutrition - quite the contrary, arguments are constantly made even by the most hardcore parts of the movement towards the importance of policy making aimed at empowering such communities before a full transition would take place. b) it is NOT true that meat agriculture relies on soil that would be useless anyways - I am certain that most people are aware of the current situation in the Amazon. c) when defending the death is natural argument, the documentary conveniently forgets to mention that all animals raised for their products (either meat or even milk) are slaughtered at a very early fraction of what would be their natural life spans.It is perfectly understandable that people who do not wish to give up meat but are uncomfortable by the implications of its consumption will flock to this documentary. After all, it would be lovely to have our burgers not ethically but also environmentally and scientifically justified.However, achieving comfort by accepting a distortion of reality does not bring us anywhere. Regardless of where you stand in the meat-eating debate - whether you are a hardcore vegan, a ride-or-die steak lover or simply someone who is trying to understand where your food comes from and its impact in our world, surely we all appreciate our documentaries to be objective and honest, otherwise one is just as well served by looking for information in fictionalized dramas."}], "reviews_amount": 508}
