Opportunities still came for a happier ending and escape, and one by one they screwed themselves over as was the general feel of the film.For all the owners effort, and the partners madness, i honestly was disappointed by both story and acting of the others.

The first half is heist+home invasion clich\u00e9s galore - a bunch of thugs looking to make some quick money by robbing a rich house fail to realize that the resident couple has some secrets of their own to hide. This plotline has now nearly run its course and needs truckloads of inventiveness to be taken seriously. While there have been a few surprises in this subgenre such as Don't Breathe and Villains, I don't think this film makes it to that list.The screenplay meanders, the characters are all unlikeable (the film uses the pregnancy ploy to make audiences care for Mary, the character played by Maisie Williams, but it doesn't work), and the overall slackening of pace do the film no favours. There are zero scares and it's some bloodshed alone that tags it under the horror category.

Bad casting (except Williams), superbad screenplay, especially the dialogues, soo shallow.

No not the IMDB ones from folks like me, but the professional reviews that said this was a worth while movie. The only bit of truth in any of them was that it was nothing new. Fine. But to praise anything else was deception.The idea that rich people keep lots of money in their house is pretty ridicules. But it has made many a film plot, notably Don't Breathe. Are there bozos out there who think Bill Gates has a safe full of millions in his house?? Maybe. But I bet he does not! Rich folks have investment portfolios where their money is making more for them and not sitting in safes gathering dust. Maybe they have a few hundred around just in case, but all else is platinum cards, etc.When the poop goes down, the film truly stops making sense. That the would be robbers would now trust the homeowner whom they just terrorized with helping them is absurd. Once things went sideways, the robbers would have knocked the old folks out (or killed them) and fled.That the owners knew two of the robbers makes me feel killing them would have been the option.But no. Other than one psycho, these are just desperate kids out for money to improve their dreadful lives.

Maisie Williams (Mary) is the most famous actor in this confusing mess of a film. Whilst I watched this I could not help but think of it as the British version of Don't Breathe (which is superior in Every aspect of this genre of film) without the blind man. Instead you have 2 creepy older eccentric characters Richard Huggins (Sylvester McCoy) &amp; Ellen Huggins (Rita Tushingham).Gaz (Jane Curran) is the unhinged character within this group &amp; he does a convincing portrayal of this perhaps maybe a bit ott. Whereas Nathan (Ian Kenny) plays Mary's boyfriend &amp; Terry (Andrew Ellis) the tag-along of this dysfunctional social group.What annoyed me most is Terry whose decision process throughout this film beggars all belief/ beyond stupidity. Why would he choose and obey the 2 strangers that he met for the first time over his close friends of many years?! Maisie Williams is the only shining star of this film but even she cannot stop this Titanic of film from sinking beyond mediocrity. Maisie, you deserve to be in a much better film than this!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "A great little British film, with a few twists thrown though out it. Though Maisie Williams is billed as the star of the film, it should be Sylvester McCoy who stole the show as the doctor/owner of this big house (though I misread the opening titles as Sylvester Stallone (which would of been a whole other movie). Rita Tushingham also plays the doctors wife well here as well. I spent the film swapping sides with who I wanted to get revenge/win, although there were many times a character did something forehead slappingly stupid that annoys me like it does in many a film. Gaz is also played particularly well also for his over-nastiness from his violence to the disregard he has to property, Mary was okay in it, and the other 2 guys were just sort of there to annoy me. Give the film a try, it's not the best film out there, but it's certainly not the worst either.

This is a film that has been made albeit with minor details changed slot in the last few years. This one starts off with a bang with some good acting then proceeds to get sillier in the second part. It's not as bad as some are saying but there is better - The Visit for example."}, {"id": 33, "text": "As Halloween nears more scary films are being released with the intent of frightening film lovers. Some will be good, some will be bad and some will be in between. Consider the film THE OWNERS to fall into that last category.In England a group of 20 somethings decides to break in a house when the owners leave. The mother of Terry (Andrew Ellis), one of the group's members, is the house cleaner there and he knows from her that there is a large safe in the house. As they wait for the owners to leave the girlfriend of one, Mary (Maisie Williams) shows up telling her boyfriend Nathan (Ian Kenny) to come away and take her to work. He leaves her to enter the house as the couple who own the house leave.Led by Gaz (Jake Curran) the group breaks into the house and goes on a destructive bent. Smashing things, knocking things off of shelves and more they search for this safe when it becomes apparent Terry has no clue where it is. Throughout this rampage Mary tries to convince them to leave to no avail. Eventually they find the safe in the basement but before they can break into it the owners of the house return.Taking them captive we learn that the aging couple are Dr. Huggins (Sylvester McCoy) and his wife Ellen (Rita Tushingham). Tying them up they attempt to force the doctor to give them the combination to the safe. Refusing to do so the Gaz threatens them, urging Nathan to cut off one of Ellen's fingers. As the tension rises between the members of the group a fight follows with Gaz stabbing Nathan. Without revealing what takes place next suffice to say Mary comes to the rescue and releases the hostages.But this is one of those films where everything is not what it appears to be. Once released the tables slowly turn and the hunters become prey to this elderly couple. Not in an action packed way but slowly, methodically. It seems they have a secret that they've kept hidden. Now the gang has to worry not about just surviving but escaping as well. And the odds are stacked against them.The move is well crafted and looks great with some nice cinematography going on. But a great movie needs more than just that. Plot wise we have a theme that's been used in the past in other films with a few slight tweaks to change things up a bit. It still makes for an interesting story though.I found that the weakest point of the film was the dialogue. For me the overuse of bad language, in particular the F bomb, is a sign of lazy writing. Yes, people do talk like this. No they don't use it every third word. If that's what is used to convey that these are lower working class characters there are better ways of doing so. Instead the use here becomes repetitive and useless.With the exception of the two actors playing the elderly couple (Sylvester was once a Dr. Who and Tushingham was well known in the 60s for films like A TASTE OF HONEY and DOCTOR ZHIVAGO) the main selling point here is Williams coming fresh off the success in the HBO series GAME OF THRONES. There she starred as Arya Stark and made a name for herself. This film feels a bit below her status if she hopes to move on to cashing in on her fame from that series.In the end the movie does provide a few scares and a decent story even if a familiar one. If you're looking for something to watch and noticing that the titles available these days are limited you might want to give this one a try. Just don't set your expectations high and you'll find it worth watching."}, {"id": 34, "text": "There are scary, creepy, thrilling, funny, and unpredictable parts.

Trainspotting and Snatch are two that come to mind. If you are in the right frame of mind they can be very entertaining.This one, The Owners, does not come very high up to the standard but is fun because (1) you can see quickly how amateurish and sloppy the would-be thieves are and (2) you just know the owners, the old short meek doctor and his half-crazy wife, will somehow get the best of the intruders.Much of it is funny but in total it is a very dark story, as the movie ends the doctor and his wife are found needing to plant three new bushes in their backyard garden.I watched it at home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped.

I'll just say that I enjoyed. It was a little predictable, as others here have said. And, I like that in my 'B' horror movies. I would recommend it."}, {"id": 41, "text": "First up the performances are excellent in this not very horrific horror. It starts strongly but then seems to meander into nothing much. Great to see Rita Tushingham in anything to be honest but she's not really given much to do here."}, {"id": 42, "text": "Very well, if that's what you want. What I wanted was to see 2020's unforeseen The Owners. What can I say, it really got me enthused. Then it got me thinking it was a little contrived.Anywho, Owners is something else (I'm not sure if that's always a good thing). It starts out as a despairing home invasion thriller only to become a psychological horror flick and a damaging one at that. Sans any civil characters, its diegesis involves four desperate thieves who decide to break into an old English abode. They get more than they bargain for when the keepers of said abode are even more messed up than the four offenders robbing them.The Owners is well cast with equally young and elderly actors. They effectively blur the lines between restraint, sheer madness, and sheer lack of self-control. The real star however, is probably the London Victorian mansion where Owners was filmed. It comes off as drab, cold, and dusty, a sort of never-ending labyrinth where cockroaches and silverfish love to hang out at.So yeah, The Owners is directed by Frenchman Julius Berg. A veteran of TV, this is his first feature film and it's a fervent, mixed mess. Using one location (when one location was probably all that was needed), Berg pushes the twisty envelope by giving us something adjacent to a Twilight Zone episode that might have been helmed by Eli Roth. Heck, you could even compare Owners to stuff like Don't Breathe, Straw Dogs, Saw, or The Shining.Bottom line: Owners is violent, blood-soaked, frustrating, and belligerently creepy (look for the closing credits which are done in reverse). As an ode to all things horror mumbo jumbo, it leaves you scratching your head as to how much more nastily polished it could've been.

If you have ever seen a horror film there is enough clues for us to know what id in the safe. As expected the group becomes divided over how much coercion is required. And in all home break-ins.

This is just as confusing as the writing, so maybe it was intended to be another indecipherable 'twist'.

Best avoided."}, {"id": 83, "text": "Believe it or not, home invasion movies are not a new phenomenon. In fact, one of the earliest examples of the genre was silent movie director D. W. Griffith's 8-minute length film The Lonely Villa (1909). Basically, location dictates whether a movie can qualify as a home invasion thriller. If the location is a home of some sort, the film meets the requirements as a home invasion epic. Movies about people stranded in public places, such as either tornado shelters or confined in public facilities aren't designated as home invasion films. Typically, since Hollywood holds little sacred, filmmakers have tweaked the formula so that shelters, hotels, and public facilities stand in as hybrid-home invasion thrillers. A legitimate home invasion thriller must transpire on property which a family either owns or rents. For example, Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) and its 2005 remake aren't home invasion thrillers since they take place in public facilities. As a movie genre, home invasion thrillers-particularly those made over the past twenty years-have waxed increasingly violent, and these life and death clashes tend to be more personal since the occupants are fighting for their lives in a last-ditch effort to survive. Movies like The Desperate Hours (1955), Straw Dogs (1971) and its 2011 remake, Funny Games (2007), The Strangers (2008), The Collector (2009), Don't Breathe (2016), and The Purge (2013) exemplify these violent, personal thrillers with life and death stakes. Mind you, filmmakers complicate the home invasion formula when they divide our sympathies between the occupants and the trespassers. French director Julius Berg's home invasion thriller The Owners plays out at an isolated country estate in England, and daredevil teenagers craving excitement and cash are the perpetrators. Meanwhile, Berg inverts the standard-issue home invasion formula and springs one surprise after another at audiences.The Owners opens with a scenic long shot of the English countryside. Mary Shelley lenser David Ungaro pans his camera 180 degrees away from a mansion nestled in a cluster of trees to a compact, four-door, red car parked on a hillside. Seated behind the wheel is wannabe rapper Nathan (Ian Kenny of Solo: A Star Wars Story), while Terry (Andrew Ellis of Demons Never Die) sits alongside him, and tall, gawky Gaz (Jake Curran of Stardust) babbles on in the backseat. The guys have been getting high while they watch the residence of Dr. Richard Huggins (Sylvester McCoy of The Hobbit trilogy) and his wife, Ellen (Rita Tushingham of Dr. Zhivago) with binoculars. The Huggins are about to depart the premises to dine out. Nathan has borrowed Mary's car, and she insists he return it because she is already late to her job. Mary (Maisie Williams of The New Mutants) knows they are up to no good, but Nathan convinces her to let him hang onto her wheels for another hour. Grudgingly, Mary relents, and the guys cruise off over the hill and break into the Huggins' residence. Gaz is a one-man wrecking crew as he enters the sprawling house and smashes objects, overturns furniture, and basically trashes every room in his search for the fabled wall safe. Terry's mom, Jean (Stacha Hicks of Captain Phillips), is the Huggins' housekeeper, and she mentioned the wall safe to her son. When Terry stumbles upon it, Gaz is frustrated because his safecracking equipment was designed to open vaults with electronic codes rather than a combination dial. This is the first of many obstacles with which these ill-fated burglars must contend. Since he took the car keys, Mary bursts into the house and rebukes Nathan about vandalizing the Huggins' home.The Huggins return home sooner than Nathan expected, and he and his thugs take them hostage and grille the doctor about the safe. At one point, Gaz assumes command of the operation, browbeating Nathan because he lets Mary interfere with their efforts, and then chiding him for his reluctance to sever Ellen's ring finger with a box cutter. Suddenly, Gaz and Nathan tangle in a knockdown drag out fight that leaves Nathan with the box cutter jammed in his stomach. Mary lashes out at Gaz with a sledgehammer, and he poses no more problems for anybody. During this fracas, Dr. Huggins manages to free himself and attend to Nathan. Initially, it looked like these reckless hellions were going to rule the day, but Berg turns the tables.Dream Kids scenarist Mathieu Gompel, High Life scribe Geoff Cox, and Berg based The Owners on Belgian artist Hermann Huppen's 2011 comic book Une Nuit de Pleine lune Translated into English, the title means Night of the Full Moon. Berg never treats any of the revelations in this grim melodrama seriously, and he saves the best revelation for last. Were this movie a success, it would be stimulating to see how Berg could develop a sequel. The Owners constitutes a triumph of style over sadism. Rita Tushingham delivers a feisty performance as the unsavory teens threaten her with bodily harm, and Berg milks these scenes for all the suspense and hysteria he can conjure up. The macabre humor and the witty dialogue take some of the sting out of the sadism.Meantime, the two blood-splattered corpses which they have to step over constitutes most of the gore. Throughout The Owners, Sylvester McCoy disarms our fears as a garrulous old physician who struggles keep everybody calm about their predicament. You almost forget you're watching a vicious horror chiller without a rating as Dr. Huggins putters and prattles about the place. Huggins' rants about an infestation problem with all sorts of creepy crawlies is laden with irony. Without being specific, Dr. Huggins is alluding to the notorious trespassers. Ultimately, Berg and company subvert our expectations in what resembles the aforementioned film Don't Breathe, but from the perspective of the residents who ultimately wrestle the upper hand from their adversaries. Mind you, as obnoxious as these mean-spirited teens are, The Owners emerges as a palatable Twilight Zone take on the home invasion scenario."}, {"id": 84, "text": "This movie made no sense.

There are some fair performances, by the cast Maisie Williams doesn't really stand out here like she does in GOT and personally her career will flounder and fail unless she goes to America and forgets the British film industry, which she should have done after GOT. Richard McCoy who plays Dr Huggins is probably the worst of the cast followed by Andrew Ellis who plays Terry. None of them play believable or realistic representations performances of the characters and it gives the film a very amateur feel. I think poor direction and screen writing are also to blame here since from the outset all the cast feel like caricatures.The worst aspect of the film is the lack of suspense caused by screen-time padding where characters do unrealistic, stupid or clearly contrived things to advance the film because there isn't much of an underlying plot to work with.To say it's a total mess would be unfair, it isn't. it is good to a point but goes down hill pretty quickly forty minutes in after events take a significant turn.

However, I was intrigued by the movie's cover/poster, and it definitely had some appeal to me. And it looking like a horror movie, of course I was interested.So I sat down to watch The Owners, and yeah I was entertained by the movie. Writers Mathieu Gompel, Julius Berg and Geoff Cox definitely had managed to put together something that turned out to be interesting. Well, right up to a point, then the movie just started to lose momentum and settled into auto-pilot, then the movie just grew stale. That happened at the stage right after the big reveal of what was really going on.The storyline was entertaining, sure, but up to a certain point about halfway through the movie - as I mentioned earlier. It was a shame really, because director Julius Berg really was phenomenal at setting the stage and lining up the suspense by gradually adding to the story. But once the reveal of the events took place, the air just escaped from the balloon, and the storyline became flaccid and sort of monotonous.It should be said, though, that The Owners is a movie that is driven more by its strong and noteworthy acting performances than it was driven by the storyline. The movie had some very nice actors and actresses on the cast list, with the likes of Sylvester McCoy and Rita Tushingham. But most outstanding was Jake Curran, as he really stole the show with his performance.The movie is labeled as a horror/thriller. I would say it has more emphasis on the thriller aspect than it does the horror. If you expect a scary horror movie, then The Owners is not the right cup of tea. However, if you are looking for a suspenseful thriller that has some punch to it, then this is definitely a movie well-worth watching.I am rating The Owners a mediocre five out of ten stars. I would have given it six, but what happened after the great reveal midway through the movie, it just felt too monotonous and uneventful really. Mind you, this is not a boring movie. It does have some strong and good things to it, it was just a shame that director Julius Berg set the movie for auto-pilot halfway to the finish line."}, {"id": 93, "text": "4.6/10 (the current IMDb rating for this film) is criminally low. I strongly believe this is another case of people not liking character's decisions and blaming the movie for that. News flash: people don't always make the best decisions in real life either. Sure the movie wasn't perfect but for the most part I thought this was a ripping good time.Maisie Williams being in this was what attracted me to see it, but in reality the real stars of the show were Sylvester McCoy and Rita Tushingham. I love it when some older actors are given roles that they can actually do something with. Too often older actors are basically just playing the stereotypical older person, but that's certainly not the case here. They were given great amounts of freedom to work with and they nailed it.This movie was tense, found goods levels of violence without ever being gratuitous, had a feeling that anything could happen and that no character was safe, and had a nice little twist at the end for the cherry on top.

One of the biggest problems here is the unappealing group of main characters we're supposed to be following around and feel sympathy towards. Brash, arrogant and hot-headed to the point of being caricatures of British thugs rather than real people which makes for a complete disconnect with them the second they show up on-screen, there's never a sense of even caring about their plight with the exaggerated way they break into the house and start tearing things up or even cracking jokes on each other that are in no way funny. Since these are the people we're following for the majority of the film and are supposed to feel sympathy towards once it starts getting crazy, it's a tough sell to get to care about what's going on here. This turns into the other big problem here in the lack of anything original or creative in what's going on. This is entirely predictable and riddled with cliches, from the disarray between the group that puts the captives in charge of the captors, the secretive nature of the elderly couple who foreshadow what's to come, the psychological mind-games that bring the group down as they pit the kids against each other. It's incredibly easy to see where this one is about to go every chance it gets and doesn't do anything to change the script for what keeps happening as the storyline plays out exactly as you think, causing the film to feel incredibly dull and plodding as a result. These are the films' biggest drawbacks while it does manage a few noticeable positives. Among the biggest aspects found here is the fine use of mind-games that come into play which keeps an appropriate air of suspense about their true intentions. While being obvious the entire point is the series of mind-games based on their kindly demeanor hiding their true intentions, the change in tone and behavior becomes far more fun with the aggressive bent to their attitude once it shifts into their darker plans. Enhancing the action with some enjoyable confrontations that make for a fun time here with some extra bloodshed thrown in, although it's too little too late to save this one.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Language and Graphic Violence."}, {"id": 96, "text": "I don't know why they keep putting actors from GoT in these terrible movies. From the lousy X-Men sequels to Terminator 5 to countless low budget thrillers like this, I can't recall a single good film headlined by any of these actors, aside from Dredd, which also flopped. But I digress, let's review this film.The script is atrocious. There isn't one likeable character, which makes staying with these characters a chore. After the twist in the middle, the film meanders to the end without any kind of wit or surprise. It's an unoriginal take on an unoriginal scenario done countless times before. From Mike Mendez' Killers to Don't Breathe. The direction is barely serviceable. Not very atmospheric, you have the feeling you've seen it all before. The acting is bad.

The acting was very good, although I feel like these characters needed more space to shine - we only get glimpses of brilliance from each of them.There are some truly brilliant moments of direction and acting, and I really wish those were leaned into a bit more. The cinematography was lovely overall but could have used some more time in the editing room - especially the very ending, which felt abrupt and disjointed.It's an exciting film, but not wholly satisfying overall. I loved the portrayals of some of these characters, but they are not done justice in the end. Also, for taking place in an enormous mansion, it felt shockingly small and like the setting was not utilized as well as it could have been. We're stuck in the same few rooms for most of the film, which really brings it down some.I went into this knowing very little, and was somewhat pleasantly surprised, but feeling like it did not live up to its full potential.

The acting was top-notch, as well as was the production quality and the cinematography.The story is sampled from a basic evil owners concept that has been done a million times already. This time the film is mostly carried by the acting and additional subplots that tried to establish more character ties.The beginning of the film was quite engaging, I was interested in what they will try to do with the tired idea. But from the second act and on all the characters just make the stupidest possible decisions and act like children. Most of the things that happen make no sense, they are just there to push the story.In the third act, the film goes into a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is probably due to the fact that this film is based on a comic book or a graphic novel, but all it did was just literally reduce the field of view for me. If I wanted to read a comic I'd read a comic, when I'm watching a movie I'd like to see the whole screen. They were probably trying to merge printed elements with movie ones like in Creepshow (1982), but they failed to justify this artistic choice.The ending was very predictable, and although the filmmakers tried to convince me otherwise, I was just waiting for it to wrap up. Actually, I expected a much worse and more ridiculous ending, but they have decided not to assault my brain with stupidity even more.I can see why so many people hated this film, but I approached it open-minded so it didn't annoy me enough to hate it.5 stars for the acting and the looks of the film, and one star for writing the most annoying and hated characters in the history of cinema."}], "reviews_amount": 102}
