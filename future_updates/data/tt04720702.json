{"name": "Bushwick", "titleId": "tt04720702", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "If Bushwick had been shot in a traditional way, I would have given it 6 stars. The story - a survival tale - has been done many times before, and is nothing to write home about.The use of steady cam is, however. 'Bushwick' is one long continuous shot, where you don't notice the cuts (much like 'Birdman'). You are taken right into the action. There's no shakycam, no quick editing, just a camera constantly hovering beside, in front of and in the back of the action. How refreshing.I wish that more movies were shot like this."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Let's be honest here, this movie will never win an Oscar and neither will the two actors, the plot is ridiculous, the acting poor and you find it hard to make out what the lead male is saying half the time.All that said, it actually works like a video game with the viewer right there in the middle of the action and you actually start liking and wanting the two main players to succeed in their task - its pretty intense and the action never stops and surprisingly, I actually started to enjoy the movie - one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen recently. I would rate more of a 7.5/10 but will go for the higher 8 on the IMDb rating system because I did enjoy it, as stupid as it is!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "What a strange film!I actually really liked the start, where you don't really know what's going on apart from some military activity of unknown origin. You do have a feeling of being right there in the action, and that feeling is progressed through to the end. This is an idea with legs - and it looks like it will run and run but...There were a few things that ruined this movie:1) The characters seem to get quickly bogged down. Not only in terms of location but in terms of where their characters are going. There seems to be poor motivation for the characters.2) The acting from Brittany Snow was terrible. Is this the actresses fault or do we blame the director for this? Whatever - it just felt really off in places - for example when the Gran died and when the priest killed himself. The poor acting just jolted me out of the moment. Funnily enough I thought the acting from Bautista was very good and I found his character very believable!3) Very odd plot moments such as the church, the laundromat, and the gang house. Felt surreal in places.4) Terrible ending. This is just bad script-writing in my opinion. The ending had a very unfinished feel to it. Events must have some logical purpose to them and a story without a conclusive ending will always fall flat. At least, the ending fell flat for me. I was almost surprised when the end credits rolled. Sure, I understand they had a message to get across on the futility and waste of violence, but the laws of screen-writing still apply - you need a compelling ending with RESOLUTION!On the whole a good idea, with good action moments and well shot so you feel like you are in the action. Let down by some bad directing/acting and a poor ending."}, {"id": 3, "text": "While the effects were clearly low budget, this film did its best with what it had. While not on the level of Children of Men, it is still an entertaining run and gun (or more likely get gunned) movie that keeps the frantic pace until the end. This movie really gave me a DMZ comic feeling. Just like in the comic, the South states are attacking the North by invading Brooklyn. The people trapped between the warring sides try to survive by any means possible. My opinion is that you should give this movie a try, even though the effects and even the acting fall flat at times. The action more than makes up for it."}, {"id": 4, "text": "WOW, I was hooked up all the way through this movie. I watched it on Netflix, never heard of it before, watched the beginning of the trailer and I thought I'm gonna like it and I did.At the beginning, it's the total confusion with the shooting, questions left unanswered for some time. When you get the answers it's like what the heck!Honestly, it's a great movie. Near the end you kind of guess what was going to happen and it is sad in a way but it was logical and inevitable and it is a really good ending.I didn't get bored at all. Action packed. People running, defending themselves. Facing danger, no matter who you are or which religion you practise, you need to hurt others for self-preservation. Defend yourself or die. Well filmed also.That was brilliant!I recommend this movie, just try it!"}, {"id": 5, "text": "Clearly a B film not meant to be taken seriously but yet, still manages to be entertaining. The action sequences and battle effects are better than I would have expected for a film with limited funding. There are quite a few nonsensical plot sequences, but towards the last half the writers try to inject a little logic to make sense out of what is happening while the two main characters gradually travel through multiple life threatening moments in their effort to reach family and ultimately safety. If you're up for a different guilty pleasure watch, then I can recommend watching Bushwick."}, {"id": 6, "text": "So a large group of militants from Texas (or should I say, the South) want to secede from the United States--which is constitutionally illegal, by the way. The militants' think that invading and capturing a poor neighborhood in the largest and most economically viable city to the US (a city of 8 million inhabitants and over 1,200 miles away via air, mind you) is a better tactical strategy than using all those militia members to defend Texas instead? They somehow have been duped into believing they can conquer this neighborhood (Bushwick, of course) because the minorities won't fight back. Really? You guys need to spring for a better intelligence officer. Because, some of the folks in the inner city are better armed than police. Speaking of police, apparently New York's finest were on vacation this day, the US military too. I think it's safe to say the North would still win this civil war as the South's strategy was too ambitious, to say the least. By the way, no way there are any political undertones here. No Way!But don't worry about the highly improbable plot, because the unbelievably horrible acting is more of a distraction than the dreadful plot. I cannot express enough just how bad the acting is, especially with our main character, Lucy (Brittany Snow) and her drug addict sister, Belinda (Angelic Zambrana). Absolutely appalling. Where did they find these two? Brittany Snow's character is way too annoying, especially early on. Her delivery is often too rushed and she mostly displays zero emotion, even during times where being sad or scared is called for. I'm not sure if this is the fault of the writers, director, actress, or all three. But trust me, the screenplay and dialogue are really really bad on their on.Dave Bautista as Stupe, the neighborhood hero and ex-US military patriot, is about this film's only saving grace. That and a pretty satisfying, non-traditional ending. Together, they are worth a few extra stars"}, {"id": 7, "text": "I really wanted to like this movie. I watched it all the way through hoping it would get better. It didn't.It wasn't all bad. In fact there were even some brief flashes of brilliance. But not near enough to make this movie come together as a worthwhile story. In fact the story is what stands head and shoulders above the other problems as the real culprit of a failed effort. I kind of doubted that there was even a script at times.The whole idea is basically Texas wants to secede from the Union so they decide to hold New York hostage so that the US Congress will let them go. But here's the thing: It isn't exactly Texas. The soldier that gets interrogated to provide the info says he is from Kentucky. He also lists 6 or 7 states that are with us. Strangely none of the states he lists is Kentucky! And then he is supposed to be a mercenary. But claims he was just following orders. And the reason that these guys dressed like SWAT teams are shooting everyone on sight is because Bushwick has so many guns and people are fighting back. And well that just shouldn't have happened because guns are illegal here. So they got orders to shoot to kill. And apparently they are just invading this one neighbourhood in New York.That pile of crap is what you get from the one short scene that is supposed to explain what is happening. And of course it contradicts an earlier scene in the movie that says that they also invaded Washington, Chicago and a few other cities. Not to mention a scene of most of New York in flames. On the other hand the character that informed us of the invasion of those cities apparently forgot that as soon as he said it because he was the one that was interrogating the mercenary to find out what was going on. It's glaringly obvious that there were rewrites and changes with a complete lack of effort at continuity. I could go on and on about the gaping plot holes but it's basically all hole and no plot.The acting isn't the worst that I have seen. Nothing great but then the actor's didn't have anything to work with so it's not really fair to judge them too harshly.Special effects you ask? Well don't go expecting a bunch of impressive CGI effects because there aren't any. What there is, is mainly some plumes of smoke and some flames. Non-CGI effects included some quite decent pyrotechnics work that worked pretty well. Most of the explosions and such are actually off screen. Basically a loud boom, camera shake and maybe the lights flicker. And there were some helicopters.The camera work was decent. Quite competent and at times even impressive. There were a lot of scenes that went for quite a while without a cut and it seemed that most if not all of the movie was shot with one hand-held camera. With a better story to tell it could have been very effective.The sound was not great. Dialogue wasn't always clear. It was often hard to tell if the bangs were guns or explosions or what. In fact it seemed like they used the exact same explosion effect about 80% of the time. The music was pretty awful and in many cases just did not go with what was on screen.Direction? What direction? The movie basically looks like the directors gave some very basic instruction and then went and smoked weed in the corner. Many of the scenes end up being very flat and one- dimensional. Probably because the actors are putting most of their attention into where they are going physically in the extended and sometimes complex scenes.The concept I think was pretty good. If they had pulled it off it would have been a very realistic real-time thrill-ride. But they did NOT pull it off. It appears that they tried to fix things by shooting a new ending or something. The last 5 minutes are jarringly different in look from the rest of the movie and the ending fails on many levels. I won't get into that.So: Might be worth a look if you are bored and non-judgmental. If you are more of a stickler for a coherent and logical story you will hate it. A lot. My honest recommendation would be to watch the trailer and then NOT watch the movie. That way you might get a little enjoyment and you will miss the aggravation and disappointment."}, {"id": 8, "text": "If you like invasions and apocalypses -- whether zombies or Commies, aliens or earthquakes -- you'll enjoy this fun, low-budget thriller.

I will give the company credit for casting Dave Bautista. That was a perfect choice. Your female lead Brittany Snow was miscast.

Bad acting throughout... really bad acting. The whole setup is silly and, did I mention the bad acting, the unrealistic scenarios on top of the bad acting and the bad acting. What is more troubling, is the fact that they use Texas, a white militia, attacking Brooklyn because it is full of people of color and many nationalities, so in essence, the director is saying, people of Texas, White people and better yet the south as the actor describes the militia being comprised of the South only, are the ones behind the secessionist movement.

The camera work is great, as there are a lot of long continuous shots of fighting and escaping scenes which I am sure are challenging to stage.

For a start anyone invading Bushwick would simply starve them out, modern urban life is fragile, relying on just in time deliveries of resources, you would target the infrastructure, the distribution network, and the city would eat themselves, their only militia's being their street gangs as they've foolishly disarmed themselves, and have become atomized individuals.

Nope.Brittany can't stop talking. The annoying chatter only adds to her shallow, self-centered character. Thanks to inspired directing Dave is reduced to moping around, head down, mumbling. An hour and a half's worth of disjointed editing and we discover the big ruse... Texas gets the south to fight for independence by sending troops to New York, unaware that the locals might not be willing to roll over and play dead. And the only thing more grating than Brittany's dialogue is the morbidly looped video game wannabe soundtrack.I kept hoping for an ending of some kind, maybe worthy of the old disaster movies, where love is found, right prevails or at least Maureen McGovern sings about finding a morning after. Here Dave dies without a hero's farewell. In the final scene Brittany is shot. The camera does a closeup of her lifeless body, but her chest is still heaving. She's out of breath from doing the stunt. And we're cheated once again.

Are you freaking kidding me? They couldn't even come up with a remotely believable reason.I have to agree with another reviewer who said that this is Red Dawn for Leftists and SJW's - that pretty much sums it up.The only reason this gets one star instead of zero is because I think Dave Bautista did a pretty good job. It also gets a tiny nudge in the humor category because for some reason, Leftists love to use BB-guns in their movies ... and not even nice ones.

It was an extremely transparent effort to paint the right, southern states and, conservatives as evil entities wanting to invade certain parts of America(Bushwick!?) in an effort to secede from the Union and, start a new, civil war that makes utterly no sense and would accomplish absolutely nothing.I was initially intrigued in the beginning, wondering who was attacking and, why? The characters seemed genuinely perplexed and fearful. You wanted to see them escape and, find out what was happening. You wanted to root for them. The hesitant, ex-marine, medic not wanting to fight and, the 2nd year grad student knowing nothing about war or, the reality of violence. Suddenly thrown together, you want to see them escape and figure it all out.Then, about half way through the movie, they tell you the plot and, the movie takes a monumental dump. You see immediately the liberal plotting. Based on something that would NEVER happen in reality. Texas is all-white? And, racist? LMAO! Really? Apparently, the writer and producer have never BEEN to Texas. Secession? Why would you start attacking other states if you wanted to secede and be left ALONE? And, if you were from Texas and, believed in the 2nd amendment and, KNEW of the gun violence in NY, you'd know plenty of people had guns. STUPID PLOT.Bautista is likable in this movie. He only had so much to work with. He was portraying a guy who wanted nothing more to do with mindless violence whom, gets thrown back in the mix against his control and, tries to help others just as desperate out of a bad situation. In the end, they kill off his character needlessly in an effort to promote mindless gun violence. Both main characters die, in fact.

Much like the characters played by Bautista, and Jane Snow, it was chaotic, and frenetic. The camera shots was nauseating at times, but manages to convey the sense of chaos and helplessness. It also narrows the perspective to first person, making the audience as clueless as the characters of what happens. It is almost like a snapshot of a real battle in which you follow Bautista and Snow throughout the movie. Honestly, this movie may not be a success due to its camera work, and unconventional style. It has several what the F... moments, which I will not spoil. However, Bautista actually performs well in this movie and carries the weight of the movie on his broad shoulders. Unlike other movies where he is given a few one-liners, or is limited to the comic relief as in the Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Bautista is able to display his acting range here.

They were portrayed as great shots, with girls who never even touched a gun before not missing while under fire, while the militia couldnt hit the side of a barn.

When it was over we each said That was pretty bad.There is a short extra on the disc and the directors reveal they were inspired by former Texas governor Rick Perry saying a few years ago that Texas might want to secede from the USA. So they came up with the story in this movie, Texas, Louisiana, and a few other S.E. states decided to go to war with the rest of the USA and begin by attacking large cities. Here they are attacking New York City. We find this out about halfway into the movie.In the first half we just see explosions, gunfire, and people running for cover. The plot makes no sense at all, why would Texas and a few other states form militia that would go into large cities and just try to kill all citizens, including children? Be that as it may the whole movie has two main characters, Dave Bautista as Stupe and Brittany Snow as Lucy, they meet by accident when she takes refuge in his tiny apartment in Brooklyn. Add to all that the dialog is often cringeworthy, characters behave in terribly unbelievable ways during the mayhem, it has the look and feel of amateurish improvisation. I know some have said they like the movie because it has a look and feel of those video games where you hunt down and shoot people.

The acting was subpar, few actors were actually convincing and did the best with what they had, however those who weren't made the film less and less intriguing. Some scenes just made be cringe and want to walk out .  The gun flashes, ugh don't get me started they literally the most fake and pointless thing ever, they're unconvincing and unneeded half the time. Also the useless and eyesore of a scene, where the helicopter is viewing the city, and it looks like it was made with green screen and cardboard cutout in somebody's basement. I understand that low budget means compromise, but if it looks that bad and isn't even essential, cut it out.  The ending is ridiculous, the scene is painful, I honestly felt like I was viewing a paintball game, it's terribly unresolved and you're left angry at how you just spent the last hour or so of your life, watching a movie and it all turned out to be for nothing.

Bautista puts in a very strong performance so the two leads carry the film from start to finish quite competently. Especially as the film starts almost immediately and does not really let up til the end. That's a difficult thing to do and remain authentic so well done to the screenplay writer. The cinematography is excellent. Loads of flowing live shots which don't look cut, lots of real time viewpoint following and some really good action angles. Excellent job done there.

The scenes are long, continuous takes. It takes you to the action and the confusion and gives you bits of information to work with while you go on an adventure and things start to make sense. As a bit of a video game geek in my younger years, I thoroughly enjoyed this aspect.I went out and saw this movie mainly for Brittany Snow; I've been following her work since Pitch Perfect, and this one was completely different compared to her previous roles, so I just had to check it out. While she was a bit lacking on the acting department, she was convincing enough for me to care about her character, being a 20- something myself. She's got good comedic timing during downtime scenes in the movie and good chemistry with Dave Bautista. The movie uses Snow's character to introduce us to the confusion. She starts off as someone as clueless as the audience, with no experience firing a gun and no idea what the hell is going on. Her character toughens up later on. I hope Brittany Snow continues to do more movies like this.The concept is modern day civil war (even acknowledged by Angelic Zambrana's character), which is not impossible to happen, given the current political tension in the US. This movie will put you into the action and there's no oh here's the problem, this is how we eliminate it formula here. There's no big boss to defeat here. It's making do with what you have; you don't completely know what's happening or what will happen, all you're concerned about is staying alive, which is something Dave Bautista's character echoes in the movie. It's all about normal people, with no control about the situation, just trying to get by. It's about a tight-knit community made up of different minorities (we see some Amish) taking the time to stop by, help a neighbor, and put away some modern day Confederates. Ignore the low ratings and go see the movie with an open mind. It's all about normal, everyday people just trying to stay alive.

Wounds that go clear through the other side of a limb can be fixed with a hot knife and rubbing alcohol.The south has risen again, and they think Bushwick, New York is a soft spot.

Stay and kill when you are outnumbered.The shiny spot, in this tarnished work, is how two people are trying to survive that stupidity on both sides, and learning to work together. I also must give credit to the camera shots. They were excellent in capturing the feeling of chaos and did a good job in immersing the viewer into the film.The ending was predictable and annoying.

Bushwick is not perfect in many cinematic ways, but is a great story, with timely relevance that looks almost like a documentary.

To me that's the ratio I love...small budget/big entertainment. It was a 1 1/2 hour film , in that time couldn't tell the full story and develop it properly.

It took me six minutes to realise i was watching a one take shot, and it kept going. That is high praise indeed. Not only this is an incredibly difficult technique to execute, but to make it invisible like this film does is top tier filmmaking, and then, when about twenty minutes had passed, i realised, ah, this is what their doing. Of course, there are invisible match cuts here and there, i mean this ain't Russian Ark, but Bushwick takes a thrilling premise that was a hot take approach for 2017, and executes it quite well.Dave Bautista and Brittany Snow give good performances and they fit their parts. I wish they didn't reveal the major plot twist on the dvd's blurb. The reveal of this twist was a very fun slice of speculative fiction and would have been a lot more effective if i didn't know where it was going, even though it was foreshadowed to to all hell. It added a lot of now-ism to a film that already had a very now-ish style and even though some viewers might find this film's depiction of a second American civil war a little far fetched, it was more than realised enough for a ninety minute genre film i found.After the reveal, more of the film's message surfaced and just made the film more interesting, more New Yawk in flavour. New York of course is known, to any self-respecting cineaste, to have a truly rich history of regional filmmaking and Bushwick definitely follows that lineage. Talk of Bushwick being a latter day Escape From New York are not too far fetched with this being a film with good drama, good action, and a high concept executed competently."}, {"id": 81, "text": "So 1 single thing bothers me about this film.

Snow's character over a couple of hours develops from not knowing how to fire a gun to being able to double tab one handed and wounded and hit moving targets. The paramilitary force seem to have total air superiority over New York even though the US army hold areas within a few blocks.

However, this was so overly done, there were so many times where you see the splice! Not so flawless. One scene where Dave and Brit are on the roof, and the climb into a tower section to get the glass out of Dave's characters leg, you clearly see Brittany head in first head to the right of the screen, milliseconds later, she appears on the left side of the screen. So many mistakes like that could have been easily avoided had they not to soooooo many cuts, and faked the single shot filming that much."}, {"id": 106, "text": "Well, this movie could have been good.There were some good things about it, for example, the opening scene is pretty freaky when a guy engulfed in flames runs by in the subway -- jarring and disturbing and really draws you in. Also, it was great that the death of the lead female's deeply annoying soy-boy bf dies horribly early on. David Bautista was good. And the single-camera method was effective in giving a sense of video-game immediacy.But there were other things that just didn't work so well. The plot premise was kind of loopy and the exposition of it seemed just stuck in at random. The military tactics had no rhyme or reason to them. The cool black granny seemed kind of contrived and likewise Bautista's moment of emotions in the laundromat. The priest killing himself was totally pointless. The biggest disappointment is the final scene -- it's like the director couldn't fiture out how to render it covers it up with chaos and darkness. Supposedly they are escaping to an army safe-zone, but there is no sign ot the army anywhere. And then having both the main characters die, rather than being artistic or philosophical, just tore out any sense of a point for the whole film."}, {"id": 107, "text": "An American action thriller. This dystopian story has an interesting premise: what might a second American Civil War look like on the streets of suburbia? Annoyingly, it winds up a weak attempt at political satire.

The movie  stars Dave Bautista and Brittany Snow. It was directed by Jonathan  Milott and Cary Murnion (the duo also co- directed the 2014 indie  horror-comedy 'COOTIES'), and it was written by Nick Damici and Graham  Reznick. The film has received mixed to negative reviews from critics,  and it's also only received a VOD and limited indie theatrical release  at the Box Office. I thought it was OK.  Lucy (Snow) is exiting a subway in Bushwick, with her boyfriend, when  they're attacked and her boyfriend is killed. Lucy tries to run to get  help, when she realizes all of Bushwick is under a military invasion.  She manages to avoid being killed, with the help of a war veteran named  Stupe (Bautista). Stupe then reluctantly helps Lucy make it to her  grandmother's, and the two try desperately to survive the brutal  invasion together.   The movie has a very strong Walter Hill '70s/80s' B action movie feel  to it. That's what I like most about it. I also like seeing Bautista in  the lead, and the motive for the military invasion is pretty  interesting. The film is also kind of pointless other than that though,  and in the end it's not really that entertaining. It did hold my  interest (at least) throughout it though. So I think it deserves a  slightly above average rating (at least) for that."}, {"id": 113, "text": "One of those movies, with improbable and simple idea behind, that make me wonder about affluence of my spare time and states of mind in which to watch them. In the beginning there are many not logical and unanswered questions (e.g. at start how that large scale attack happened during a single train ride incl. changing lines? Or, why everybody's shooting everybody?) Sirenes, choppers, smoke, blood, fire, bang-bangs, so on... Not a clue to make just enough of introductory sense for the first third of the movie, along just mentioned street fighting and running (generally: black uniformed guys shooting everybody incl. civilians). Put it short: hellish urban warfare. Then, after half an hour, the script is getting somewhere where I also got this strange feeling of black humor, esp. when hood-gangs and high sis appear. As for the acting, it's not that bad as one would expect, though at first half there was not much to act about. Quite fast action not lacking violence, all the time. The movie budget is showing, not in cast as much as in effects, stunts, camera and stuff being destroyed. Note the decent directing. Finally, after that hour of 'cracky' urban street/basement/roof pandemonium, there's a sort of tightening of the story-line. I somewhat enjoyed the movie, together with number of wicked moments (e.g. protagonist duo is getting actually acquainted with each other on the very end). I always liked the urban NY all together feeling, so: fire up, switch-on to get simple fast tempo far-out! You'll be pleasantly surprised few times; that is if you don't expect serious and deep stuff."}, {"id": 114, "text": "I generally do not write reviews but was spurred on by reading the other reviews here. Many of them make two presumptions: one, that this is not an entertainment website but a political debate forum, and two, that when you post a public review, your personal point of view matters the most.Carefully avoiding those two, I would review this movie in the following manner, as neutrally as possible.1) Story: 6/10. A hybrid of alternative history and probably a doomsday-start idea, is not bad except a few plot holes that cannot be covered in so little time or budget. But not the particular error that everybody seems to think impossible. For these proud 'mericans, I as an outsider can say that many nations have broken up from inside before, and they were just as human as Americans. Once you step around the blind patriotism, you can see where the actual errors in plot lie. [*** SPOILER*** For example, the absence of the home team in the field -- I don't know if the budget prohibited this, but when the motherland is under attack you expect to see at least a few APC's crawling around, and the other dudes cannot afford to leisurely cruise about in copters unless they have total air superiority, ja?]2) Screenplay: 8/10. At many points during this movie I mentally prepared myself to digest a while of meaningless drama - and was pleasantly surprised. Later I tried to imagine what would a big-budget studio with an insufferably famous actor in that role would have done; and found myself answering, same old s**t forced down my throat, which will have little if any continuity later on anyway. The writers here were wise to think of common sense: when bullets are whizzing by, only superman can afford to be melodramatic. And the people depicted here are very much non-super.3) Camera and editing: 5/10. I am giving it the middle rating under the force of impartiality only; otherwise I would have given it a 9/10. The end-product that was in vision here was a sort of hybrid between a streaming game and a standard thriller movie, and I'd say they did achieve such. But the problem with such a view is that either you like the handycam or you just don't -- there's no real middle ground here. So, it will give headaches to those who can't digest live-action first-person footage. Others will feast on the no-cuts game-footage-like immersion.4) Acting: 5/10. Miss Snow was great when action is required, but needs to inject life into spoken words. Bautista was impressive in displaying a nice balance of self-control and only-human, otherwise, not much to speak of. Supporting cast did their best, I guess, according to the low budget.5) Music: 5/10. Another forced-by-partiality rating that is personally a lie; I like very little background music and this being a realisticmovie they did the right thing to use such very little indeed. Though the parts of respite may have needed some ornamentation, imo. However, this is another hit-an-miss thing; either you like loud bg-score or you like them muted or none whatsoever. Thus the median rating. Anyway, what little is there is not bad. Btw the surround sound effects are quite well done, in the job of bringing out a conflict-zone atmosphere into your living room.In conclusion: a gust of fresh air for most of the young-adults out there, a headache for the older and serious customers. The political reek, intentional or not, should be utterly ignored in order to enjoy this movie properly (in its place as it is) - otherwise, to both teams, this will feel no more than propaganda.Perhaps a sequel will come out to fill in the gaps, or better, to continue the alternate history."}, {"id": 115, "text": "Please save yourself almost 2 hours of your life.

It does try to explain the men in black but again, it's a lot of nonsense. There is a way to make it make more sense but there is an almost desperate need to keep the overall world structure simple. That also goes for other issues. They almost never just kill a man in black who is down and out. It's annoying to see people knock out a man in black in hand to hand combat and not double tap him in the face. They also rarely strip the men in black of their weapons except for a few handguns. Apparently, people are willing to march into gunfire with nothing more than sports equipment. I call it comic book simplification.

I often do that, sometimes being pleasantly surprised by what I get to see, and that's how I felt about this particular movie. It is definitely not a perfect movie, and you'll see some big flaws right in the middle of watching it. For starters, it's a little odd that the loyal U.S. military forces would not arrive and start fighting back a lot sooner than they do. (You would think that they would at least send some air support fairly quickly.) Also, the protagonists have ample opportunity to take the weapons and gear of the fallen enemy combatants, but they only do this ONCE in the entire running time. And the very ending of the movie (which I won't reveal) is for the most part very disappointing, leaving many viewers to think they are being cheated in some way.But fortunately, the movie does work for the most part. It's a very skillfully directed exercise, being that it's directed in a real time fashion, with seemingly very few clear edits. Instead, the movie plays out almost like one uninterrupted shot (though if you look real carefully, you will see where there are edits from one shot to another.) The movie also has a feel of authenticity, coming across as a more realistic treatment of the premise than you might think. The action and suspense scenes are also well done, containing a lot of excitement. If you are prepared to overlook those aforementioned (and other) flaws, the movie does manage to be effective enough to make it worth a look during a slow day."}, {"id": 125, "text": "The worst movie I've seen in my entire life, without beginning or end, the productors should be clarify that it's just a test of actors (very bad), and director.

You have to be willing to simply accept that this army actually thinks it's worth invading this neighborhood, which is fairly implausible.

It was almost a road warrior off shoot.This was a great film. I am from South Carolina. The premise was not thrilling to me. Then again, Pennyslvania seceded. I think one civil war was enough. The film captured what New York would look like if it was a war zone. At first the film was very cynical in it's view of people lacking law and order. By the end everyone was helping everyone escape. There were no racial lines or classes. Thr main character Gentiles helped a wounded Jew. It really showed the full spectrum of human decency / depravity. The film was not without flaws. Please bear in mind I am not trying to bash the film like a self-entitled Hipster Millenial who has YET to write a masterpiece screenplay. A lot of work went into making this and I acknowledge that. Good job, guys (zero sarcasm).Okay. The Marine guy Stupe said he was a medic in the Corps. Huh? The Navy supplies the Marines with medics (Corpsmen). The Marines are actually a part of the Navy. That's why Marine stands for (M)y (A)$$ (R)ides (I)n A (N)avy (E)scort. This is fantasy. Maybe in this universe the Marines train their own medics? Or maybe Marine Force Recon has their own medics? I accept that. But i suspect that the writers made a goof. It is forgivable. The one big plot hole that baffled me was when the crazy black woman held the girl's sister hostage. She forced Stupe and the blonde gal to go recruit people from the local church down the street. Her son would provide the guns while the white folks would provide the warm bodies. The sister would be returned after the two parties met up at the laundromat. The mom said that a black person wouldn't make it to the church without being shot. Okay. It may be true that people of differing ethnic groups are afraid to go into certain parts of New York City. That's why you move AWAY as soon as possible (and unwittingly avoid the doctrinal speaking, selflessly motivated zealots who invade your neighborhood). Racial paranoia is definitely real. While watching this scene unfold i asked myself this: Are black people really afraid of being shot by white people?. Isn't it the other way around? I think white people are better known for being / causing serial killers, genocides, mass bombings and shootings. Unless we are talking about mountain folk in East Tennessee, white people generally only shoot people who break into their house. This whole scene would have made more sense if it was a crazy white lady doing it. I think I am missing a key geographical and cultural tidbit from New York culture that makes this scene work.The point here is that the lady had an irrational fear. The whole premise broke down when Stupe and the blonde gal were pushed back onto the street. There was a giant mob of neighbors walking through the street. Why go all the way to the church to get people? Use your neighbors, crazy lady. The whole plan fell apart and the sister ended up being okay. The story didn't have much plot. It was a decent idea, but it wasn't very realistic. The one theme throughout the entire film is the chaos of an urban environment. The director did an amazing job making the skirmishes believable. I did take issue with how inaccurate the bad guys were. The bad guys were in cover with weapons braced. They fired on a mob running down The street. I assume they were highly trained. They definitely were well armed. That mob would have been cut down. It could be that the BGs were not expecting resistance and left the heavy weapons at home. That makes little sense to me as an Army Veteran. To quote the Kentucky kid We were following orders. This may be why they left their heavy weapons at home. The BG's intelligence said they shouldn't have much resistance (I wonder if that has to do with New York almost seceding during the civil war).Since most of a platoon's firepower and killing ability come from their squad support weapons that may be why the mob was able to run a-muck. In real life, dumb a$$es that run through established fields of fire IN THE OPEN get killed. The movie was very lethal. It should have been more lethal in the giant mob scenes. My take away is the militia were highly motivated with high morale but inadequately trained.The few talking scenes do a great job showing the character's humanity. You get it all from the slutty sister, the Hasidic Jews battling the militia, the market owner, the sleazy gangster types, the overwhelmed priest &amp;c. Stupe's story is particularly hard on the feelings. This is a great film to watch. It's flaws are minor. Bushwick is one of the top 5 films i have seen in 2017.

However, this shoot 'em up survivalist movie was watchable...and pretty fun to watch as well. Like many other viewers, I didn't have any good expectations when I first started watching, but as the movie progressed, I was happily surprised that I was getting more and more hooked.My favorite part of the movie is that the main protagonists don't form a romantic, sexual, or even overly-emotional bond...and best yet, there is no happily ever after where everyone is reunited &amp; walks off into the sunset.

The film follows a couple of characters, the great Dave Bautista and an annoying sweary blonde girl, as they navigate streets and buildings and attempt to survive. It's supposed to be shot in a single take and the roving camerawork is a real asset, although there are many cuts hidden by sweeps and CGI. The characterisation isn't very good and the bits where the leads settle down to chat inside buildings are quite dull; the worst character is the druggie who is a real irritant.

Maybe you feel more at home with your particular hand gun, but there is no doubt that an assault rifle has a lot more ammo and firepower.

He is on a strong way up to becoming the newest, BETTER, Rock, Arnold Schwartz-- and all the rest of the power lifters who've bravely made the switch to acting.  in my humble opinion, When you see a film and read a book, you have to bring something to the table. Hitchcock was a great believer in this as he left certain things to the imgination... YOUR imagination (the viewer).

In many ways, as others have said, it flows like a video game with admittedly immersive camera work and sound.One glaring plothole was the girl's complete disregard for the welfare/death of her boyfriend within the first moments of the film. Considering the way she loses herself over the other incidents through the movie, one would have thought his death would have left some sort of mark.Bautista's ex-vet role has some degree of authenticity, beyond the fact that he routinely disregards collecting any sort of firepower beyond a pistol. This definitely moves away from the shoot 'em up game for reasons that aren't really made apparent.Those especially negative reviews (I feel this is more a neutral one) routinely whine about the female lead as a SJW (an alt-right term for Social Justice Warrior). The word snowflake is bandied around too, presumably alluding to the lead's (Brittany Snow) dirty blonde hair and Caucasian complexion. I actually would have thought those reviewers would have found her one of the 'pure race' myself, but I digress. One reviewer also mentions how the characters unbelievably take down the 'spec ops troopers'. I'm not too sure what movie he was watching, but the inbred, illiterate bigot that they capture clad in his black 'spec ops' uniform is hardly a poster boy for any sort of Special Forces operator.Our heroine attempts amazing feats as the movie progresses, especially after Bautista's character is killed as a result of 'friendly fire' (ie: a scared black girl hiding from the invaders). This new found 'ooh rah' attitude rankles the alt-right reviewers somewhat apparently, so they no doubt cheer when one of their brethren are responsible for putting a bullet through her head at the climax of the film.If the film does anything, it infuriates the Trump-voting, Bible-thumping bigots out there which isn't a bad thing.

The main actors in Batista and Brittany Snow do their best work and convey the right emotions during the events of the movie. What really makes the movie special though is the camera work. It's basically a tracking shot for 95% of the movie!

This is the first time in my over 250 reviews I'm saying the opposite.Going into this, I had very low expectations, and from the very start, those expectations were met with the very poor acting and dialog, followed by the start of an outrageous story-line.As the story continued, I began to notice that the camera angles (poorly aimed in some scenes) were similar to video games like Call of Duty. Then I noticed the background music was similar as well. For a few minutes I thought to myself oh boy, this movie is gonna be a waste of time, but oddly enough, all those factors started to grow on me, including the bad acting/dialog.Then I started to notice the directing and cinematography were actually quite good - and those poorly aimed camera angles actually made the scene very realistic, especially for a B-type low budget film with two amateur directors, Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott.Oddly enough, I also started to look past the poor acting and dialog from Dave Bautista and Brittany Snow and instead, became fond of their characters, and able to relate to them as just 'average Joe's' trying to survive. As I grew up in Brooklyn, I realized it wasn't bad acting/dialog, but instead their characters were spot on Brooklynites! For that matter, Dave Bautista nailed his character as a passive war vet turned janitor who lost his family.All of a sudden, BOOM, I was engulfed in this film and was really enjoying it. You can't compare a low budget B-type film to the blockbusters, and as such, to review it on it's own merits, this film was outstanding! I really felt like I was right there where all the action and suspense were happening, and was rooting for the Brooklynites. Sure one could argue about plot holes and an un-realistic story, but this is pure fiction (although it does make you think), and the screenplay was written so well with the pacing spot on, I felt like I was watching a live newscast in a war zone. What I also really liked (and respected) was the fact that there were zero clich\u00e9s in this film, and it was pretty much unpredictable. Even the ending (not going to give it away) was a shocker and certainly not expected.It's sad to see such a low IMDb score from people comparing this to blockbuster films, or inserting their political opinions and agendas into the story. This for me was simply a fun ride, a great suspenseful adventure thriller, executed very well from every perspective. It left an impact on me, wanting more, and I do hope a part 2 is considered.I will watch this again, and it's a well deserved and much respected 9/10 from me... great job to all those involved in the production of this sweet little gem."}, {"id": 177, "text": "Like others, I heard about the film because Aesop Rock posted on Facebook saying he was doing the score. So I wasn't expecting much beyond a cool soundtrack...From the first scene, it's apparent that winning an Oscar isn't the top priority. The dialogue isn't fluent and the acting is stunted, and we're thrown in with the action almost right away: streets are burning, we don't know why, let's get the hell out of here. The top priority, it seems, is creating a video game-like war-torn corner of NYC through which the protagonists must try and survive. And it does this well.It only took a few minutes for me to start honestly enjoying it. The main driving force is the perspective: a single hand-held camera doing long continuous takes, so the whole movie, having been edited to cut different takes seamlessly together, runs like an entire 90 minute one-shot. It makes you feel as if you're there with them, experiencing the action unfold, no tea break, and the ridiculous plot and forced acting combine to make it feel like you've stepped directly into a '90s B-movie or a shoot'em up arcade game set in Brooklyn. It's really pretty cool, and almost makes me think that the silly plot and acting were intentional. Maybe, maybe not.If you're looking for a political thriller, a thinking man's action movie, cool martial arts/fight scenes, or any amount of emotional realism, look elsewhere.

It has a gritty feel to it and there is no big Hollywood star waiting to rip his shirt off and everything has a degree of realism about it.But some of the action scenes do suffer from a lack of funds. Soldiers wait patently for stuntmen to do their thing before spurring into action, or beat at invisible flames that the CGI team didn't get time to add.This feels very much like a computer game. There is not a whole lot for the characters to do except run and dodge and shoot, but the film is kept under the magic 90 minute mark so that was ok.They try to add some meat to the characters in a couple of quite dull dialogue scenes that didn't really work. I only know the characters from their backsides so I only need to know them about as intimately as I know third storm trooper from the right.The final sequence falls apart a bit as the sets are just too small for the extras to comfortably fight over.This is a great, cheap little run-and-gun action movie.

The sfx are oddly weak and the camera work is some of the shoddiest I've ever seen considering the films budget. Seriously, at one point I think the camera goes up Daves ass while following him.Though the concept is a bit far fetched I think considering the current state of the US at time of writing this or something similar is more realistic than most want to admit.Sadly as mentioned the film falls apart early and it descended into yet another action flick with little going for it.Bautista has done nothing to silence his critics here as he puts in arguably his worst performance yet.This film is the very definition of potential squandered, it should have been SO much better.The Good: Fantastic opening sequence The Bad: Very poorly shot Shoddy sfx Soundtrack doesn't fit Things I Learnt From This Movie: Such a far fetched plot being believable at this time is genuinely scary I couldn't take the Jewish gang seriously"}, {"id": 180, "text": "Bushwick feels like a low-budget zombie apocalypse movie without the zombies.

Bautista is best known for his chiseled larger-than-life physique and his martial arts skills, but displays neither. As he has shown in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, he can handle comedic roles and does a reasonable job here with a role that calls for more emotion than action. While fans may appreciate his dramatic range and nobody would want him to be limited in his career, they may be disappointed that he doesn't do more fighting. The script is a mess. Nothing makes any sense, from the plot to the military tactics to the motivation of the characters. A hodgepodge of liberal and alt-right political ideologies are presented and seemingly given equal time.

This mentality is like a brick wall cloaking a lot of anguish and pain which is only fair of course. 'Bushwick' eloquently puts the shoe on the other foot where your home has been invaded by the same 'just following orders' jarheadism as that of what we unleashed on Arab countries post 9/11 in which probably thousands of innocent 'collateral' occurred (without knowing the correct figures).. in pursuit of oil, cloaked as a conquest to rid the globe of weapons of mass destruction, to restore order and bring Osama to justice and believed by the greater majority of US.

It is really immersive, and the audience learns about the situation (quickly, I might add) right alongside the characters.The story hardly wastes any time throwing us into chaos and survival. The best part is that Brittany Snow is just a college girl, smart and capable, but not combat ready and not that great of a survivalist. We get Dave Batista playing the stereotypical Rock Role of being former military, but instead of being a witty, smoldering pretty boy, they layered on substance to his character, and let him be gun ready.There are good twists, not a lot of complex multi-threading (at least for a city at war), all good action, and a ton of immersive realism.The biggest problems with this movie are the most realistic ones: in the times of a domestic war, there are going to be 4 sides: invaders, defenders, abstainers, and criminals: people that are just going to take the opportunity to do whatever and hurt whomever they want before someone kills them.Honestly, the more I think about it, the better this movie seems. I'd probably expand the ending though, in the very least there should have been an epilogue. At it stands, the movie just sort of ends, but it is possibly by design."}, {"id": 191, "text": "So it's Red Dawn but from within. While this film-school quality movie has a gritty look and a nervous timelines to it, (given the BLM/antifa riots this year) ,it just has to fall back on the predictable:.... It's always the white guys fault, or the domestic terrorist is the white guy(s). There are so many factual and technical false presumptions as to make it mostly unwatchable toward the end. Bautista is also barely audible, as is the fashion these days. (Grunting and whispering is supposed to convey a deeper, more pensive thought process--yawn). The girl, whoever she is , is athoroughly cloying and method actress with zero presence. The movie is vaguely interesting visually because it's shot in the streets with minimal production interference. In other words, no budget and no effects necessary. But the greatest offense is the idea that people who are willing to fight for American values (you know the thing, man... are lunatic killers is offensive and frying-pan-over-the-head obvious. I was expecting the guys in black (of course stormtrooper black) to tell Wolverines!!!... But the millenials who wrote and directed this woeful trash probably never heard the term. Don't waste your time on Bushwick. Just watch Red Dawn... At least it's funny."}, {"id": 192, "text": "All in all, an interesting concept. It's the Civil War all over again with the states of the former confederacy leading the the attempted take over the U.S. to establish a right wing racist military state.What made it even more realistic for me is this: there are some political pundits who just today suggested that the alt-right might attempt an armed insurgency to overthrow our government. Many of them are are heavily armed. I grew up in Brooklyn, NY. At the beginning of the movie, the subway station is Church and McDonald avenues. It's a few blocks from where lived.It is nowhere near Bushwick. This area is border of the Kensington and Boro Park sections of Brooklyn, about ten miles from Bushwick. I guess the writers/producers have no idea about the geography of Brooklyn."}, {"id": 193, "text": "I mean it's more tactical. This isn't an attack. This is an invasion.There's one thing this film surprised me with. And that's the speed at which the violence begins. One moment Lucy (Brittany Snow) walks with her boyfriend through a subway station. The next moment, he's lying dead next to her and in the background you can hear the sound of automatic guns and screaming people in panic. Turns out a war started in this part of New York. A kind of American Civil War in guerrilla style. The sound effects and the way in which the camera follows fleeing Lucy looks a lot like a third person shooter. Even Lucy's sister Belinda (Angelic Zambrana) thought the neighbors were playing Call of Duty all the time.It's only when Lucy is rescued by Stupe (Dave Bautista), a concierge with a military background, this realistic looking film turns into a survival journey through a suburban district of New York. Immediately I had to think of movies like No Escape. But also of older hit-movies such as Escape from New York and the magnificent film Warriors. A turbulent flight through neighborhoods where street gangs suddenly take up arms against the forces who try to take over Bushwick and punks who take advantage of the lawlessness to rob neighborhood stores. And all this looks as if it's filmed in one take.The reason why those troops are penetrating this neighborhood and total anarchy breaks out, sounds quite ridiculous and unlikely the first instance. But thinking further about it afterwards, you could say it isn't. Such a situation could occur somewhere in the world, given the interracial and domestic conflicts that arise everywhere. But apart from this original approach, this film has little to offer. The rest of it is just about the two main characters trying to escape the violence in a city that looks like a battlefield. Even the noisy and rebellious looking local residents who are waving with their illegal weapons excitedly, don't make it more interesting. Although some of them were in a high stage of enthusiasm.In addition to the fact that it's all simplistic and there aren't really surprising developments, there were also some things that were quite annoying. For example, the continuous mumbling of Dave Bautista almost the entire movie. Besides the emotional closing argument, his oral contribution was limited. He resembled Rambo who also mumbled the whole movie in those days. And although he seems to have a lot of military experience, he continuously refused to use more sophisticated firearms. I've lost count of the number of times I got p*ssed because they ignored modern automatic guns, which were lying around for the taking. They stubbornly held on to their small handguns. I would have known better.I'm not sure if it was the intention to make a political statement. If so, they didn't quite succeed in doing that. Before you know it they shifted back to making a superficial action film with Jews jumping around with Uzi's. In general, the acting isn't so bad. Brittany Snow is doing her best as an emerging survival expert. Dave Bautista's posture is very suitable for playing the character Stupe. His physique and rough-hewn behavior makes an extremely dangerous neanderthal of him (mumbling included). And if you're looking for a movie with a denouement so non-compliant compared to the rest, don't look any further. Believe me. So, Bushwick isn't special, but you don't need survival skills to watch it entirely.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"}, {"id": 194, "text": "Come on people, this isn't that bad. I thought it was pretty entertaining, and it held my attention.It seems Netflix is the new direct-to-video, which is fair, though Netflix has actually put out some good movies. I think this movie is one of those.Dave Bautista is awesome ok. He's a good actor and he does have charisma, even when he's lumbering along and shooting a gun and not talking at all. He's like a much less confident version of The Rock. He carries this movie, and was the best thing about it for me, and the only reason I watched it. His monologue towards the end of the movie is worth the build to that point.Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milly are obviously amateur directors, and they were definitely trying to ape some other movies with the style. Even if it is a less atmospheric and well-acted Escape From New York, it's still watchable.The action scenes were enjoyable enough. There were lots of long and well-stages battle scenes, and I thought the apartment fight scene with Bautista was pretty cool. Nothing amazing, but alright.Don't listen to all the overly harsh reviews. This isn't the worst movie ever, and just because it's not Escape From New York or Children of Men, but that doesn't make it not worth your time. Netflix has made far worse movies than this."}, {"id": 195, "text": "I Am A Huge Fan of Dave Bautista Big Fan Since in my childhood i use to watch him in WWE i remember these times with him in it he is my role model like Dwayne Johnson, Steve Austin, Diamond Dallas Page, Kane, Triple H but then he got into MMA is great then he turned himself as series actor witch is great like Dwayne Johnson. People say to me really you say Dave Bautista is actor i say yeah ! he has talent like Dwayne Johnson but he hasn't got the really best opportunities in movies expect for Guardians of Galaxy for bigger screen for Marvel but he hasn't made many lead role movies witch someone should have but this movie eh it's shame for Dave. i understand it has a lot of action and it's really starlight forward pace i understand. but the movie is what i didn't like about movie is ending witch i am going to not spoil it yes i am going to hate movie because of ending of it because it killed it, it ruined it buy many seconds it's SO bad i am like screw this movie theirs no ending it's noting it needs more questions needs more telling did Brooklyn win ? because of ending wasted Dave Bautista for no reason witch i love to see him towards at end of movie i mean i loved seeing him as lead role actor in movies like this but there's another movie called House of Rising Sun (2011) he is lead role in that movie but it show's he can act he has strong performance in movie but this his acting his great but not in best movie has been made. i thought it wasted everything at end towards at start it turn out to be great and thrilling it keeps you watching until at the very end of movie but towards it, it kills it. i like the way story start's and everything it's like Purge but different style of movie with a lot of very bad CGI too many bad CGI. story follows Lucy (Brittany Snow) was in attack her boyfriend died from explosion in war as she runs tosomeone house one of bad guys try to kill her but you have Stupe (Dave Baustia) Who Is a War Veteran who helps Nicely To Lucy and they decide to cross five blocks of Bushwick to get Lucy Back Home i thought the action you have Baustia kicking ass in movie a lot i love it, it was a lot of fun in movie it was worth of fun to watch i like to see more of that in movies with him he needs more lead role movies to kick a lot of ass in films like this but better. the city turned into war zone is because Texas military force invades their Brooklyn. Soldiers Taken Orders to Invade Brooklyn for some reason and people from Brooklyn are defending there city. a single hand-held camera doing long continuous takes, so the whole movie, having been edited to cut different takes seamlessly together, runs like an entire 90 minute one-shot. i like that but movie didn't need to do that a lot because kinda annoyed me. the movie is full on it doesn't stop it's not movie goes for 3 hours long long time just to know something it's full on full on run they move, everywhere the movie moves to every different places. Bautista Performance is great he can be a great actor like Dwayne Johnson he has been hired in a lot of movies but as a cameo sadly but in this i know everyone would be exciting for this movie because of Bautista OK but its movie you will watch it for once that's it believe it's not worth of your time it's fun full on action mixed full on thriller but there's not much to say about this movie it's sadly ruined ending it's like me saying stop movie almost to end don't watch it but it totally sucks the film way ended JUST SUCKED. it's sadly made it's shame for Bautista to be in this movie role i mean there's many ways to change the ending of this movie change it to different direction believe me people when movie ends it's ugly i don't want to spoil it but it ruined many movies do that i hate it i am series i do hate that the writes of movie and director just sucked at making this movie. it's huge huge let down of this movie believe it is. you could watch this for Baustia and for time waster that's it then end of movie you decide whatever you like it or not i sadly didn't because it killed ending SO badly didn't make any sense it's like you wanna know what's going to happen next did People from Texas won over Brooklyn or what ??? Movie Like This Just Watch Purge Anarchy &amp; Purge Election Year Sadly But I Love Purge Anarchy a lot more then this i am come on even Purge Anarchy did a lot more better then this. The entire story line is all over the place and makes no sense whatsoever didn't make any sense oh yeah Stupe The former Marine war veteran takes out a lot of the bad guys but fails to take ANY of their M-4 Rifles from them He continues on with only his Colt M1911! NO WAR VETERAN in these circumstances would EVER leave a downed enemy without taking their superior firepower and ammo!!! STUPID, STUPID movie!! And it's so sad too because I really liked the blond and the big guy my role model Dave Bautista. But Movie Believe When You Get To End It Will Make You Hate Movie."}], "reviews_amount": 196}
