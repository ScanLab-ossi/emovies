I would like to know what the hell have you done all your life apart from writing some bad reviews for this movie, any achievements all these years? Anything you can write down on a paper and say here's what I've done my entire life? NO!! That's what I thought. When it comes to movies, the times are changing but it seems these haters are way behind those times. I'm giving 10 stars, and to tell the truth I'm doing it just to see the comments after this 10 stars review even though I know the movie it's around 8 stars.

There are only two professional actors, but they also didn't play good. About amateurs? What should I say next? I'm ashamed of their shame. Amateur actors are fourth-hand, I think ... Embarrassing, painful, annoying ... How much feeling can Bromania and Maticiuc have when they claim to be actors and have made a movie? It's amazing how much it defies the definition of a movie. The scenery is awful and looks like it was made by an 11-year-old in the park while playing in the sand. For a comedy that theoretically should make you laugh most of the time, I only remembered two moments where I had a little fun. I had fun, I repeat. I didn't laugh with my mouth to my ears. Romanian cinematography has 100 times better publicity films than this embarrassing production, which nevertheless has a record of sales in Romania. Do you know why that is? Because Bromania and Maticiuc are well known and have aggressively promoted the product in all possible and impossible environments. I think they heard about their shameful work on Mars as well. In addition, the target audience (the one with no higher education and no film culture) responded presently. If they deserve to be congratulated for something, Bromania and Maticiuc deserve to be congratulated for marketing, not for the movie attempt. Repeat movie attempt.

I found myself laughing a few times.Surprisingly there is not so much bad language but there are a lot of language jokes that makes sense only for Romanians.Considering the budget this looks promising and can be considered a success.If you don't expect too much you might quite enjoy it, I can definitely say that I saw comedies worse than this a lot of times."}, {"id": 187, "text": "No, I am not advertising any video channel, I simply feel this is what director Jes\u00fas del Cerro should put after the end of what felt like a glorified, overlong internet video done by an above-average content creator. But should I really be surprised at this trainwreck? Matei Dima, despite having studied acting in the US, is best known as internet funny-man Bro. And I am not even going to mention that weasel Codin Maticiuc's performance--he has no acting studies, nor skills. He is simply a businessman who got bored.The aforementioned actors play the two leads in this movie which revolves around them going to Miami to make some cash and attempt to rise themselves from the poor Eastern European life in Romania. Yet despite picking on Dima, he is, in fact, this basic comedy's only redeeming feature. His acting skills do show a bit, indeed. Or maybe is just because everyone around him acted like a bunch of left-over firewood. Fine, he is not the only one. Florin Piersic Jr., Letitia Vladescu and veteran Mirela Nicolau did a pretty decent job too, I guess.But a movie like Miami Bici really should not be written about in such an overworked manner. With a modest 1.5 million Euros budget, its only ambitions were to get as many people into a paid vacation as possible. But there are great things in movies that are not expensive. Like a great story, an introspective plot and smart, witty, timed comedy. Miami Bici has none of those. There is no social commentary--although there is potential for one--no class inequity, and the comedy, the only thing that is actually crucial, rarely hits. And when it does, it's only because Bro is ready to save the day. While Miami Bici attempts some creative albeit formulaic comedy, most of it falls flat.Take this movie for what it is. A glorified internet video, a piece of effortless entertainment, or a teenager's slumber party's choice for a quick flick while doing anything else except actually watching it. And you should do the same."}, {"id": 188, "text": "If you haven't seen the movie, I recommend you not to take into account the reviews of those who gave a low grade or said that it is a very bad movie.Before watching the movie, you need to know and understand that the jokes will be understood and will only make sense if you are Romanian and have lived in Romania, or if you know the life and traditions of Romania. Otherwise you will not understand and it is possible to say that it is not good.In my opinion, a good movie is when I click play and I don't know when the movie ends. I think it seemed like 10-20 minutes had passed.The team behind this film made an exceptional film, especially with the budget they had. Let's not forget that in America with this budget they didn't even make a Short, not to mention a movie and if they did, it was in category E.The film is a new approach to life in Romania and I think that most of those who saw it (I mean Romanians) found ourselves in that situation, dreams and disappointments.I've seen a lot of movies this year and I can say that this is the best I've seen. All my friends saw it and everyone liked it, I even made a mini cinema in a friend's garden where we all saw it.We didn't even have time to finish our beer, because we laughed all the time. I think that means the movie is good.The negative criticisms are again something typical Romanian that as soon as someone comes up with a new approach we hit them in the head.Well done team and you should make more movies like this. Respectfully AlexH"}, {"id": 189, "text": "It's a pleasant soft comedy. Might be hard to understand for foreigners, but for us, Romanians, who know the subtleties in the movie, it's actually quite fun to recognize some things which have been presented in a satirical way and should not be seen as an insult to our people, it's just a funny representation of some realities.Matei Dima has some good ideas and a decent to good acting, but he needs more directing experience.Miami Bici isn't something revolutionary, but, in my opinion, is much better than what we see at the tv, the so-called comedy tv series (will not name them). However, this is just my opinion.L-a Seral was also a decent production. If Matei wants to go further on this road, I hope he will continue. I believe that he can evolve in time, by learning from his mistakes or failures (5Gang: Un altfel de Craciun - The failure might be due to the hate towards 5Gang, not towards the movie itself, since the bad rating on IMDB)."}], "reviews_amount": 190}
