This is a disjointed story that is held together with scotch tape, prayers and good old fashion sex but don't hold your breath guys, not even those scenes are good. This is all bad. It could have been a fun story but whoever wrote this script either stopped paying attention to the plot on the first day of writing and got high, or they were using an online app to randomly string together events. Calling this movie ground breaking makes you wonder if whoever made that comment were paying attention to the movie or plot at all. Seeing Luke Wilson in a film of this caliber, I come to the realization that the current economic climate creates desperation which forces talented actors to accept crazy scripts and odd jobs. No, my advice is to stay away from this movie. You'll have more fun watching your tumble dryer completing a cycle or organizing your sock drawer."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I've never been so critical of movies.

Too bad you can't award zero stars. Story-line weak and little continuity. Even the sprinkling of T&amp;A wasn't worth the time."}, {"id": 3, "text": "This movie is pointless,stupid and horrible. It is filled with Jamaican sterotypes and a million yea mon phrases that are actually an annoying cultural perpetuation. The actors are some known individuals. I am so confused about Luke Wilson being in such a low budget movie with such an idiotic script. I cannot believe persons used money to make something so inferior. The audio was bad,editing was bad,plot and storyline nonexistent. ABSOLUTELY STUPID FILM. WASTE OF TIME,MONEY LOCATION AND ACTORS."}, {"id": 4, "text": "The movie is all over the place, story is 0 points, everything is so random, save yourself from this."}, {"id": 5, "text": "It took 5, yes 5 writers to come up with something this bad. How this was green lit is beyond me. This should never have seen the light of day. Talk about talented actors sinking to a new low. I get it, it was a job but have some dignity when choosing a project. Some of these actors need to turn in their SAG-AFTRA card and call it a day.

I don't know why I sacrificed my time for this trash.

I not only regret watching it, I feel bad for anyone associated with it.

Not funny and terrible plot."}, {"id": 23, "text": "So, I typically give way more than 1-star to a movie as even bad movies a lot of times have something good going in some areas. Before watching this one, I down voted 1-star reviews thinking those people are just stupid with no sense of humor. How WRONG I was... This movie does NOT deserve any more than 1-star. This is a massive flop with an absolutely horrible script and terrible directing. It is not funny. It's badly cut, terrible directing which makes camerawork seems bad and actors who can play way better than what is here, seem like it's their first movie. A high school play is better than this. I don't know what happened. This is so weird, and sucks for the actors to be involved in such massive flop of a production nonsense. Boo for the producer of this thing too to not be able to see it."}, {"id": 24, "text": "That could somehow afford Luke Wilson? I'm utterly confused. I'm literally having flashbacks of film school.

I really want my money back! I actually really like some of the actors in this movie from other shows and I honestly dont understand how they got them to agree to doing this movie?!?!

There are parts where the characters are speaking, camera is looking right at them, BUT THEIR MOUTHS ARENT EVEN MOVING. It's a terrible voice over flaw. And the scenes just change suddenly when you don't expect it. If you watch at the very beginning, you expect to keep watching her trying to catch the dogs running away...but no. It cuts right into her being back at home. It keeps jumping over small things like this that may seem pointless but actually are necessary to keep you as the viewer invested!! I get it. It's suppose to be a comedy. But scenes are cut way too much and in such a weird way, nothing makes any sense. I don't even blame the actors. It felt like they had no earthly idea what was going on either. This was terrible directing and editing. The plot was all over the place. Characters so hard to read. I just. No. Do not recommend at all."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Don't waste your time. Wow.Editing is terrible, score is terrible. It's all terrible. I can't believe some of these actors said yes to this movie.The bloopers during the credits were the best part. Yikes.I'd like 90 min of my life back. I actually signed up for an IMDb account just to warn others."}, {"id": 29, "text": "I gave it 20 minutes before taking a hard pass. Here is my theory... I think a bunch of Hollywood filmmakers wanted a tax write-off for a trip to a swinger's resort in Jamaica. They slapped together a ridiculous plot, filmed it as quickly and cheaply as possible, then used any leftover budget on resorts and drinks and whatever... with any out-of-pocket money they spent deducted on their taxes as a work expense. That's all I can think of - nobody possibly thought this movie was so good it had to be made."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I feel bad for all the actors.

I figured John Lovitz and Luke Wilson would do something good. Why would they ever sign up for this garbage. I don't know who the intended audience was but I found zero value in this movie.

It did not flow. The story line made no sense. The dialogue was disjointed. The acting was wooden. Some of the scenes, we can only assume, were added for specific comedic purposes. We are still waiting to laugh ..... Please don't watch this movie. You'll thank me later"}, {"id": 35, "text": "A movie with Luke Wilson, how bad could it be..... the answer is It's the worst movie I've ever seen and my bar is low. There are no words for exactly how bad the movie is. It's raunchy and all over the place story wise and just plain awful. Save yourself from this movie. Do not watch."}, {"id": 36, "text": "I like going into movies not knowing much about them, but that was a mistake with this one, which earns its 1/10 stars by being a terrible story with no cohesiveness. It's not funny and I figured it would be better just by having Jon Lovitz and Luke Wilson in it. Those names are probably why most people watched it at all. My advice would be to not waste your time, but if you're currently watching it and reading these 1 star reviews while it's playing, then you probably also have a partner who figured you may as well just finish it."}, {"id": 37, "text": "Okay, so hear me out.... The reviews are true, this movie IS AWFUL. However..... it is so bad that it is almost entertaining. Truly a train wreck that you can't help but watch. Once you continue you keep laughing at how truly random, horribly written and just overall horrendous it is, you start to just find it funny. The CGI is comparable to the first Harry Potter quiditch match and makes you question why they tried to put it in there in the first place?? There is about 7 minutes worth of content in this movie, every other scene is just shots that look like a middle school youtuber took on their vlog camera. From beginning to end, this movie is flat out BAD (but like... watch it)."}, {"id": 38, "text": "I can't tell if this was a student film by a bunch of kids with massive trust funds to spend or a money-laundering operation for an outlet with an urgent need to quickly hide a bunch of cash.The acting is actually fine, but the movie is...well, there are no words.

I found myself cringing so much to the point where I wanted to call redbox And complain to get my money back. I made it halfway though this film before I couldn't take it anymore. Literally no redeeming qualities about this movie to the acting to the actual plot in itself.

Entire film full of boring conversation, and disgusting overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the playing dumb scene, overuse of the tripping scene, overuse of the weird sound playing at the background scene, overuse of the copulate with only sound scene, overuse of the nude people slow motion running scene, and overuse of the guy with underpants dancing scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Papa and Mama McGursky watching two birds copulate! At the end, Laura reconcile with Tom, after having misunderstanding with him!

I didn't know movies could be that bad. It actually makes me like other movies more; like literally a new low, so everything else moves up a bit. There are movies where people are trying to do a good job and it turns out bad and that can be funny. There can be slapstick dumb humor which can be funny. But I honestly feel like it turned out bad enough where they tried to actively make it worse so it can be funny how bad it is, but it just becomes purposefully bad which is just so bad.

They recently met each other and they decide to marry. The most beautiful aspect of this movie is its amazing locations and scenes in Jamaica. You will see beautiful shots of the beach, sea, jungle and a beautiful resort. I give the acting an average score. I think the acting could be improved. I liked the background music. However, I think the usage of sound effects could be improved.

There were several actors that had small parts who are employees of the resort and it was so good to see these familiar faces while watching! There was even a quick glance at the owner, Harry!

Also there is not meaning of the whole story. Up and down and no other actors almost."}, {"id": 64, "text": "I'm not sure why there is so many 1 star reviews? It's not that bad. It's no comedic masterpiece or breaking any new ground, but it's watchable.The story is of a young couple about to be married in the Bahamas. They're on the plane with their friends and family when they have to land in Jamaica due to weather conditions. Following the advice of a cab/tour guide the check into a hotel and decide to hae the wedding there.... before they find out its a nudist colony for swingers.The first half of the film is ok, not classic laughs, but enough to chuckle. There's some decent comedy if you can stand the fact your parents are taking sex coaching lessons with your partner to be's parents (yet, not in the same way as Meet The Fockers)The film loses steam after it does the play-it-safe / done-to-death scenario every one of these films does... That's the couple have a fight, weddings off, they make up, weddings on, everyone's happy again and they live happily ever after as everyone smiles and looks in love over some romantic song. Would it kill a writer to keep the comedy going during these things? Then it ends on a dumb note by revisiting the dumbest joke of the movie.Actually, having said that, I guess I can see why people aren't liking this movie. But it's not a 1 star effort. Its more a meh, it's ok, but I'll never watch it again affair.There may be no memorable quotes or scenes, or any replay value, but it's not a movie where you're bored to death from start to finish. It's watchable once. I give a 4.5."}], "reviews_amount": 65}
