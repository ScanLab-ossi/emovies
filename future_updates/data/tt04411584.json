I absolutely loved it"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Such a delight to watch a movie about the law of attraction and the power our thoughts have over the outcome of our lives. I've been a fan of Josh Lucas for a long time, so it was a nice surprise to see him in this film. Katie was good to see too. I pray more see this and embrace the idea that our world can be full of peace and love, if we collectively come together to envision that outcome. It's important to recognize we are all connected and pray for the same love.At 11:11 am and pm every day, send love and happiness out to everyone. #floatingkindness"}, {"id": 2, "text": "It is really not amazing but it's pleasant and nice. Some movies make u wanna press the fast forward button but u kinda just breeze through the dull moments. Nice cinematography on some of the scenes and as for The Secret, it's kinda existed in the movie but not forced through."}, {"id": 3, "text": "This is a very beautiful feel good movie. The plot is simple but the presentation is so good that you fall in love with the characters."}, {"id": 4, "text": "I thought the trailer for this looked really good and I always liked Katie Holmes and Josh Lucas but the movie looked really good from the trailer and it did not disappoint. I don't usually rent any movies for $20, but me and my mom really wanted to see it and thought it was worth it and it was! The acting was very good, and I loved the story. It really inspired me too and I just recommend this movie, especially if you may be going through a hard time. It lifted my spirits for sure."}, {"id": 5, "text": "What a nice movie! Very well acted, funny, romantic and uplifting.I read the book and can confirm from my way of life that the quantum physics of the law of attraction, our thoughts create our life, is definitely working.

Worth every penny I spent to rent it."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Pleasant enough, although the score was quite bland, and detracted from the film. It was never explained why a college lecturer, drove down to deliver a letter, with a boot full of high powered saws and tools, enough equipment to repair a roof. I would warn the ladies especially, if a guys driving round with these sort of tools, ideal for disposing a body, might be worth not inviting him into your house to meet your kids, especially when you find out that he is not a builder, but a lecturer."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This film sounds like they threw words into hurricane hazel and what came out was the script.We couldn't make heads nor tails of what was happening, who the people were, and why were in space at the end.We felt like we were in therapy, with Therapist Bray coming out to play \ud83d\ude02So many questions: why did nana try to eat the ring? Why did the eldest daughter act like no one else knew what s'mores were? Why didn't he just give the envelope to her at the beginning? Why did Bray run like that?And what was with the music in some of those scenes? In one scene we literally find Bray fixing the house to melancholy music - your chopping mate, not putting down your dog."}, {"id": 9, "text": "What a positive message during the all movie!

Of course the blonde is his sister, not girlfriend."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I will never get back that 1 hour and 47 minutes of my life. Katie Holmes can't act her way out of a paper bag. Jerry O'Connell was casted incorrectly. The script is lacking substance and the movie never gets going. The end scene is so cringe-worthy, I wanted to crawl in a hole. Katie Holmes also has newly veneered teeth that are now too big for her mouth. She makes weird faces like a kid that just got braces and tries to cover their teeth with their lips. It's weird. This whole movie was weird."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Was waiting for this movie ever since I heard about it. Got to see on the same day it got released. Being an ardent Secret follower and fan, the law of attraction and the major Secret nuances were very mildly sprinkled or applied overall. I would say that, this movie was a decent love story with fantastic cinematography, good performance by the all the major actors. The major cons of this movie is the casting which made a great impact. Starting from Katie Holmes, josh and the kids, everyone played their part very well and we could just move into their story. The background score also needs to be mentioned and went well with the movie. Though the story was straight forward with a predictable climax, never felt bored. Felt that the law of attraction could be more applied or showcased and depicted in the movie. The impact was very meagre in this and couldn't satiate Secret fans. But it's a complete family entertainer and could feel the positivity when the movie ends. It was so light and cheerful!!"}, {"id": 13, "text": "I loved this film. I also loved Rhonda Byrnes, The Secret book so I knew I was going to thoroughly enjoy this. Katie Holmes and Josh Lucas are superb in this film and do a beautiful job conveying their characters positivity, or in Katie Holmes point of view, negativity. It's so nice to see their characters morph into bigger people who see that you can any situation in your life. Just listen.This movie made me smile and literally make she say, awe out loud. I've already watched it many times and will continue too, it's very inspiring.Watch this film!!!! You won't be disappointed I promise!!!"}, {"id": 14, "text": "Sometimes you just needs short story and few characters to show the sweetness of life with all its struggles. This movie has it.

If you want to watch something that makes you smile, and remind you that good is out there, it's perfect. The actors are great."}, {"id": 17, "text": "I had no idea when I watched it that this was meant to be a sequel, or that it had any mystical implications, because it really is just an empty, Hallmark style, film about a love triangle.The cast is good, even the child actors are more than adequate, but the movie has nothing original to offer."}, {"id": 18, "text": "I suspect the people who fall for this are the same ones who keep telemarketers and spammers in business."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Josh Lucas is too stiff of an actor for the roles he's been getting. This movie is plot-less. Katie Holmes acted well but she could not save this mess - her character is not developed, no idea why this girl is falling apart, no idea what's going on between the characters, the climax is a screaming match at a birthday party and you're left wondering what the heck is going on. I can't get the time spent watching this movie back. What a complete waste of time."}, {"id": 20, "text": "If you like Hallmark style love movies this is your jam.

All done with a tender touch in the midst of an unfolding love story. Great cast, acting, music, directing and cinematography. Nice to find a sweet film about listening to your heart and dreams that is also uplifting."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Do not watch this movie with children, they will get a totally wrong idea about life. The sentimentality is way too much. Why a guy who has the answer to a families problems in an envelope, something the mother owns decides to play silly bugger with the news is never really explained. One could say he wants her to need him but thats not really the point, either he is honest or not. He is certaintly portrayed as Mr Nicest man in the world. A chessy piece of moviemaking."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I'm sorry but any person can make better scenario better reaction. The story is very prosaic."}, {"id": 25, "text": "What a great film.

I was always a big fan of Katie's since her Joey days on Dawson's Creek,...in this movie she plays the part so well she wears her acting amazingly!! Her beautiful face portrays every bit of what she is feeling and when she is happy her smile makes your heart glow!! Just wish she would make more movies so I could watch them and feel good!! #katieholmesrocks"}, {"id": 27, "text": "This is so painfully bad! First off she lets her kids insult her in their car and says nothing about it. then when he crashes the car into Bray's truck and he comes back to the house to fix it she just leaves him alone to fix it (for free) any normal person wouldn't just leave him to fix her car for free without joining him outside?! Everyone is going on about the storm like its gonna be some massive tornado that takes up the entire plot of the movie, but all it does is get the floor yet and put a whole in the roof, ( i was expecting the house to be a pile of rubble) later when he is fixing their roof she doesn't stick around or offer to help, she leaves with the kids! in one scene the eldest daughter and Bray are chatting about her party, he mentions smores and she shouts out 'HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT SMORES' WHAT! how does he know about smores??? how do you know about cars? WHY WOUDNT HE KNOW THAT SMORES ARE A THING! IM ENGLISH, WE DONT EVEN HAVE SMORES OVER HERE AND I KNOW THERE A THING! Then there's Bray who constantly trying to be smart and philospical? why? it makes the scene super cringey and weird??? when he starts talking about magnets to the kids, like its a new discovery? EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT MAGNETS!!! we also keep seeing Bray on the phone to his girlfriend, all while creepily flirting with the hotel receptionist (by the way, this is soooo clearly a fake hotel, as this is very much just a nice house where they made one room kinda look like an office/reception) near the end they show that the main female gets a cheque, then they zoom in on the thing but look at the date, not the amount? im watching it as i type this and please please stop it with the weird quotes and phyicopical stuff! every time someone says a quote everyone else turns round and does this look, like randomly quoting mohamid Ali is normal? while in real life if you 9 year old would to suddenly quote einstien people would reply with 'stop being weird!' and another thing, 'The Secret: Dare to Dream' is SUCH a Halmark Movie title! its way too cheesy! thats wrong with naiming it something like 'The roof' 'Dead husband' or 'Will she wont she'??? at one point they all get excited that they found their mail box in a pond, they get excited to open and read it. but you were sent a second copy of this and opened it earlier in the movie? you've already read the letter!! earlier in the movie we see bray fix the roof and install a sky light. sure he can climb a ladder and get a bit of wood up there, but HOW did he get a huge chunk of glass up there without a second human or even a crane!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "Absolutely loved it. this easily deserves a 10 star rating. best 21 million dollars ever spent! bravo bravo bravo!"}, {"id": 29, "text": "Nice pace of a movie.

So fake for all the acting and storyline. Boring to hell."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Katie Holmes is terrible. After all these years, she still acts on sceen like Joey Potter. That scene when she finds he knew her husband. Jeez. I wouldn't have slapped him. I would have wanted to know about every last minute he spent with my husband. So egotistical of her. Better read the novel than wasting time with this awful movie."}, {"id": 35, "text": "I'm really glad some people left nice reviews because this was definitely worth the watch.

But at one point I wasn't sure and I thought if it didn't end the way I felt I would be disappointed that it built up towards my expected conclusion. Ok, for a nice change we don't have mad sex starved females climbing all over some guy like it seems more than half the movies and TV shows have that as a prerequisite! No car chases, no blood, no guns, a movie a family can watch together When my kids were little, 3 girls and a boy who came a bit later, I used to look for a movie we could all watch on a Friday night, them on the floor in sleeping bags and their mother and I on the couch. It seemed easy enough to find something we would all enjoy and I am glad they are now adults, because I don't see much family oriented movies anymore! I gave it a seven, it can even deserve a bit more. The whole cast of actors are pleasant.

A breath of fresh air! :)"}, {"id": 40, "text": "I give it a 10 because I started watching it assuming it was worth a maximum of 5. It's warm, uplifting an beautifully casted. It's the first movie in a while I don't feel forced . Despite my expectations of seeing a chick flick, and it does mark some of its boxes , it's worth the view. It wasn't too sweet and the message was nice. Yes, it's cliche at times but for the first time in a long time it felt right. It's a nice movie , not a masterpiece but in a world of Netflix underdelivering it's a pleasant change."}, {"id": 41, "text": "A simple premise, an inevitable ending, but a nice easy ride. I don't know whether it was the direction or the performance but this was not Katie Holmes greatest performance. I was never quite convinced she found her character. Beautiful cinematography rendering idyllic locations. An optimistic sentiment that reminded me of the story of the young girl, gleefully rooting in a room full of manure. When questioned why she was so happy, she replied, With this much stuff in here there must be a pony, somewhere! I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Romantic Drama}"}, {"id": 42, "text": "Its a sort of Sunday afternoon made for TV feel good type of movie, nothing earth shattering here but then again, give some of the detritus I've watched lately, a pleasant surprise. Simple plotline, decent acting and characters you sort of like and want everything to turn out well for them in the end.Its an OK movie and worth a watch on a rainy afternoon - sometimes pleasant is enough."}, {"id": 43, "text": "The premise is that positive thoughts attract positive energy and outcomes, and negative does the same; consciously or subconsciously. This means that the central character is a master manipulator who must've secretly wished the woman's husband dead, which caused the plane crash that killed him. Then he must've meant to meet her and cause her house to be damaged in the storm so he could worm his way into her life, causing her to dump the boyfriend, and ultimately manipulating her and her family to move in with him. And, of course, because this is all just positive thoughts, there is no sense any personal responsibility or effort into making things happen. Furthermore, there is this fantasy that the American dream of wealth and prosperity just happens by wishing; and in fact, the only measure of success in this movie is money. Interesting, seeing as the movie itself made a loss! The whole thing would be laughable if its message wasn't so dangerous. You might as well believe in the force. This type of pseudo psychology is cultish, and like any other cult, needs to be avoided."}, {"id": 44, "text": "Lighthearted movie that's hard not to enjoy. It borrows well worn plot elements from a number of other films, but it all works. Good performances by pretty much everyone in the cast.

But that aside, this is a beautiful, sweet, feel good movie. Katie Holmes looks very different, from what I remember. If I had not known she starred in it, I would not have known who she was. This movie flowed so smoothly. Never boring, and was sad to see it end. I do recommend if you are a fan of the Hallmark Channel type of films."}, {"id": 47, "text": "Awwww I love a good story.

Such a touching story and the chemistry between these two was perfect."}, {"id": 49, "text": "So before I watched this I decided to check the reviews because I don't have nearly two hours to spend on a duff film. The critics said it was terrible but then I decided that critics don't write for the viewer, they write for companies and the viewer doesn't care about that, so I gave it a shot and I loved it. Excellent acting and a great storyline which kept me engaged all the way through. Beautiful morals and so good to find a romance which was true to romance. So I've decided to always check what people say about films and not what critics say because let's face it....they're paid to be critical! So enjoy the film and the lessons from it!"}, {"id": 50, "text": "I've been dying to see this film from the first time I saw the trailer. I wasn't disappointed. A true Family Movie that wasn't being Preachy. I was a bit worried in the end only because I'm a pessimist at heart. We should all Dare to Dream. I highly recommend this Movie. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25"}, {"id": 51, "text": "As someone who believes in the Law of Attraction and loves the original movie The Secret, I was really looking forward to watching the principles come to life in a real story. Unfortunately the story line was flat and predictable.I was looking for the main character to experience deeply profound and mystical attractions and manifestations. Instead, we're given a cheesy love triangle story that only hints on the very basics of energy and attraction.It is a shame the movie was not able to debut in theaters and I understand their decisions, but $20 to rent a movie at home only added to the pain and suffering of watching this movie."}, {"id": 52, "text": "Really, really bad. Half of the sceens don't make any scence. I don't have much more to say. It's just a bad movie."}, {"id": 53, "text": "As many people have mentioned, there were so many questions left unanswered while watching this movie. Like how could she leave the keys to her house to this random man with the logic he's not a serial killer because he's a professor like whaat?? And how did he fix the roof by himself like that so fast? Why did Tucker open up his life to a stranger? Why did the 16 year old act like a 7 year old and want a kid's birthday party whom she invites a middle aged man to? Why did she think people didn't know what s'mores were and how did not even the actors question it? Why didn't they know anyone besides Tucker and the mother in law? The line I now know that I can get whatever I want which I realise is the premise of the movie, is just such a misrepresentation of life. And the pony, just when I thought it couldn't get any worse. This was definitely written by some upper class middle aged hallmark loving woman who has no concept of reality."}, {"id": 54, "text": "Very nice, feel good, inspirational.

Clearly aimed at the sort of person who believes in star signs it stretches all belief from the start. I can't be bothered describing the whole film but at one point Josh (or Jesus?) describes the law of attraction by holding a magnet so it attracts a paper clip 'what you think about the most will be attracted into your life declares Jesus i mean Josh. He asks the kids what they want most, the describe the Pizza and topping they most desire (mum had denied them Pizza because of money worries) and guess what at that exact moment there is a knock at the door and a Pizza man delivers exactly what they wanted.

The whole script was clicheic and everything was way too easy to predict. The film had no suspense at all, and the only thing I found interesting about the movie were some of the lines of the characters, repeating some of the core ideas of the book I mentioned.The place was nice, the scenery was great, but as I said earlier, it was wasted on bad choices of acting, directing and plot."}, {"id": 60, "text": "I read the books years ago and I love Katie Holmes, so figured I would try this. It was surprisingly pretty decent. The dialogue was a little corny in some spots, but overall felt natural. Josh Lucas always has something charming about him. The kid actors were good, especially the son. A feel good movie that makes you think about life without being over the top about it."}, {"id": 61, "text": "First and foremost, I would like to applaud this well done and well executed movie. Katie who typically underwhelms with most her movies actually turns in a good performance as the widow in financial trouble. Josh with that signature smile and blue eyes turns in an excellent performance as the secret angel. The movie's premise after some quick reveals is Josh is delivering very good news to Katie and family. The movie moves a good pace and doesn't get stuck. The quick reveals gives the real reason for Josh's visits and sets up the conflict of the movie when Katie's character confronts him. Of course everything resolves itself, Katie breaking up with a fianc\u00e9e and deciding to live her life. It gets wrapped up at the end aka Hollywood style. It was a very good movie and the performances were good.

Gratitude and giving thanks being the main ones. Yes there was reference for the I want oppose to I dont want but the law of attraction and the secret is more than that. Its changed my life with the daily practices which I give daily thanks too.The film is a lovely romantic story and gives the audience a view of helping others sometimes in reward brings happiness in return.

The plot is based upon a committed woman choosing to fulfill her own commitments balanced against a man with his own commitments. Guess what?

Honestly, it did not ring any bells about the book itself, but still, the movie was inspiring and worth watching to have a good time.

Now, Miranda, who works in the nearby Middendorf's fish joint, is leading a hardscrabble life and may have to sell the beloved family home.Into Miranda's comes the most intriguing character in the film, the smooth-talking Vanderbilt engineering professor Brae Johnson. Brae is not only a charmer, but he also has words of wisdom for everyone after a miraculous experience spared his life and gave him an entirely new outlook. He wins over all of the kids, especially in giving Missy the idea of the taffy pull as the pretext for her sixteenth birthday party.The only mistake made by Brae was in being slow on the trigger to inform Miranda about the reason for his visit to her home and the nature of the mysterious contents in a manila envelope. Part of the problem is Bobby, Miranda's controlling, but well-intentioned mother-in-law, who always seems to be the spoiler when Brae needs a few minutes alone with Miranda.Sadly, the big loser was Tuck Middendorf, who publicly proposed marriage, yet eventually lost out on the sweepstakes for the hand of the widow Miranda. Brae was apparently living with a woman, and one of the best moments in the film is the revelation that the woman is not not Brae's live-in lover, but his sister!At one point, Miranda is physically abusive to Brae. But all is forgiven in this endearing, family-oriented melodrama. The last barrier falls down when it becomes clear that the two little ships passing in the night will be able finally meet alone at the Waffle House where they will dare to dream together."}, {"id": 81, "text": "Take a world self help best selling book about making your dreams come true, create a cheese movie around it with no real depth and this movie is the result.Just like that, nothing more nothing less."}, {"id": 82, "text": "A nice drama.

When a storm blows a tree through their already leaky roof, he offers to help out and... well, you can imagine the rest. The plot offers nothing new, though there are a couple of rather unlikely twists as we proceed down a well trodden path of romance and serendipity. Celia Weston adds a little extra as her rather sceptical mother Bobby and at times is has tiny echoes of It's a Wonderful Life (1946) bubbling underneath that make it an easy, if completely unchallenging watch.

But hey - everyone needs something to help them get by, and like I said, the thought was in the right place.Now, the book has inspired a film which I can only imagine will be the first of many.Director Andy Tennant knows romcoms. After all, he was behind It Takes Two, Fools Rush In, Ever After and Sweet Home Alabama, the kind of movies that the lady in your life wants to put on any time they show up on a Sunday afternoon (and you'd be the jerk wanting to watch The Replacements again).Miranda Wells (Katie Holmes) is the kind of hardscrabble, yet gorgeous, widow that these movies are all about. She's raising three kids on her own but a storm blows into town and she has to hire Bray Johnson (Josh Lucas, who was in the aforementioned Sweet Home Alabama) to help fix things up, which includes her life and her family. Bray is pretty much The Secret in human form, because he's a positive thinker, as well as someone that has a mysterious past that could ruin everything.Don't you just hate the third part of the hero's journey?If you're already in for the 90's stars in this, Jerry O'Connell shows up as well to seal the deal.There was another movie version of the book in 2006, but that one didn't have romance, a storm or Katie Holmes trying to raise kids. The universe talked to me and told me not to watch it. However, the universe did tell me to watch this, as we got a screener in the mail and it felt like I was watching too many slashers and perhaps it was time to watch a family-friendly movie about the power of positivity.Now, for you moment of meta, sponsored by the IMDB trivia page for this movie: Josh Lucas played Mitch McDeere in the television adaptation of The Firm, a role originated by Holmes' ex-husband Tom Cruise.Now, back to The Secret. I feel as if my movie writing is now a success, as I have been able to convince movie studios to send me films to get my expert opinion. Most of my opinion is based on how much I love movies where people are menaced by gardening implements. That said, when this crossed my plate, I knew that I had finally achieved something worthwhile.Then my wife said, Why do you want to watch this movie?So I explained The Secret*somehow combines the Protestant teachings of Norman Vincent Peale with the Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky to create a theory that you can reprogram reality without needing to make sigils or set things on fire or masturbate. Then she stared at me even longer, wondered why she married me and went out to smoke a cigarette.*The movie does this with pizza magically arriving when the children wish it in existence.

A devastating storm causes damage to her home, which only makes life more bleak. When she runs into mysterious man Bray Johnson (Josh Lucas), her life seems to be changing in a positive way. Bray offers her a helping hand in a positive way with all Miranda's problems. Bray tries to convey his positive energy to Miranda and her children, but as Miranda starts to spend more time with Bray, she learns that he is also hiding something from her.With this film they have trouble telling the message that life is or will get better if you go through it in a positive way. Despite this good report, the film is not much special and can quickly become predictable. The story also quickly becomes a bit repeated, because with every negative thing that happens in the film, Josh Lucas offers his character a helping hand over and over again to make the situation positive.Katie Holmes does good acting as a woman going through a rough patch, but doesn't do anything remarkable with this role.

Bray offers to help again and does so, but he notices the mail box where he put the envelope has blown away.Bray interacts with all the kids and they like him a lot and they notice that Miranda seems more alive when he is around.

It would seem that Bobby is a busy-body, but she just wants Miranda to get out of trouble with bills, a house falling apart while rearing her kids.Josh Lucas needs to be in more movies as he has a way of saying things you believe without reservation or hesitation. In here he gives many life lessons when interacting with the kids and with Miranda, and does it a very gentle way.The Problem: okay here goes: Miranda later finds out that Bray knew her late husband who invented something and Bray takes credit for it.But we all know the real problem is that adults don't really talk to each when it is absolutely necessary to do so. But - as you know - if they did we wouldn't have a story.
