I had goosebumps.Sope Dirisu is incredible - and Wunmi Mosaku is an absolute scene stealer."}, {"id": 1, "text": "This was the perfect horror movie. Genuinely terrifying in parts. And also giving a view into a world of human experience that encompasses human-born horror, loss, grief, desperation, striving and hope. I really cared for these characters and what happened to them, their story. I felt they were so real and believable in their struggle with one another, their love for one another, their tragic loss of community and connection, their being thrust into a cold, thin alienating, lonely new life in a strange land. Great actors , great script and engaging story, great camera work and yes, a twist. For me, there is a lot to like here and I will be looking out for more by this film-maker."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Decided to watch this film on Halloween as pretty much watched all the classics over the October month and i found this little gem very refreshing. Netflix has been disappointing this halloween with the terrible blyth manor but they pulled it back with this one. A horror story with heart that makes you feel lucky for the life you have. It tells the story of two asylum seekers and the struggles they face to settle in a new country BUT something has come along with them!! The story flows nicely, the acting is a decent effort and there are some very good jump scares. Some of the dream scenes are beautifully shot and kind of reminded me a bit of the scenes in The Ritual. Its not all horror but that shouldn't stop you giving this one a go."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Different and memorable. Not predictable, left me wondering in what order it was written."}, {"id": 4, "text": "It starts well, midway you think it's following a standard horror movie course, but stick with it! Very well done. Terrific ending!"}, {"id": 5, "text": "The horror genre is filled with junk, so it comes as a pleasant surprise when you run into a gem, and His House is very much a gem. I don't wanna give too much away, but the story is about African immigrants who escape their war torn country to settle in a dilapidated house in the UK, and from there bad things start to happen.There is so much depth to this movie that a few words just don't give it justice, what's more is you genuinely feel for the main characters of the movie. The scares? Let's say this one is just downright creepy, coupled with some excellent angles that really make the movie crawl under your skin.Great great watch!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "This movie was amazing. There are so many metaphorical meanings behind the film and it was interesting to see what happens at the end. The fact that the story of refugees was told is amazing because you hardly hear those stories. Let alone see it in horror films. The scary moments were actually scary, there were elements I've never seen in any movie, etc. The actors all embodied their roles well. Great Job, Remi"}, {"id": 7, "text": "If you're a fan of in-your-face horror, this film is deeply psychological and not for you. Although politics lay the foundation for the story, the story itself isn't really about immigration. I think sometimes people see minorities in horror films and automatically think it's about racism or prejudice. To be blunt, there's no political message in film. It's well crafted and allows you to draw your own opinions. See it for yourself."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Its not spooky or creepy. Mayb some wannabe critics may term it as a horror film cos of the trauma the couple went thru or mayb cos of the evil men can do (one tribe butchering another tribe) or mayb cos of the Folie \u00e0 deux. The performances by the two lead actors is top notch, the film ain't boring n moves at a decent pace but it aint a horror film."}, {"id": 9, "text": "The psychological torture and torment of two immigrant refugees, a married couple, brilliantly examined and presented through the culture they have travelled from, the beliefs of their homeland, within a derelict British society they now call home and the tragedy endured trying to get there.

African asylum seekers in Britain get housed in a haunted social housing property. The leads are just brilliant and utterly convincing as a married couple who have literally been to hell and back. Remi Weekes, the director, has a very sure hand with horror and breathes some fresh life into the haunted house/demonic posession/witchcraft genre. A very small cast, a disconcerting and claustrophobic atmosphere and winning leads make an original and fresh movie. It starts very creepily and builds the tension throughout although the end was a little heavy on the virtue signalling."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Really liked His House, great effects, great characters, brilliant actors, well done horror and very good political / society story, good ghouls - a solid 8/10 from me"}, {"id": 12, "text": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 The last scene of this film isn't very long but being someone who's seen it all and a connoisseur of DISTURBING FILMS.. you know 120 days of sodom..

It feels like a half baked BBC drama more than a Horror on Netflix.The cast is fine, downtrodden but likeable in a 'not entirely likeable sort of way' I think it probably wants to be more of a social commentary than an actual horror...And it's this which I think is part of the problem, it wants to show the horrors that people are fleeing from and the perils and loss of the journey but that (if done properly) would be enough, better even than what we wind up with here.People will review it well and say it's the best movie of the year etc, but it isn't, if it is then they need to watch more movies... It could have been so much better, it's a shame they wasted the opportunity."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Was not expecting that! Jump scares and screams that I have not experienced in a while! I feel like this story is relevant for its time and seeing the raw emotion from the main characters through a scary jumpy film was done very well and had me wondering what the hell is going on with the unexplainable goings on inside their house. Creative and new kind of scares that were not samey as some other modern films. The actors who play Bol and Rial were really believable."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Very moving story with twists and suspense throughout. Also, bring out the horrors and unfathomable hardship that many refugees faced with certain death, take to life a peaceful life. Superb acting by all."}, {"id": 18, "text": "His House is a beautifully acted movie about a Sudanese refugee couple who are moved into a rundown house in England. The house turns out to be haunted, and there are a number of questions left up to the viewer to decide by the end. The movie does a neat trick of making it clear exactly why the couple can't just leave this house once the haunting starts. They have strict rules in place to maintain their asylum status, and one of those rules is they don't leave that house before they're told that they can. There's conflict between the husband and wife, as he is eager to assimilate while she wants to hold onto their culture. The ominous mood is set up early, as the house they are given is large enough for two families but they are being given it to themselves and the rehousing agent (Matt Smith) acts shifty about it and won't explain why they have this house to themselves. The house has been used as a trash dumping ground by the neighborhood kids, so it has fallen into an abandoned state and they wind up having to fix up parts of it just to have livable conditions. There are holes in the walls from which come whispering sounds. And from the very first night, there are jump scares and WTF moments, and some pretty good ones too. The wife, Rial, becomes convinced that a ghost from their past has followed them to England. The husband, Bol, doesn't want to hear it at first. They have a big secret between them, a major source of guilt. Whatever is in their house is feeding on it. The thing is, if the ghost followed them there, why do other people who have lived in the neighborhood longer treat their house like it's haunted? The movie hints that there might be something much older occupying that space but never explains it fully. However, the movie does manage to come to a mostly satisfying resolution."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I was waiting for this movie since I saw the trailer...

This film has impressive visuals and tremendous acting especially from Wunmi Mosaku who plays Rial. What is truly remarkable about this film is the way it toys with the viewer's relationship to different aspects of the film including characters and the horror itself. This film packs so much emotional depth in only 93 mins. My only negatives are that at certain points the movie becomes a little ungrounded with the extent of the hallucinatory/dreamy imagery. Also, I'm not exactly sure how I feel about some of the horror imagery being traditional African body art. I'm certainly not sufficiently knowledgeable of the subject to judge whether there is narrative significance to the art or if the filmmaker just thought it looked spooky."}, {"id": 31, "text": "Now when it comes to movies in this exquisite genre, there isn't always satisfaction, but this amazing masterpiece is no doubt one of the best low budget movies I have ever seen.

The story was simple, straightforward and seems a commentary on social issues like immigration. There is a recent trend on horror film makers where it is 'woke' thing to incorporate certain socio/political/philosophical topics as a storyline, but this one was hardly entertaining. It was forgettable and very basic but still I gave it a OK rating because I like the shots and imagery of the film."}, {"id": 47, "text": "This movie is all about a twist that makes things interesting for a moment and that's it.

It does a wonderful job at keeping the viewer on their toes, using a simple storyline, and one that brings awareness to a real world plight. There are some frightening moments. Unfortunately, the conclusion doesn't tie up the loose ends. It's a smart film, but a little complicated at the end in that we don't get our problems solved.

One cannot take shelter in any of them separately, by dislocating it from the other two. More to the point, one cannot identify oneself exclusively with one's present, respectively erase one's past, for then he/she becomes haunted and hunted by the latter (as it initially was the case with Bol). However traumatic, only by facing and seeking to constructively deal with one's own past, can one find the means to 'start anew' and ensure a future.

Some may find some of the scare moments mildly silly in other words you are seeing too much which takes away the supernatural scare factor and shift it towards a zombie flick.

The generic formula: dark house (this time not the usual Manor in the middle of nowhere) a couple moves in (this time refugees not the successful author) a troubled past (this time a lost child and Culture) plus, a dark entity (this time African witch craft) it's not groundbreaking as outlined by others but that's personal taste I guess and should not stop watching his house!"}, {"id": 98, "text": "This film poses that question.

See for yourself."}, {"id": 105, "text": "Now if you're waiting for you're typical, surface level horror film to pass the time, you might be disapointed. From what I saw, most bad reviews were about the movie being boring, which will probably be the case if you're only looking for jumpscare instead of looking into the story.However looking deeper into it, you'll get a great social commentary about colonisation, immigration and all the consequences, or rather ghosts, that inevitably come with it. Here's my personal interpretation, but to each their own (SPOILERS obviously):Story (just ignore this paragraph if you already saw/understood it): We follow a couple, Bol and Ryal, running from their country in a attempt to make their way to the greater land and start a new life. However the house given for their trial period as UK citizen turns out to have obscures presences hiding behind its walls. We eventually discover that in order to make his way to london, Bol stole a little girl from her mother in an attempt to get himself and his wife seats in the bus that will lead them to the boat to England. Ryal, filled with remorse sweared to protect the little but the latter ended up dying in the sea as they were floatting to the Occident. The presences tormenting them are ones of a demon, Nygyak, and the many ghosts he appropriated the souls from, including the little girl's. He offers (or rather demands) to get Bol's soul in exange of the little girl's, as a sign of reparation. Eventually, the demon is killed and and Bol and Ryad accept the price that comes with freeing the little girl from Nygyak and the thousand ghost that were under his influence.Now you could see this as a simple story about this couple of immigrants being hunt by demons after comitting a crime, but in my opinion, this movie is a commentary about colonization as a whole. Bol represent the colonizer: he takes from people to make his path to more success and belonging, at the expanse of other people's life. Then once his ghosts (the immigrants) comes to reclaim their part of the cakes, he plays the denial card: you can see him trying to get rid of everything linking him to his past life, and na\u00efvely hide the scratchs of his damaged house in a attempt to make himself at home. The same way a lot of Occident countries, after so much years of slavery, colonizing and stealing ressources, likes to paint those event as part of the past while fully keeping the economic advantages that came (and still comes) with it. I'd say Ryal represent your actual immigrant, scarred by war and full of remorse (just as Bol, she made her way to UK at the cost of someone else's life) and nostalgic of her home, not quite able to fit in as she's lost in a world that isn't hers and where people mock and reject her. But now she's also here in this house, which imo represent the land, within which colonizer and colonized have to cohabit anyway. Bol wants to make the house his, while Ryal wants them to acknowledge the ghosts and leave. I'd say Nygyak is a metaphore for war and death, as he slowly draw the two characters against one an other in order to get his blood sacrifice, presenting it as an easy way to fix their tornment. Once the demon is defeated, Bol and Ryal finally both understands they have no choice but moving forward while bearing the consequences that come with leaving on a ground obtained at expanse of so many lives, and fix their mistakes (aka fix the house).I like this interpretation as it doesn't paint a white and black picture, simply aknowledge that as long as this circle of stealing and repaying continues, more lives will be lost.This movie is great, the performances are outstanding and doesn't fail to keep things interresting despite a limited budget. However I think if you're looking for more traditional horror, this probably ain't it. Still, congratulation to Remy Weekes, looking forward his next projects."}, {"id": 106, "text": "I thought this was a spectacular film.

I think it really touched upon some real emotions like *SPOILER ALERT* the hardships of having to try and survive within a war-torn country. I felt worried about what could happen to the two main protagonists while also being kept on my toes whenever the spirit was involved. I also felt emotional towards the finale. I won't ruin much more... leave the rest up to you! I'm a huge horror fan and this one is so simplistic and stylistic it really makes it that little bit more enjoyable.

The noise is caused by a witch/apeth and ghostly images of the horrors of the Sudanese couple's past.Excellent acting by the leads and steady direction by newcomer Remi Weekes keeps the tension at boiling point as a clever plot twist explains the witches presence.It is the plot twist and the psychological emotions of it that are released by Rial killing the apeth.A good, suspenseful new twist on the genre delivered in a compact running time.

A deep seated respect for the elders, the ancestors and a genuine fear of witchcraft spell out African culture and often dictate how lives are lived here. This movie perfectly captures those fears and beliefs, but there is more to this. I believe this encapsulates survivors guilt. The intention to save another from a terrible fate, going awry and ending in tragedy must surely leave a deep wound on the mind that is self destructive and requires an honest introspection and eventually acceptance of the role one may have played in the loss of that life. It amounts to wrestling with one's own demons and a process of self forgiveness and acceptance that that pain and guilt will always live on inside you. Very interesting movie. I loved it and I so enjoyed the creepy moments. When Rial tells Bol the story from her mother, I felt once again as if I was camping out in the pitch dark of the African veld and listening to a wise, old African woman telling me a moralistic tale with a terrifying, supernatural consequence, and nothing but open veld and darkness surrounding me. It's pretty creepy. Unless one comes from a deeply superstitious culture, you may not appreciate that feeling, however the movie captures it perfectly. Totally worth a watch. I loved it.

The couple struggle with the concept of what it means to be one of the good ones. For the husband, it means assimilating smoothly into English life and establishing themselves as a family in that image. He cheers for their local soccer team, attempts to dress like the images of English families, and disregards the lifestyle practices they used to have in South Sudan. For the wife, it is about coming to terms with their past and the loss of their daughter. Their struggle manifests as a demon in the walls of the house they are granted asylum in. The demon appears in many forms: as their dead daughter, as the dead passengers of the sunk ship they survived crossing the mediterranean, and in its true form. Long exposure shots, eerie non-diegetic sound, and the use of shadows are all horror conventions used to create frightening ambiance for the demon and create scenes where the fears of the couple are realized.The demon forces the couple to confront the repressed, a critical turn in the film: their daughter was never theirs in the first place. They took the child so they could board a bus which only was helping families with children escape. The daughter dies in the sinking ship crossing the mediterranean; the couple being some of the only survivors. They struggle with what it means to be one of the good ones and cannot come to terms with the passing of the child that they abducted for their escape. Their time in England is met with skepticism for their existence as refugees, but the film is really a commentary on the dilemmas of survival that refugees face. The film for me could only be a horror film. The demon lets the viewers feel the fear and repression for the appearances required of the refugees in order to make it through the system of asylum approval. It reveals the horrors that they are trying to escape and how even in safe country, it can continue to haunt them.Even if the content isn't interesting to you, the movie is a must watch for horror/thriller lovers.

Wow what an amazing, creative, impactful and genuinely terrifying movie His house was, let's get started.First of all the movies cinematography, tense and uncomfortable tone and Jumpscares were excellent. This movies visual creativity was incredible, there was some shots and use of lighting, and camera trickery that I had never seen before and the movie blew me away, the visuals despite having one key element to them were always changing and getting more and more interesting as the movie developed. The movie also had an incredibly uncomfortable tone throughout, as the main characters mental health declined slowly and slowly more as the movie developed so did the increasingly uncomfortable tone and the characters became more and more unpredictable you never knew what was going to happen, which made it very uncomfortable due to the increased stakes and power that the witch was getting over the characters, the movie built up tension and had amazing Jumpscares, the movie did an absolutely incredible job at building the movies tension, it did an excellent job at extending the scenes and building the tension making the audience not know when a jumpscare was going to happen made me on the edge of my seat throughout, the creativity when it came to the Jumpscares was also excellent, it was completely different every time and the director somehow made one house be capable of way more scariness and Jumpscares than it should of done, I was simply amazed at how well they did with the Jumpscares which got even more scary as the movie went on.My next few positives would be the representation, unique character perspective and themes making the concept of the movie really interesting, as well as the character background and depth. I thought the movies representation was fantastic, to have a largely black cast was excellent and considering the themes of refugees and escaping your country it was really interesting to see the different cultures displayed within the film, and having the characters escaping their country due to having no other choice due to gangs was so interesting and unique for me, and they cleverly linked these themes with not being able to let go, these were both balanced and tackled really well and were cleverly intertwined throughout. I also really appreciated the character background added, spreading out what life was like for the main characters across the whole movie really helped with understanding what they were going through, there was also so much character depth, both main characters were fighting over not letting go of their country and troubled past with their daughter but also having to fit in a country that shuns them or where they don't feel welcomed so this was powerfully done and added multiple layers to the characters involved.My final few positives would be the performances, script, equal amount of time spent on both characters, plot twists and amazing ending. The performances from both Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Musaku were truly incredible, they showed such depth and nuance to their performances, they managed to make their characters so believable and real it was incredible to watch, their performances and subtle facial expressions were also terrifying and contributed towards how scary the movie was. The script was also very powerful, the social commentary the movie conveyed about a lot of the populations views on refugees and even black people was powerful and would be really impactful for a lot of people and it still was for me, and the script and dialogue in general was masterfully constructed and put together. The movie also did a good job at spending an equal amount of time on both main characters, the movie did an excellent job at balancing both of the characters out, I understood and connected with both characters an equal amount, and the movie spent a lot of time developing both and it was never one way or the other. And finally the movies plot twists and final act was just fantastic, I genuinely didn't see the plot twists coming and they really changed how I saw the movie and its characters but in a good way, it really concluded both their character arcs excellently and very cleverly and ended the movie on a high.Overall His house is a creative, unique, powerful and terrifying movie that is an incredible debut feature for Remi Weekes, who judging by this movie has a bright future ahead of him."}, {"id": 183, "text": "I very much enjoyed the suspenseful nature and the setting of this film but what caught me off guard in a pleasant way is the plot and the human side of the story.

It's about real demons but also inner demons and demons from the past. It's about refugees but also culture, vulnerability and being scared of a new world.

There's a lot to learn from this movie and if ignorant people can look past the black acting leads and director they will be open to a touching story which we all need to be aware is happening in this world. Love it."}, {"id": 196, "text": "Firstly, the film settles the tone of gray, cold England and introduces the main characters, Bol and Rial, both well played by Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku.The first 60 minutes of the film are pure horror, perfectly directed by Remi Weekes who utilizes suspenseful sequences to capture the audience attention and concludes with well executed jumpscares. Moreover, the film deals with relevant themes such as xenophobia in what, in my opinion, is one of the best scenes in the feature; Rial speaking in his native language to a group of black english teens who respond with aggressive insults and mocks. Furthermore, Weekes correctly portrays an atmosphere of intrigue and confusion, in the complete style of Jordan Peele, as it something was really wrong but you just don't know what it is; a clear reference to Peele's 'Get Out' can be perceived, as well as the soundtrack, which resembles the music from 'Us'.The second part of the movie focuses on telling the backstory of the characters, employing a series of dream sequences, beautifully filmed, and very clever flashbacks. However, this part of the movie breaks with the formula that had been going on for the first hour and the feature acquires a dramatic atmosphere. Furthermore, this second part becomes more subjective, confusing and ambiguous, which in my opinion is a great decision from director Weekes, who guides his direction into making the build up of what would be the movie's plot twist and climax, an event that would wrap everything up and will make us understand why everything took place.In conclusion, the movie is like two movies merging to tell a single story; in my opinion it should have stayed as a suspense/horror film, with the formula of the first half, because it had potential to become on of the best scary films of the year. Cinematography is one of the highlights along with direction and edition and acting is pretty decent.The movie is great at its suspense moments, but it kind of fails in the combination with its dramatic aspect, at the end it tends a lot to hard-to-believe fantasy and it just doesn't work because it stays in the middle of drama and horror, ergo, it is too real to believe the fantasy and too fictitious to don't; the closing scene is brilliant though.

The story, about a refugee couple, touchingly played, who having escaped massacres and civil war in an (unnamed) African region, who are allocated a house to live in in a down at heel estate. The house seems haunted at first, but maybe it's the ghosts of those they've lost back home and maybe a demon has followed them? The sense of threat and danger is well done, and although here and there some of the dream/haunting sequences and flashbacks might confuse the audience, the cast and director manage to draw you into the experiences of the couple and gradually reveal their secrets. It's all a bit downbeat, but it's an intelligent and meaningful piece of filmmaking."}, {"id": 199, "text": "I love the genre of horror and seen a lot so I'm really surprised about this rare gem!

This is not a film about race or the differences in race or the difficulties of adjusting to living in a new country, it's not trying to say anything about the immigration system it's just telling a story that happens to involve new immigrants to a country, saying this is a commentary on immigration is like saying Jaws is a commentary on water safety or Die Hard 2 is a commentary on airport security.This film is a supernatural horror about the desperate things that people will do to survive and the consequences of those actions, and it's one of the most entertaining horrors I've seen for a while with some genuinely unsettling scenes, I can only hope people don't dismiss it because of a few ignorant reviewers who see imaginary agendas whenever there are black characters leading a film.8/10"}, {"id": 216, "text": "There are so many terrible films, particularly in the horror genre, on Netflix at the moment. This is not one of them. All the horrors I've watched recently are either far too dumb, or too far the other way - relying on being artsy or having powerful imagery but sacrificing a satisfying story. This one gets it just right. It is genuinely intriguing but leaves you with a resolution. There are layers of interpretation, but also a nice clear cut story.I found for a good part of the film I thought it was just a theme of asylum seeking; a couple fleeing something bad and arriving at a not-beautiful side of Britain, with the man trying to adjust to a new culture and then woman conversely holding onto her roots, all through the narrative of an apparently haunted house. The pair being explicitly warned that they might be sent back if they made any trouble, or didn't integrate properly, emphasised this theme. But it turned out to be about something quite different - something I can't really say without giving away the plot substantially. It could have been based on anyone with a past, and the fact that the main characters were refugees worked well for the narrative but was not the entire theme.It was well cast and very well acted, which is not actually all that typical in many films being streamed at the moment. Matt Smith is in it but as a side character: they don't try to force him into it beyond his welcome just to exploit the well known name; also refreshing. He is good in his part, but the two leads are allowed to shine.I'm not much of an artistic critic but I felt they built and maintained the atmosphere brilliantly. I can't even tell you if it was visuals or score or lighting or whatever because I'm not the type of audience to dissect that - I just know it gripped me and took me with it emotionally. The tension is good and there were jump scares that work well. Personally I can't stand a film that's just reliant on jumpy moments or gore and lacks any actual substance. This, to me, gives the best of all worlds. And when it ended I felt genuinely glad I'd watched it, and watched it to the end.Honestly this little film buried far below the (poorer quality) netflix recommendations was a very positive surprise for me and I would definitely recommend watching."}, {"id": 217, "text": "The horrors that asylum-seekers have to put themselves through when meshed with a haunted house storyline is what we get in Netflix's His House. Bol (Dirisu) and Rial (Mosaku) are refugees fleeing their war-torn country of Sudan; they brave bullets, rough waters, and even lose their daughter as they finally arrive in Britain where they're granted probational asylum. They're temporarily moved into a shabby, crumbling house in the London suburbs, and that's when the past begins to haunt them.His House is a pretty strong directorial debut from Remi Weekes, who has also written the screenplay. It may just be a 93-minute film, however, His House manages to dive equal parts deep into the struggles of immigrants as well as survivor guilt. While Bol tries to blend in with the new surroundings (he sings football anthems at bars, changes his attire, and prefers to use tables while eating), Rial holds firmly onto their culture (she wears their daughter's necklace, dresses in vibrant colors, and sits on the floor while eating).The scares, the greatest thing about horror films, are well-conceived. Weeks mixes jumpscares with more atmosphere-heavy ones in an effort to keep viewers on edge. Practical and visual effects are put to solid use in these sequences, though some fare better than others. A little inspiration has been drawn from films like The Conjuring and Lights Out, in a good way. Weekes, through some effective crafting that blur the lines between fantasy and reality, elevates His House beyond the conventional haunted house movie.Not everything works though. The final act switches horror for a somewhat predictable twist, and while the closing frames make for a powerful set of metaphors, it feels slightly sketchy from a closure standpoint. The performances are good for a film that revolves mostly around two (or three, if you include the beast) characters - Dirisu and Mosaku showcasing credible, lived-in feats."}, {"id": 218, "text": "Well... I was lucky enough to watch this movie at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival (internet). I am a big fan of horror films and this movie definitely delivers. The story is one that blends very well the horrors that many refugees face along with the manifestations of the terrors they bring. Often times the most scariest stories are those that deal with the non supernatural.More specifically, the movie is actually logical and doesn't fall for the classic tropes. In many scary movies that deal with a haunted house, I ask myself Why don't they just move?!?!?! but in this case they can't because they're placed in these specific, confining circumstances in order to get their asylum granted. I was also a fan of how the film portrays the female character as the strong, cool and collected wife while it's the husband who quickly descends into madness.Overall, I encourage everyone to watch this movie when it comes out on Netflix Turkiye."}, {"id": 219, "text": "As my parting shot to the Halloween season, I give you a horror film that mostly eschews the usual tropes to concentrate on two good human beings terrified by their country's turmoil and their own familial loss. Scary it is a bit; searing it is much in its commentary on current societal guilts.You've not seen a haunted house tale like this one. The ghoul is less ghoulish than emblematic and the residents haunted by their past more than their Stephen King-like ghostly resident. Brimming with commentary on refugees and loss, Remi Weekes' His House is a thinking person's thrilling scare and cultural relevance.Bol (Sope Dirisu) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) flee from war-torn South Sudan, losing their daughter in the sea, and are given a home in London by the Brit social system. They aren't allowed to leave their new home, and thus they must endure the torments of a creature that may have followed them to torture them, Babadook-style, about their alien status and responsibility for their daughter's drowning.While the ghost makes sounds and actually talks at times, writer/director Weekes centers the story on the protagonists themselves-Bol's guilt and Riel's motherhood. The jump scares are few but the menace all the more harrowing because of the mental torture. Weekes masterfully displays the couple's loneliness through shots of a hollow home and bleak, vacant outdoors. He also quietly shows through flashbacks the grim remembrance of a ravaged country and a lost daughter.As refugees, Rial and Bol are appropriate examples of good people caught in compromising situations they seem to have no control over. In that way, Weekes has given the audience a realistic heads-up about the challenges of immigration and the plight of unfortunate parents upended by war and fate.This thriller at a hairy time of year does double duty competently scaring and responsibly commenting. His House becomes our house of the mind and the world, now and forever. On Netflix"}, {"id": 220, "text": "I'll jump straight into it.

The acting was good from all involved and it built suspense really well also.What I didn't enjoy was that I thought it was a bit dull at times. Long dream sequences you knew full well were dreams and, because of this I felt slightly disengaged from the film. Sticking with the theme of the dream sequences, some of them I just didn't understand at all.

I couldn't stop thinking my god maybe some of people who came to my city saw this kind of horror and I judge them.Then the moment when main actress wakes up in, I guess a school in Sudan. It was horrible. Made so real. Director did great job to show us what it means to see this. It is a moment that happens, a lot, for real.

However, that beginning and that ending feel like they are from two different movies. It's quite unfortunate that it made me feel that way because I do think that there is a lot of things that this movie gets right.Let's start with the first half of the movie. What I would consider the horror half. This film began very quickly and left very little time for the viewer to get situated. The first 45 minutes were indeed very scary, and I was drawn to the screen. But what made that first half so great, was that it didn't just rely on the usual horror tropes. His House explored themes of racism and all the other challenges that refugees face. These issues were explored in a way that caused tension even outside of the house that works as the centrepiece of the story. Another aspect that created its own horror was distrust and challenges of marriage. This film managed to create an atmosphere of constant terror and tension, and I, for one, really liked it.The second half, however, moves into a completely different direction. What started as a pure horror film, shifts more and more into a drama as the run time moves towards its end. The horror changes from the typical haunted house style more into creature horror. That's also where the movie stopped being scary for me. I have never found creature horror to be particularly scary and this film didn't change that. I do realize that that is a personal problem, and most people will probably find the second half to be nearly as scary as the first one. But it's not just the normal horror stuff that changes. The two aforementioned aspects of immigration and marriage are almost completely forgotten about. And it is quite unfortunate that this is the case. I felt that they added so much to this movie and made it more than just another haunted house film.With that being said, I did like the second half nearly as much as I liked the first one. His House end up becoming a rather touching drama by the time it finishes. And if it forgot about the challenges of immigration and marriage, it replaced it with the conundrum of whether to leave ones home country in the first place. Although a new home promises a better life, is that always going to be the reality?There is a lot to like about His House. I think that it fantastically approached horror by making it about more than just jump scares and a scary atmosphere. I also liked that it was a haunted house film that didn't take place in an abandoned mansion. And, I also liked the second half with everything it had to offer. The thing that lessened my excitement was the fact that I felt like I ended up watching two different films. Had there been more cohesion between the two halves, I'm certain that I would've liked this film quite a bit more."}, {"id": 223, "text": "Already in the trailer she looked sinister and did not disappoint. Full of terror, on the one hand the story of a haunted house or rather ghosts, since that concept is used of saying that ghosts do not inhabit the house but that they inhabit us, on the other the drama of the refugees, which is also horror. A Sudanese couple escapes from the war in their country and lose their daughter in the process of fleeing to England, after a time detained they are transferred to a dilapidated but spacious house where they can rebuild their lives. It will not take long to realize that they are haunted by terrifying presences, a masked child brandishing a knife and a witch (according to the cast but in the translation he is named as a witch) who asks for a blood sacrifice to bring back to the life to the minor. Terribly gloomy, it appeals to the atmospheric heaviness and the social and family drama that adds to the share of terror, plus successful moments that make the hairs on the back of the neck stand up (be it the clich\u00e9 of the genre or what refers to the tragedy of the refugees). Compact, original and as ominous as it is simple, they have in the performances of the Nigerian Wunmi Mosaku (Fantastic Beasts, Batmans vs Superman, Luther) and the British Sope Dirisu (The Hunter and the Ice Queen, Humans) one of the high points of the film. Also appears Matt Smith (Dr Who, Charlie says) and when not playing amorphous bicharraco the Spanish Javier Botet (It, Mara, Polaroid, Slender Man, Insidius 4, The mummy, Alien Covenant). An intelligent terror very close to Get Out (2017), not far from the conventions of the genre but without the rubbish of a serial killer reaching teenagers.Detail: both protagonists participated in Black Mirror in 2016 but in different episodes."}, {"id": 224, "text": "His House is simply excellent! It's really hard to categorize as simply just a horror film as well because this film has so much going on under the surface. All in all, it plays out as more of a psychological drama than it does a horror film.Shedding light on a unique underrepresented perspective of refugees seeking asylum, this film has it all, great acting, a well constructed plot that coincides with the philosophical message it conveys, a subtle social commentary on immigrants and discrimination, and of course horror elements that take an interestingly artsy and stylistic approach to the predictable pattern we've come to expect from the haunted house genre. With sequences that place our protagonist in dreamlike fantasies stemmed from tragic events of his past, this film refuses to be confined to traditional ideas in terms of its haunts. There is also something to be said about the candor the film has about its own plot, the characters seem to know exactly what is happening to them and why, this is echoed through a couple of my favorite of Riel's conversations, one with her husband and one with Mark their case worker. The mystery for the audience becomes about the tragedies of their past rather than what is haunting them. This is a bold move because in doing this I will say the second half of the story looses a bit of its suspense but at the same time remains completely unpredictable.The second act that reveals the source of the couples harbored angst, although placed in reality, is arguably more horrifying than all the scares that lead up to it. It is sure to be the scene that sticks with you long after the creepy ones fade. Although the atrocities are still there, after this turn in the film there is a shift in mood away from traditional horror which is why I would recommend this movie to anyone not just fans of the genre. My one criticism would be that the end scene was a bit anticlimactic in my opinion but it doesn't take away from the story overall and that should not deter anyone from seeing this film. It honestly has to be my favorite horror film of the year probably because like I said before it packs in many themes and such a deep message. It's a story about coming to terms with guilt, shame and loss that is told more through a horror lens than it is horror at its core. This is sure to be a future classic."}, {"id": 225, "text": "'His House (2020)' follows a refugee couple who are moved into their new urban home and struggle to adjust to their new life, thanks - in no small part - to the otherworldly presence that lurks within their home. It's a film steeped in subtext, a marriage of genre and theme that creates an incredibly cohesive experience. Though it makes several missteps and is often too heavy-handed for its own good, the affair is compelling throughout and succeeds in pretty much everything it attempts. Its two leads do a fantastic job of portraying the terror of their situation, trapped in a haunted house and expected to be thankful for it. They have two distinct ideas about how best to proceed and this conflict makes for an interesting dynamic that allows the piece to explore its central issue even more fully, both on a literal and metaphorical level. Whether or not its horrors are 'real' is, ultimately, irrelevant; the movie's spooky events work just as well either way. They're a reflection of both the characters' inner conflict and outward situation, an intriguing and effective way of exploring how these things feel rather than how they are. These suspense sequences are atmospheric and intense, only occasionally tipping into potentially silly territory. As it moves towards its conclusion, the thing gets a bit more overt than it perhaps ought to (visually, at least). However, it sticks the landing thanks to its complex and satisfying final message. The overall experience feels oddly important, in a way. It empathetically delves into an underexplored situation, funnelling each and every one of its genre elements through this in an affecting and resonant way. It isn't perfect, but it's a gripping and distinct affair throughout. 8/10"}, {"id": 226, "text": "His House dwells deeper in a broadly spread subject matter.

Setting up an emotional barrier around the premise; effectively foreshadowing other horror elements.Although there was room for improvements. We barely see any cognitive explanations for the supernatural occurences that take place. Nor any befitting insights into their pre habitat or the violent consequences they faced in the past. Apart from our two main characters, others didn't really have much of a screentime to reinstate their presence.In conclusion, the film took an unconventional route as a Horror project; indulging itself into various socio-political affairs.

They live with you. It's when I let them in, I could start to face myself.His House is about a refugee couple that make a harrowing escape from war-torn South Sudan, but then they struggle to adjust to their new life in an English town that has an evil lurking beneath the surface. As a horror piece, this had the elements to make an effective experience. Storytelling is where it stands out. The premise is based off of a story from their background. There's a long monologue that tells it all in a great way. What it also utilizes is the fact of passing down stories from culture and generation. Going back into our characters' past lives furthers the experience. It's less of a dramatic past but more of a horror story of war and loss. A scene that captures a war zone experience is one of the best action scenes out there. Between the agony and how the scene is filmed, I couldn't have wished for a better directed scene. I don't know the story behind writer/director Remi Weekes but this must be a personal story for him to tell. Above all this is a story of what refugees must face after their given sanctuary.Actors Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku really did well. They're a great duo together and the essence of their character are portray perfectly. You wonder if what they are seeing is real or just a product of PTSD. What I found most interesting is the complex they live in. It's a character itself. As it's torn apart slowly, it doesn't just look great but also is done with purpose. Another scene uses the deteriorating walls to transition into a war zone. Everything is all meaningful. That's what makes this movie good. Sometimes I wish it could be just a little better. This is a more personal note for me but I wasn't always the most interested in what was happening. I appreciated everything but the slow paced scenes didn't always keep my attention.

With even the horror movies trying to push the envelope like Hereditary often having major technical flaws, this movie despite some drawbacks, truly feels like a professional job, not only in its production but truly in its writing. It feels neither by the numbers nor without a basic sense of prudence in its structuring.Get ready for some cheesy visuals but that is only a cosmetic aspect of the movie. This is one of those supernatural horror movies that tries to have a very human terror at its centre as very well developed characters have to deal with their personal figurative demons in a very material way.Sure, some will insist its all some kind of metaphor like how they insisted that The Babadook was really about depression and you can take that angle if you like but the story stands on its own two feet without the need to pull at too much subtext.With its slight, chill atmosphere in a stagnating corner of my homeland, the sense of dread almost never quite leaves us as our two main characters deal not only with the unknown menace but with that curious omnipresence of the authorities and no matter how good our intentions, it's hard to not feel like a criminal. You cannot tell me that they weren't going for a racism theme.Seriously, that candle terrified me. I'm not kidding.I never know what to say about acting except it's amazing here. Matt Smith is memorable but he doesn't manage to quite steal the show.This is one of those movies that confronts us with some of the very worst humanity has to give and can experience and although there are indeed wrong notes in there horror is hard and one feels that a lot of passion went into this and it truly does respect its audience."}, {"id": 229, "text": "The best way to describe this is 'a BBC drama about refugees relocating to London...sprinkled with a bit of horror'.The recipe is:Take 1kg of 'Insidious', mix in a bowl with 250g of 'Lights Out'...and then garnish with a tablespoon of 'Hotel Rwanda'.

It is more or less billed as a horror movie. It would be more accurate to call it a drama horror, though. The horror is literal and visceral if you want to watch it that way; but, more interestingly, it is allegorical and even political. At its heart, this is a movie about the horrors faced by people forced to flee genocide, and the resultant trauma they carry with them through having to make impossible choices, including having to assimilate into another culture at the expense of one's own selfhood and culture.Don't get me wrong: this movie has some traditional and extremely creepy, scary moments, especially in the middle third. It does function well as a horror movie.

Even when the female character asks for directions while mispronouncing words, she speaks perfect English the entire film.The stero typical racial differences are also very distracting from the political message they want to send (more on that later). It seems that they desperately wanted our sympathy, but didn't want to put in the work to build up their character.The political message they try to convey is simply unclear and very poorly visualized. They move from one time and place to another and it's unclear how it alles fits together.The sound effects are heavily overused; there is often more sound than image and it often used in overkill to keep the viewer interested. That being said, the overuse of jump scares is also a very desperate attempt to get the viewer in their grip. This should not be the kind of movie that should have to rely on these easy ways to scare the viewer.The visual effects were OK, but also overused and you could definitely witness the early days of a young visual effects creator, using everything he has in his tool belt to how off his recent skills. The director should have known the time and place for this better.My most important observation was the idea that this film borrowed a LOT of elements from other horror films, but copied them without any real original tone of voice. They just wanted a quick way to bootstrap their movie and sell a decent trailer, which is simply disappointing.The ending, which I will not reveal, because there is not much to spoil, is just blurry, plain and not quite as thought provoking as the film leads up to. You turn off the tv with an awful font for the end credits and think to yourself well, that's one and a half movie that I won't get back....The acting of most characters was OK. I hope this film may lead to more roles, but I think their talents were underused; they could have easily carried his film more, instead of relying on cheap computer effects.In summary, this movie seems like a long short, one that was stretched to an hour and a half in order to be used by Netflix and add to their large stack of average-quality films."}, {"id": 232, "text": "A couple fleeing tribal violence find refuge in Britain, but their nightmare doesn't end there.Complex characters in a finely tuned horror - strictly for adults!

It does raise the expected issues, but doesn't hammer them home, instead leaving us with their texture while the characters get drawn deeper into a mysterious terror. The performances are excellent, as the couple move together and apart, each absorbing in their own way the malevolence that stalks them. The emotional high comes in an accusation during dinner, with the couple truly at odds with their predicament and themselves.I prefer my demons introduced gradually, so while the director sustains the sense of hallucination, he does get a bit ahead of himself on the visuals. This blunts the suspense, and in the climax he goes too big on CGI. That's my preference, and I found much of the imagery startling, with some ghoulish touches out of Africa, plus a superb dream scene bang in the middle, followed by several atmospheric episodes. The sound design is subtle, which may leave the jump scares underpowered, and the orchestrated music only comes in later, finishing with a gorgeous choir.About halfway through I was delighting in the sophistication of the screenwriting - however, by the end me not so happy. The reveal genuinely confused me over whether there was one crucial character, or two. And if it was just one, doesn't that muddy the wife's motivation? It was the bus scene that made me think, Hang on ..., so maybe I'll get satisfaction on another viewing.

A witc is in the house.Sounds great but it's a lot about blah blah and now and then indeed some zombiefied people appear and masked ones.Was I scared, not one bit. Was it creepy, not at all but the effects used were okay and the zombiefied ones were well done.But still, towards the end I was just waiting for it to be over. Not that much of horror to see after all. Not for me this one.

But the story is shallow as it tries something new and direction is dull and bleak that does make it difficult to sit through.The plot is about a couple who was able to escape from an hostile country in Africa. Able to get shelter in England with a probation period to pass through the immigration laws. They move into a house. Until they begin experiencing some haunting noises and sightings.There is more to the plot without giving away spoilers which focuses on the couple and there tragic losses they dealt with escaping.The film does have several creepy and scary moments that will get your adrenaline going when the couple run into ghostly figures or strange sightings.The performances were decent with the cast ensemble. The direction is also decent which feels shallow and could have been so much more. While it feels forgettable to any other horror movie."}, {"id": 240, "text": "Yes, I know Halloween was last week and I am late with this review but better late then never so here is my review for the new Netflix Horror Film His House. The premise of the film sees a refugee couple arrive in the UK but struggle to adapt to new life.Main Character Sope Dirisu who did a great job on Gangs Of London plays the main character here and once again he does a great job, he delivers a strong performance that makes you interested in his character. He just does a good job as a lead male in a horror film, there isn't much else to explain without spoilers just that he is really good.Supporting Characters Wunmi Mosaku who was on Lovecraft Country, though I didn't care much for her character Ruby, also does a great job here. Her and Dirisu have a great dynamic and actually it very well could be argued that she is the protagonist of the film and the moral centre. She does a great job here and adds plenty to her role and the film that you are watching. Matt Smith has a small role here and he does a good job when on screen, he doesn't take away from the film by being in it too much and actually adds plenty to the film and his relationship with the two leads works well.Story The story is good, especially in the last act for me. There is a twist in the movie that made it way more interesting for me and by holding off on it the reveal felt more impactful, also just the feeling of the surroundings was done well and made you feel stuck in this place with the couple. Though I will say that the first like 30 mins are fine but a bit slow, you aren't really given much in terms of plot and it feels a bit like it is moving through the numbers but it does pick up as it goes on.Script The script is okay, it creates a tense filled atmosphere and helps develop its characters to make them interesting. There is some decent dialogue here but nothing particularly memorable and no real moments to rise it above other horror films.Style The film does a good job of unnerving the audience and the characters, it relies on tension building instead of jump scares (mostly) which makes it more scary in my opinion. The film also is only 90 mins which is a good thing because any longer would have been too long, though I will say the pacing isn't quite there as I mentioned in the story section as to why it holds the film back.Overall Overall, this is a strongly acted tension filled horror film that is a good watch. It isn't going to change the horror movie genre but if you like horror films and have 90 mins free then I would say it is worth a go."}, {"id": 241, "text": "Our two, grievous Black leads, Bol and Rial, are anything but strong when separated. Power comes in pairs, and it's a lesson viewers come to define as they watch the two toil through the muck and the piss to keep each other in close arms.His House rather chooses to express the mentality of guilt and sorrow over subtle flashes of horrific figures, clips filmed in total darkness, and simple but effective music that works to keep you at the edge of your seat. Not too many jumpscares with this one, and it's just the perfect movie for a cryptic Saturday night. You'll feel an ease with the theme and be invited to explore the world of struggling refugees after harsh times learning to adapt in modern society with European fellows. Overcome the horrid dredges of Fear and submit to Love, but keep in mind that you cannot hide your true self from another's peering gaze.THE GOOD: Wonderful theme that mixes well with our plot and mingles exceptionally within the cast. THE BAD: N/A THE UGLY: Movie falls apart in the last 8 minutes. A terrible Hollywood-esque ending serves to resolve conflict."}, {"id": 242, "text": "Exploring themes of grief, trauma, immigration, assimilation, remorse &amp; acceptance through a horror lens, His House is a haunting &amp; harrowing depiction of the refugee experience and, in addition to capturing their inward &amp; outward struggle in adjusting to new life in new place, also delivers as a thrilling &amp; effective haunted house chiller.Written &amp; directed by Remi Weekes, the film blends character drama &amp; genre thrills into one finely layered narrative and holds nothing back when unleashing the terror that dwells within the walls of their new home. While there are times when the story becomes perplexing, everything adds up &amp; makes sense once the full picture of the characters' backstory is revealed.The atmosphere within the rundown residence is palpably tense &amp; often unsettling, and though Weekes relies on jump scares to frighten the viewers, most of them do work out in the film's favour. Wunmi Mosaku &amp; Sope Dirisu play the young refugee couple seeking asylum after escaping their war-torn homeland, and they both chip in with performances that are credible, grounded &amp; convincing.Overall, His House is a welcome entry in the world of horror and also marks a solid debut for Remi Weekes' directorial career. The proper care with which he sketches the characters' troubled past, vulnerable present &amp; uncertain future, and brings it in sync with the immigrant issues gives his picture a relevant touch &amp; relatable appeal. One of the better horror entries in Netflix canon, His House is certainly worth a shot."}, {"id": 243, "text": "I bet you might not know what this film is but it is the breakout film from Remi Weekes and it is a pretty good breakout film.His House is about two black refuges named Bole (Sope Dirisu) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) get released from a war in South Sudan. They end up in a house that has a evil presence waiting for them.His House was a film that completely surprised me. I had no idea that this film was coming out but it was definitely worth my time. It is a film that is a little hard to find now. Must films are just gory and forget about the scary part of the film. This film remembered to be scary. I am not saying that films should never have any bit of blood in them but I am just saying, if you make a horror film, make it scary. This film did just that. The story was the key aspect of this film as is most. Th background that they created for the characters really helped you feel for the characters. They also did this thing were you didn't always know if the the scene that they were showing you was a dream or if it was real. That really helped make the film pretty freaky. That was also the films disadvantage. The end of the film had way too many of those scenes and it messed with your brain the way it shouldn't. It was confusing at the end not knowing if it was really happening. That was the only flaw of His House. Otherwise the story was wonderfully crafted.The acting was the best of the year. The two main characters were executed marvelously. Sope Dirisu hasn't been in anything else I have seen but he gave a fantastic performance in this film. Wunmi Mosaku has been in some big films like Batman Vs. Superman and Fantastic Beasts. She didn't really have much to do in those films but she was in them. She sort of gave a little bit of a creepy performance. Both of the leads did fantastic jobs. Matt Smith was also in this film as as a guy who was checking on them every week or so to see how they were doing in the new house. He didn't have much to do and did good when he was on screen. Overall, the acting was pretty good.This film used practical effects a lot. It was a genius idea that worked to the films advantage. It looked 100 percent better than just putting glossy computer generated images in there. Some of the practical effects reminded me of the Pans Labyrinth. Especially at the end.I would really love to see more films like His House in the next couple of years. The only problem with the film is a little bit of a shaky ending. Besides that I would recommend this film to any movie fan."}, {"id": 244, "text": "What is left behind is a horror film with a great construction and development of characters and plot, we have a contained horror that permeates the work that goes beyond the supernatural, we have a social horror that works very well during the work, even if this aspect is explored in a light and often subjective way.The script, which tells the story of a refugee couple who flees to England, and in his new life needs to deal with prejudice, with social phobia and with the pain and regret of having lost a child in the crossing, the film is full of small mishaps and details that complement his work, such as the exploration of the culture of Sudan and the religiosity that mixes the psyche of traumas of the couple.The direction of Remi Weeks is very good, the director knows how to build tension very well, without resorting to sound effects or cheap scares, here the fear is real, it is built and grows throughout the work, the film also has a beautiful photograph, which contrasts well the gray of england with a yellowish palette of sudan.The performances, both by Wummi Mosaku and Sope Dirisu are great, both deliver characters full of quirks and with many dimensions, some explored and others are more on the surface, it is also worth mentioning the house where almost the entire film unfolds, we have a great scene composition and an aversion climate very well given the residence.What was left behind is not a perfect film, we have a rhythm problem that bothers the viewer and we also have a third act very triggered by the rest of the work, but overall we have a great film. NOTE 8/10"}, {"id": 245, "text": "Initial Thoughts: I did not find this film to be a politically motivated film, however, it does pull from that streamline with refugees being the focal point. I felt the story to be absolutely compelling. The undertone for me showed that adjusting to a new place, a new land can be difficult, and strenuous. This film pulls from that and then adds a cultural lore that adds to the intensity. The evil of His House is slowly pieced together with shadows, whispers, and patience. Eventually everything is brought to a front that comes to a death-defying end, but eventually brings about it, some peace as well.The two leads were strong together and in their own ways. They brought the intensity and calmness of each situation to a story, as I said above, was already strong.Lastly, the cinematography was spot on. Everything was fluid, from steady camerawork to near perfect effects, this film was fun to watch.Overall: If you haven't had the chance to watch this film. I would definitely recommend it. Especially if you enjoy thriller films that offer a hearty meal instead of cheapness to just get a scare.Enjoy the show!"}, {"id": 246, "text": "'His House' is a fine horror film with interesting shots and imagery overall.Other reviewers (bot accounts with only one positive review of this film, as always) mention that there is a twist in this film, but there's not. They also state that this film is amazing, but it's not that either.The 'twist' can be seen after the first 10 minutes of the film, and the ending, while not being anything original, was still ok.There were also some cool scary shots and nice surrealistic imagery, but sometimes the CGI was taking me out of the film.In terms of storytelling, there's not that much to work with, the whole film can be summed up in 4-5 sentences. Our family duo is overcoming their fears, and...that's pretty much all. There's also Matt Smith in this, but he's just sort of there. And there also was a neighboring lady that had 2 sentences in the film.Besides some social commentary and lots of victimization attempts and wishful thinking, there's nothing more of note. Lines like They will send you back to die like the ****ards always do and some more bashing on Europeans, as well as further pushing of an idea that if there is a military conflict on your territory, then people all over the world owe you something.P.S. Was nice to see Javier Botet wearing full-body make-up again :)"}, {"id": 247, "text": "His House is far from a traditional horror and will certainly not appease viewers looking for a movie that follows the Haunted House status quo.The concept was good. Following an African refugee couple who have fled turmoil in their homeland only to find an all new horror that awaits them within their temporary accommodation.His House has a slight art-house feel with good tone setting that reminded me of The Babadook. But it moves too quickly to the revelation, physically, of what torments (or will torment) the lead couple. It didn't build any real suspense and because of that the scares fall flat. A shame because it could've been truly terrifying.And this is the issue with the whole movie. The pacing is off. Too slow where it could move more swiftly, which ultimately diminished the scenes where suspense could be utilised to ramp up fear.I was rooting for His House and I can see why some have opted for the higher ratings. But for me it felt like a great opportunity missed. A genuinely compelling concept let down by below par execution.The twist is not so much a twist. More an explanation for the presence within the house. The final scene is swift but good. A simple but well shot piece.I would recommend fans of cerebral horror give it a try. I didn't feel my time was wasted. It just didn't quite fulfill the early promise."}], "reviews_amount": 248}
