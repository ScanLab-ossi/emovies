I saw Blumhouse and I saw Phylicia Rashad and I thought ok, lets do.I was pulled in from the beginning and was interested in trying to figure out what was wrong with this guy. By the time the twist happened, I had figured out most of it, but I still couldn't turn away and wanted to see how it ended. I thought overall the movie was satisfying. If you're a perfectionist, I probably wouldn't bother with this because the writing was a little choppy and you might have to suspend disbelief to suspend disbelief, but it's really not a bad flick."}, {"id": 1, "text": "A good thriller movie with new story. But there is nothing horror in this movie. Movie is bit slow but not boring. Climax was not that good and could have been improved."}, {"id": 2, "text": "If you like Black Mirror you'll probably enjoy this. Wouldn't classify this as horror but more sci-fi, drama. The acting is superb."}, {"id": 3, "text": "A well acted and well cast movie with a good pace. Phylicia Rashad is a stand out and really helps the story along. It's difficult to write too much without giving away any spoilers and the minor mistakes in the plot consistency are easily overlooked as you want the story to continue.Not enough of a thinking movie or a thriller/mystery to get an 8 or 9 but a good watch in any case."}, {"id": 4, "text": "So apparently there's this guy who has some severe memory problems and he's somehow got custody of his daughter still. His little girl has to remind him of just about everything.So, he knows a neurologist, who connects him with another neurologist who wants to hook him up to some experimental therapy. To first access his memories through hypnosis, and then by hooking up some device she created, the Black Box.He starts seeing some weird stuff in his 'memories' . They make a point of stressing how he was NOT A FIGHTER.. Oh so come to find out, he's not even the father of the little girl. He's a different person entirely, who has been uploaded into a different body!Then when he goes to visit his REAL family....he comes across as quite the a$$. His former wife, conks him over the head.+1 Star for his wife conking him over the head....He's losing time. I think that his scientist mother has overwritten another guy's mind. And yeah that's what happened. OG dude is still in there. They are fighting for control over the mind and body.His memory coming back he has a choice. Preserve himself or the other guy. He remembers that he was an abusive husband. As opposed to the other guy who is really a good father.I thought the end was a bit too convenient. Convenient that the friend and little girl showed up just in time. The movie was okay. But still just okay.6/10"}, {"id": 5, "text": "It starts slow and confusing in the beginning.

He visits a neuroscientist doctor who tries to put him in a machine to revisit his memories. Except he is unaware of these memories.It was a boring plot that was done before with the concept idea. The script and direction does not do anything new. The music score is tedious. The characters are forgettable. It lacks suspense and scares for a psychological horror film. There is a couple of twists which did not disappoint with the direction it goes. But it has been done before and better than this film."}, {"id": 7, "text": "A mediocre film, but a worthwhile reminder that when the ability to electronically preserve consciousness is perfected, it will mainly only be used by unethical psychopaths to preserve the consciousness of other unethical psychopaths; a pertinent milestone in the wickedness of humanity."}, {"id": 8, "text": "The only saving grace is Phyllicia Rashaad.

Not a horror movie, more of a sci fi thriller. Think poor man's Jacob's Ladder and you're partially there.

It'll pass the time but it won't be memorable."}, {"id": 14, "text": "This was a terrific thriller. There were some really endearing characters - relatable, sympathetic as well as the easy to hate type. The story was solid with ample twists to keep you wondering what the hell is going on! And a few scary moments that added nicely to the creepiness. The acting was really good - but of course it would be, Phylicia Rashad starred. I just loved it - the story was well written and thought out. It was really enjoyable and entertaining. Bravo to all involved. **SPOILER ALERT** This updated twist on the mad scientist story was excellent and unexpected. So what I didn't get the whole medical, techno how the good doctor made this happen. It was about the concept and the follow through that was so well done. Lastly, I couldn't help but to notice that many of the actors have African names. Yes! It is about time."}, {"id": 15, "text": "The whole cast is excellent the story though done before is excellent, it keeps you watching and you're never bored. It does its job, its entertaining!!

The explanation of the technology is not an explanation at all.

And I didn't really feel her character was realistic at all. The kid was cute but also unrealistic in how you'd behave when you lost your mum and your dad has amnesia. It was funny how the guys friend shut him down all the time when he was trying to make a point about what he saw.I enjoyed the movie a bit because I found it quite amusing towards the end.I think by the end there was nowhere else to go with it but unveil the things we guessed.Black mirror has interesting characters with explanations of potential technologies that massively stretch the imagination but are well executed so as to feel somehow possible and leave you pondering about what could be in the future ahead.

This movie is under rated and definitely deserves to be rated higher than 6."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Black Box could easily have been an episode of Black Mirror, a compliment given the quality of that series.It's a slow burn until the big twist arrives mid-film and then things get much more interesting. Like Black Mirror, it touches on some heady topics along the way including loss, abuse, and the sense of self.At first I was turned off by lead actor Mamoudou Athie's performance which was so wooden to be a turn-off. But when you view his character from the perspective of the entire story, it makes sense.Blumhouse is clearly looking to branch out from its horror roots. Science fiction looks like a promising genre given the excellent Upgrade and The Invisible Man."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Proving that budget is merely one ingredient, and not the most important, this story is engaging, unpredictable, thrilling -- as good stories are.

The first twenty minutes was a bit slow and boring, in my opinion. The young daughter seems a bit too educated and mature for her age and the first 20 minutes mainly revolve around our main character Nolan, ava, and Gary. After meeting Dr Brooks, the movie will take you down an intricate maze of mysteries and discoveries that might have you questioning what's real and what's not.For a good 45-50 minutes, the movie had me entirely captivated. The ending is true blumhouse style which leaves you questioning and wanting more in a positive way.8/10.

I did expect more from Black Box though, at times it felt like a cheap TV movie and the ending is really not satisfying.

They've done it well.Even the ending, while I'm not 100% satisfied with it, was still good, this was their artistic choice and I get it.The scientific element is a tough pill to swallow, but if you're open to it, it's fine.The only out of place thing was the way the daughter was written, she's a little too mature in her dialogue and actions, but other than that - it's a good watch."}, {"id": 44, "text": "This is the first movie in YEARS that has had me caring for the lead.

Its a superb what if tale that says maybe we shouldn't do this, but I wish we could . This is an actor's movie with a good script and direction from Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour,Jr. and Stephen Herman.

It's good \ud83d\udc4d film and well worth viewing for everyone!"}, {"id": 46, "text": "So I really liked this movie. It's the classic major plot twist concept, but I really enjoyed this permutation. It has a pretty good dynamic between the characters, and sets up a good sympathetic villain. I think this would have been almost better position as a sci fi, the horror aspect is more suspenseful than scary, but the movie does a great job of keeping your interest and the payoff is there. Definitely worth a quarantine watch"}, {"id": 47, "text": "This is a pretty tight little movie: the writing, acting and direction are all solid and explore interesting ideas around the ethics of memory and identity. I think where it misses is in the attempts to bring in horror elements / visuals. It's not that they're bad necessarily, it's just that they seem more like a marketing attempt than something necessary to the plot and I think the movie would have been better without them."}, {"id": 48, "text": "A movie built around actors who created believable characters who told a captivating story from start to eerie finish."}, {"id": 49, "text": "Very Good movie!

Satisfying."}, {"id": 50, "text": "Can see why it has the horror genre tag but only slightly. The backwards man is a scary concept especially in your own subconscious, and I couldn't look in places.The premise excited me. The actress who played Ava was the stand out (so cute!) The guy who played Gary also deserves praise.The twist took a moment to sink in and it could be a little confusing in placing, but that is to be expected with the plot.

The main actor had no on screen charisma and neither did any of the others. I just didn't care what happened to any of them. The little girl gave the best performance.

I see a lot of people saying it really isn't a horror movie . I disagree . Horror doesn't always have to be slasher killers or ghosts and demons .

We've got grieving husbands, wives, friends, mothers, and children. Then we even get to see how the dead feel about being dead which is fun.I did like the twist, a lot actually, and I really enjoyed how nothing felt forced. For a movie with so many momentum changes, plot twists and emotional elements, it still seemed to flow smoothly. I thought the acting was good. There were only a few moments that I thought were out of place.Oh and uh, no, it wasn't very scary. It was a little sci-fi but definitely not horrific. Kind of a thriller... *Spolier here*My favorite part of this film was the end, when the two fathers were together. When Thomas realized Nolan was the ghoul he'd been running from, I was so happy. I already knew of course, but I loved Thomas's reaction. I have to say I enjoyed this movie because it did reflect on two types of families, two types of fathers and how their families manage grieving. I loved it when Thomas really realized that he was the problem in his family and that Nolan's family loved and needed him. Not to make this a race thing, but seeing an awesome and loving African American father is fantastic in film, additionally seeing another African American father who now realizes the error of his ways is great. Of course, all families have these issues but it felt good for me to see the representation.Overall, this film was very good.

Wow what a movie! I was truly surprised at how fantastic Black box was, there is so much good stuff to talk about here.My first few positives would be the interesting concept, real and unique relationships and likeable characters. And easy to connect with characters. The whole concept of implanting memories into a different human to me was really interesting and cleverly explored with genuine reasoning for this and compelling characters that we cared about. I also thought that the characters were real and had unique relationships making them easy to connect with. The movie had a very genuine and natural feel to it which I thought was great, the relationships were just like a normal day to day relationships for people watching so the movie felt very grounded which I loved, the relationship between the father and daughter was both unique and heart-warming but also heart-breaking, they had such a lovely bond and you could tell how close they were, but due to the fathers memory loss he just wasn't the same man he once was for his daughter, and to have her be so understanding and know what's going on was really interesting and well handled considering how young she was, due to this kind of relationship as well as the fathers relationship with his brother, it was so much easier to connect with their characters as they reflected real life issues and relationships.My next few positives would be the performances, cinematography, use of sound and Jumpscares. The performances in this movie all round were fantastic, Mamoudou Athie was absolutely fantastic in the lead role, he was charming and passionate and conveyed the characters condition in a believable and real way, the daughter played by Amanda Chrstine was also fantastic for a child actor she was just fantastic, had heaps of charm and charisma and delivered all of her scenes excellently, and a big shout out to Troy James for his role as the backwards man, his acrobatic/ contortionist abilities made the role terrifying and yet compelling to watch and he always does an excellent job in all of his roles. The cinematography here was also excellent, it was very unique and blended the beautiful landscapes and sets of the real world and contrasted it with the virtual reality world excellently for a very visually interesting movie. I also thought the use of sound was excellent, the usage of bones clicking and cracking created a very good uncomfortable tone thanks to Troy James, and the diegetic sound of the doctors voice when Nolan was in the different world was interesting and made you feel like you were part of the movie with his character, the use of sudden Jumpscares was also very effective, the movie didn't rely on Jumpscares because it didn't need to, but when they did have some they were executed very well and startled me on multiple occasions.My only two slight nitpicks would be the lack of detail to certain plot points and the slightly unsatisfying ending for the main character. There was just a slight lack of detail to Nolan's character that would have been nice to have a little bit more depth to it, little things like Nolan's job was only touched upon but never really felt significant, this is only me being slightly picky, I also wished they would of added slightly more to the end to make Nolan's character arc more satisfying, I wanted a little bit more of an emotional reunion between him and his daughter and a little bit more time spent on it, they had enough for it to be satisfying enough but a little bit more could have been added.My next few positives would be the balancing of tones, character background and emotional weight. I thought the movie balanced it's grounded and realistic tone with it's characters and relationships but also the very dark and scary tone of the imaginary world perfectly, neither were overused and balanced each other out very well, I also loved the character background despite the plot twist which we will talk about shortly the movie did a great job at making you understand the character and what Nolan's life was like before his accident that made you connect with his character and his relationships even more. The movie also had a surprising amount of emotional weight, due to how much I connected with the main character and his relationship with his daughter and brother I genuinely wanted him to be ok and to be able to be the man he used to be and when that payed off it was done extremely well and built up very well.My final few positives would be the plot twist, added stakes to the plot and the clever mystery about the reality of the plot and what was real. The movie did an absolutely excellent job at creating the mystery of what Nolan was thinking was real or not, I genuinely didn't know who was telling the truth so hats off to the movie for cleverly manipulating the audience and at least for me genuinely being confused as to what was going to happen, and on that note the plot twist was absolutely excellent and for me completely unexpected, the fact that the doctor implanted her dead sons memories into Nolan's brain, made the whole plot make sense as to why he was so different with his daughter, it was very cleverly done and added so much more stakes for the characters, and added to the well-executed dark tone.Overall despite just a couple of little nitpicks, black box is an absolutely fantastic movie, really taking me by surprise, balancing it's more grounded and realistic tone with genuine emotion and heartfelt relationships, with its surprisingly dark and uncomfortable tone for a perfect blend of the two."}, {"id": 80, "text": "More often than not I find my self irritated by unimaginative copycat movies.

The dynamic between father (Mamoudou Athie) and daughter (a terrific Amanda Christine, the true star of the film) is warmly established. It takes about an hour before the big (predictable) twist arrives, and thereafter, Black Box descends into a heap of melodrama. I didn't find Black Box positioning itself in the horror genre except for the first time the Backwards Man (played to astounding effect by actor-contortionist Troy James) pops up. It's very clearly a psychological sci-fi thriller that focuses less on the sci-fi and more on familial bonding.The performances (from the all-black ensemble) are good enough to drive the film forward even during its melodramatic portions, with Amanda Christine being the standout performer, followed closely by Phylicia Rashad (as Dr. Brooks). The film has most elements of a Blumhouse production and blurry parallels to Jordan Peele's Get Out can be drawn. However, once the initial uneasiness recedes, Black Box is content being a little sappy in its proceedings.

It's a unique and peculiar twisted vision from the likes of Blumhouse, which has a great premise, but doesn't always execute it as well as it could have. I'll start with this films flaws, for a number of reasons, this film ends up feeling a bit uneven. I won't spoil the whole twist of this film, you know a 'twist' is coming though as you watch it, and once it is revealed you can't help but feel a bit cheated out of the whole premise it set up. This alone accounts for the film feeling uneven for the last 1/3 or so, and also leads to a rather predictable finale which I knew almost exactly how it was going to play out. However, despite these flaws, the film does manage to capture the viewer's attention all the way throughout- by never giving up on the wonderfully mysterious and unsettling atmosphere it sets up from the very beginning. The acting is quite good, most notably from lead actor Mamoudou Athie, who provides a nearly incredible performance all the way throughout. Other standouts would include rising star Amanda Christine, Tosin Morohunfola, and Charmaine Bingwa. Phylicia Rashad's character feels a bit played out at times, as her character really serves no purpose other than a plot device, and a generic one at that. I enjoyed the cinematography in this flick, as well as the ominous tone and music it kept threw out. It never feels like more than one film, but you can't help but feel there was a far better way to tie this story together, rather than focus on something you truly aren't invested in, or even given much of a reason to. In the end, at its worst Black Box can be a bit of a structural mess, but its ideas and potential- as well as its phenomenal lead performances- lead this film to be quite enjoyable. It's an experience unlike any other, one you won't forget, but one you wish they would have spent just a little bit more thought on. My Rating: 7.25/10"}, {"id": 113, "text": "Black Box is the one of a first batch of movies made in partnership between Amazon Prime and Blumhouse productions, famed budget studio that specialises in making horror movies. Though by no means a bad film, I do wonder if that Blumhouse name might give people incorrect expectations about Black Box that may lead to disappointment.Six months after losing his wife in a car accident, Nolan (Mamoudou Athie) is struggling with memory issues related to the severe head trauma he received. This is impacting his ability to care for his daughter Ava (Amanda Christine), so he agrees to undertake an experimental therapy from leading specialist, Doctor Lillian Moore (Phylicia Rashad), which combines element of hypnosis and virtual reality. Exploring his own memories, Nolan comes under threat from an unrecognisable and barely human form.When I mention expectations, even in that synopsis it sounds like the movie is a horror film - and the character of backwards man, played by Troy James, who I've seen perform on The Flash, is certainly a creepy element. But beyond him, the film is more of a science fiction thriller, than it is a horror film - and that may disappoint some brought by the Blumhouse name. Away from that aspect, the film has the good sense to use its rather obvious twist well before the end, and then use that as an exploration point for the finale, rather than as the ending itself. That said, I thought overall the film was a little dull and struggled to full maintain my attention for the duration.However, it is the first feature for Writer/Director Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour and for screenwriter Stephen Herman and though, as I say, I thought the plotting was a little pedestrian, from a technical standpoint the film is pretty good. It often interesting to look at, and what visual effects the film has are nicely done. Mamoudou Athie is decent as the lead, a little bland at the start but that does begin to make sense as the film goes on.I have no massive regrets about watching it, but it was all just a little too mediocre to consider recommending it."}, {"id": 114, "text": "Really enjoyed the actors and some of the storyline. Somewhat of a different role for the great Phylicia Rashad (for those who have never seen her play the antagonist.) Had if it not been for them and the bits of clues they drop at the beginning, I probably would have stopped watching.Concept seemed to be a mixture of Get Out, Self/less and Replicas. The story is slow moving, but there are a few plot twists that make the slow pace more palatable, different and new.I would not categorize this movie as horror, because there was nothing really scary about it. It was more along the lines of mystery/sci-fi with a splash of suspense. In the words of my niece, It felt like a group of college film students came together to make a fan film inspired by their favorite movies, had all the equipment and actors they wanted, but did not have the experience to make it the film it could have been.The saving grace and the reason for the six star rating was that I could see the intention of the movie and Blumhouse's desire to do more than just straight horror.

Successfully grabbing my attention right away. I was so intrigued by the idea, a captivating concept anyway. With a fairly modest allowance, they indeed had a decent showing in regards to the visual effects. Using all those to their advantage depending upon the set requirements in a particular scene.The Soundscore had a certain melancholic tone attached to it, which I very much adored. Though not absolutely fluent in all its practices, the cinematography looked insipid. Shaky movements, weirdly panned frames; it consequently exposed an amateurish work behind the lens.Another gripe of mine would be the third act. Sailing smoothly before, just when it was about to enter final phase; it took a turn for the worse. The sudden change in tonality, with a convoluted writing; it strides away from its designated path. Undermining its substantial quality underneath.Although the same can't be said about the performances. Quite contrary to its inferior technicalities, All of the acts, each one retaining prominence of their own. If I were to pick one, Amanda Christine as Ava would be my preference.

One, I like it when they are nice and easy to understand. Even just on the surface, so that you don't feel like you need a degree to understand them. It's fine to have some deep levels of complexity under the surface, but for those who just want to watch the film and enjoy it for what it is - at least on the first viewing - to have things simple enough is very important. And secondly, I love when science-fiction combines itself with horror. There aren't huge quantities of that here, but just enough.The lead actor in this movie has an amazingly soothing voice. I'm not sure if that counts for anything or not, I simply had to get it out of my system. He does a decent job of putting the movie on his back and having enough charisma to carry it through. But this isn't really a film about star-power, it's far more about the story.The film let's itself down a bit at the end. It all gets a little clunky and chopped together. Also I wouldn't have minded seeing it take a more daring and memorable direction at the end.

There's a bit of a father daughter thing going on that grounds this in a more relatable way. Plus, the horror in this is interwoven in the story in a way that works. I can't say it's really scary or unique, as it does rip a lot of ideas from other things. I like that this is more of a drama then a horror movie. However, around the halfway point it takes a turn. There's a big reveal that completely shifts the movie. The first half is about a man trying to remember his past like in a typical amnesia driven plot. Then it shifts into something else. Which may work for some but it kind of turned me off towards it. It took a sympathetic main character and turned him into someone horribly unlikeable. It doesn't ruin the movie because the writting is decent and the performances are really good. Those two things carry a lot of this strange Get Out inspired thing. Other then that, the father daughter relationship is quite nice. I wish that was more developed in the second half.

I thought she did an excellent acting job.My main negative to this is that I feel like the film lacked a proper beginning. No backstory to the car crash or the characters. Felt like it was missing 10/15 minutes. If I hadn't read the bio on this I'd be way more confused. Although it was an interesting story I felt it fell a bit flat in areas. Long segments where little to nothing really happens of note.But on the whole I'm pretty pleased with my choice of film. Exceeded my expectations definitely.

The master horror director Jason Blum has combines traditional tropes with modern sensibilities. Something for everyone.Black Box has the creepy notion of transplanting brain waves to reconstruct consciousness from the dead to the living. The spine- tingling attraction is that while trying to create new life with old, (Mamoudou Athie as recently-comatose Nolan, aptly evoking thoughts of Christopher Nolan's memory-loss masterpiece, Memento), a new mind in a foreign body, a Frankensteinean doctor, Lillian (Phylicia Rashad) cannot expunge the errors of the previous life. She can't alter violent and dangerous traits residing in an active brain that may be quite a bit more macabre than the host.Yet, Black Box is a generally quiet scare, the best kind because it's the mind's memory that is orchestrating the imbalance, not a ghoulish scientist. In this case, she played the calming force on the Cosby Show, and ironically, we know what happened to Bill.However, Blumhouse is interested in family dynamics, the kind that turn a Thanksgiving feast into mayhem, at least figuratively, exploring the contradictions of love in all its potency. Blumhouse's Nocturne has the family mosaic in its complicated and sinister form.It's the early part of Black Box that has the most powerful ideas challenging the audience to like Nolan while disliking host Thomas. Similarly, Lillian manipulates Nolan's consciousness while the audience tries to figure out the good guys from the bad.It becomes a hot mess of identity and priorities. If our current election has your mind bent, then see Black Box to straighten it out when you realize that no human enterprise can be fully controlled or understood."}, {"id": 122, "text": "I've noticed a pattern of films with Black leads, and or majority black cast, seems to be reviewed much harsher than majority white films on here.For instance a commentor rated it a 5 and gave his review a title of too dark ... In reference to the the majority black cast-not the script. From his viewpoint, the idea of Black professionals made it ridiculous, unbelievable, etc. Because apparently they don't have Black professionals, doctors, etc.It's unfortunate when you're so small minded that a film with a majority black cast offends your senses, especially when there is next to none in existence - in spite of Blacks working in all professions(including the ones featured) , and not just the lower rungs of society as often portrayed via media.I was hesitant to read the reviews because I knew this was the type of vitriol I would see, but I was curious as to how others viewed the film. I like to hear other perspectives/insights and constructive criticisms.As for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting was great from all. The cast seemed very reminiscent to what I've experienced in life.The talented Phylicia Rashad was great. Her voice is so calming. This was definitely a different from previous roles I've seen her in. I enjoyed the twist. It was a good movie and worth the watch. By no means was it a horror movie though. Nor was it B grade type, or less interesting Black mirror episode. \ud83d\ude44However, if you don't like Black people, you definitely won't like this movie, so skip it and save everyone from your racism- this isn't to say if you don't like this movie you're racist, but racist def won't like seeing successful Black people not being drug dealers/convicts/rapist and the usual stereotypes. I do find it interesting the number of reviews that felt a need to point out that its a majority Black cast.I enjoy movies no matter the racial makeup.
