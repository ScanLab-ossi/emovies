Performance of Mikaal Zulfiqar , Armeena Rana Khan and all supported cast is very good. A very well entertainer movie for all kind of public. Like small members to aged also. Perfect family entertainer."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I expected more out of this movie. A movie written by PFA should inspire the youth towards them and create a sense of pride. But unfortunately our Pakistani writers lack the creation of creative writing skills. The story had no links. It was jumping into different scenes one after the other. The love story made no sense, supporting actors had no role, family felt out of place and the dialogues; stolen from Facebook quotes. This movie could've been so much better if they removed love story, marriage and songs for every single actor in the movie!!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "This was an execellant movie. Overall production is fascinating. I really enjoyed it"}, {"id": 3, "text": "I had mixed feelings about the trailer, so I decided to wait for reviews which also turned out to be mixed, but finally I saw the movie last night and yet again I've mixed feelings about the movie, the movie had a few Top Gun references and it makes you realize why Top Gun is a classic, Top Gun is possibly only aviation movie that blends romance, bromance, rivalry, style, heroism, music perfectly well, Sherdil too tries to be all in one but succeeds on few aspects and fails on some, the songs were few and were short in length which is good, the movie had some fun moments but some of the comedy was unnecessary, locations were very good, fight scene was enjoyable but aerial sequences could've been better but still good try, we Pakistanis have grown up watching Bollywood movies and their culture, this movie celebrates Pakistan and its Pride so watch it for the Patriosim feeling and definetly show it to your kids so they can grow up with Pakistan and its culture unlike us who had to do it with Bollywood movies because Pakistan wasn't producing good movies. Overall there's a 50% chance you'll like the movie and 50% chance you won't. Take the chance, Pakistani film industry is taking a chance by making these movies, so should you."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Super cool cast, excellent directions, super excellent/ flawless and realistic visual effects. A must watch movie that will invigorate patriotism. Timely release in cinema at the time of Indian Airforce's international humiliation. Story is very much realistic in contrast to over exaggerated biased Bollywood movies. Gives message of peace"}, {"id": 5, "text": "I have got to be honest. As I was going to watch Sherdil I had my expectations really high. I had watched Parwaaz hai Junoon, which I absolutely loved and since Sherdil was a similar genre, I expected the same output from it too.However just when the movie started, I saw my expectations fading away. From the sudden skip to 5 years to the unnecessary dance numbers, it was all a total waste of time. And just when the movie could have gotten a bit better the random kidnapping scene lost all my interest and I saw quite a few people leaving the theatre, which showed that just like me others had had enough too.Something which I did like about the movie were the graphics in the Ariel fights as they seemed very real. Additionally, I also thought comedy was on point too, especially the scene where the cadets go to watch a movie at night.In conclusion, although the movie was bearable, I have seen much better Pakistani Movies."}, {"id": 6, "text": "It was fine until the interval came up.

But again even in the absence of High quality bollywood films to be compared with, and get thrashed in public perceptions, the film bored the audience with overacting and lack of a good script according to many Pakistan media outlets.

They should have shown more air force story rather then love story. A nice effort. Support Pakistani cinema"}, {"id": 66, "text": "Although the movie starts with a rather impressively convincing dog fight especially if one considers that it's been made by a very young and recently revived Pakistani cinema with a very limited budget, yet ironically, the real problem is in the first half of the movie. The first half of the movie has all sorts of issues starting from storytelling, editing to acting and even casting. Add to that the rather weak musical numbers which otherwise can save the day for a movie much like they did for JPNA2 (not saying that JPNA2 was as weak a movie rather it relied heavily on its musical numbers). The worst actors in the movie would have to be the hero's father accompanied by some extras and the weakest casting choice ironically would have to be the heroin of the movie as she never looked inspiring enough on the silver screen and therefore the chemistry between the protagonists was missing to say the least. However, if you are able to make it through the first half then the second half of the movie surprisingly truly picks up. So much so I was beginning to wonder as to whether the first half of the movie was made by another team altogether, but no, perhaps it's due to the fact that in the first half PAF was trying to make a love story and unsurprisingly failed badly at it while in the second half they get to the real point and the focus of the movie naturally build's up. It was sad to see only 5 people watching the movie and from that number a couple left after watching the first half leaving only the three of us to enjoy the second half. Had the movie not been so weak in the first half, it wouldn't have met such a sad and gloomy fate in the cinema house.Note: The spoiler paragraph along with the alert has been moved to the bottom from here for the reader's convenience.To wrap it up I wish someone could make an edited version of the movie to reduce the burden of the first half cause then it could get a really good score but for now I am forced to give it 6/10 (and that too could be considered generous from certain point of views) with a heavy heart as the movie isn't bad in totality. In fact the main reason for all of the above may have been due to the budget constraints that were probably eaten up by the dog fight scenes. Please if you can, then do wait for the second half to start and you may not regret watching it as much. We came out very happy after watching the movie perhaps also due to the fact that we have all the claims in the movie to back up in the real life in the light of the recent incidents that have taken place in the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan. Hope we learn our lessons sooner and learn to give and earn respect. Pakistan Zindabad.SPOILER ALERT!!!The hero's acting (Mikal Zulfiqar) too improves with the introduction of one of the finer actors Hassan Niazi who is playing the Indian Pilot and has previously proven his mettle in the movie Malik. With his introduction the level of acting goes considerably higher. The best thing about the movie is that it didn't follow the mellow drama and didn't run down on the adversary in the endeavor to highlight the hero. A critical mistake that even Richard Attenborough made in the movie Gandhi (1982). In fact the Indian pilot is depicted as a very professional and composed officer who wouldn't lose focus on the mission or play it dirty when the time comes. While the Pakistani pilot on the other hand, though very capable, is shown to be aggressive and someone who needs to learn a few lessons in order to become a greater fighter pilot. Those lessons he learns indirectly from the adversary. The movie also very nicely touches on some poking things and doesn't take typical route towards explaining or justifying them and by the way, these are the places where one begins to wonder if the second half of the movie was made by another team. Another thing that failed to fully establish a point is the hero's rich family background, though it may have made a greater impact if he was shown to be coming from a rather humble middle class family, the reason why they probably did it was to show that the hero is willing to leave all the luxuries of a wealthy life in favor of his passion for flying and for his motherland which, as mentioned before, didn't make the impact it was supposed to leave."}, {"id": 67, "text": "I watched this movie with my family recently and they loved it. My little one wants to watch it again he enjoyed it so much. This movie has all to offer esp the amazing ariel dogfights scenes, courtesy of PAF Pilots.

Loved the songs , the action , the comedy, the thrill. Super dog fights. Hats off to SHERDIL"}, {"id": 77, "text": "SherDil is a film that will definitely be memorable purely because of the turning point it will turn out as for the visual effects and CGI in the Pakistani Industry. Other than that, the film also hits all the right spots as a masala entertainer, and while it's not the best film out there, it's definitely a fun popcorn watch and to me that's what a costly ticket price should be worth, the grandeur.The timing really helps as the story and many scenes reflect upon the recent Pak-India conflict. Let's break down the technicalities:Story: I must admit that it is not something i'd purely enjoy on a laptop screen, the film is purely made for the big screen, hence why I didn't mind the script which had alot of flaws. It's very inconsistent, and goes haywire at times. The first half is great, after that there's just too much unnecessary stuff going on that's both dull and unnecessary. The Dubai scene could've been cut short ALOT and that random Don scene was just not needed. If you can look past that, it's very engaging as the ending is definitely satisfying. Dialogues are well written and had the script had a better direction or proper character development tau this would have been a revolutionary product. 5/10VFX/Cinematography : Scott Newman and Muqeem Khan have done a fantastic job. Riki Butland has also brought his magic to the screen. You can tell the budget was huge. looks expensive and at points I could barely tell if it was CGI or real. The dog fights are fantastic, cinematography is breathtaking and these combined are the saving grace for the film. 9/10Direction: Azfar Jaffri i feel didn't have much creative control because the tone feels like it's not his. I'm a fan of his previous work so this could've been better. Direction is not perfect, but it ties up the lazy script as best as it can and Jaffri deserves a credit for that. 7/10Acting: overall the acting is very good with the exception of minor characters or extras who felt like were dubbed by random people. as for the whole cast, here's a breakdown: Mikaal: while he looks the part and commands good presence, his acting is hit or miss. in the start he's overdoing it and then his transition in five years isn't visible. his performance is decent but could've been much better. Armeena: i don't know if i can comment much as her voice was dubbed horribly. whatever differences the makers of the film had with her, it felt like they purposely had a bad voice actress do her dub. her expressions were fine, the tone of her voice ruined it all. Hassan Niazi: what a performance! he completely overshadowed Mikaal and brought his A game to the table. we need to see more of him. Sabeeka Imam: her accent was believable, although not accurate. her performance was slightly stiff but not bad at all. her scene with Hassan felt very natural and she definitely commanded presence for the limited time she was in. Samina Ahmed: as always, she rocks it. undoubtedly the best, i'm your biggest fan Samina ji! Additionally Leyla Zubairi gives a mediocre performance, where as Dr Uppal struggles to deliver his lines, clearly not an actor. I think however the breaking point in this cast are the new faces. Malik Aqeel has great comic timing and does justice to his character. Belal Shahid gives an impressive performance as he not only is able to play a backward character with perfection but does what Mikaal fails to do; his 5 year transition is spot on. Ibrahim Alavi is out of the three given more screen time and relevance and it is all deserved. He has the most natural delivery in the whole cast. He being a first timer completely outshines Mikaal and Armeena in all their scenes. Despite the lazy writing, he makes the scenes work with his subtle yet impactful performance. 7.5/10Music: the soundtrack is well done and adds alot to the dogfights. at some parts the music is added to the scenes in a weird manner which it could've done without. 8/10Songs: The military song is perhaps the best one as it not only sounds good but goes well with the training montage, i can definitely jam to it. The rest of the songs are decent but nothing special. Ho Jania is shot beautifully but it could have been choreographed better. The Club song is just weird and feels out of place and has very tacky lyrics, nor is it shot well with the both Hassan and Sabeeka giving dancing awkwardly. Ibrahim should've been given more space as he brings somewhat life to it. The film could've done without it honestly. Lastly, Kuri da Jhumka is a decent wedding number that people will definitely be playing at their Mehndi. All the boys carry it well and the choreography is good, although it could've been shot better. My only problem is the weird random chinese girl. What the hell was that? 7/10Overall: the film has problems with the way it's excuted. Script was inconsistent and editing was very sloppy. However, decent performances by the cast, beautiful visuals, intense and well animated dog fights, an extremely funny first half and a very satisfying ending make up for decent cinematic experience. Overall i give the film an 8/10 as the pros outweigh the cons.SherDil is an entertaining flight that has some flaws but you still have a lot of fun!"}, {"id": 78, "text": "And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. If not before but now Mr. Nomaan Khan the writer &amp; producer of recently released Pakistani film SherDil would have started believing in this famous quote from The Alchemist. Nomaan Khan started working on this film project couple of years ago but events shown in SherDil has startling resemblance with recent Indo-Pak tension. SherDil is one of the most anticipated Pakistani films of this year and timely tribute to Pakistan Air Force.SherDil has been directed by Azfar Jafri who is known for films like Siyaah, Janaan and Parchi. Though he has been associated with films from different genre but with SherDil he has added one more feather in his cap. Directing war film is not a child's play in Pakistan but Jafri has pulled it off with an ease. There are certain dull moments in SherDil but ignorable due to some witty dialogues and situations which maintain audience's interest in the film till the end.The main offering of SherDil is its visual effects and cinematography of aerial combats which have been shot magnificently. Arguably such dogfights we have never seen in any film from subcontinent. There should be no doubt that SherDil will always be remembered for combat scenes between JF-17 Thunder and Mirage 2000. We must thank Scott Newman for providing believable visual effects and Riki Butland for unbelievable cinematography. Prior SherDil Riki Butland has been associated with Hollywood blockbusters like Star Trek Byond and Fast &amp; Furious 7. Services rendered by Scott Newman and Riki Butland for SherDil has raised the bar of Pakistani films to the next level.Mikaal Zulfiqar is one of the main heartthrobs of Pakistani dramas and films, shines in SherDil. There is always a low opportunity to show acting prowess in an out and out action film but still Mikaal Zulfiqar has done satisfactory job as a main lead and he looks believable in uniform. Hassan Niazi as nemesis of Mikaal Zulfiqar justifies his selection in SherDil. His verbal confrontations with Mikaal Zulfiqar are one of the main features of SherDil which does not only provide entertainment but also shows glimpses of irk between Pakistan and India.Writer and director of SherDil should be commended for not doing mud sledging while showing confrontation between a Pakistani and Indian fighter pilot. Though SherDil is an effort to boost patriotic and nationalistic feelings but same time refrains from spreading jingoism and war hysteria. Armeena Rana Khan and Sabeeka Imam are completely wasted in the film. May be storyline does not require their extended roles but one thing is certain their importance in SherDil is not more than the props. Music is completely irrelevant and forgettable, only drags the pacing of the film.On the whole, SherDil is refined cinematic product from Pakistan which does not only entertain but also explain the current Pakistani standpoint towards India. One may brag to claim that SherDil has a power to convert the happenings of 26-27 February into mere its promotion. On positive note SherDil seems like Prime Minister Imran Khan's message to India in cinematic form which is nothing but Peace and Mutual Respect."}, {"id": 79, "text": "While everyone watches any given movie their own way I would STRONGLY suggest you watch Sherdil a couple of times to grasp the true essence of this masterpiece. I watched it twice in the theatre two days in a row and I was blown away by some of the key elements I completely missed the first day. I know this might sound crazy but this is the kind of power some of the biggest Hollywood movies like Inception and Interstellar have. For me a strong cast makes or breaks a film. Loved all the stars perfect for the characters even the debutantes. The only reason I ended up rating it 9/10 is Armeenah Rana Khan. She was just a pretty face with zero expressions. But I am glad at least she was good in the songs. Saving grace. Nomaan Khan is a maestro of his crafts. Well written and produced and the direction of Azfar Jaffery is the icing on the cake. Dog fights are the BEST part of the movie, followed by very intelligent comedy and emotional connect/patriotism shown by the AirForce. Lovely family movie. Five thumbs up. Can't wait to watch it again."}, {"id": 80, "text": "Since March 22nd, Sherdil is just continuing to stamp its aura on audience with nothing but overwhelming appreciation and applause for providing a complete entertainment to every segment of society. The dogfight sequence cannot be explained in words and the only true review anyone can make is to ask the reader to watch it and feel it. Everyone watching feels being siting in the cockpit and making moves. Your nerves would sync with the buzz and trust me your expressions would tell you how real the action is! Scott has done probably the most accomplished work for these VFX effects. The music is amazing, songs are worth falling in love with and the best part is that in 5 songs you will listen, every song is mastering a particular cord! The movie is offering some of the most melodious songs Pakistan Cinema has ever offered. The story is household and realistic from start to end. Producer and Director have really gotten best out of cast and crew, and this is the strength of this movie. The performance of debutants or that of the seasoned divas, the out come is super professional and you can't miss to appreciate the work put in by Producer and Director. While the country is proudly celebrating a strong National response recently handed down to invading aggressor, the movie is not letting the momentum break. I am proud member of the cast and in the role of Sqn Ldr Sikander I open the inning in the first scene which set the tone for showing best action sequences any dogfight has ever been filmed and shown, later mastered by Mikaal and Hassan. Nomaan Khan and Azfar Jafri has done a wonderful work. It is a must watch masterpiece. Even the critics are saying, no better action can be filmed. Sherdil has left everyone behind, carrying the bat, unbeaten!"}], "reviews_amount": 81}
