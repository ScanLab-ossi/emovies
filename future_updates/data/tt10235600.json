Netflix movies used to be far better. But now their standards are going way downhill. The message in this movie, if any, is about female infanticide in India.

From first to last it's utter garbage."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Set On the backdrop of contemporary rural north India, this endeavour of making an eerrie film with the theme of the rural India's apathy towards girl child, is ofcourse a failed attempt. But, we know Indian or rather Hindi horror genre, where in the recent times, except Tumbbad, none is even watchable. This movie is an exception to that. Despite it's shortcomings it stood through because of the performances, specially the child actors together with a splendid role by Shabana Azmi, and ofcouse the direction and beaitiful cenematography. Whatever the script is, it has been presented fatless, lean manner. Definitely a good watch."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This movie starts out with amazing atmosphere right from the start. The cinematography is stunning. I've watched many horror movies in my life and lately they all seem to be the same thing over and over. I found Kaali Khuhi to be a refreshing take on a haunted tale. Even better to watch a film that has important meaning. The acting was strong especially from young actress Riva Arora. She has a bright future ahead of her. I don't recommend many scary films to my friends especially recent scary films, but I will recommend Kaali Khuhi to everyone."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Whenever something from Bollywood comes on Netflix, I am always apprehensive that it is going to turn out to be a waste of time. This is one of such movies.

This isn't your usual horror film, so don't come in expecting jump scares and gory sequences (though there are plenty of creepy moments!).Instead, Kaali Khuhi is a dark, surreal story that connects a young city girl to the girls who lived in her father's village before her. The spirits are angry, and rightfully so. Worth a watch, and a discussion afterwards, about a practice that still unfortunately happens worldwide, and about the director's POV on who's complicit and who's innocent - and who really has control over their future.Engaging and thought-provoking, beautifully shot, and far more interesting than most horror films I've ever seen."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Waste of time and money. If u dont have story and content, stay quite. Stope fooling people and spending money in nonsense!!! Enough is enough!!!"}, {"id": 12, "text": "I had no idea what to expect from this movie, and it ended up being one of the most unique movies I think I've ever seen. Lots of reviewers are complaining about the plot (?? which was... clear and easy to follow to me?), but the fascinating part to me is that traditional plot structure felt less urgent and important than the devastating mood: the gray, dark tones; the slow realization that none of the adults are reliable, good people there to help; the outstanding acting of the tiny main actress (who was interesting to watch in every single frame); the use of color/ sun/ light in spare moments during the rest of the oppressive darkness and rain; the gorgeous cinematography (that popsicle drop in the well in the 2nd scene!)...As a North American, I loved getting a peek into a unique side of Indian cinema, locations, moods, etc, that we don't usually see. It felt like watching the origin story, the creation of a Hindu goddess in her pain and struggle to do the right thing, as well as desire for revenge and balancing the scales. The intensity of the actors made me think I could've understood it even without the subtitles, and I forgot I was listening to Hindi at times as I read along.Favorite moments were the body horror ghost womb (!!!), everything coming back to the well/ water, the p.o.v. of the girls running around the maze of the small town, and that beautiful/ jarring sequence with the sunlit sheet slapping us back into the cold rainy present.This movie reminded me of the movie mother! by Aronofsky - you don't really know where you're standing at times, and are only given clues through color, sight, sounds, themes and characters' emotions - but more accessible. This is a movie about being a girl in the world, and as a daughter and mother, it moved me and will stick with me!!"}, {"id": 13, "text": "I just had one question after watching this movie. If Sakshi was killed as an infant how did she grow old to become 10-12 year old ghost. And if she could grow even after dying, why didn't she any grow older."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Kaali Khuhi was a surprise. It was recommended by a friend and I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. This is more of a ghost story than it is your classic horror flick, with beautiful long shots and an intelligent script that you would expect from an art house film. The plot deals with insidious practice of female infantcide that is still done in many rural villages across the world.Much like the movie Atlantics, it's a smart ghost story with a message and a non-typical ending that is quite moving. Some of the special effects can get confusing, however what Kaali Khuhi make lacks big budget special effects more than makes up in content."}, {"id": 15, "text": "It rolls over the land like some sort of a silent witness, starting with the opening sequence, which takes place at night to the last shot, which is at dawn, signifying a new beginning perhaps. The fog works strenuously to add a layer of mystery and creepiness to Terrie Samundra's debut feature. The director also relies heavily on other horror tropes - a ghost makes a sudden appearance in a mirror, the soundtrack is purposefully ominous, in one scene, a withered old woman with one eye shows up, it rains incessantly. The story is set in rural Punjab, which is presented as desolate, dark and quietly horrific. The color palette is grey. But as I watched, I found myself wondering: How many fog machines did they haul to location? Or is it now all done digitally?

The idea is to scare you but also to make you think beyond the horror onscreen and consider the horror in life. Incidentally, horror plus sex was dubbed horrex but I couldn't think of a clever name for horror plus message. Kaali Khuhi is about female infanticide in Punjab. The heroine is a 10-year-old girl Shivangi who confronts an awful secret when she is taken by her parents to their ancestral village because her grandmother is ill.When we first meet Shivangi, she is peering into a well as she sucks on a gola. The red flavoring from the gola drips into the water in tight close-up, foreshadowing the blood that will soon be spilled. It's a striking, spooky moment. Shivangi played by Riva Arora is a timid girl, confused by the adults - especially her parents who don't do a good job of shielding her from their problems. But eventually, she is the one with the courage and wisdom to put an end to the terrible events.As an idea, Kaali Khuhi is potent. There is something inherently eerie about wells - the cavernous dark space and the impossibility of escape makes them perfect fodder for horror films. Case in point, the Japanese classic Ringu, in which the murderous spirit Sadako, with her hair covering her face, emerges from a well, walking like a marionette whose strings are being drunkenly yanked by someone above. We learn later that she was drowned in it. It's terrifying. Kaali Khuhi has been edited by Sanyukta Kaza who earlier cut the superb Paatal Lok. It's thrilling to see a team of female artists tell a story that puts women front and center. It's also thrilling that Terrie is attempting here to deliver an urgent message via a genre picture. But for the combination to work, the writing needed to be much sharper"}, {"id": 16, "text": "We loved this movie!

The story itself is overtly simplistic and devoid of any layers or character development. It is not horror per se but more a story that involves supernatural elements. The production values are high, and direction is competent. There is so much that could have been done with the material available but the movie though underwhelming and slow does a credible job. It is not something that you would in all probability rewatch but as a one time watch it works. The acting is competent and the photography is excellent.

This is an emotional drama about a heinous phenomenon that still exists in parts of India. The cinematography is beautiful, the sound design was moody and scares were effective, at times. Trust me, guys, this is by no means a bad film. But, I don't say it's great either. The film has dialogue issues, which made me wonder 'Do people even say this,' at times, and the characters were pretty shallow and not well-developed.

Watch it by yourself then decide, whether it was worthy to watch or not.#At last but not least, this movie is going to be one of the rarest gem of bollywood horror genre that will be remembered for a long time."}, {"id": 94, "text": "A fool and his money soon part ways. If you want to see this adage in live action, just watch the ratings of all exclusive releases from the house of Netflix India in the last 2 years -- one stinking crapola after another. This movie is the mother queen of all the crapolas that Netflix has thrown at its subscribers. Actually, it doesn't really matter if you see this movie or not, because if you are a Netflix subscriber, you've already paid for it. The only saving you're going to do by NOT watching this film is that of your time. So, go ahead and do it.The nincompoops at Netflix are so hellbent on building an Original Content library in local language that they are simply elated in handing out cash to the out-of-work, incompetent Indian movie makers (if you can call them that.. haha!) who are robbing them blind in broad daylight by producing utter rubbish in the name of films. I canceled my Netflix subscription recently and now sleep happy, knowing that I will no longer be funding the creation of any more garbage with Netflix stamped on it. I've taken care of my money, you take care of yours however you see fit. Adios."}, {"id": 95, "text": "Kaali Khuhi as a story never takes off at any stage in its 90 minutes run, the scenes keep repeating itself in a endless loop time and again. Though the intentions of Kaali Khuhi is genuinely good, as its storyline focuses on female infanticide, but releasing the movie on Netflix doesn't make any sense. I don't think anybody who subscribes Netflix, would indulge in infanticide or need awareness on the subject.If horror was USP of Kaali Khuhi I doubt there is absolutely nothing much to write about. A terrible screenplay supported by some poor acting lets the movie down in every possible way. Cinematography and editing does have a few good moments sparingly, but that does not add any value to make the movie more interesting whatsoever. Production design, music, makeup and costumes were just about par. Director Terrie Samundra really needs to get her act together, if at all she wants to make another movie.Overall, the movie doesn't scare you one bit, it is not at all even close to even give you a jump scare. Only positive aspect is that, Kaali Khuhi doesn't have any adult scenes and can be watched with the family. Watch it only when you have absolutely nothing else. It's a 20 minute short, made into a 90 minute feature just to bug the audiences."}, {"id": 96, "text": "Kaali Khuhi though with desirous intent in heart; fails to felicitate a rather exceeding technical prowess. Other than its artsy appearance; Netflix's brand-new original does everything else woefully wrong. Dreadful writing - Checked Inept Screenplay - Checked Meager Performances - Checked Lately, this has been the case, when it comes to Horror! Especially in Bollywood. They do get engrossing scripts to work out with, fair enough funds to help in the process of making but it's always the 'Writing' that let the whole project down! Something similar happened in this case as well!Cinematography is undoubtedly Brilliant. The framing, colors, vibe all being in the top tier! In addition, seemly soundscore with somber tonality; helping to create a certain mood!However, the rest is a pile of trash, in all fairness!Misfit dialogues, sudden outbursts of emotions, recurrent issues with pacing; it all made no sense! Perhaps, the most startling factor being the infirmity of the performers to stand out! With such competent names in the cast list, it's confounding to say the least."}], "reviews_amount": 97}
