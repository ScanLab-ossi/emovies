Octavia Spencer was so over the top camp , Chris rocks voice over was overly excited considering he is narrating a story that is about evil withches and the danger they pose towards children ..The whole film was so badly miscast it makes showgirls look like pride and prejudice, Hollywood u have to stop now remaking classic movies , come up with some new ideas and make new movies diverse. We do not need to erase iconic movies from the past just to tick the diversity quota , make new movies new ideas and just be diverse ....Anne Hathaway really should be kept away from icnonc roles like this. It's actually angered me at how bad this film is. Enough already"}, {"id": 1, "text": "What the F... is Going on? Im a norwegian, and one of the best things about the original, is that the beginning is set in norway. Bergen. The story about the girl in the painting. Dahl had norwegian parents, so i really love the beginning of the original.Why do the keep making terrible remakes of really good movies? The make up in the original is far surperior to the terrible CGI in this movie. If you check out the drawings in the book, the Grand witch is way off in this movie. The CGI is more like the Scorpion King.That someone in the comments gave this movie 7-10 is just nuts. So incredible bad"}, {"id": 2, "text": "I thought the cat CGI was inconsistent and Anne Hathaway's accent all over the place. Sometimes she's Russian, Scottish and Swedish.

Why not remake a movie that should have been good and wasn't!?"}, {"id": 4, "text": "Total tripe from start to finish. The only one good thing about this movie is Anne. The CGI is shockingly bad and cartoonish. A British story set in Britain that's been Americanised and therefore completely ruined. Hideous doesn't even come close to describe this movie."}, {"id": 5, "text": "The remake has no story line, no emotional connections to the characters. Nothing compared to the original and yes you should be comparing. The only good actress in this film is Anne Hathaway who did alright. The director should be ashamed. What a waste of money and talent. I'm going to go have some Cress soup and enjoy the rest of my night watching the original version. More talent in just the pinky of that movie."}, {"id": 6, "text": "The Grand High Witch is killing it. but seriously, she's terrible. From the start on, with the weird Chris Rock voice-over, this remake goes wrong wherever it can wrong. The acting is stiff, the focus is hardly on all the other witches, the CGI is not good. Even the housekeeping cart seems to come from the CGI box. Positive thing: Octavia Spencer is doing her best to be a genuine grandmother, and she succeeds, but that's about it. OK, yes, I am a fan of the 1990 movie. Even though it wasn't as close to the original story, I really can't believe Roald Dahl would recognize his book in this mess. The first movie was gorgeous in it's authenticity. It has folklore, it has an edge, it has a heart. This is Hollywood factory work and seems to want to be much more than it can deliver. It made me miss much more than the purple glow in the witches eyes. It made me want to just throw up like a witch who smells children. I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it. I am sure that an entire generation who never grew up with the original will disagree, but to me, this is like cursing in a church. It's horrible."}, {"id": 7, "text": "There is going to be a lot of unemployed actors in Hollywood, very soon.Is there anyone left who understands the public mood?"}, {"id": 8, "text": "This was horrible I can't believe they would remake this amazing classic and cast Anne Hathaway at the grand high which. No offense to her she's an OK actress but this was not a role for her. This was Anjelica Huston's part it's like could you imagine anyone else playing Morticia Addams? And also no offense to Chris rock but the narration was no Bueno"}, {"id": 9, "text": "I love Octavia and Anne, but this movie seems like it was rushed and that they were just phoning it in.To begin with, the original is a cult classic, so how dare you mess up with it. Then, if you are gonna do it, well, do it well. They were clearly going for a kids friendly movie but I mean, this story is creepy. The mouse animation takes you away from it, specially coming from Henson's animatronics. The Great Witch reveal is underwhelming, and the changes/additions to the story don't serve it. It just doesn't adds up.It pains me that Cuaron and Del Toro are attached to this project as producers. Zemeckis seems to be going in decline and it just sucks. Dahl's fans may be happier with this ending, but with all the other changes I dunno how they can be happy with the movie in general."}, {"id": 10, "text": "This re-make of the witches is very short and very simplified from the original adaptation of the film. The cast doesn't seem entirely engaged in their roles. Too much auto-tone and CGI used here to the point that it's not as effective as one might hope it to be. Very bland sets and much smaller scale compared to the original version. Ultimately, this is just another bland Hollywood low budget re-make film."}, {"id": 11, "text": "This whole movie is a mess! The cast all seem very dis-interested in their roles. The plot is a shot by shot re-make of the original and overall, I don't feel like there is any spirit or enthusiasm in this project at all!

They should of just left this movie alone all together"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Anne Hathaway can't hold a candle to Angelica Houston and neither can the rest of cast against their 1990 counter parts. Zemekis's direction is bland and unimaginative. Avoid."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Some 80s and 90s family movies look incredibly cheesy and bad compared to modern releases... Well, now we have the opposite! The 90s adaptation is a masterpiece compared to this. It's incredible how many talented people worked on this mess. The cringiest thing about it is Anne Hathaway's accent, which jumps from Russian to German to Swedish, and it's never funny because she's trying too hard. There are many other talking animal movies that your children will enjoy, spare them, and don't succumb to the voice in your head asking how bad can it be?. IT'S REALLY BAD."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Worst remake so far. Don't waste yours or you kids time. Just watch the original"}, {"id": 16, "text": "What they end up doing in this movie makes the film less of a movie and more of a commercial for something stupid , if you see the film you will know what I'm talking about. It was cute and fun. But NOT at all a good movie nor a classic. It's barely considered a movie. Not sure what audience this movie would even appeal to. I would skip this and either read the book or watch the original movie instead. Not worth the time!!"}, {"id": 17, "text": "I've not written a review before on here, but I felt compelled to after sitting through this film and wasting \u00a315 for the privilege! I didn't understand why they had to remake the witches, the original felt authentic and was engaging and fun. The grandma and little boy made a great team and you rooted for them! This one was boring in places, all the actors (except Octavia Spencer) were dreadful, the little boy especially! And Chris Rock as the voice over was annoying, at times you couldn't hear /understand what he was saying! My children found it frightening, the way Anne Hathaway's mouth opened with those teeth and her extending arms was very much like the clown from IT and the CGI was so obvious. And what accent was she supposed to have? At times it was Scottish/Irish and some kind of Eastern European!!? I wouldn't recommend it, stick with the original!"}, {"id": 18, "text": "Terrible. The witches are pathetic, the original had over twice the amount in the hotel. Anne Hathaway WISHES she has the poise, energy and even the accent."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Nothing new nor exciting here at all! Makes sense why it's free to watch with hbo max subscription!

How long does it need to be because there is nothing else to say about this basura. And just in case that is spanish for trash so if you do decide to watch it...you've been warned."}, {"id": 21, "text": "So I wanted to like this and had some hopes for it, but it honestly fell pretty flat. I even thought that with actors like Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway that it might be saved, and they were great in their roles as far as remaking/re-imagining movies go. But even with that, the grandmother is sort of a rehash of Spencer's character Minnie from The Help, Stanley Tucci hardly gets ANY screen time or character development, and Hathaway, while nailing so many of Angelica Houston's mannerisms, is still a bit overdone on her character. But also the remake lacks the character/story development, decent plot, dialogue and even the action and tense scenes from the original. And the transformation scenes (minus the one in the beginning which I thought was a good add) were extremely short with bad CGI. Overall, this was no improvement over the 1990 version, and not different enough to be all that good."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Found it enjoyable both times we've seen it.

The old movie was not the best but good enough for the technology they had back then. I always dreamed of them remaking it! But lo and behold this was terrible.

It had so much potential but unfortunately falls flat with its over use of awful CGI effects. One for the kiddies but if you're a fan of the original classic, stick to it. Not even Anne and her terrible accent could save this toned down version!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "I don't get why everyone's calling this a remake. It's not a remake. It's another adaption of the book. I think people need to focus more on comparing the movie to the book rather than the 1990 movie. I will say that the 1990 movie was a lot darker and dramatic while this one is more comedic and light hearted but I never expected this to be a copy of the other movie since again, it's not a remake. Here are what I think are the pros and cons of the movie.Pros:Stayed more true to the book especially the ending, Anne's performance was amazing and I could tell she had fun with this role, I liked Daisy/Mary's story, the costumes were great especially the Grand High Witch's, loved the final battle feel between the grandma and the GHW, the beginning was really well done and emotional, loved the scene of the witches meeting especially the GHW's dialogue and the witches chasing after Luke, Mary and Bruno, even though she didn't have an unmasked form, I still liked what they did with the GHW's true look and still found it quite terrifying, loved Octavia's performance even though I felt that she was too young for the role.Cons:CGI was over the top, movie seemed a bit rushed, I didn't like the way the grandmother's backstory was played out, was confused as to why the GHW didn't have an unmasked form but I still liked what they did with it (I put that under both the pros and cons list because I was kinda disappointed but I still liked it), felt bad for Bruno's parents that they never got Bruno back, don't get why the main character is just labeled as Hero instead of Luke or some other name though I can't remember if he was given a name in the book.Overall, I think the biggest highlights of this movie was Octavia and Anne's performances and it staying more true the book than the 1990 movie did even though the time settings were different and they changed the races of the grandma and grandson but I don't mind that."}, {"id": 29, "text": "I'll admit that I had little to no hope for this one to begin with, at the risk of sounding like an old man drinking from a hip flask and muttering at innappropriate moments 'I miss the good old days.'Never before has that been more applicable than now.Lets begin with the goodit isnt a long movie.I guess that's it!Now for the bad!The addition of CG when used properly is seamless and adds an extra layer of depth to an already decent idea. Unfortunately as is the norm these days CG is used at the drop of a hat (or wig) because its simply the easier option. Remember the terrifying grand high witch transformation from the original film? now its a question of forget prosthetics or excellent makeup, or even excellent acting actually. You wont find it here!The CG snake was needless and looked awful, hire a real snake or use one of the crew members' pet snake, cheaper, easier and realistic. SIMPLE!The most irritating thing about this movie from the beginning is that it lacks any subtlety at all, which unfortunately makes it all completely unbelievable. If witches were obvious-and every single witch in this movie parades around with the subtlety of Donald Trump-then they would be easy to spot. Sometimes less is more, what you dont see can be infinitely more horrifying.The above bits are the least of this movie's problems. Now I am mixed race and love a cultural nod as much as the next person but again a little subtlety would be nice, yes the main characters are black and no problem with that at all in fact I welcome the change, however I dont need to be given a stereotypical view of a black family, We dont all like motown, we dont all like southern style food, i mean what was with that room service scene!?!?!? All it was missing was a sign saying Stereotypical Southern Black Woman's Order' , Please get away from this one size fits all model because its old and tired.Movie is set in the US, why? What was the point of doing that? Story is unchanged regardless of where it takes place but what difference did changing the setting to the US actually make? Other than filming it in America because it was convenient I cant think of any other reason for this.The actingOctavia Spencer is great I love the lady but shes the only good thing here. Stanley Tucci plays the same character he plays in everything, the quirky one, it works for him and thats fine. The kids are terrible and very irritating, at least the kids in the original had some likeability. Anne Hathaway is awful, bad accent, hammy and just a farce overall. Very much a paint by numbers portrayal of the bad guy, clich\u00e9, robotic, silly really and not in a good way.I touched on it earlier but why is EVERYTHING CG!?!? The terrible mouth of the Grand High Witch, the terrible CG mice, The transformations were pathetic and we had a CG wooden log!!!I ask you WHY!?Skip this Hammy dumpster fire"}, {"id": 30, "text": "Awful.... why remake it the first one was great... the special effects are too much and take over the movie and they aren't actually that great.Don't watch this... enjoy the first one again instead"}, {"id": 31, "text": "Guilty of Not Reading this book Yet, so I can't compare the two. I did watch the old movie, but the two are completely different animals, both were great stories in their own way. I almost didn't watch this because of a review I read online, but my family all wanted to, so I agreed, and I'm glad I did. It was a fantastic movie. The witch's mouths were a nice touch, and I LOVED the ending. Nothing cookie cutter about this storyline it was entirely Unique with most characters having depth and substance. There was only one character who wasn't in the first movie who seemed a little haphazardly thrown in for audience appeal, but the voice actress did the part well, and I was left wondering if she was in the book too. I'll have to find time to read it soon. Overall, it was a great story, with fun special effects and good acting. I'd recommend watching it if you get the chance."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Terrible, boring, and dull re-make of an already simple and stupid film and story.

My kids loved it and love the original so they actually pulled it off in my opinion. People may also find other ways or reasons to hate it (probably involves current issues politics bs etc.) but seriously it's not bad. You also have to remember these movies are kids movies based on a kids book so if your pissed that a movie from your childhood has been remade, that's sad. At least they waited 30 years to do it. The first one is a lot scarier but that's because of the awesome makeup and not cgi."}, {"id": 35, "text": "I was surprised to the reaction to this film... It's completely inoffensive and does everything it needs to with the charm of grandma, the malice of the Grand High Witch, etc. I'm getting the feeling that these are reactionary responses to yet another 'bland and unoriginal Hollywood' trend even though this is an adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, just like the 1990 version is.It's alright if people don't like this movie I suppose but acting like it's the worst thing to come to screens is an exaggeration to say the least. Kids are most definitely going to enjoy it, it is for them after all, not the adults comparing it to the 1990 adaptation, so I'd say this film was a success in what if wanted to do."}, {"id": 36, "text": "Everything was being cool, until Anne's really exaggerated performance, maybe another actress would have been better choice"}, {"id": 37, "text": "This film is a snooze and looks cheap and poorly made.

What is up with the scars on their faces the point of the disguise is to not be able to recognize the witch without looking into their eyes if they're trying to remake the movie exactly as the first one which it seems like they are.

There's complete no plot or storyline in this movie. Characters are just nowhere or without existance. An hotel that is empty of people, where is everyone? The high witch is the only one who talks or acts in this movie from the rest of the Witches group, the rest are just robots. I don't know who approved the script for this remake but should be fired inmediately. Where is the makeup? Where is the evilness? Where is the Witch? Both kids have more personality while they are mice than humans. When they are in human form they are so lame. But as mice they are cometely different in form and intentions. This is just trash."}, {"id": 41, "text": "If I had one wish in the world it would be to go back in time and never watch this movie lol the original is so good and this movie was just weird and disappointing.

They go to a hotel in Alabama and they have the misfortune to be there at the same time as a witch coven gathering. The witches have a plan to turn all children into mice and eliminate them. They turn the boy into a mouse and he together with two other children who were turned into mice and his grandmother had to defeat the coven led by the high witch. They do this by feeding the witches the same potion that was used to turn them into mice and it ends up turning the witches into ugly looking rats. And then they leave with a huge pile of money and potion and a list of all witches in the world and plan to turn them into rats as well. About 45 seconds is spent trying to turn the children back into their human form and then they shrug their shoulders and say well it's ok beeing a mouse. The boy even asks how long mice live and the grandmother says that regular mice live three years but that they might live three times that which is ok with the boy who is happy he won't have to go to school and they can die together. The grandmother doesn't seem to be too bothered either which is strange to say the least since the indication is that none of these poor children will see past their mid teens but at least they can have fun with all the money. And then they show us a scene 11 years later with an aged mouse talking to children and sending them out on a mission to eliminate witches. Obviously someone was not good at math since 1979 is about two years past the mice life span according to the film.Another issue is why does the potion work on witches who are not even human? Why doesn't the grandmother try to find an antidote when she captures the head witch instead of feeding her to her cat familiar. In the beginning it is said that a witch gets the same pleasure from squashing children as a normal person would from eating ice cream. And then 25 minutes later it is said they hate the smell of children since children smell like dog poop... soooo....dog poop ice cream that they get enjoyment out of squashing. Someone should have read through this script more. The good things are the effects and the adult actors although Anne Hathaway changes her accent throughout the movie. She was still entertaining but not enough to improve this movie which has a terrible ending.

I would've preferred a much darker spin and more sinister vibe over this comical TV movie offering but oh well. Octavia was really good as always but the cheap CGI did let the movie down. It's also been very clear for a number of years now that Anne's forte are not accents. I mean she sounded comical and even Scottish in certain parts...like girl come on now.

So will the boy and his 2 new friends save the day. Overall its not as scary as the 1990 version as that scared the living daylight out of me. Anne Hathaway did her own version of Angelica Huston's charcther and I liked how it wasn't a copy and paste of the original.(like The Lion King which came out last year and that had NO changes).If you are looking for a creepy film watch the 1990 one instead,if you found that one too scary,go watch the 2020 one instead.

Angelica Huston was so perfect in her portrayal that she didn't even need to speak and you'd get the chills from her stare. I think everything was just overly done but without any substance. Even the weaving choreography-like movements as the witches entered the grand room they were having their meeting was annoying! The other witches in this movie also seem like they were just there to fill the bodies of witches--even they didn't add any kind of color to the movie.

Anne Hathaway gave it her all, but she was horribly miscast and misdirected here. The role of the grand high witch was taken to Mommie Dearest levels of camp. What makes the witches so terrifying is the fact that they can pass off as ordinary ladies without raising any suspicions. The witches in this new adaptation give themselves away instantly. Mr. Zemeckis and the scrip writers are utterly incapable of subtlety and atmosfere, it seems. The grand high witch's transformation is also jaw droppingly lazy. It's just a badly rendered CGI slit mouth, some claws and a dress with an animated snake. That's it. It's such a shame, really. With a more appropriate team this could have done justice to the source material. Also, why on earth was this adaptation so americanised? Are american audiences really that lazy? This adaptation is fails in every possible way and it's not, by any means, as close to Dahl's novel as Robert Zemeckis claimed it would be.

She stuck with her grandson and believed him through the whole thing. I think that was probably my favorite thing about both stories. I keep seeing these reviews that say no emotional connection.. please. If you have no emotional connection to this kid, you didn't want to have one.The new version got rid of most of those plot holes. In particular it got rid of the painting people. If you remember the original had two different people in paintings. One was explained. The other wasn't. They also got rid of the cut off finger thing. I'm glad they stepped a little away from the fat kid trope in the new adaptation. I hated that about the original. Yes. Bruno is overweight. No the entire existence of this character doesn't need to revolve around him being overweight.The biggest change between the two is the ending. This ending left us all in shock. If you know anything about the original, you know that there was controversy about the good witch being thrown into it. That wasn't the original story. This new version plays closer to the book.

It's a children's book turned into an oscar winning movie because it has been turned into a movie about society and racism. It's disappointing how it's nothing like the original and you can't watch anything nowadays without it pointing out every problem we have in society because that's totally what kids should be worrying about."}, {"id": 243, "text": "I like the plot of the movie even though not happy ending I think.

Poor poor plot. It is more like a Halloween semi-spooky child's book of about 20 pages or so. Was not made to entertain adults at all unless you have very low expectations and are just bored enough to watch anything. The boy had a bad script but still did well with what he had. The original blows this away and ruins this movie just in comparison. As Snoopy says, 'BLEH'.

The whole movie was just pretty bad and boring! Don't recommend it!"}, {"id": 283, "text": "This movie is terrible, downright terrible nothing can save and it has almost no redeeming properties. First of all the acting, the acting in this movie was appalling especially from the children which couldn't give any convincing lines, not only that the acting from Anne Hathaway wasn't any good either, her accent was all over the place, sometimes it was German(of which it was fairly racist) other times Scottish and sometimes just her natural voice, the only half good performance in the film was Octavia Spencer who was fine but not amazing. Now onto the CGI, which may I add is absolutely terrible, the old practical effects of the original still somewhat hold up today the CGI in this movie is already dated an will properly look terrible in 3 years everything looks unrealistic and awkward. Now onto the script, some of the lines are absolutely terrible for example 'Sometimes things just happen in life' and 'a human mouse lives for about 9 years(then the grandson says) YAY we can die together' not even worried that he's gonna die in 9 years and instead says 'I won't have to learn to drive a car'. When the script wants to be funny it's not but in serious moments I couldn't help but laughing. Next the child's mentality completely changes halfway through the movie, in the bogging and even at the hotel he's quiet while when he turns into a mouse suddenly he's heroic. Now onto points about this being a remake. Honestly I didn't mind the race element with the main characters now being black, honestly I didn't mind this and I'm not sure why people are so upset. But on the other hand the witches powers completely change with them now being able to fly and extend their arms, simply for the sake of plot, this doesn't stay close the the original and actively worsens it. Now to the movies one redeeming factor and the reason I gave it 2 stars. Before I went into this movie I hadn't seen anything about it but when we got to the end and I saw it was directed by Robert Zemeckis I couldn't help but bursting into to laughter, and when the movie continued I thought it was some sought of joke(which would of brought the movie to a 7) but Robert did actually direct it which is pretty funny.Anyway, bad movie bad everything nothing good about it apart from the fact it was directed by Robert Zemeckis which made me laugh."}, {"id": 284, "text": "This is by far one of the worst movie I have ever seen.

I read a comment on youtube where a person stated that in the first movie there was a witch and in the second an alien. I couldn't agree more. And the Alien was much creepier to me (That awful creepy smile, those hands and extending arms...) The actors are great and the special effects are updated to today's tech. Didn't like the changes in the story. Okay, so in my personal experience: found it scarier and the ending with a sad note.

How is it possible that in 2020 computer imaging is looking this fake? I agree with what another reviewer posted, it seems like this whole thing was rushed. It's just plain BAD.Not to mention the utter disappointment in Anne Hathaway. Girl, what are you doing!? She's a great actress but could not muster the dark and sinister energy of Anjelica Huston to save her life. Again, in agreement with other reviews, her accent makes no sense whatsoever. Listening to her speak is cringe-worthy.Wish Stanley Tucci could have offered some comic relief, but he's barely noticeable in this film. His parts total about 90 seconds.My last takeaway is that one of the biggest disappointments is the way the witches are portrayed. Not even a little scary... even as rats. There is a clear lack of artistic direction throughout the entire film. Without any Jim Henson-type direction, this movie is a sad flop.

Aimed for your kids. But the jokes and some scenes they added for the younger audience are cheap and unnecessary.

Hathaway's Grand High Witch just isn't scary. She's too clownish, over the top and silly. There is no subtlety. No sense of controlled, calculating evil under a sophisticated, disguised surface. The worst section was the conference room scene. In the original, it was suspenseful and scary. There's no suspence in this new version, it moves very quickly, and the over the top CGI is very off-putting. The reveal of the witches true appearance happens within seconds. Bruno's arrival and transformation is similarly rushed, there's no build-up as he slowly realises he's walked into danger and that he's the of a joke but doesn't know what it is yet.I'm sure children may enjoy this version, and maybe that's all I that matters, but I think the 1990 version is far superior in its writing, performances and effects."}, {"id": 366, "text": "I don't understand the hate here, this remake is every bit as good if not better than the original.

Anne Hathaway really makes it her own. Pacing was spot on as well. Wouldn't want to say I liked this version more but it did resonate with me more.

She is immediately creepy, and rather annoying in the way she speaks. Octavia Spencer is fantastic. Kristin Chenoweth comes out of nowhere with no back story. Anne Hathaway, while great on screen, her character's accent makes her nearly incomprehensible throughout the movie. The special effects were nice, but there is very little magic to behold in this version. Viewers of the original will especially feel this during the ending.

The original was already well done and well received. So like seriously, what's the point? I love Octavia Spencer, but as another review mentioned, her performance in this felt like a rehash from The Help. The 1990's grandmother was firm, but had a mischeivious side to her. It made her character fun and loveable. I don't wanna be too hard on child actors, but again there was sense of play from the kids in the 1990 film. The 2020 child actors are pretty generic. Anyone coulda done those parts. I will also agree that their perfomances come alive when they are mice....and I'm not sure that's a good thing. Stanley Tucci is lovely as usual, but his presence cannot save the film. And Anne Hathaway.....Oh boy. I don't know how to sum it up. First off, I enjoy her in most things. I think she's a great actress. Even in this movie, her inconsistent accent didn't bother me as much as did others. That's probably because she seemed to be the only actor having any real fun. Having said that, I think she was miscast. She just doesn't have the weight and fear factor Anjelica Houston brought to the original. Houston's performance is both unhinged and hilarious. It toes the line between an kids film and macrabre. Hathaway is doing a great job but there's nothing exciting about it. She's playing the notes, but I never feel like I'm experiencing a character. Some of that can be blamed on the LAZY direction and cinematogrpahy. The shots of the original puts the viewer on edge and were designed to be unsettling. The backstory of the little girl stuck in the painting is far more effective, than the little girl turning into...a chicken. Maybe this was a more kid-friendly vibe, because I seriously doubt any kid over 6 would be afraid of this movie. I saw the original when I was 9, and it immediately left an impression! The 1990 film had charming characters you root for, the world had atmosphere, it felt full and it had (gasp) WITCHES!! As in plural!! Not just Anne Hathaway doing all the heavy lifting while, these were extras stand back and do little to nothing. In the original the witches were threatening, yet entertaining because they ALL seemed to want children dead. In this film, Hathaway seems to be the only Witch hellbent on stopping the kiddies. Its like the director forgot to tell them to look engaged. The whole remove your wig scene is so lackluster. Seriously, when they are trying to step on the mice/kids, their feet even looked bored. Their feet lol! So again, why bother???I mean... I kinda like the twist of the little boy's pet mouse. That was cute I guess. But otherwise, this was a dud. Maybe if movies cut down the CGI, and focus on storytelling, they'd stand a chance of leaving a lasting impression."}, {"id": 380, "text": "The Witches is surely not Oscar material, nor cult-level stuff like the heyday Zemeckis you might expect.

It is a very decent if not very straightforward remake that perhaps simplifies Roald Dahl's story a bit to be a bit cleaner cut whilst keeping it fresh and modern. Just enough backstory is given to keep children aware and adults interested. The movie has beautiful visuals and the acting is actually very good with special mentions going to both Octavia Spencer and Anne Hathaway's performances.The latter I tried to dislike but her habit of chewing the scenery and penchant for over the top villainy make her a perfect villain although at times, her attempt at an Eastern European accent can be a bit jarring. The child actors, Jahzir Kareem Bruno and Codie-Lei Eastick, we see in the lead roles are both very good in their limited screen time and their voice overs are professional. As an African-American male, I personally enjoyed the subtle references which came off as relatable but not too forced as to make it exploitative especially in a children's film.

I watched them back to back and here's what I think. The original scared me when I was a child. I really liked the original look of the original GHW because it made her stand out from all the others. The original was creepy, but it also had better make up for the witches. I like how they didn't make the shoe and wig removal in the old movie so dramatic. I take off my shoes everyday, but I don't sigh in relief acting as if my parents didn't discover I hid a stash of Halloween candy under my bed. The original I felt could've touched up on some things and toned down on others. For example, we didn't really need the chase scene in the original. I like how they made it more direct and straight to the point in the new one. One thing I've noticed is people complaining about Anne Hathaway's accent. I actually loved her accent. I like how it was Russian and Scottish and Swedish all at once. I also like how it had more of a backstory in the new one. By that I mean how the grandma was a voodoo priestess and knew all about witches. I like how they made the new one with less adult aspects like the manager hitting on the chambermaid. Octavia Spencer was kinda perfect for the role of the grandma. I like how they used more humorous scenes. I think they could've put a little more thought into the transformation in the original, but overall both movies were good.

We then almost immediately see them at the exact hotel she chooses to go to in order to avoid witches because 'it's full of rich white people' and the first child the Witches turn into a mouse is a rich white child!It's scary and confusing for children and completely naff for adults. It's lost all the charm of the book, has ostracized people with disabilities and decided to bring class and race into the picture without any context and then in schizophrenic fashion turns that on its head anyway!I can't find anything redeeming about it.

The story became excited since the witch appeared until the middle of the film, which the protagonist and her friends had to fight against the witch and her pensioners. The fight scene is so fun.

Anne Hathaway was creepy-ish I guess, but would've been better without the stupid extending arms. Overall her transformation was underwhelming.

Where to start? I'll hold off on the book comparison for now. The dialogue was incredibly dry and most of it was pointless. The direction, cinematography and editing were just disappointing. The vibes of the movie just weren't at all what they should've been, and attempts at being scary just came off as slightly disgusting and unecessary. The pacing of the movie was not good - at one point I thought they did a pretty good job with building up suspense, but they didn't carry out the execution of it well, and just like that, the scene became absolute garbage - to say the least, I was disappointed. Now onto book comparisons. I was pretty disappointed with the high witch, the grandma, and the boy. I thought the high witch (though I love Anne Hathaway) had lost all of her sleek and silent charms (with her long black dress and hair, along with her ruthless and bloddchilling smile) was now portrayed to be an overly flamboyant woman, who was excesseively dramatic if I may add. The classiness of Roald Dahl's high witch was nowhere to be seen in this movie. The movie version of the grandma was not the strong and silent woman that I had come to love when I read this book as a child. She was not a witch hunter who smoked cigars, and was constantly on the brink of death. Instead she was a woman who wore bright dresses and tried to make the boy DANCE with her after his parents had just died. I also thought they made the movie grandma too young; the book grandma looked like she would kick the bucket any minute. Octavia Spencer acted well, but I just thought the writers had completely changed the vibe of the movie by making her a fun grandma (so to say). Some additional gripes: the movie starts off as being narrated by none other than Chris Rock, who by nature has an excited and fun voice. This immediately sets the movie up as a fun family flick, and from the very beginning the eeriness and the bone-chillingness of the book has already been lost. The girl mouse (??????) Daisy, or should I say Mary, is already set up as a stereotypical girl character inserted just so they could have a girl character. She is seen examining her nails, checking her hair, when SHE IS A LITERAL CHILD. WHY WOULD THEY FEEL THE NEED TO MAKE A CHILD ACT LIKE THAT? Just to distinguish her from the boy mice? Oh yeah, the gender roles are strong in this one. I dont know how to argue for this point without it sounding wrong, but in the book, the Norweigian-ness of the whole story added such a distinct flavour of smoggy, dark mystery, but the movie has nothing close to that. Roald Dahl, being Norweigian himself, has inserted parts of his life and emotions into the book, and that personal touch is missing from the movie. Anyway to recap, here's what was bad: dialogue, directing, cinematography, atmosphere, writing, the characters and the randomly enforced gender roles in a mouse. One could argue, it's just a kid's movie, stop holding everything against the book for comparison. We KNOW you love the book and think it's a classic, but jeez, leave the movie alone. Okay, I'll stop comparing it to the book, but even then. It's literally just a bad movie. I really don't how else to put it - this movie sucked. It was arguably one of the worst movies I've seen this year. That's the end of my review, sorry for ranting, and thanks for reading :)"}, {"id": 463, "text": "Absolutely NOT a movie for children. 15+ I'll say. Nice cast, bad acting.

The previews looked great - I liked that they mixed up the storyline a little by changing the setting, adding in new characters and changing the approach. I really like Anne Hathaway, and she was certainly the standout in this rendition, but that might be all I can say for it.The movie started out well. I liked the way they introduced the characters. I think updating the witches and the setting of the story was smart - it was a great way to reach a broader audience. I also liked how they showed the bond between the central two after the loss of his parents/her daughter. It was sweet and the young man in the movie was doing a great job, definitely a talented young actor. But the movie took a nose dive as soon as Grandma started talking about witches.Turning Grandma into the backstory, authority on witches, and moral compass was a huge mistake. I realize that getting Octavia Spencer in probably required a larger role, but this was ridiculous. I didn't mind that she had her own story about them, honestly. But she just kept yammering on (in many scenes, about all things) - it made the movie drag and removed a lot of plot discoveries. She spelled everything out and it really took away the magic of Roald Dahl's story. Even the 'will they make it' moments were destroyed by their existing knowledge from grandma. She knew way too much about the witches and magic in general, which is not really well explained (other than being a voodoo priestess, maybe). Her character was terribly written and played way too large of a role.Still, I was prepared to come on here and say watch it, you might think it is OK if you like this style of storytelling. I was even prepared to give it a middle of the line grade. While boring, they did really recreate this, rather than try to duplicate the original. I was happy to look past poor graphics and CGI (the budget for which was clearly thrown into the cast). I thought, someone will like this well enough. Then, they did something ridiculous...They don't change back! You have a young boy who is happy to live maybe 9 years as a mouse, no 'good witch' to fix the situation, and everyone is just cool with the fact that Bruno's parents are going to pass on him if he is a mouse. The ending they created just destroyed anything positive you could say up until this point. Every choice was bad (aside from chasing after all the bad witches).

He normally gets on my nerves a tiny bit but I thought he was perfect in it. 4. Stanley Tucci can do no wrong in my eyes. Even when his willy is being bitten by a rat.Ok, now let's address the glaringly obvious flaws of this film... 1. Anne Hathaway. No she was never going to measure up to Angelica Houston but to fall this short is a travesty. Her accent is absolutely disastrous and that's not the worst of it. She TOTALLY overacted and brought absolutely NO class to the role of the Grand High Witch. 2. The CGI. What the hell were they thinking?! Again, totally overdone and unnecessary.

I loved the kid, he did the best, but not for too long. Chris Rock's voice was so annoying, it made the whole plot sound ridiculous. My expectations were much higher when I saw Anne Hathaway is going to be the Grand Witch. Her acting was okay, the makeup was just stupid. Why did the witches have to be so fashionable I don't understand. Concerning the witches, they barely had a say during the entire movie. The CGI was unbelievably poor.

I guess they want to stick with the original book ending. Because in the book he does not turn back human.

I was watching this version and like OK there is no witch that honestly feels bad about this. All witches are evil And all of them are turned into mice.

The original film starring Anjelica Huston gives us a much deeper insight of the story and is not as superficial as this one. It is funny and sad in a way and has a much better ending ( not sure what the ending in the book is, but this one was really unsatisfying). Anne Hathaway is really bad. She really overdid it and overacts her role to death. And while I generally really enjoyed the effects and male up work in this film (one of the better aspects) why did she look like a female Venom? Octavia Spencer tried her best and she did have some fine moments but was just too cute and nice for he own good at times. But still one of the better aspects of the film.

It's like trying to redo hannibal or beetlejuice some roles are so iconic they cant be copied . This is a disaster and Anne Hathaway was HORRIBLE, and her accents were atrocious.

She does do a very good job though. It's essentially the exact same storyline, but instead of Angelica Houston as the grand High witch, it's Anne Hathaway, and instead of Mr Bean (A.k.a. Rowan Atkinson) as the hotel manager it's Stanley Tucci. I remember the part where she turns into a wedge and turns the kid into a mouse as one of the most terrifying experiences of my childhood. This version doesn't exactly do you as well in that department, but maybe it's geared towards an even younger audience. Remember our twisted 80s movies used to be even for kids? They just don't do that anymore."}, {"id": 496, "text": "A young wannabe witch from the Midwest gets more than she bargained for when she moves to New York to become a full time professional witch and ends up as assistant to a tyrannical, thundering editor-in-chief of Witches Weekly magazine. Hilarity ensues..."}, {"id": 497, "text": "To start off, I did not dislike this version. There are many positives in this film but I was hoping for a more Coraline type of feel and the final product was too family friendly yet also a little too dark for young kids. Had GDT stayed on as director, we would've had a phenomenal film. Zemeckis just has seemed to lost his touch over the years, having more flops than successes. This movie had a phenomenal cast, many Oscar winners working on the film, and yet it still left a lot to be desired.When comparing this version to the 1990 version- I like the grandma character more in this version though I'm sad they didn't do more with her past. Not to mention they could have went into all of her stories. This was a huge missed opportunity by all those involved. The grandson actor is good but he's very subdued until he turns into a mouse. It feels like two different people. Same as with Bruno to an extent. Though, I liked that Bruno was like-able and I liked Mary but once again they should've shown her taking chocolate from the GHW and turning into a mouse. Anne Hathaway did good, they could have made the ballroom scene more demented and darker. There were so many things left out of the book in regards to this scene that I would have liked to of seen- the demented songs, the laser type sparks coming out of her eyes to fry the witch was scarier in the book. Not to mention the absence of the mask. I liked the grandma's house better in the old one but I liked the hotel more in this one. The set was impressive as far as the hotel goes. Though the grandma was wealthy as a kid and as an adult. They missed so many opportunities showing her childhood experiences with witches, her family vacations, and having a large Tudor house. Especially with race-bending. I always pictured her and her husband being anthropologists or something similar where they could travel a lot but with the hidden agenda of witch hunting. The CGI was a miss in this version for the most part. Not awful but far from what it could've been. GDT initially wanted this film to be stop motion. And there were elements that just could've been scarier and closer to the book. The depth just wasn't there. I didn't like the ending in either version really. I didn't like the witch show down in her room in this version. At all. They should have ended with the grandmother and grandson (and friends maybe) going to the GHW's castle and carrying out there plan. Another HUGE opportunity missed. I didn't like all the changes they made to witches features but the wide smile was unsettling. I liked that the GHW looked deceptively young and pretty in the original but was actually very old underneath her mask. The wide smile could've included scarier sequences (like gnawing off the grandmother's thumb as a kid). I missed the absence of blue spit and little tid bits that the grandmother learned.Hopefully Warner Brothers will lend out rights down the road or do another version with a better direction. This version wasn't awful but far from what it should have been. Had GDT, Henry Selick or Taika Waititi been the director this movie could have been 10/10 instead of a 6 or 7 out of 10."}, {"id": 498, "text": "I grew up loving the original Witches movie with Angelica Huston! As a little girl it used to give me goosebumps! Now older, I was so excited for this remake. They sometimes say remakes and the second movie isn't quite like the first or as good as the first movie. It has majority of the same theme/plot/characters, but Anne Hathaway playing the Grand High Witch is very different than the original performance. I think she did a great job, but it was a lot of CGI (her mouth in particular), which at times felt a little distracting. The children mice were SO adorable, and Octavia was so delightful playing the grandma. Your kids might be a little afraid of some of the CGI, but it was not more scary than the first in my opinion. It was still so fun to watch, and people are tough critics these days, so I'd take the really harsh reviews with a grain of salt."}, {"id": 499, "text": "What a great family movie to see, can't recommend it enough for families with kids that haven't seen the original or even have seen the original. We enjoyed it from start to finish. The actor's were all great especially the grand mother and the Cgi was great also. Go see this movie and don't worry about all the negativity from other reviewers. I totally understand that all people have opinions but Seriously 1/10 what the f@#k, you'd be the type of person to complain about everything. It's 2020 so I should expect it wouldn't be like the original and made for the current generation. If kids could review on here they would praise it because in the theatre we watched it in there was laughter and cringing, ohhhs and arhhhs in all the right spots. Support your local cinema, would be a shame to see them close down because of Covid and unfair reviews of a great movie."}, {"id": 500, "text": "Dont get me wrong, Anne Hathaway was great for the Grand High Witch and is a worthy competitor for Anjelica Huston but her accents were all over the place. For me, that was the only bad part. It was very enjoyable and stays true to the book. It's a new take on the 1990 one and I hate to say this, but the 1990 one is inferior it only did better in the practical effects department. The 2020 version does everything better from describing in detail, casting, acting and has a well respected director (Robert Zemeckis, Back to the Future). Additionally, the actors (mostly actress') are Oscar and Emmy winning actors like Octavia Spencer, Anne Hathaway and Stanley Tucci. I could go on forever why this version is superior but I must leave it at that."}, {"id": 501, "text": "This film was weirdly inconsistent with its tone. The book and the original movie both had scary parts but they were both overall kids stories with some adult humour sprinkled in, but this film had both moments that were too kiddy, and moments that were straight up IT levels of horror.This movie is rated M here in Australia (PG-13 equivalent) and in terms of content, there are definitely parts that stand out as being deserving of that rating. This movie will straight up scar kids if they watch it too young, in particular the scene where the main character transforms into a mouse, as well as the design of the Grand High Witch (played wonderfully by Anne Hathaway) whose stretchd out grin and three-fingered claw hands are somewhat reminiscient of Pennywise from IT.However, once the kids are changed into mice, the film becomes a very silly kids movie, becoming entirely tonally distinct from the first half of the movie, to the point that a lot of the tension that was in the original book is removed and pacified.One significant change from the book and first adaptation is the fact that the main character (who remains nameless in this version like in the book) and his Grandma are black. Of course, I have no issue with this, and I think that they do some interesting stuff with it in the beginning, but they seem to forget this change and play the rest of the film straight from the pages. For example, when Grandma and the kid first arrive at the hotel, they put an emphasis on the fact that most of the hotel staff are black and are surprised that they are serving a black woman and her grandson instead of their usual white guests, but none of the other characters, not even the white upper class guests seem to care. Keep in mind that the film is set in the 1970s in the Southern United States.Another addition is the character of Mary. In the book, the main character had a pet mouse, and that remains true in this adaptation, but a new change was that the pet mouse is also, coincidentally, a person who was transformed into a mouse by a witch before the events of the film, and just coincidentally ended up in the main character's hands. I'm guessing this, alongside the decision to expand the role of Bruno (the other kid who is changed into a mouse) was done to make the ending of the film less tragic than the book. In the end of the book, the main character stays a mouse for the rest of his life, and it's implied that he and his grandmother die together because mice don't live that long. This was also changed in the 1990 movie, where a good witch turns the main character back into a human, but this version is an in-between, that while the kids stay mice, all three of them stay together, and wit hthe help of Grandma, start a witch hunting club, which I think is an okay ending.Overall, this film's weird tonal issues is my main problem with this film. Too scary for kids, and too childish for older Roald Dahl fans, but there were still plenty of moments that were enjoyable. While I don't particularly like the older 1990 movie, I would say that one is a bit better over this one."}, {"id": 502, "text": "I read some reviews &amp; wow, some of y'all need a hobby/life.

It's a she, what's his name HER name is Daisy etc.To those championing the original, remember Roald Dahl wanted his name taken off of the credits because he didn't like the way it ended, it wasn't true to his tale, I find it exceptionally bad that his name and production company is stamped all over this film that changes the bits it does, while I can't speak for him, I very much doubt he would have wanted his name associated with this train wreck of a remake.It got 2 bits right.... but so much more wrong"}, {"id": 542, "text": "Everyone here seems to be a little confused...

Her performance as The Grand High Witch is the main highlight of the film, although there are many highlights. The cast is brilliant, I was just as impressed with Octavia Spencer and of course Stanley Tucci was great, providing some laughs and reuniting with Anne Hathway.

The plot, although differing from the book in settings was just as coincidental as it always has been and kept the fundamentals alive.Our only concern was maybe it could have been 20 minutes longer just to tie up the story better and make it more fluid and my daughter would have liked the very ending to be like the 1990s version, (She loves a happy happy ending!) but, it was well acted, mild threats kept light hearted and fun all round.Perfect for little ones and adults alike that enjoy a take on a kids classic and remember it is not an epic!"}, {"id": 593, "text": "Fun, but no rival.

The turban witch sounds like a snake, Anne sounds like a cat, etc. They aren't born anyway, being hatched, and live presumably long lives, so they likely wouldn't have to stick with just one accent.But...the ending...was horrendous.

I thought this movie took place in a later time period because, seeing as the characters were people of color in the 60s, them being able to get that hotel stay wasn't nearly suspicious enough to the people. Sure they were questioned but it wasn't sufficient enough I'd think. Another thing, there's many scenes in the movie where your expectations are diverted but certainly not in the good way. You see some situation that could turn out bad, nothing bad happens. I have no clue what it is but this movie felt like it was purposely trying not to traumatize the child audiences like the first movie adaptation did. They fail, with absolutely horrifying sound effects and transformation sequences, but even still they somehow decided that watering down the action sequences would be smart. There's a scene where the 3 mice characters are passing through the hotel. At every turn, you feel like someone will spot them, something will happen. They make mistakes, are all over the place, even get spotted by one cleaning lady at one point. Every other character just blows it off as her being conveniently dramatic and it doesn't even pose a problem, it just moves on. Throughout it was just Oh no here's where they get caught or Oh yeah the camera is going to pan down to reveal the cat is waiting for him or SOMETHING but none of it ever comes. What does happen though? This TERRIFYINGLY bleak ending. The mice are NEVER turned back to people. NEVER. That's so TRAGIC. They're just fine with it even though at the end this kid-turned mouse is just like, I'm happy I'm a mouse now, I can die at the same time as you grandma. Like, OH MY GOD THAT'S SO SAD. He's like 14 in human years now and he's just TOTALLY fine with dying. Did he have no hopes? No dreams? I genuinely think this kid is just so traumatized from his parents dying like 30 seconds into the film and no one taking this horrible trauma seriously (the grandma literally just makes him dance it off like WHAT) and him being unable to get help that he oppresses it and it eventually turns into this CHILD wanting to DIE at like 14. I do not get it, this movie is so sad and horribly heartbreaking and we never even find out what the other two kid-mice went on to do, are they a part of the witch hunters??? I HAVE NO CLUE. Not to MENTION how that couple just...ACCEPTS THEY'VE LOST THEIR SON FOREVER WHEN GOING TO LEAVE THE HOTEL. THESE PARENTS HAVE LOST THEIR CHILD AND DO NOTHING. HE'S DEAD TO THEM. WHAT. Anyway yeah watch this movie for an anxiety inducing, bleak tale of children being turned to mice and no one being able to stop or reverse it so instead they probably poison a chef who went to check to see if the pea soup was good (y'know chefs taste the food before sending it out but I guess that dude's just gone, now that I think about it how did they know the soup was bland as humans?

I can't stress enough how much this irritates me. I'm not saying this film is all that great though, as it has as many misfires as it does gems. For all the decent performances, impressive practical effects and playful cinematography, there's also a sordid first half of the narrative, bland characters and horrifying CGI.

I love Octavia Spencer and I cant fault bar character, shes animated, but plays it well enough. The little boy is fine too. Nice lot of celebrities also. It doesnt start as sinister as you would hope, I love the original film as a kid and adult, and the scary ness of it. It was fine until the first which entered and it was abit cringey. Then it was ok until the witches enter the hotel. They're all bright and not scary, ok fine. But then shes holding an adult cat, and not that it's really relevant but if you have ever tried holding a sizable cat on one arm, it doesnt come off like it does in the film, but hey, I digress. The meeting in the hall has hardly any witches, you expect at least double. Anne Hathaway was the wrong choice. Her acting is laughable and not scary, her accent... she sounds Norwegian, scottish and Russian rather than German. Shes overacting, but not in an Angelica Houston scary way, in a sad as if meant to be funny way. When the witches take off their shoes you can basically see the toes they supposedly dont have, thay was kinda lazy. She floats all cringey, she doesnt look scary, but like a pretty clown(?) The cgi is sad, not scary. When she says witches, she sounds like shes saying b***hes. The mice make you forget your supposed to be scared, they make you think you're watching stuart little or something. I got abit bored after that, but wanted to see how it ended. Stanley tucci should have been in it more. Needed better witches. Needed better effects or cgi. Meh, may turn it off before then end... Ps. Watched abit further on and it continues to be cringey. Her accent continues to be bad. But she mentions she has selective food disorder and calls it picky eaters. This is slightly offensive to those with this eating disorder, that is real. The struggle is real. So I continued to watch despite my instinct to turn it off. The witches turn into crazed rats by doing a weird bang poof on the ceiling, yawn and just prior ann Hathaway reveals herself to be a witch by doing magic in the dining room by moving a table out of the way and no one seems to notice. Then she reveals herself to the grandma and I think, why cos they pretend not to be witches. But hey. Anne Hathaway's acting and accent continue to be embarrassing.

It just takes away from the original and that is not what you want when you are making a remake.Like i was looking forward to seeing the hotel in this film. The original hotel was so iconic to me, it just really stuck with me and when i watched it was like like i really want to go to this fabulous hotel on the cost in the UK. This hotel looked so bad, i honestly think it was CGI. It looked fake, like all the exterior shots looked like it was a CGI hotel.Speaking of CGI, there is so much in this film and it just looks stupid. They lean so heavy on it. The original uses make up and animatronics so well and it just works to make the film seem more rooted in our word and just more pleasing to look at. I also think it is incredibly lazy to just CGI. That word pretty much sums up this movie.The acting was fine apart from Anne who was chewing up the scenery like it was going out of fashion. She was the best part of the move i guess. Well her costumes were to be honest. But they even used CGI in her costumes!! It was infuriating. Her accent was absolutely horrible tho.

The story is similar enough to be considered a remake, but the minor differences keep it interesting!It's been given the Hollywood treatment for sure, so it's far glossier/more polished than the original, but having just watched them back to back, unless it's just nostalgia you're after, then that's no bad thing I promise.Overall the quality of the story itself shines through, and if you just want to have some fun watching it then you will certainly do just that.If you're looking to review it for Oscar-worthiness then maybe reassess your expectations, chill out and grab a drink.

If you read all the negative reviews they are mostly from those who think one race or color can do abetter job and question the cast. Who cares!! Watch it, smile, enjoy and go on with your lives! Don't rate a movie lower because a character is not of the race in the original or what YOU wanted. The rest reviewers who are asking why the movie was even made? Here's the truth about those nonsense reviews, MOST of them did NOT watch the movie so their reviews are biased and inappropriate. Nothing wrong with remakes and this is a great story to remake. It's a kid's movie, but we see old angry folks sitting behind a keyboard and trashing a good story.Is the movie, the best ever 10/10 Well, not really... Is it good? Yes it is! Is the movie better than the original( I watched the original 3 times)? No it is not,but it has a great flare and spins. It a nice refresh and a story you want to experience again. Not to mention the fact, millenials often don't want to see 30-year old movies and they would connect better. So if you are 50, and angry, it is YOU who is a problem.

Take a break, Zemeckis.In this fantasy film set in 1968 Alabama, an orphaned young boy stumbles across a conference of witches while staying with his grandmother at a hotel. Based on the book by Roald Dahl.Aside from fun performances from Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer, The Witches relies too much on CGI, which in my opinion is making movies worse with every use. What happened to getting a real cat in a movie? Is it really about animal rights or more because Hollywood doesn't want to train an animal to sit on Anne Hathaway's forearm? Chris Rock as the narrator was a nice touch and the highlight of the film.

My family thought it would be a good idea to watch the 1990 one day and watch the other tomorrow and I just loved the 1990 version it is a classic but when we started this version.... well let's just say I was ready to gouge my eyes out. And to think that such great actors and actresses like Anne Hathaway and Octivia Spencer were in such a train wreck of a movie. My first complaint is that this movie uses an overly amount of CGI where it's to the point where it makes the Green Lantern movie look like Avatar. My second complaint is that it they didn't have the setting anywhere near England, seriously the book and original movie take place in Norway and another place I can't remember, not in Chicago. My final complaint is the acting, even though Anne Hathaway wasn't terrible it was still a little over the top with the accent and all, and Octavia Spencer's character is basically a rip-off of her character in The Help. In conclusion, the people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves and apologize profusely for this movie.

I LOVE Robert Zemeckis (we share a birthday and he's a great storyteller fun fact, also sharing a birthday with George Lucas). There was nothing wrong with the original, however technology gives you a little more room to play with the execution of the storytelling. None the less, a lot of the 1 star ratings were simply because the leads were black? Seriously, it was compared over 4 times to a 'what if' a historically black film was revised with an all white cast. Which is extremely demonstrative of their ignorance because that has already been done with a lot of literature and black characters. As well as people stating this is a political remake, when no one really thinks that until you factor in their own insecurities of having minorities in leading roles. Anyway, I don't love Anne Hathaway... her acting was a little much, but that may have been how the director wanted it played. No one can really recreate that Anjelica Houston portrayal but she does it in her own way which is what an actress is supposed to do. It's just a bit distracting from the story. Overall a great FAMILY film. One person did say it wasn't as scary as I remembered it as a kid. Which I agree with, but you may not realize that fear as an adult. Seeing those feet, mouths and claws may be more of an impact for a child, or it may have purposefully been made kid friendlier. Because I was 4ish when the original came out and I couldn't sit through it I remember being terrified. that also may be the difference between CGI and practical effects. Still a great watch, people who rated it poorly where looking for an updated remake without it being updated. It's not a transformer movie it's a Roald Dahl adaption. I and a lot of people can feel apart of the story now with a lead character portrayed by people of color."}, {"id": 671, "text": "I just don't understand why they remade this movie, especially since they did it almost scene for scene only worse. Unlike some other comments I didn't mind the spin of swapping the main characters out for African Americans, I just don't think it added anything.It's hard pinpointing exactly what went wrong here, but the whole film just felt off, you didn't feel like you were watching actual characters...but actors acting like characters, which makes a huge difference. Octavia Spenser has done some great roles throughout the years and she just didn't seem to put much effort into this. Anne Hathaway has also done some great roles...and it seems she put TOO much effort into it. It felt like she was trying too hard the whole time. And every other character is basically forgettable, including the lead child. Who was actually pretty good I think, just underutilized because the voice over by Chris Rock basically stole all the kids thunder by explaining everything he had already done, was doing, or going to do. Let the damn kid act.Finally there was something odd with the special effects, some scenes lead me to believe they might have originally intended for this to be in 3D for a theatrical release, so you have these weird CGI sequences where they're reaching or running right at the screen and it comes off looking out of place. Which was really the case for the whole movie, just nothing seemed to work together and it results in a movie that just feels completely unneeded.As a complete side note on what could have actually worked...change up the story a little bit to have the black leads have an actual backstory as to why they're there. If they'd put a French spin on it then the African Americans could have been the descendants of Creole slaves or immigrants who'd had dealings with witches on the European continent. I think that would have been a fun twist instead of just essentially making them movie props for a diversity quota."}, {"id": 672, "text": "As someone who grew up with The original film I wondered if they would make a crappy remake. The simple answer is no, I don't think they did. The film closely follows the Original with very minor tweaks to make it unique. The design of the Witches is Fantastic, maybe not as creepy as the original Grand High witch but definitely kept some creepiness to it. The unique change of a third mouse brings more uniqueness to the story if only slightly. And The Soundtrack is great! Picked some great 60s/70s songs and The Orchestrated Music Really adds to each scene! The few turnoffs (of which there were few) for me were :The crassness of the Grandmother towards the beginning. I get it was to help the kid but she basically tells him to stop crying about something traumatic.The use of CGI for every animal. It worked don't get me wrong but even the Grand High Witches cat was CGI. I feel it wasn't necessary even if it was to set up perch scenes a cat wouldn't normally do.Beyond that the film is great for all ages. Parents warned: Your little ones may be afraid of The Grand High Witch scenes after they take the disguises off. It's nothing major, a little CGI editing to the mouth and some practical/CGI claws on her hands but might be enough to scare.

While critics might be quick to dismiss the film in comparison to the original 1990 adaptation, it has potential to be a sleeper hit and gain a cult following for future generations.Anne Hathaway gives a GRAND performance as the Grand High Witch, with classic campy terror and vaudevillian shtick humor (minus the dodgy German accent). Although Hathaway might not instill the same terror upon younger viewers as Anjelica Houston, she none the less delivers a balanced and entertaining performance that is all her own. Let's just say that if you are a fan of Miss Hathaway, you will be content with her performance, and may never be able to watch The Princess Diaries or The Dark Knight Rises like you once did. A true testament to the raw talent that Hathaway has.Octavia Spencer plays the role of the grandmother with all the tough love and southern spunk that you would expect to find in a grandmother. Spencer might have been too young to play a grandmother, but her mild mannered yet passionate performance, radiates the film against the madness in Hathaway's performance. Clear eyed, charming, witty, and devoid of irony, Spencer nearly outshines Hathaway when they are on screen together.The highest praise of this film goes to Hollywood newcomer, Jahzir Bruno, playing the hero boy who triumphs against the forces of evil. Bruno was perfectly cast in this role, and despite his young age, is very believable and sincere in his delivery. His character is perfectly relatable, down to earth, humble, and never displays any obnoxious adolescent moments. While watching the movie, kids will identify with his fears, and adults will be moved by his bravery and loyalty to those he loves."}, {"id": 674, "text": "In 1968, a young Hero Boy is forced to go live with his grandma (Octavia Spencer) after losing his parents in a car accident.

She takes him to a seaside hotel for an escape hoping that witches would not search there since black children are rarely at the luxury hotel. Unfortunately, the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) has gathered her followers to present a potion to turn all children into mice.This is the second film adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book. The 1990 adaptation stars Anjelica Huston and is a fan favorite. It's probably a fool's errand to try to do another. The only reason is to upgrade the mice with CGI and that's often a bad idea. The charm of the old animatronics is actually more timeless than CGI which ages over time. It does inject some American racial divide into the story but the movie drops that interesting take rather quickly. The one awful thing it does is to replace the greatness of Huston with a terribly weird Joker-smiling Hathaway. It is bad. There is no good reason for this movie and watching it proves that."}, {"id": 675, "text": "When The Witches 2020 was announced I was completely shocked and excited.

Couple weeks later Octavia Spencer and Stanley Tucci were added as well and I was all on board! Since COVID19 cancelled theaters to release films regularly, Warner Bros and HBOMax worked together to release it streaming on only HBOMax this October.Now the original 1990 film is and always will be iconic for Angelica Hustons' performance as The Grand High Witch is unlike anything. Anne Hathaway sold that role in a different way and it worked! As well as everyone else in the cast are all really good. There are certain aspects closer to the book and some different. Book had claws for fingers and nostrils and toes and the grand high witch being pretty but has a mask to cover her face. This version had everything that the book had expect her scary face was an elongated mouth and only came out when she was furious. I loved this touch and some won't at all. I will always be a fan of the 1990 version being so advanced with prosthetic puppets and makeup can appreciate its originality! As a whole I loved this re-imagined version by the iconic Robert Zemeckis and produced by Guillermo del Toro they did a great job. Some aspects are closer to the novel and minor changes, don't go in expecting the original. Go with an open mind. Do not listen to the negative reviews I didn't understand.

She seemed like she was trying real hard I guess but it came off really tacky and the cgi did not do well in replacement of the practical effects. The mice were so hilarious and cute in the 90s version, and the grand high witch was perceived as something ancient, outer worldly and truely malevolent. You could tell that all the other witches feared and worshipped her. In this, Anne Hathaway is more of rich snob if anything, and her accent is so all over the place it's hard to take seriously. I didn't understand the purpose of the big teeth either (if they don't actually use it eat children - what is point of it?) seemed like something that sounded creepy on paper but doesn't make much sense beyond that.

And whilst Dahl might be turning over in his grave, it doesn't detract away from the fact that for kids, this film is lighthearted, fun and enjoyable.9/10"}, {"id": 680, "text": "I decided to give this a go because I'm a HUGE fan of the original, I knew this would be bad but I saw the names of Robert Zemeckis, Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuar\u00f2n attached to it and thought it may actually be decent.... How wrong I was.As I watched the first 10 minutes, I knew this would be bad. I'm not going to bore everyone with attempting to act like a professional movie critic and talk about a load of technical things.The entire movie is made out of CGI. Poor character models, ridiculous looking animals, fake EVERYTHING. Literally, everything was fake. And it looked it too. I've seen better CGI in 80s and 90s movies and YouTube fan films. I mean, what's wrong with dressing people up and playing the part and actually looking real? Why computerise everything and make it look cartoony as hell.Anne Hathaway did a decent job, her accent was weird but her acting was pretty darn good and scared the hell out of my young siblings but her characters' design was ridiculously fake, silly and ultimately, flawed. Hathaway and the brilliant Octavia Spencer did a good job acting wise but it wasn't enough to save this film.The original had heart, soul and genuine magic that drew people in. The remake has none of that. I'm surprised that Zemeckis, Del Toro and Cuar\u00f2n are even involved in this. Why make this film? Why spend money to butcher and destroy the name of a wonderful Film and book? Roald Dahl's name should be nowhere near this remake. It's an insult.PLEASE Hollywood, stop disrespecting and destroying classic movies."}, {"id": 681, "text": "I'm not sure where to begin on this one, so let's wind the clocks back to 1990 and talk about the original film based on the same book. While I haven't read the Roald Dahl classic book of the same name, I enjoyed the creativity throughout the first adaptation of his work. The Witches from 1990 had many issues and stretched out a very small story to fill the run time of a feature film, which was absolutely the most notable negative of that film for me, as it was for this 2020 version as well. At a mere 105 minutes, Robert Zemeckis' The Witches felt like an eternity to sit through and missed the mark almost entirely for me.This film begins with a montage of images that showcase the fact that witches exist in this world. After the death of his parents, a young boy and his grandma flea to an expensive hotel, where they can get away from the witches, whom they believe are following them. Without knowing it, they end up going to this hotel during some form of witch conference. This in turn leads to this young boy being turned into a mouse by them, as well as another young boy at the hotel. The two of them, along with another mouse, venture around the hotel, trying to escape from these witches.The premise itself is the most intriguing part, as it's equally strange and fun. With that said, the idea was created as a book, then as a mediocre film in 1990, and now remake nearly exactly the same in every way. Because it did nothing new with the material, I have nothing but criticism honestly, aside from one major thing that I really appreciated. Without ruining it, the original film ends in a way that left me disappointed, but this remake actually had the guts to do something that I wished the original had done. For that reason, I give this film a little praise, but that's just how the film ends because the rest is absolutely the same.I admit that I was enjoying the first act of this film because Octavia Spencer made for a very enjoyable grandmother to this young boy and I would've loved more of that. Sadly, once they get to the hotel, the movie takes no chances and the witches themselves chew up the scenery, and not in a good way. Anne Hathway plays the head witch and although she's absolutely committed to the role and having a blast, I just found her performance to be way too overdone. I commend her for going all out, but it didn't work for me. This was a major issue because she has more than half of the screentime of the duration of the movie.In the end, Robert Zemeckis is a director that I love, but his latest efforts in Allied, Welcome to Marwen, and now The Witches have all been less than stellar to say the least. I thought The Walk and Flight were great films, but I haven't truly loved one of his films since Cast Away, which was 20 years ago. On top of that, Zemeckis also wrote the screenplay with both Kenya Barris and Guillermo del Toro, so I'm really not sure how all those creative brains just made a copy and paste of the original. There was so much talent behind the lens here and I'm still scratching my head as to how this was the final result. I don't believe this film is worth anyone's time, but it's now available through HBO if you wish."}, {"id": 682, "text": "How on earth does it make sense to, in the name of being inclusive to minorities, adapt a book written by a Norwegian-English author that revolves around the land of his heritage, and completely Americanize every aspect of it! To me this screams blind ethnocentrism. Now, I think it could be justified if there was a point, like in order to stick to the spirit of the original that may be lost otherwise. But this isn't the case.As with so many of the introduced elements to this adaptation, there is no real point at all. I won't give spoilers, but time and again, a new character or ability is introduced. You start thinking to yourself, I wonder how this is going to be used in the story to create new conflict, build tension, add depth, or set up a more epic confrontation. Each time, you are let down. As soon as something new is introduced, it is promptly forgotten, and the result is that this wasted time and distraction waters down the original story. Tense, climactic moments are simplified and hurried through in the most pedestrian way possible. Both the book and the 1990 film were so much better in terms of storytelling.They also introduced plot holes so big that they confused my children on more than one occasion. I am pretty forgiving when it comes to plot holes in children's stories, but it does get to a point where it's off-putting, like, They're just dumb kids, it doesn't matter.The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of one change I came to appreciate--the addition of the snake-like mouths for the witches. It does add to the feeling that the witches are inhuman creatures which is in line with the source material.The last issue, the one that makes it really hard to give even 2 stars, is how mind-numbingly lame the dialogue is. I'm not sure this is a direct quote, Those mean, nasty witches, are really mean, nasty and evil! but it's hard to keep track because there are probably 50 or so analogues. That and characters awkwardly stating the obvious to the viewer: Oh no, the mean, nasty witches just ***** and now they are trying to *****!, when we have just seen ***** and *****, and there is no reason for the character to communicate this to another character."}, {"id": 683, "text": "Robert Zemeckis always teases us with something that could be family fun and charming enough for adults. He frequently doesn't deliver like he used to. Which is the case yet again with The Witches. A movie so adverse to the art of filmmaking it constantly gives up in the middle of scenes.Robert still shows signs of life with some nice looking shots and editing that has some inspiration behind it. However, more times then not he feels like he's sleep walking. He's never been a director to deliver tour de force pitcures but he usually finds a balance between fun and dramatic. The typical shmaltzy music he uses is over bearing in this and the constant visual effects do this little favors.It's like Steven Spielbergs BFG but with less effort put in, which is saying something. Even basic scenes that start promising end with a CG extravaganza that made me want to hide away and forget I saw it. One scene in particular where the witches reveal their plan is one of the most embarrassing things this year. Robert can't help but flex his visual effects in this scene and it's a sight that made me want to stop and die.The overbearing use of CG definitely doesn't help, but neither does Anne Hathaway. Who is overacting to such an extreme it's unbearable. She is the main protagonist and is so laughable you can't see her as a threat at any point. She is so so bad in this and looks even worse when she shares scenes with Octavia Spencer. Who plays the grandma to the main child and is lovely. She is typically charismatic even if she isn't trying that hard. She knows what this is.Which is a family movie at the end of the day. It seems to want to drive in the Stuart Little lane of yesteryear. But I can't see any demographic of people enjoying this. It's a clunky disaster of bad acting, poor writting, and so much post work it feels plastic. There's no heart to this. There's no warmth in a movie that tries so hard to have some. Kids will be bored and adults will be horrified."}, {"id": 684, "text": "The entire film seems to be CGI with bluescreen to put people on the scenes -- it looks gaudy and off putting -- and I don't like it.The acting is over the top and the music is too dramatic with most of the plot dragging on when the cast is in the hotel part of the movie.I liked the New Orleans backdrop in the first 10 minutes, but there wasn't much of it; which begs the question why rewrite the story and take it out of London in the first place. The CGI animals were average looking but not my chief complaint of this piece.In the end it was a below average experience that I would just say go and watch the original movie and skip this, but even so I rated that one as an average flick. The material potentially isn't suitable for children really.4/10 a miss in so many regards that needed a lot of work in the cinematography and desperately needed some real sets to bring it alive."}, {"id": 685, "text": "This has to be one of the most heinous remakes of a film that I have ever seen. Anne Hathaway's delivery with a hybrid of about five changeable accents throughout the film, makes her character incoherent and very difficult to understand. On some occasions, I believe most skilled MI5 interpreters and trained linguists would not actually assimilate what was actually coming out of her mouth at times. Her character is a shadow of Angelica Huston's prowess as The Grand High Witch. An American disaster remake with over the top CGI in your face from start to finish. The continuous and monotonous narration throughout this film disrupted any realism throughout. Nicolas Roeg obviously tried to capture the mystical and magic mind of Roald Dahl's children's dark fantasy novel in his 1990 film, which still retains a cult following to this day. The makeup and potential was all laid out on the table for this to be a fantastic remake. Unfortunately, Hollywood grabbed it by the horns and stripped it of all its magic, comedy and dark fantasy themes. Robert Zemeckis's retelling of the wicked children's story feels more grumpy than scary, while its comedy veers between frantic and strained. The original 1990 film was more faithful to the book albeit the ending. As a British child who grew up in the 90's, engrossed in Dahl's novels, this has to be by far the most unendurable and vast substandard film I have endured in a long time. 1/10. That is being generous."}, {"id": 686, "text": "I don't agree with a lot of the negative comments here. Hathaway's accent is fine (the book mentions a non-descript foreign accent and she ticks that box fine). The use of CGI is fine, is not overly done. The adaptation of the story, location etc.. is fine, like countless other adaptations. And the 1990 film was ok, just. It wasn't some masterpiece as some have made it out to be. What is not ok is:1 - the film isn't funny, ever. The book makes you smile, giggle and laugh out loud. The film's poor script probably is its biggest failing. 2 - the film takes a long time to get going. 3 - the portrayal of three fingered witches was wrong, as disability adovates have pointed out (it's not in the book btw). 4 - the portrayal of the boy was awful for much of the beginning of the film. He is totally deprived of any emotion, rendering him completely unsympathetic (same issue with the 1990 version). And yet he gets Chris Rock's joyful voiceover as an adult? it doesn't add up.To give the film a different take on the book it could have given it a voodoo inspired take on things which I think would well."}, {"id": 687, "text": "I will not be watching this garbage. i mean besides the trailer. hard pass. the 1 star reviewers have some great commentary listen to their advice and do not support trash films like this with money, it enables the producers to think that they should just keep ruining classic films over and over again. only real reason i wrote this (haven't put up a new review on here in a long time lol and i think this is only the 2nd review i've posted where i did not actually see the movie, the other was Grown Ups) is because of some interesting connection i found. so this Witches is a wannabe 'remake' of a film i grew up loving, the original which starred Anjelica Huston, a film a dearly loved at that time. Jim Henson puppet factory doing the heavy lifting on REAL special effects. CGI today doesn't count as SPECIAL EFFECTS!! you know- how they used to have to use wires and explosives and robots and claymation and all together at the same time with early computer animation, that was real* special* effects*, not this junk they pump out by the truckload for kids these days with their brainwashing. no wonder people buy this BS propaganda and vote again for Trump after all the horror and indignity we've endured as a human species for the last four years. sorry for that rant, but i feel hollywood and in particular disney propaganda is directly related to people being so dumb and emotionally unstable in the USA. ok, so the real reason i am writing is because i noted they mention this powerhouse actor Stanley Tucci in here (never really cared for him) got his start in the movie Prizzi's Honor, which also starred guess who: Anjelica Huston!!! In fact, Prizzi's Honor was nominated for 8 Academy Awards and the only one that WON was Best Supporting Actress: Anjelica Huston (her only oscar) who does not even appear at all in the extremely horrible quality film trailer on imdb for that movie lol. I was just noting Stanley Tucci standing twice in the shadow of a great actress regarding Witches and Prizzi's.

It's full of over the top CGI, bad dialogue and too much Anne Hathaway cleavage for a 'family' movie.Some of the spooks are still there but then the tension is ruined by everything else that is bad.Let's not talk about that unnecessary voiceover.This is 2020s CATS.

We watched the old one and liked it, but the old robotic mice creeped me out and I can't see my kids loving it like the movies being made today. It's not a stab at the old one, just the truth. Times have evolved in movie making and the new one proves it. The story was not in depth like the first one, at least in the witch scenes. I can excuse it because it left room for the grandma and Luke to bond and some new scenes to add to the fun aspect of being mice. Their background was a retelling and you can't be mad at it because the setting is in Georgia, not Norway so the original story of the girl in the painting wouldn't work. The new story was meant to capture kids' imagination and I think it achieved it. Anne's accent was just as hard to understand as Angelica's so I wish they would've improved on that. These two ladies shouldn't be compared because I enjoyed what they both brought to the characters. It's a retelling, not an exact copy! Each movie has their own high's and lows, which should just be enjoyed, not picked apart because grown adults think it it should only be done ONE way. The retelling was fun and meant to capture the attention of kids, which I think it did. It brought a new audience to an old forgotten movie and it's new companion. I recommend it!"}, {"id": 690, "text": "Very fun performance by Anne Hathaway. Cool costume design. Some new magic for the witches. Good way to pass an evening with some kids in for some fun but spooky times.I would've liked it much scarier though. The mice kids really aren't in any danger much of the time. The chefs didn't even take any shots at them. The witches have genuinely scary powers and that just wasn't represented here. Without the danger element this is not really the kind of film adults also like, but just too safe and better for kids.This version has a different ending too. I don't mind the differences this movie has but I'm not sure it's really thought through. Like I was saying about the lack of danger element, the ending kind of reverses that, so the movie is a strange mix of messages about risk and change and consequences.A fun film with some daring twists that don't quite pull off in my opinion. But it's rare enough for these kinds of remakes to take risks.I'm really giving it a 6/10 but will give a 7 just because I think it's very watchable and not every remake has to surpass a previous classic film."}, {"id": 691, "text": "Where do I start?

Remember when the child in the original kept saying Grandma! in a far too excited and annoying cadence? I do and I still have nightmares.Opening up the film, it's again, so much better. You actually feel for the child losing his parents in this one as it isn't as cold or glossed over like in the 1990 version.Anne Hathaway is just phenomenal as the grand high witch, and I was scared too, as Houston was just superb in the original. She had no problem with portraying a hilarious and genuinely terrifying witch in this.I'll try not to go too far into this one, but there are some much welcomed surprises and twists in this that will delight and entertain the entire family.Go see it."}, {"id": 692, "text": "Roald Dahl's 1983 novel 'The Witches' was one of many hits from the highly-acclaimed author's prestigious bibliography and was brought to life on the big-screen in 1990 thanks in large part to producer Jim Henson. Dahl, however, was rather critical towards the film (as he was admittedly known to do when it came to adaptations of his work) for its radically different ending. Nevertheless, the film was a huge success with critics and while it may not have been much of a box-office hit, it has very much become a cult classic of its time. As such, it's not too surprising that the 1990 film's legacy has had a major impact on the reactions towards this year's new adaptation of the novel, directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Guillermo Del Toro and Alfonso Cuaron. But while most of the user reviews on this site are venomously decrying this as a complete and utter disaster, it's not 'that' bad.To be fair, though, I'm not saying that it's perfect as it's arguably the most by-the-numbers film that Zemeckis has ever directed. Just like what happened when Tim Burton directed his remake of 'Planet of the Apes' in 2001, this is one of those films where, if you didn't know that it was directed by the same guy behind 'Back to the Future' and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', you probably wouldn't have guessed since it's one of those films that could've easily been done by anyone. Still, for what it's worth, the film does a nice job of maintaining the whimsical nature of Roald Dahl's writing where the kids are the heroes in a story that's full of the delightfully twisted dark sense of humor that Dahl was well-known for. And while it's completely understandable if some may find her performance to be a bit too over-the-top, Anne Hathaway is clearly having a lot of fun in the lead role of the story's main antagonist, the Grand High Witch.Now as a quick disclaimer, while I have read the book, I'll admit that I've never watched the 1990 film because, simply put, it never ended up on my radar when I was growing up. As such, I don't have the strong connection to it that other folks have, thus influencing their thoughts on this new film. And becuase of this, I found this new version of 'The Witches' to be generally solid overall. While it's far from being the best film that Robert Zemeckis has ever directed, it's ultimately a harmless family-friendly flick that helps bring one of Dahl's most famous stories to a new generation."}, {"id": 693, "text": "My 4 year old has a very poor attention span. Hardly ever sits through movies but she sat through the whole of this and thoroughly enjoyed it.

I did however feel the movie lacked the depth of the original. They changed a lot of the original storyline which made it hard to connect with the characters and not to mention they didn't include a certain character that I feel was central to the original in adding a nice twist to the story, mainly at the end (if you've seen it and then watch this you will know who I'm talking about). I didn't feel any macabre and eerie aspects to this film and missed the story about the girl in the picture from the original movie. I hated the ending.I found that there were too many comedic elements to the movie instead of good character development and I would have given it 5 stars for effort, however my daughter just loved it and at the end of the day these kind of movies are more tailored to children so, although far from perfect, it's certainly one that little ones will enjoy around Halloween. Angelica Houston will always be the grand high witch to me but maybe watch this with an open mind with the kiddies and try not to take it too seriously. It's not a bad movie."}, {"id": 694, "text": "Ooooookaaaaaaay, before I get into this and believe me, I'm going to get into it, let me set the scene. I love Roald Dahl, I love The Witches, I'm currently reading it to my class at the end of the day (my Grand High Witch would fit right at home as Herr Flick's eviller other half from Allo Allo) and I love the 1990 film. Now normally I'd be a bit wary of Roald Dahl remakes, but after watching the trailer, the change on location and era seemed to work and the cast of Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer and Stanley Tucci is incredibly strong, so we thought why no give it go.And it just goes to show, that you should stick to your instincts and the people who make trailers are veil geniuses.Adventure - I'll give you that, Comedy - not so much, Family - are you kidding me?The story changes from London to 1960s Alabama, from a Norwegian Grandma to a Deep South one, with a history from the turn of the century with Witches and in fact these changes fit in with the story and style of a Roald Dahl book, it maintains the creepiness of The Witches by giving them a believable backstory.However, when Hero Boy and Grandma(they're not given names in this film - which is a bit odd) check into a nearby hotel - again a diversion from the original for the reason, things go a bit, well rubbish really. For me it loses its Roald Dahl quality, its scariness mixed with fantasy and humour. It just goes a bit horrible really. The Witches, who by rights, have no toes, are bald with itchy heads, huge nostrils and claws amongst others are turned into demons from your nightmares. I totally agree with those who got offended by their hands, which should be claws but not look like really long three-fingered things and I use the words things, even though I hate using that word in writing, they don't look like claws, they look like someone has had a bad accident. If I was someone who had Ectrodactyly, a limb abnormality, I'd look at it and think they were taking the mick!On top of that, the Witches mouths open up like something out of a nightmare I had after watching several Vampire series in one night, it's something out of V Wars or Van Helsing, not a family film. You've got it very wrong there Mr Zemeckis.And, my final point - to be fair I'm holding back as there is so much more, I could go on about, is the inclusion of the wonderful Kristen Chenoweth as the voice of a child who has been turned into a mouse, WHY? All other children whether real or mouse like are played by and voiced by children, why do they need the voice of a woman. It is just odd and takes away from the character, a character who by the way doesn't exist in the book.You can see the influence of Mr Zemeckis and Guillermo del Toro and if it wasn't changing such a huge part of not only my childhood but also my adulthood as a teacher then I might, nah who am I kidding, I'm regretting renting this, I could've spent my money on something I'd have enjoyed more instead - like dental surgery!I'm not going to score this as I don't think it would be fair to the very talented people involved and to be honest, I reckon children would probably really enjoy it, but adults if you've grown up with the original - swerve this please!"}, {"id": 695, "text": "A new adaptation of Dahl's The Witches has hit HBO Max and it's a bit of mixed bag. While some of the effects are charmingly whimsical, the tone is often too silly to conjure up any legitimate threat.In the 60's, a little boy is orphaned after a deadly car crash and is sent to live with his eccentric grandmother in Alabama. Almost immediately, he finds himself preyed upon by evil witches who look almost exactly like regular women except for their strange hands, feet, the scar across their mouth, and the fact that they're always wearing wigs or turbans to cover up their baldness.He and his grandmother escape to a swanky coastal hotel only to discover it's crawling with witches who are in town for their annual meeting. When the little boy gets too close, they turn him into a mouse and he and his grandmother must find a way to stop the witches before all the children in the world suffer the same fate.The Witches appears to be trying to give us some political message, but it's a little too muddy to be totally effective. Are the witches fantastical versions of racists, nazis, and all other sorts of bigots? Is it saying that it's our duty to rally the troops to fight again them? Maybe, but it's all too silly to take seriously. With every smart move like this, the filmmakers usually fudge something immediately after, canceling any goodwill out.

Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future Trilogy, Forrest Gump) and starring Anne Hathaway, it is a mediocre update to a beloved children's story that only barely manages to engage its audience.In 1968 in Alabama, the unnamed hero boy (Jahzir Kadeem Bruno) survives a car crash that kills both of his parents and is sent to live with his maternal grandmother (Octavia Spencer). One day when the two are out shopping together, the hero boy encounters a witch who entices him with a snake and some chocolate, but disappears when his grandmother calls out to him. Later on, the grandmother tells the hero boy about how witches are very real and that once they set their sights on a particular child, they will never give up pursuit until that child is dead. Desperate to avoid her grandson from being killed, the grandmother and the hero boy take refuge in a high class hotel, unaware that a large group of witches led by the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) are staying there as well.Nearly everyone I have met has read at least one story written by Roald Dahl. His dark sense of humour and tongue-in-cheek wit still resonates strongly with many people today, and most of this ends up being translated successfully into cinematic form with films like 1990's The Witches. That film remains one of the most popular adaptations of Dahl's work, so it comes as a surprise that this modern update with seemingly better technology thirty years later could be so inferior in comparison. What I believe made the 1990 film special was how lively and raw the special effects were thanks to the puppetry and animatronics provided by the The Jim Henson Company. Whenever you saw a character interact with a mouse or a freakishly ugly witch, you instantly got the feeling that there was something physically there in front of them. With this film, the CGI is so overabundant and unconvincing that it severed most connection with me as I watched actors talk to an obvious green screen under the pretense that something will be added later in post-production. This made the film feel soulless and sterile and it constantly made me wish I was watching the original film instead.Quite a few talented people worked on this film, like director Robert Zemeckis, who also co-wrote the script with Guillermo del Toro. This should have been a winning combination but instead it seems nothing good came from it. Not once did I ever have that sense of wonder and fascination I've come to expect from watching a movie made with the involvement of either of these two. Zemeckis, who directed the cult classic Death Becomes Her, a film renowned for its impressive visual effects, instead takes the easy route of overloading each scene with CGI and badly rendered animals, including a very fake looking cat. Additionally, del Toro's signature style seems like a mixed bag here, keeping that dark fantasy tone while also including scenes that would be too frightening for most young children. That's not to say the 1990 film didn't have its fair share of scary moments, but most of them were brief, whereas this time the camera would often linger on the fearsome appearances of the witches enough to burn their images into one's mind. Something like this may be fine for del Toro's other films aimed at adults but seeing as this is supposed to be for kids it comes across as unnecessarily mean-spirited.The film's one saving grace was Anne Hathaway's performance as the Grand High Witch. Almost equalling Anjelica Huston before her, Hathaway brings so much over-the-top madness and eccentricism to her role that one can't help but laugh at seeing her lose herself playing this cartoonishly evil character. She easily overshadows the rest of the cast, which isn't really a good thing the more I think about it. While all of the other actors aren't terrible by any means, they just didn't leave as much of an impression as their 1990 film counterparts. Rather strangely, the film is narrated by Chris Rock as the older hero boy, which made the film feel as though I was watching an episode of the sitcom Everybody Hates Chris. Even though that did offer some mild amusement, it still seemed like a bizarre creative decision that made me forget I was supposed to be watching a Roald Dahl story in the first place.In the end, I just don't see this film being anywhere near as fondly remembered as the 1990 one. The very fact that I am able to recall so much of the original off the top of my head despite having seen it so long ago whereas with this one I am struggling to think of even one memorable scene goes to show which of the two has the most staying power. Roald Dahl rather infamously hated nearly all film adaptations of his work so it's hard to say if he'd approve of this one, but considering that it does accurately follow certain parts of the book more closely than its previous incarnation makes me think he would probably enjoy this one more. Personally, I'm going to stick with the 1990 film and so should you.I rate it 5.5/10"}, {"id": 697, "text": "It amazes me how many people in these reviews think this is a remake of the original movie.

It wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, a lot of the people giving it 1's are clearly just salty and have no idea what a 1/10 movie is really like and are stuck on the original (I suggest Birdemic for a 1/10 movie), but I don't see myself recommending this to anyone any time soon either.The fact is, it's not a good book adaptation, the original movie is both more captivating in the way the plot unfolds, the puppets are in my opinion far scarier than the CGI, and while the actors were all pretty good for the most part, I'm sorry but they just can't compare to the original's who were almost born to play those roles.And To be clear I could care less about them casting black actors. I'm not at all opposed to this. But I'm sorry, Chris Rock was not a good choice for narrator. Especially if you are a grown up who grew up with the real Chris Rock. It just doesn't work. There were much better choices for this movie. It seems SO forced.

I have seen so many comments on horror groups from outraged men and women who think 'true horror fans' will hate this movie. They need to grow up. We know that the original was great, get over it. Kids will love this, they'll also love the original. Shut up and let people enjoy things.Ok so onto the movie. The story has moved to 1960s Alabama. Little Hero loses his parents in a car crash, and his Grandma comes to take him into her home. Not ashamed to say that the first 15 minutes really moved me, actually had a lump in my throat. Grandma singing Reach Out, I'll Be There to a clearly traumatised little boy is genuinely upsetting. The story hasn't changed much. The Witches are holding their annual meeting at a posh hotel (where Hero and Grandma are hiding after they encounter a witch near their home) under the guise of a conference for a child protection group. The action is very slapstick, the mice are very cute, the acting is great and the story is pretty heartwarming. I was slightly put off by the fact that Anne Hathaway was playing the Grand High Witch because I've never been a fan, but she was great - although her accent jumps around quite a bit. Octavia Spencer is one of my favourite actresses, so there was no question of me not watching this movie. She is excellent in it, just the right mixture of stern Grandma and loving Grandma. The children are excellent too.Your kids will love it, the whining adults who need to grow up and let people make up their own minds need to stop living in the past.

Why bother then? Why set it in the 1960s at all at that point, what was wrong with 1980s America?Why the addition of the new character? This literally led to the underdevelopment of Bruno and his family members, reducing his entire being to a prolonged fat joke.

There is a magical power in his story telling if you read any of his books. That magic has not been portrayed in this film. It's not in the same league as films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or the BFG.This is literally a remake of the old film. Remakes often need a wow factor to compete with the original...this did not have it.

I liked what they did to present the witches as being non-human creatures.The cast in the movie was good, and with the likes of Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway, to mention the most notably of performers, then you definitely were in good company throughout the course of this movie.However, to me at least, The Witches is hardly a movie that warrants more than a single viewing.

So much so, that I found and watched the original for comparison.To be quite honest, I think this is a better version, if only because it is period pertinent, but they both stand as great productions.The Jim Henson special effects of the first one are pretty good, and taking them out of context by comparing them with modern day capabilities isn't fair, and I only do so because it's something so many here have already done. Certainly for the time they were excellent, but there is no comparison with the new release where they are immeasurably more convincing.I don't necessarily want to do a side by side comparison between the two movies, I think they both stand by themselves for the era's in which they are released, but the notion that this film doesn't stand on its own is pure trash.The story, direction and in particular the acting from most of the cast are all very good, and in fact rather than go on, I'll simply say its an all round good film. Well set and well produced. Most of the reviews here are lopsided and unfair accounts of a good production that has stepped on the toes of a childhood or overly fond memory of the 1990 version.

This is more in line with the manic early films of his career rather than the more maturely told movies he'd been making since the 90s. In another way, this also feels like the safest move he could have made after the financial flop that was Allied and the incredibly ill-conceived mess (as well as financial flop) that was Welcome to Marwen. A retelling of a well-regarded children's book that had another adaptation from thirty years ago is the sort of safe movie an established director makes after having cost some studios a few bundles of money.So, witches are real, and they're real ugly and they hate children. Our protagonist (I'm not calling him Hero Boy) is a young boy who lost his parents to a car crash in Chicago in the 60s and moved in with his grandmother in Alabama. She's a healer and tells him of witches and how they want to turn children into animals. When our protagonist meets a witch in the local grocery store, Grandma takes serious precautions and takes the boy to a swanky hotel on the Gulf Coast that her relation used to be the executive chef at. Coincidentally, a large coven of witches are using the hotel at the same time for a gathering in which the Grand High Witch details her master plan to put a potion in chocolate that will turn children into mice. The boy and another young English boy named Bruno get turned into mice, and the two, along with another child turned mouse that the boy had kept as a pet and the boy's grandmother, must find a way to fight the witches and turn their evil plot around.It's the exact same story as the Nicholas Roeg version from 1990 with a different ending, but, oddly enough, Zemeckis' version, which runs about fifteen minutes longer, ends up moving far more quickly with a focus on visceral movement and action over brooding menace. I enjoy the Roeg version, but this one is definitely a different beast despite the same story, and I find Zemeckis' return to spectacle based storytelling to be a fun diversion.Performed with a very odd Swedish/Norwegian accent by Anne Hathaway, the Grand High Witch is a scenery chewing monster without any subtlety, and as an antagonist in a children's fantasy adventure tale, I found her amusing. Octavia Spencer plays the Grandmother with tenderness and strictness in equal measure, providing a very nice human grounding for the second half of the film after the boy gets turned into a mouse.The special effects use CGI rather extensively, even going so far as to animate a cat that's never more than a cat, and I get the feeling that the decision to move the release from theaters to HBO Max might have cut back on the budget to finalize the movie a bit. The computer generated animals never look bad, mind you, but they exist between cartoonish and real in an uncomfortable spot. They're just a bit too cartoonish to feel like they exist in the same space as the humans around them. Another few million and a couple more passes in post-production might have made that gel a bit better, but as it stands, in a children's fantasy adventure film, I found it largely serviceable. As an end note, I did find Alan Silvestri's score to be an odd companion to the action on screen as he pulled rather heavily from his work on The Avengers movies, delivering a bombastic and bass heavy score in place of something to probably should have been lighter and more whimsical like he did on Back to the Future.Energetic, well-performed, and appealing, Robert Zemeckis' apology for losing so much money on his last two movies is a fun diversion of a family film with a menacing villain and a winning performance by Octavia Spencer."}, {"id": 711, "text": "IN BRIEF: All of the joy and wicked dark humor has been zapped from Roald Dahl's classic novel in this over-produced nightmare.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) This garish retelling of the Roald Dahl's charmingly macabre children's novel is a major disappointment, especially from the talented director Robert Zemeckis. Lately, he has been so enamored with CGI and its powerful effects that he sacrifices his actors and story to wow his audience. This moviegoer was not.All of Mr. Dahl's dark humor and subtle wit has been expunged by the director and his writing crew (Kenya Barris, Guillermo del Toro and Mr. Zemeckis himself) as they readapt the hi-jinks to a Black family in Southern Alabama during the late sixties. The move does not go well.Octavia Spencer plays Grandma and she, at least, brings some sense of humor to her character. Jahzir Kadeem Bruno plays Hero Boy (?) and he is serviceable in his role as written. As they encounter a group of witches at a hotel convention, the stage is set for humor and conflict that rarely materializes.Most of the fault belongs with the director and script, but Anne Hathaway's bizarre interpretation of the Grand High Witch is all terror and none of the fun. Her thick German accent is sometimes unintelligible, and the CGI only distorts and makes the character more repellent and unpleasant than needed. Granted, she's a witch, but far from bewitching. The comedy is sorely missing in this performance. It's as if someone put a spell on this actress' skills as a comedian which she has shown to better effect in many other movies. Also wasted in his role as the harried hotel manager is the usually reliable Stanley Tucci.There is no delight or whimsy in this off-kilter film adaptation for today's audience, only lots of desperation and some spiffy CGI, certainly too intense for younger audiences...and this reviewer. (GRADE: C)"}, {"id": 712, "text": "This movie seems to be getting a lot of hate, which is mostly a sign of the times we live in.. Any 13-year-old can write a tweet and call it a review without putting any effort into it. Whatever - another discussion, another day.I saw this movie at a theatre - uniquely, in the middle of a pandemic. I've been cooped up in my house since March, and when I saw that my local theatre was hosting limited viewings, I took a chance. Thankfully there were only two other people there. Anyway...!I had a good time! I immediately loved the new setting of the story, Alabama. And yes, I definitely appreciated the renewed diversity of the characters. Rather than going too much into the story, I'll focus on the technical aspects. Actors first. Anne Hathaway is a riot! Deliberately overacting every scene, she just beams with wicked joy in playing such an evil character. She chews the scenery as if it's an all-you-can-eat buffet, and her glee is infectious. What struck me most about her performance though, was the way she utilised her voice. I'm not sure if it was digitally enhanced in some parts, but in any case, her range, depth and boisterousness were very impressive. And yes, her accent was ridiculous... But to me, somehow it just added to her otherworldly nature, because the fact that her accent didn't belong to any particular Earthly country, only emphasised her demonic identity. Octavia Spencer is lovely as always, faithfully executing her part as a kick-ass grandma. She, too, is joyful and captivating. Stanley Tucci is always a hoot. Even though he doesn't have that much screentime, it's obvious he still had fun with that leering Cajun accent and that typical hotel manager moustache. I would recommend this movie for the actors alone.Now, as far as comparing this remake to the 1990 original or the book, I'm afraid I can't be of much help. I've never read the book and it's been so long since I've seen the one with Angelica Huston, all I can remember is that I was absolutely terrified as a child. Although I'm pretty sure that's exactly the point of The Witches - it's basically kiddie horror. Now, I personally can't really think of any reason why any children's book writer would deliberately want to give children nightmares, but it seems to be pretty normal for some reason.. On that note, the other two people in the theatre with me, were actually little kids, no more than 7 or 8 years old. Unaccompanied. Now, call me old-fashioned, but there are some visuals in this movie which are truly disturbing. I will even admit that I had kind of a hard time not being a little bit freaked out myself. Now, far be it from me to tell anyone how to live their life, it's just that... I don't know. I find it difficult to understand why the line between what's really kid's stuff, and what is not, should be so blurred. Why frightening, mentally unhealthy even, imagery needs to be so normalised to the point where our children are basically watching horror movies. Hell, why not just stick 'm in front of the tv and put The Exorcist on. Oh, that's different? I'm overreacting? Explain to me what exactly the difference is. A funny talking mouse really doesn't change anything.Oh well, here I am talking into a void again...One last note I guess. For the most part, this movie is very visually pleasing. The costumes are a treat and the scenery is very well visualised. The CGI is mostly good, although the cat is seriously unconvincing. They definitely could've spent a few more hours rendering its movements, or better yet, they could have just as easily trained and used a real cat. For most of the shots at least, just like they used a real mouse in the beginning, which was changed to CGI as soon as it started talking..So. Definitely fun, and definitely scary. Also, should I be at all concerned that this review which I am writing right now, is the 666th user review for this title...? Freaky stuff.."}, {"id": 713, "text": "The Witches is a remake of the 1990 movie of the same name. This remake is directed, partly written and produced by Robert Zemeckis, the director of Forrest Gump and the Back to the Future trilogy.In the film, an orphaned boy (Jahzir Bruno) goes to live with his grandmother (Octavia Spencer). When he comes into contact with a witch, his grandmother tries to protect her grandson and they flee to a hotel on the coast. The two think they are safe here, but the boy discovers that the hotel is being used for a witch gathering. The head witch has a devil plan that he has to stop the hotel with his grandmother and friends.This remake puts the famous story of writer Roald Dahl in a modern guise and can thus become a new classic for children of this current generation. For parents it can be fun to watch this movie with their children, especially if they are familiar with the original 1990 film. Although this film is not as good as the original, it does contain some nice hints and references. .With the help of Guillermo del Toro as co-writer and producer, Robert Zemeckis provides good and fun effects in the film. For older viewers, some images may seem a bit fake due to the use of CGI effects. Halfway through, the film comes across more like a Stuart Little remake for the children. Yet they have provided a good mix between visual and computer effects for a family film.The acting is done appropriately by most of the film cast as well. That Jahzir Bruno is still a novice actor, older viewers can sometimes see in his acting. For a first children's film, he does well for a younger audience. Octavia Spencer delivers the best acting in the movie as the caring wise grandmother, who tries to help and protect her grandson from the witches. Anne Hathaway delivers appropriate, but some special acting. Her character in the film has a somewhat distinct Scandinavian accent, which sometimes comes out better than the other. Sometimes she also speaks as Gollum the character from The Lord of the Rings movies.

It stayed true to the book while still adding some new aspects, such as the witches only preying on underprivileged, poor children who would not be missed. I also liked how there was more diversity than the 1990 movie.Sure, it has a few flaws. It was a risky move to Americanize the story, the accent of the Grand Witch is a odd and the witches don't have a lot of magic, but I wouldn't say any of these are a real deal-breaker.

After about twenty minutes I thought I had been wrong, the opening had some originality and it seemed like something fresh. then they arrived at the Hotel and Anne Hathaway came on the scene like a wrecking ball. Any potential that this movie had was suffocated by Hathaways incredibly poor performance. Watch Anjelica Huston's performance in the original and you will see the MASSIVE difference in ability. Hathaway's performance is akin to an amateur impressionist. It feel more like an insult than an homage by Hathaway, she put zero effort or spirit into this character. Her accent is atrocious and her presence is almost nonexistent. Also the CGI already looks cheap, c'mon they had better puppets in the 80's. All witches now have joker smiles and shark teeth? This could've really been a good movie and it is just marred by an extremely poor performance from the lead villain, an overuse of cheap effects, poor pacing, lack of originality in the second half and a horrendous ending. The only highlights of this movie are Octavia Spencer and Jahzir Bruno who do a fantastic job of filling and updating their roles. Unfortunately as most fans know, Jahzir spends the second half of the movie as a poorly CGI'd mouse. Leaving Octavia Spencer to carry the entirety of the movie from there on out almost seems like a cruel prank. Tucci is decent as is Codie Eastwick as Bruno but there characters are so poorly written and used they practically add nothing. The addition of a third mouse is also meaningless and changes nothing in the story. Ultimately this movie is a far worse version of the first one. They actually managed to tell less of the story, give characters less development, and have worse effects than a movie made over 30 years ago. Some of this may have been forgivable if they added any decent original concepts but again this is a poor retread with no added substance. Its disheartening to see so many big names attached to this film. Guillermo Del Toro should not put this on his IMBD page.

Having never really been a fan of Anne Hathaway and only seeing her in The Devil Wears Prada which believe me, I don't think I'll ever watch that movie the same way again after seeing The Witches (2020), there's just something about her character of The Grand High Witch that didn't really give me the chills as much as the original (if at all). In the original Anjelica Huston was known to frighten many that I know of, myself included, with her 4 hours of make-up I should bloody well think so and all. But here, in the 2020 remake it seems there's little to no effort at all. And like many of the reviews here, there's a lot of scenes in this movie that have been cut which were originally in the 1990 classic, as for Hathaway's accent; yes I do see the change in it throughout the movie, there's no consistency with it - is she Russian or British? I think I can safely say she's been well and truly mis-cast here, it isn't the right film for her &amp; if you read the trivia section it mentions other possible actresses that were considered for the role &amp; most of them would have been far better. For me, this isn't a terrible film but it's not blockbuster of the year either. Entertaining for kids yes and comedic elements are there but I will always think more of the original. Hathaway is no Huston."}, {"id": 718, "text": "Robert Zemeckis with the help of Guillermo del Toro has gone for a grotesque take on Roald Dahl's The Witches.The book has been transplanted to Alabama 1968. A young boy (Jahzir Bruno) goes to live with his Grandma (Octavia Spencer) after the death of his parents in a car accident. He gets a pet mouse to cheer him up.One day in a store he is lured by a witch who offers him a bar of chocolate. However his grandma calls out for him before any damage is done.His grandmother tells him when she was a child her friend was turned into a chicken by a witch. The witches seem to target black kids as no one seems to notice when they go missing.The boy is taken to a hotel to stay by the seaside by his grandmother. Unfortunately the witches are having a convention where the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) plans to turn all the children into mice.Blessed with a narration from Chris Rock, a camp performance from Anne Hathaway and expensive CGI special effects. This adaptation still struggles compared to Nicolas Roeg's version from 1990.This can be shown by the waste of Stanley Tucci's hotel manager character. At times The Witches wants to be a dark Disneyfied kids movie with a nod and a wink to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This explains why a fat boy lured with bars of chocolate is transformed into a mouse because of his greed."}, {"id": 719, "text": "Comedy horror, fantasy. A screen adaptation of the children's novel of the same name by the English writer Roald Dahl and, at the same time, a rethinking of the film of the same name, released thirty years ago. I have not read the book, I am partially familiar with the first film adaptation (scene, characters, scenario and ending), so I will evaluate it exclusively from my own bell tower. I understand that this review comes out on the eve of Halloween, which I am not celebrating, but it just coincided. I really missed my favorite cinema (hello May!), So I decided to go to the screening, but nothing good came across until I accidentally stumbled upon this picture. And here's my brief opinion - it's so bad that it's even good. The picture has, in addition to a heap of shortcomings, also advantages, and now your humble servant will disassemble them. So, the advantages: 1. Anne Hathaway - I confess that it was the beautiful Anne who persuaded me to see this creation. I was hoping to see a charming villain who would make insidious plans to conquer the world or something similar, captivating the viewer with her outfits and demeanor. And he was not deceived in this. Ann here is almost the only bright spot that attracts attention to herself and makes her follow her every step. Her appearance reminded me very much of Tim Burton's Dark Shadows, namely the main villainess in the brilliant performance of Eva Green. It seems to me that she was chosen when creating the image for Ann. Wig, manners, behavior, well, except that here Ann does not seduce men, because we have here a comedy horror film for teenagers, and not Burton's comedy thriller, designed for an older audience. But the image was clearly too clever, and sometimes her actions cause more bewilderment. Well, Ann sometimes overestimates too much. But I repeat - she is here - the main celebrity and the most memorable character, more precisely the villain. 2. Scenario - if you have not fallen asleep within the first twenty minutes, then you will find such an enchanting idiocy (I will mention the key features in the minuses) that the brain explodes. The script is so stupid, stupid and at the same time periodically feverish that it is amazing. But this is so bad that it is even good. At least I laughed at this orgy, for which, by the way, the director Robert Zemeikis and Guillermo del Toro were responsible, and a couple more people. Looks like the brainstorming was not without the participation of some funny powders and a whole box of strong liquor in order to get this at the exit. 3. Humor - I hoped to laugh at jokes, but in the end I was amused by one of the photos at the very beginning of the picture, and the stupid script. Thank God that I did not watch the first film adaptation, otherwise I would have had to cry bitterly from what they did to one of the pictures of my childhood. So the disadvantages: 1. Blacks - in the first film adaptation, the main characters were white, but since we do not live in barbaric times, but in a progressive age, the writers replaced the heroes with blacks, but they did not think of working out the historical background in which the main action picture. Where is the contempt for blacks? Where is the peacock of the whites? Why is the protagonist's grandmother taken seriously in, for a minute, the most expensive hotel in Alabama - the southern state of the United States, where ONLY rich white people stay, and blacks work there only as service personnel with the lowest wages? 2. Mockery of the first film adaptation - the scene was moved from England to the United States, the witches were not ugly, but young and attractive, a logical scenario with a clear motivation for the first film adaptation turned into a natural farce where everything happens just like that. The only plus of this picture is the finale, which is one in one book, albeit a little harsh. I understand why fans and fans of the old film adaptation are so enraged by this one, which only tramples on their nostalgia. 3. Nothing new - this adaptation does not provide anything new (we do not take special effects into account). She only mocks the finished material. I really hope that the picture will fail at the box office, because it did not deserve a different fate. 4. Jokes - they are stupid and not funny at all. What I was hoping for! Good humor? Wake up, now it's rare. And I also liked the music, for which I should thank the composer Alan Silvestri, who brightened up all this disgrace with his high-quality work. I learned for myself several new musical compositions. A little about the main characters: 1. Miss Eva Ernst, played by Anne Hathaway, is the leader of the witches who arranged a coven in a luxury hotel. She did not even suspect that this would be the beginning of a series of adventures. The charming Ann shone here. I literally enjoyed every shot of her (well, almost every one). I was also pleased with the Russian dubbing, because the actress was very well chosen for this type. Kisses to Ann's hand! 2. The grandmother performed by Octavia Spencer is the grandmother of the protagonist, whose actions sometimes cause bewilderment, but the kind character and religiosity try to smooth out the overall impression. Nice and kind character, and the actress definitely coped with the role. 3. Mister Stringer performed by Stanley Tucci - one of the best comedians here plays the faded and with a bad sense of humor hotel administrator. I thought that Stanley would be another decoration of the picture, on a par with the beautiful Anne, but no. Periodically appears and behaves in some scenes stupid and you can even catch Spanish shame. Eh Stanley! Where have you taken! Another Hollywood rethinking that awaits oblivion, and I really hope - a box office failure. Another unsuccessful picture by Robert Zemeikis, which brings the decline of his career even closer. Only Anne Hathaway holds this picture with her hands, but her strength is clearly not enough for the picture to be at least good. I didn't give a lower mark just because the picture amused me, although not in the way I planned. As a result, we have a terrible film adaptation with an idiotic clownade, which is called a script here, excellent music and stunning acting performance of Anne Hathaway and a little less noticeable Stanley Tucci, well, and blacks, where can we go without them."}, {"id": 720, "text": "I've always wondered what Robert Zemeckis thinks of his career. From 1984 to 2000, he was an A-level director who could seamlessly blend visual wizardry with fantastical stories. His output during that time consisted of the Back to the Future trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump (for which he won the Best Director Oscar), and Cast Away.Since then, Zemeckis has still incorporated fantastical ideas into his films, but his effects work has gotten progressively worse as time goes on. The Polar Express is only remembered for its acid-trip inducing digital-capture performances. Beowulf, A Christmas Carol, and Welcome to Marwen were visual eye-sores. Even his adult-oriented films such as Flight and Allied - which are decent - came and went with barely a peep.Zemeckis has returned once again to the silver screen (or silver television since it's being released on HBO Max) with The Witches, another movie filled to the brim with computer effects and a crazy story. Unfortunately, this new feature follows right in line with the latter of his filmography and again makes you wonder if we'll ever get the old Robert Zemeckis back.The Witches is an adaptation of the classic Roald Dahl children's book of the same name. It was most famously adapted for the screen in 1990 with Anjelica Huston starring as the Grand High Witch.The Witches is narrated by Chris Rock, who in the opening segment explains to the audience that witches are real and are here to prey on little children, especially cute ones. This claim is supported by our narrator's encounter with witches back in his childhood.From here we travel back in time to 1960s Alabama. Our narrator, named Charlie, has just become an orphan after a freak car accident. He moves in with his grandmother, a lady who would  spank you when you deserved it and hug you when you needed it. After some time, Charlie eventually comes face to face with a witch, which brings up memories from grandma's past as well. As a precaution, the two of them head to a swanky resort to hide away for a while. Unfortunately for them, this resort is the same location where a coven of witches are planning their nefarious scheme of turning every child into a mouse so that they can be easily squashed. It's up to Charlie and his grandma to stop these witches before they cause the extinction of all children.Despite being in a slump for nearly two decades, Robert Zemeckis is still a capable director when it comes to blockbuster filmmaking. The Witches still showcases his talent with the camera as he uses a few tricks such as long tracking shots that dip and dive throughout the resort setting. It is kind of cheating since it's obvious the camera and much of the set are digitally created, but it's still nice to look at nonetheless.While the visual style of the film is in line with Dahl's authorial vision, their quality is not up to the technological standards of 2020. With their razor-sharp teeth, hanging talons, and bald heads, the witches are pure nightmare fuel that will surely haunt small children (and adults) for days after. They may not look convincing, but they sure look frightening.Even though the witch effects kept things scary, the mouse effects did not hold up their end of the deal. The entire second half of the film is soiled because of the poor effects work on the rodents. Shockingly, mouse special effects have not progressed in the slightest since Stuart Little (Ratatouille doesn't count since that's all digital).Filling in the role of the Grand High Witch is Anne Hathaway, who gives a no-holds-barred performance complete with heavy accent work and villainous speech patterns. She's more cartoonish than most cartoons, which makes her the most memorable of the cast.Octavia Spencer as the grandmother and Stanley Tucci as the resort manager are much more subdued in their roles, which makes Hathaway stick out even more from the rest of the cast.The child actors that play both their human selves and voice their mouse counterparts rely too much on overacting to get the point across. Their performances can be both blamed on themselves and Zemeckis' lackluster acting direction and screenplay, which was co-written by monster aficionado Guillermo del Toro of all people. Nearly all their dialogue is said in all caps with three exclamation points.The Witches may not live up to its print and celluloid predecessors, but it has just enough campiness and visual splendor that keeps it exciting from start to finish. It's not a good film - or even one I wholly recommend - but it's something that can be semi-enjoyed by the whole family during the waning days of spooky season."}], "reviews_amount": 721}
