{"name": "The Vast of Night", "titleId": "tt06803046", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "I was able to see this Vast of Night at TIFF midnight madness and it did not disappoint. The film takes the story of a small town alien abduction theme and carries out the story precisely the way you would expect; but, its genius comes from HOW the audience is taken through this twilight zone esque story. This is done with fantastic performances from the small cast, and some of the best cinematography I have ever seen, all carried out with the vision of director Patterson. The three acts are carried out in seemingly 3 shots, some scenes lasting over 10 minutes at a time with the operation and set up of 1950s switchboards and film reel taking up much of the action. It allowed me to focus on the scenes primarily with my ears after a few minutes. The action became secondary to the dialogue. So much so that this could work almost as well as a radio play as it does a feature film. When the camera does move, the flow takes us literally seamlessly travel across town and back again which allows us as an audience to feel like we are truly bearing witness to one thrilling evening in a very very small town. At certain points of the film I was begging for a camera cut however, desperate to see the actions or even movement of another character in the scene instead of the one angle, but that's what ultimately gave it its charm. It felt like sitting in the living room listening to a story with our eyes.This sci-fi thriller has the feeling of an old twilight zone episode story but revitalized with incredible performances, direction, and cinematography that allows it to carve out its own unique place: as eery as it is charming."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Call me the weird one, but this movie is trippy. Watching the story go in and out of drone photography, blackouts, black and white to color was fascinating. The director made it work, the acting was intriguing, watching the teenage girl scurry from place to place and all the charm of a trusting small town, well-it I loved it. Very unique."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This, for me, was a near perfect film. Although Its subject matter was of little interest to me, everything else from the score , the lighting the editing AND the magnificent performances were beautiful. The best i've seen for a while. It was a film with so much mood i was mesmerized after the initial 5 (annoying) minutes and was transfixed till the very end. Go see this little gem"}, {"id": 3, "text": "The vibe and the way Vast of Night is filmed is so great! I appreciate the Twilight Zone similarities, I love anything bizarre and the music alone makes the movie better. Captivating cinema I should've watched sooner!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "I really love this film ..the way it is shot ..the characters care very real . Mostly it is so simple .No crash bang wallop they just build up a feeling . It's very good ..Tim"}, {"id": 5, "text": "The actual film making in this movie is genius. It's unique and holds your attention from the first scene through the last. The town of Cayuga's name is a salute to Rod Sterling's production company. The radio station's call letters are WOTW. Everyone knows that there are no radio stations with W call signs west of the Mississippi River. This can only be a nod to War of the Worlds by HG Wells. There are probably other Easter eggs in the film as well. It is period production and acting in the best way possible."}, {"id": 6, "text": "One of the most remarkable film of these years. The Vast of Night sincerely proves that with a tiny powerful subject, movies could still improve and give goosebumps made of suspence, good direction, addictive acting and an amazing plot. Just an intentionally word pun: a classic modern."}, {"id": 7, "text": "The movie starts out with an old TV set playing a knock off Twilight Zone episode, the movie we are watching is supposed to be some sort of twilight zone episode. Most twilight zone episodes clock in at around 25 minutes or so. This movie clocks in at about an hour and a half. This movie could be and should be a 25 minute episode. Scenes go on for FARRR to long in this movie with boring drawn out dialogue that attributes nothing to the story. Most of this movie seems pretty pointless. If it was 25 minutes it would be great! It's also pretty anti climactic nothing really happens... unfortunately But I really dig the vibe of this movie. I love the cinematography, the lighting and just the overall eerie tone of it. It's a 10 in that aspect. I wish I could say this had a lot of potential... but this story really just didn't go anywhere. Fooey"}, {"id": 8, "text": "I'll concede I'm not an unapologetic sci-fi buff but other than some good acting, this movie was simply a cliche' 50's UFO sighting story. Nothing grabbed me at all.

This movie sucked the little will to live out of me in these quarantine times. Jeez"}, {"id": 11, "text": "Be it War of the Worlds, Twilight Zone or The Day the Earth Stood Still, this science fiction romp through a small fictional New Mexico town pays homage to them all. A fun little romp that even tips it's cap to Close Encounters. For those that crave lots of action, look elsewhere; for those of you who like a story and will allow it to develop, you won't be disappointed. This is a small cast gem."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I watched this last night with my wife, and we were sorely disappointed. We had seen the trailers, and thought it looked like it would be a good movie. Then we read some of the reviews, which more or less confirmed our reaction to the trailers.Then, we actually saw it. Nothing happened. The whole thing could have been crammed into a half hour show. There was too much talking, and by that I mean there was too much wasted dialogue, and the characters were talking too fast to make it worthwhile.I'd like to say there was action, but there wasn't any. I'd like to say there was suspense, but there wasn't any. I'd like to say we felt something for the characters, but we didn't.With the ending, we were like, That's it? A cheap knock-off of Close Encounters? So yes, two stars. That's being generous."}, {"id": 13, "text": "I gave this movie an 8/10 because it's a story. Kind of reminds me of being a child and being read a bedtime story. Something fun or wonderful or fanciful or scary or mysterious or adventurous, to fill your head with to wipe out the drama of the day. I imagine what people won't like is the lack of a concrete ending. But that's on them. I encourage folks to stop watching movies for a complete account of something. When it's done - it's done. Where's the magic in that? I love movies and books that end in such a way that your imagination can take off and continue to play it out in many different ways. In that sense it becomes a never ending story in a good, fun way. We live daily drama, reality. Why in the Sam Hill would you want to watch more? Movies and tv should be an escape from reality. As such I found this movie nostalgic, exciting, fun, mysterious and well scripted and well acted."}, {"id": 14, "text": "4/10 \ud83c\udf20\ud83c\udf20\ud83c\udf20\ud83c\udf20 I know it's the 1950's but the whole concept of alien transmissions and secret government projects with soldiers becoming ill after performing certain tasks is outrageously outdated. Yes Sierra Mccormick if I spelled that wrong so be it I'm not a fan but I think she's super cute running around with bifocals wearing a plaid skirt and the dialogue tries it's best to be witty and upbeat with old small american town slightly chauvinistic lingo from 70 years ago but it's just not enough. Maybe they were going for some sort of eureka moment to happen on camera that would draw viewers in and make this film worth while but sadly for me it just didn't happen and I'm not sure what these high ratings are about maybe it's cast or crew but I haven't spoken to anyone who has given this film a thumbs up even teens have been harsh which is the demographic this film is aiming for. Sorry but this will be a hard pass on my recommendation and usually Amazon originals meet a certain entertainment criteria but they do have their duds slip through the cracks more than I'd like to admit."}, {"id": 15, "text": "We always figure mmaybe it'll get better so kept waiting but no luck.

But really, it's messy, unevenly paced, boring, and in the end falls flat. The entire FIRST HALF of the movie is the set up, which shouldn't take more than 15 min, then you have a succession of questionable stylistic choices (45 second long black screen for no reason anyone?) and drawn out monologues that literally made me doze off.

You know when friends, family, cast and crew all submit glowingly positive reviews of a movie that's just plain bland. How can we make that illegal? This is not a ten star film, as some of THEIR reviews suggest. It's not even a 5!! Here's the truth. It's slow, the cinematography tries to be edgy, but instead veers towards annoying, the actors mumble and screech through their lines and the lead actress seems to have a run Forrest run thing going on. AVOID.....unless you've run out of sleeping pills."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I thought it was well acted and the story well told, it could have been about 30 mins longer, slightly slicker in the way 80s movies set in the 50's were made with a bit more background to the characters or a plot twist.Nowhere near as polished or as captivating as Fire in the Sky or Close Encounters but thats not a negative.Anyone who likes the old Twilight Zones or good old fashioned storytelling will appreciate this so that rules out anyone with a short attention span or those that prefer big explosions and stunt action type movies."}, {"id": 21, "text": "I watched the film because 1. There was nothing esle to watch and 2. A glowing review from someone who I now suspect is the filmmakers mother. (That juat a hunch) Let's start with the positives. It's in focus. Ok with that out of the way there is nothing to this film. It's eerily similar to half a dozen Twilight Zones and Outer Limit episodes (which obviously the filmmaker is painfully aware) It's all set-up no payoff. For a brief second you think that something interesting might happen but your hopes are quickly squashed as the film ends in an embarrassingly simple and predictable fashion. Sorry to be as unoriginal as the filmaker but the Vast of Night is a vast waste of time."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Wanted to like it, but yuck! I wish I someone had warned me.Technical issues first: The dialogue is so garbled you will need to turn on CC to figure out what is being said. The mixing is also terrible with blaring background noise and whispering speech.The plot is like a bad urban legend. The acting is fine, though the actors could use projection and annunciation training. It bills itself as an homage to Twilight Zone, but it lacks any kind of real edge or the all important moral and closing narration At the end to add meaning and closure.We fast forwarded through long sections, but still felt like our time had been wasted."}, {"id": 23, "text": "What more do you need to know.

It takes place in the late 1950s in a small southern border town of Cayuga. Fay Crocker (Sierra McCormick ) is a science geek and works as the town switchboard operator. She walks everywhere. She is crushing on Everett Sloan (Jake Horowitz) the local celebrity night time radio DJ at WOTW. During a high school basketball game with nearly everyone at the gym, weird things are going on that leads the audience to believe it is aliens.I liked how the film was done, but it dragged on in too many parts. The interview with Gail Cronauer was horribly long and boring for someone who was going to get to the point. The main characters started out interesting but then waned. It takes too long to see what is happening. Needed a good twist.Guide: I caught 1 quick F-word.

Totaling just 1 hour and 29 minutes, we still had to fast forward through countless minutes of boring and incoherent amateur league dialogue just to see how this thing ended. If anything should be vaporized at the hands of extraterrestrials, it's this sorry excuse for a film.If you're someone who usually doesn't take reviews to heart and prefers to form their own opinion, we warn you - do so at your own risk of losing time that you'll never get back. The trailer is cut with every remotely suspenseful part of the movie and those parts aren't even suspenseful in the context of the film.Best part of this film was the laughs it gave our family when ripping it apart."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Terrible. Nothing but dialog that has nothing to do with the storyline of the movie. There was a little 4 minute camera thing they did and that's the one star this movie gets.

The film script is also very natural. Good, natural dialogues. And alternating chapters; then slowly, then fast cuts, then again black image, then a minimal image, then again fast film cuts. All in all an 8!"}, {"id": 31, "text": "This movie has a definite Stranger Things vibe, with a little Super 8 as well. The story is very similar to Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

If you like watching someone run around aimlessly screaming in a high pitched voice, then this is the movie for you.

The storyline is neat and tight and the camerawork is excellent. Cast performances were top-notch - especially the two leads. It does not have a lot of content, I'll admit that, but that's the whole point. The simplicity of the tale and the brave use of space in the screenplay gives the viewer time to think and imagine and become involved, and so it leaves you with something at the end. 10/10"}, {"id": 35, "text": "Some may think it's a little slow but the acting, dialogue and story line are top notch.

Irony is that Spielberg would know exactly how this type of film should be delivered, fun, exciting and a little scare here and there. Unfortunately we get writing that thinks dialogue is the star of the show but none of the funny bits are funny, dramatic exposition is boring and unengaging and the twist(!?) Isn't really shocking. Track down Another Earth and Midnight Special to see how low budget sci-fi should really be done."}, {"id": 38, "text": "Engaging piece of science fiction, that uses material recycled many times in the past but still manages to escalate the viewers expectations and interest without becoming too melodramatic.

Great camera work. The story lightly comments on one of the most enduring and ongoing mysteries in the real world.The narrative forged by the roaming camera is brilliant.

However, I almost turned it off in the first half hour because the opening scene where you are introduced to the main characters seemed to drag on forever. I was won over because the actors are excellent, the movie is well made and convincing, and the simple story is intriguing. It's not horror as sometimes suggested, it is more drama or thriller. If you are ok with a slow burn where you stick with it because you actually care about the characters, I recommend it."}, {"id": 41, "text": "I'll be the first to admit that this movie is really weird.

Fantastic performances from the 2 leads, great dialogue, music, tension and cinematography. For me this had it all, what a gem."}, {"id": 46, "text": "Often using long takes, at rather slow pace, The Vast of Night is a pleasant surprise. At first the dialogues seem endless and totally unnecessary. But after a while the story develops and becomes more and more intriguing. It leaves quite a lot to the viewer's imagination."}, {"id": 47, "text": "A free English lesson to whoever named this movie - 'vast' is an adjective, what you should have used was the noun 'vastness' as in 'The Vastness of Night' but judging by the cardboard characters and that annoying speed-riffing wannabe hipster DJ who thinks he is the bees' knees (to use a phrase from the 50s) they were trying very hard to be cool. I had to turn on subtitles to understand that dude because all he did was babble out one hipster phrase after another and the girl would excitedly respond as if she had recently run out of Adderall.As others have mentioned, this movie was simply too long and the scenes and irrelevant dialogue stretched the thin gruel that was available. Basically, a 16 year old switchboard operator who follows him around like a puppy dog hears an odd signal from his radio show and he eventually discovers she is right, then broadcasts the sound over his radio show and an ex-military soldier calls in and says essentially it's the same sound he and others had heard when working on top secret projects where they never saw the craft that was covered. He gives them a lead to find a tape with the sound on it and they recover it and realize that it IS the same. Then an old woman calls in urgently requested the DJ to come over so she can give me some great info, except when he does she too babbles on far too long about how her son eventually was taken by something. The DJ decides to take the switchboard operator with him and eventually they spot a massive craft, and the end comes when without showing you anything the implication is made that they were also taken as there were only footprints on the ground with them nowhere to be found. So the ending was sudden and sucked except (1) the hipster and the babbling girl were finally off the screen and (2) my ill-fated cinematic journey was now mercifully over.The production value was fine, the 50s replication was fine but the dialogue was generally witless with scenes simply far too long and repetitive. The girl ran around a lot and the DJ stole someone's car to get around in and passed it off as if it wasn't a felony in the 50s. But Prime is not the only producer that throws money against the wall and sees what sticks; Netflix is even guiltier of this. Can't Hollywood make a good movie any more, at least more than once in a blue moon? You want mind-bending sci-fi then watch the German series 'Dark' about time travel, very very smart and well-acted. If you watch it then make sure you put on English subtitles and turn on the original German - much more engrossing that way."}, {"id": 48, "text": "This will probably win an Oscar because the Academy loves art movies.

But capable of influencing their destinies. They are not seen, but the classic disc appears and interferes with terrestrial radio waves. More than fear it arouses attraction. Everything is narrated visually by the director, using vintage 1950s scenarios, cars, clothes, behaviors and first consumer electronics.

Through a laser-point eye on pacing, dialogue and monologues, I was brought to a fantastical place I did not think possible, at my age and, film experience. The direction, mixing tangible Twilight Zone imagery with pulp, but familiar, small-town America creates an ambiance that is both comfortable and harrowing. Use of practical 50s radio and telephone technology transported me to the Radio Station and switchboard, where I thought I'd have to take the next call inquiring about the 'something in the sky'. This film is not a study of action or special-effects, but one of human nature, albeit sometimes mundane, and who/what wants to observe that nature. Bravo to all involved in the making of this film!!"}, {"id": 56, "text": "Usually I don't mind the slow pace and a good buildup, but this movie is just too much. The fact that literally nothing even remotely interesting is going on in the first 30 minutes or so suggests that this should have been a single episode of black mirror. Even then, it would have been heavily outclassed by superior storytelling. Though I have to admit I don't know what happens in the end since I couldn't stomach a single second more after the 40 minute mark. Furthermore, the movie tries to be artsy with its 50's TV broadcast style combined with long cuts and random 30 sec long black screens(?) I am so tilted for this movie wasting my time, that the first 1/10 from me is well deserved. If you want to watch slow sci-fi, just stick with close encounters of the third kind or the contact.

At the night of the incident there was a basketball game at the high school so the town was almost totally deserted. Fay likes the Everett and wants him to teach her how to use the tape recorder that she just bought. While she's working on that night, she heard a word signal from the radio broadcast and people calling about the things in the sky. Everett let people hear it to see if someone could help them and an old black veteran called them and said he recognized the signal and said he beads it over a secret project in the desert in Nevada when they were digging some holes for the army. And an old lady called fay and said she believes the old veteran and wanted them to go over to her house. They did and she told her story how her son started speaking strange words in an unknown language and one day they abducted him. She said they were the people in the sky. It was very impressive that she said they manipulate us so that we spend our lives doing stupid things and we don't have free will as long as they're up in the sky. They thought she was crazy and left home to go out of town with a couple to see what's on the sky because the babysitter of fays little sister told them that they're up there too. At some point on road Everett played the record the words and the driver fainted for a few seconds and they almost had an accident. Then they got off the car and fay ran into the fields his sister in her arms followed by Everett. In the middle of the forest they noticed the space ship up in the air and the tremendous one right above them. Later on there was a huge wind and their footprints by the recorder half already half buried in soil. They were abducted too like the old lady's son whom they thought crazy.

The mood is wrecked by the soundtrack, post-modern minimalist cliche drivel instead of period music . Just when you think something might happen....Nope. More talk. and again more talk.

The director dragged and stretched it for far too long. There were too many useless details that doesn't have anything to do with the main story and certainly unimportant for viewers to find out. Such as spending several extra minutes just to show you the streets, empty parking spots, and other useless and boring views. I guess they needed to do that, otherwise this flick would've been just 15 minutes long. 80 percent of this movie only consists of conversations. It's like watching a talk show. If you don't like listening to stories being told orally, skip this movie. It's a hell of time consuming garbage. No any real thrill and mystery here.

Not that Everett's snappy responses are any more intelligible. It ruins what little plot the film has, of an unexplained signal Fay has heard at her switchboard job. Nothing much to get excited about but somehow Fay finds a way.

I liked a lot about this movie: the style, the acting, the montage. I watched it in one breath. The ending is not very optimistic, but fully corresponds to the atmosphere of the film. My score - 8/10. Highly recommend."}, {"id": 223, "text": "If you start the movie without knowing anything about it, you will get a general idea after the first quarter of the movie. Critics compare The vast of night with a whole slew of sci-fi movies (Close encounter of the third kind) or TV shows (The X-file). The closest resemblance, strange that no one mentioned, is to the TV show Project Blue Book which premiered just last year, but is unfortunately cancelled after its first season despite receiving a not too shabby 7.6 rating from IMDb users. The cancellation is a big disappointment to Game of Thrones fans as the star of the show is none other than Aidan Gillen, better known as Lord Littlefinger Baelish. But I digress. The vast of night is set in the 1950s, the era of Cold War and UFO scare. I almost felt I was watching another episode of Project Blue Book when strange objects in the sky are initially thought to be Soviet devices by one of the protagonists. The stage of this mini-budget sci-fi indie is set at Cayuga, a fictional New Mexico town, and more specifically the sports stadium in a local high school where an evening basketball match is about to start. Two students cannot stay as they have respective part-time evening jobs. Fay (Sierra McCormick) works as a switchboard operator while Everett (Jake Horowitz) is a D.J. at the local radio station. They are friendly, but clearly have no romantic implications. Rather, he is more like a mentor, tutoring Fay on interview skills. Wal together for most of the way to their respective workplaces, they practice interviewing on people they pass by. As it is a small town, it seems that everybody knows everybody else.The opening sequence is brilliant, with the fluid camera tracking their movement, sometimes at the distance from the back, sometimes closer, intermingled with various dialogue with various people. Before you know, you have become a member of the small town and a friend to the two slightly nerdy but very likable protagonists.The meat, so to speak, comes as we approach the mid-point of the movie. It am not going into details but very briefly Fay hears, repeatedly scratchy electronic noises from her switchboard. She contacts Everett and soon, they are in this together. There are various call from people telling their strange experience, one of which is accompanied often with an entirely black screen, and effective device, and not overused. One of them ends up in a face-to-face interview. To say more will take away some of the pleasure of enjoying this gem of a movie. There is nothing new in the subject matter. It's the style of the filming and the performance of the cast that is mesmerizing. Brilliant!"}, {"id": 224, "text": "Why this film has such a high rating I've no idea. Its so slow.

The two main characters piece together what is happening in their small New Mexico town thought they're not totally convinced until they see irrefutable evidence at the end.

Opening scene way too long and dialogue manic and irrelevant. The old TV screen Twilight Zone 'esque' scenes were just plain useless. Use of switchboard was intriguing and interesting component of the unfolding of the story. I found it hard to believe that the radio show announcer didn't think of aliens ever throughout the whole movie until he saw the ship hovering over his head. Sure, Soviets were on people's mind in the 50s, but didn't this dummy ever see The Day the Earth Stood Still or Forbidden Planet?

You've been hearing this affecting, chilling, orchestral score this whole movie, but for some reason, when that c-chord on the piano hits, I was absolutely overwhelmed both emotionally and viscerally. This score, the characters, the little texas town, the cinematography -- I cannot overstate how much I felt this movie.

The finale was OK, if not predictable, but to reach there one must endure some inspired but mostly bland talk-a-thon from most of the participants.

Amazon picked it up for their streaming service, but it really deserves a full scale theatrical release.The movie stars an 18 year old Sierra McCormick as deliciously wholesome 16 year old school girl Fay Crocker, and Jake E. Horowitz as local disc jockey Everett. The chemistry between them is superb, and their performances are utterly convincing.It's the night of a big basketball game in a quiet US rural town, and Fay is busy on the phone switchboard while Everett presents his evening show to an audience of less than a dozen. A bit of random weirdness leaves Fay on edge, and as the tension ramps up she realises something very big is about to happen. With Everett's help, she tries to unravel the mystery while juggling filial and vocational responsibilities.The camera work in this film is second to none. There's one particularly long tracking shot that has to be seen to be believed. The dialogue is wonderfully natural, and the pacing is perfect.Keep your eyes peeled for a neat little Easter egg referencing a famous work of classic sci-fi!I rate The Vast of Night at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a breathless 9/10 on IMDB."}, {"id": 325, "text": "This is a small story in a small town, with ordinary people going through some.weird stuff.

The Vast of Night avoids tropes of sci-fi movies by cleverly using its low budget to its advantage. This movie isn't Independence Day, and it has no interest in being that. Instead it serves as a loving homage to '50s sci-fi without being bound by nostalgia. Without spoiling anything, the ending may not be for everyone, but I in particular loved it.

He makes the jump from boring to ridiculous within the first 3 minutes of his cliched, fast talking, wannabe-DJ, silver tongued devil schtick. It gets old fast and continues to distract throughout the entire film.The saving grace of this at best mediocre attempt at 50's sci-fi is the cinematography. Long, single shots coupled with seamless fade ins and outs are the lone reason to endure the yawns. However, there is very little action so it could easily be listened to with no eyes on the screen and nothing would be missed.Frankly, the imagination can add more to the story being set in 1950's New Mexico better than the screenplay delivers.

By now, we've mostly surrendered all suspensionable disbelief before our butts meet seats. So what is this thing that occasionally slips past our carefully tended cynicisms, like a slow-acting spiked beverage, to lodge unshakably in our consciousness?Months into the 2020 quarantine, when habits became a tinge warped, I found myself watching The V of N three nights in a row, enjoying more of it each time but unable to dissemble what I found so enthralling. I coaxed other eyes to watch it (remotely), but the response was a blowsy Meh. I couldn't let that go, countering with a few aspects that I thought might account for my mesmerized response to the film. Yeah, that was the best part, was all I got back. Huh.English language film-making of the last 40 years has largely abandoned the texture and the brazen attitudes that once made Anglo cinema a distinctively muscular presence in world culture. Satiny serializations now flood a market which, at one time, threatened to buckle under an assault against our collective movie-going subconscious. Artistic codes of conduct, arguments about the limits of vulgarity, audiences' struggles with a perilous learning curve - all seemed to be breathing, expanding (after periods of recovery) under this rough treatment. And then, without much warning, it mostly dissolved into cloying mush, as if a little tired of astonishing us. If you want to be challenged now without having to read subtitles, there is really only horror to reliably do the job. And that sensation has dwindled to a creepy tickle.But, in the newish century, subtle disturbances are beginning to be felt, like a breeze unnoticed until you see it moving the trees. Modestly budgeted genre films, like Take Shelter, and Gareth Edwards' first theatrical feature Monsters, from 2010, gently undermine the structural supports of what should be thoroughly exhausted tropes. With a more meditative, dreamlike manner than found in the rightly praised hallmarks of mid-20th filmic mayhem and paranoia, this second wave of apocalypse anxiety and fear of shadow forces unspools amid drab, realistic surroundings, peopled not with everymen/women but prickly, unsettled characters who've stopped looking for a place to fit. Signs of life.There's nothing exactly new here - the vocabulary has long been set, and the times are perhaps unready to birth new idioms. Still, language, an assurance of tone and stubborn resistance to metronomic pacing unite features as dissimilar as Moon, Nightcrawler and the unclassifiable The One I Love. They are also utterly adult films, with no enticements to lucrative youth-market vectors. What distinguishes them from their golden age predecessors may mostly be the absence of an outsider community for their makers. One burst of startling vitality from a newcomer on the veldt is all it takes to alert entertainment industry predators, who come flooding out of agency warrens to drive them into the homogenizing machinery of the Hollywood herd with sickening skill. Little support is afforded to outliers to pursue their independence.TVON - a puckish acronym for a transmission-mad flick - is among the first of these maverick works to leave a light on for young viewers. Andrew Patterson, the credit-averse writer/director/producer, financed this first feature almost entirely on his own dime. Is it possible that he's right, that the attention spans of 21st Century youth might need breakneck conversational rhythms lifted from 40s comedies, and sets kitted out with period detail that wouldn't embarrass David Lynch's production designers? Patterson's displaced artificiality isn't sneaky, either. It greets you at the door, in framing devices that intrude on action and suggest that the movie is itself an episode from a 50s television series called Paradox Theater, playing to an empty living room. Irony and the archness of kitsch are notably absent - the characters and story are as open to experience as an off-leash twelve year old.Equally risky, Patterson upends the paradigmatic flow of nearly every thriller since the 70s, launching his leads out of the gate at a pace that, near the halfway mark, slackens to take in rambling accounts from two elderly informants, one seen, the other only heard. This easing off the throttle would dismember the average tale of suspense, but it is how such entertainments can be made bearable to children.Professional and recreational reviewers of The V of N have name-checked a number of obvious predating works, particularly Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Stranger Things and the pandering, ineffectual Super 8. There's a glancing resemblance to American Graffiti as well, with townsfolk so rooted inside their enormous automobiles they appear to be living in them; and, in it's radio station setting, to the remarkable Canadian picture Pontypool. But these are no stronger influences than the airier SciFi features of the post-war period we're revisiting, or some of the dark-toned art/independent films flowing out of Mexico, South America, Asia and Africa in the last 20 years. What may have set off the grousing in many user/blogger reviews is this work's artistic atmosphere, neither listing toward dread nor wonder, and the patience required to attend carefully to a narrative that's spoken as often as visualized.There are also plenty of kinetic thrills. Long takes thread throughout the movie, in tracking shots that move through a smalltown in New Mexico (really Texas), where almost of all the residents are convening after dark for a high school basketball game. Later, the camera takes off again, gliding past one of the protagonists at her switchboard post and over the empty streets, darkened backyards, through a parking lot and into a glowing gymnasium, where it eases around cheering teenagers and townies, onto the court in full play and up into the bleachers, then out a second story window to end at the local radio statio. There the DJ, our other guide, stands smoking outside, contemplating the night sky while broadcasting a signal that may have come down from it.More daring still are slow zooms that focus for minutes on the leads talking, or just listening, and disorienting black outs that force our awareness of leaning in to the darkness. These scenes make great demands on the actors, not a one of whom disappoints. We're in the fabled age when technology has begun to be spiritualized, summoning demons out of the clouds, and every character not in thrall to local athletics succumbs to a slow pull toward the uncanny.Patterson has made a perfectly scaled paean to the yearnings of land-locked, small town Americans nearing the end of our affair with ideas of innocence. (It must be one of American cinema's more patiently cataloged eras, like the Regency for the Brits). His handling of character could have read skin-deep if not for the long moments we're allowed to just observe a young woman sitting at her shabby workstation, and the way that a man's prized veneer of cool can begin to give at the seams. Somehow even the big reveal hovers within the frame of its characters' imaginations, instead of catering to ours. On occasion, something almost perfect is delivered by an artist holding all the reins. And almost perfect is just about what movies should dare to be.There's no reason this should work. Whether it does for you may depend on if you've ever felt driven to watch a challenging movie more than once, to see if it might be different when freed from anticipation and relentless expectations. If foreign films bug you, or you can't endure minutes passing without explosive stimulation, you probably won't make it far into The Vast of Night. The delicate sound design, an almost subliminal score by Erick Alexander and Jared Bulmer, Chilean cinematographer Miguel Littin-Menz's astonishing camera work, the assured, intuitive performances of leads Sierra McCormick and Jake Horowitz and a game supporting cast - none of this is likely to make much difference.

I'm glad I hung in there.The two main characters are likable. The story (eventually) came together quite entertainingly. (Please don't ask me what that stupidity was with the trombone, though.) I loved that couple that came out of nowhere and responded to the . . . well. I don't want to spoil that one for you.For some reason, this film had me thinking in black and white. Like I was rewatching The Last Picture Show. The era, Texas, the flatness. Those old buildings. I kept expecting Cybill Shepherd to pop up.I dunno. I liked it. I liked the urgency of it and the way everything seemed so 50s. They did a really good job making you feel you were in the 50s. However, as another reviewer stated, the Twilight Zone/Paradox TV thing was a bit much; better without that cutesy artsy? bit of nothing.After a while, Horowitz' accent seemed to mellow out to where it was more believable. I got really into looking at Fay's glasses ----- those rims! -----and wondering why it's the first time I'd ever seen that style. Maybe in sunglasses, but surely never in prescription glasses.The character names were straight out of Top Baby Names of the 1950s. For me, that added to the fun. I'm sad, though, that there were no Mildreds or Hazels. They could have at least thrown in a Phyllis.The old lady (too lazy to look up her real name----Cronauer?) did a bang-up job of it. She was terrific. I give her 10 stars.REAL SPOILER ALERT: At the end, the spaceship itself was a bit hokey. Maybe that was the point? That it was supposed to look like what people in the mid-20th century imagined spaceships looked like?I can see why some people went on a rant about how bad this movie is. But-----I'm right up there in the top 10% of people who are among the first to bail on a stinker. On the big screen, on my laptop, doesn't matter. Usually, I give it 20 minutes.

What if they really exist? and from that the movie has this strength to bring out this enigmatic question of an extraterrestrial life. Remember the fore of the suggestion in: War of the Worlds (HG Wells) that Orson Welles was telling the story on the radio, in 1938, the broadcast of Orson Welles' version of War of the Worlds would have? , according to the legend, created a panic movement in the United States.

This movie is a good example for the question: how to keep the audience motivated for the movie, without a very special story line. the director can really do this using environment and ambiance. and if he didn't knew how to work with these, the movie would be ruined and had nothing to represent or say. It's interesting that we get to know Everett by watching the reaction of people around him, not by hearing dialogs from himself or his acting, the technique we see too much in other movies. in fact his popularity is not made by himself, it's the expression we receive from people faces. we don't even see his face clearly in the first half of the film.The idea of showing the sound wave by surfing the camera on the ground was great. In the new age movies there is more use of longshots, I think it's because of that the longshots makes the events look more real and believable. just like this movie, the longshots are amazing.there is some trickery on director's mind, and that's the usage of Light. lighting is an important element for showing the vast of a spaceship. so the director intentionally uses dark scenes with minimum lighting during the film, and when the ship with its magnificent lights come by, it will steal audience eyes for many moments. I find it breath taking actually.my problem with this movie is that the hero of our drama is introduced from the beginning and soon he will lose his title (hero). in fact not even half of the movie has a hero, this passing title is not suitable for a drama like this. and we don't know if this is a tragic story or not.in the end, I personally am very determined to see more from Paterson."}, {"id": 364, "text": "The Vast of Night (2020) on Amazon Prime is well worth a watch.

Too much of stretched scenes, stretched shots, single shots for a long time, he just filled up the gap with hours long of verbal waste!

I watch 2001: A Space Odyssey quite a lot. In a way, 2001 is the opposite of Vast of Night. 2001 shows, Vast tells. 2001 has some mind blowing concepts. Vast has one, its ending, where not only are there aliens, THEY ARE ARRIVING. Vast didn't earn this ending.I really expected to like this because I used to listen to Art Bell's Coast to Coast radio program. The parts where the DJ is on air actually do evoke a similar feeling. There's the host, the callers, and everybody is some anonymous voice in the dark, and you feel like you're sharing in secrets with some sort of club, albeit knowing it's 99%+ fantasy. The title ITSELF, The Vast of Night, perfectly evokes this feeling.I think the worst mistake here was when they visit the old lady. It seems crazy contrived for one thing, but it has extremely long speeches, with barely changing camera angles. It this supposed to be a movie or a deposition? This should have been a caller into the radio program too. I suspect the production was worried that it would be too boring if it was all done as callers, but watching this woman talk in profile for endless stretches certainly doesn't solve that problem.And the unearned ending: the UFOs are here! Uh, great, but that means the entire story up to that point was utterly irrelevant. The two leads could have watched TV for the first 80 minutes for all the difference it makes.The acting was fine, and I found the DJ rather charming. And there's a very lengthy shot where we zoom all through town, to the basketball game, etc that's pretty cool. Did they use a drone?

(and seems abductions is the first on the list these space folk go far. Laike going for water during shark attacks). And with a baby... go for the full sad hit I guess.

And so what happens? She gets her wish disregarded and left again.Only wanted to see her son. Denied as well. Bit sour. I thought at least they would have the recording to playback whilst in the woods; regretting not taking the lady's list. But... we have it on tape! And then play it to the 'beings.

Worse still is the introduction of fade outs and fade-ins bringing back the old TV image as if to show where the ad breaks would be a la Playhouse 90 from sixty years ago.The ending is telegraphed fairly early on which is disappointing while it has the sense of a Serling show or Bradbury story has none of the emotional context."}, {"id": 419, "text": "This is a tough one, since it has some charms.

But this movies does not seem to have a real plot, other than a very vague visit from space aliens. But as for a space-invasion movie, this was all done 50 years ago. The movie itself clearly references the old Twilight Zone; this would have been a very run-of-the-mill Twilight Zone episode (30 minutes). There are no special effects, no aliens, no spade-ships, no battles with aliens. The movie is more centered on the characters and their reactions to the situation. If this was meant to be a throw back to sci-fi stories from the 1960's, then it achieved that. But then again I'm not really sure who wants to watch a re-make of a Bonanza episode, or a My Favorite Martian show. The suspense is good; but I guess the problem is that there is no delivery on the back end. If the point of the movie is aliens come to earth and take some humans, then we have already seen that better done many times (e.g. Close Encounters). A few devices in the plot seem a bit odd too. For example, that the telephone operator would be so fascinated by that sound is odd. She would just think it's a strange glitch. Certainly in that time period the switchboard technology would sometimes fail or produce static or strange noises. Then, the one guy calls into the radio station to say that he heard that same noise before; but again this noise is not really that distinctive; it's just like radio static and squeaking. But OK: But even then his story does not really make a strong link between that noise and aliens. Then, there is the lady who calls the station to give another story; her story is not related to that noise at all, but is simply a weird story about her son whom she things was abducted (by people in the sky--hmm); but this does not in any way tie into previous story, other than that the first caller vaguely suggested an alien-connection with the phone noise, and she has formed an alien theory. This is OK, and watchable, but it seems to be in a no-man's-land and has a somewhat peculiar story line."}, {"id": 421, "text": "Lovely little sleeper low-budget sci-fi. Could I have had more? Sure.

It's a good effort from Andrew Patterson with plenty of attention to detail and at times the frequent toing and froing creates a sense of anticipation, but most of the time it rather ambles along and if alien life did, indeed, arrive on Earth and find these to be typical humans then they might well just promptly zip off again, or destroy the planet!"}, {"id": 424, "text": "The filmmaker did a great job in terms of creating mood, at all levels.

In fact, I am amazed on how careful they were with the details, the acting, the production in general. It is a story of alien encounter, but slow burning, focusing on the characters and the era. Quite frankly, I was blown away. It might feel kind of slow, but get into its rhythm and you will not get disappointed. The only thing that bothered me, ever so slightly, was that there was not enough focus on the actors' faces, it kept them a bit obscured. I am sure it was by design and part of the atmosphere of the story, but I wish it were lighted differently.Bottom line: if you like good sci-fi, people doing their best to build something beautiful and a film with meaning, watch this.P.S. It might be difficult to get through the first 15 minutes, they use a lot of American jargon from the 50s, but don't worry, what they are saying is not relevant to the story at large, it's just setting things up."}, {"id": 463, "text": "Just yesterday's evening I turned yet another page on my journey through Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone, and even though I was anticipating The Vast of Night, I did not predict it to be so pleasantly and thickly atmospheric, beautiful and just plain awesome, as well as inspired by everything that's twilight-zone-esque. So, fans of such vibes, assemble, because we got an unlikely modern gem on our hands.Things that'll follow are impressive, and become even more impressive in the light of the fact that The Vast of Night is the very first voyage into cinema by its director Andrew Patterson and both writers, James Montague and Craig W. Sanger - three names to look forward to in the future. The cast is quite unknown as well, and the budget is micro, allegedly pulled together by the director. On the foreground of these factors, this already well-oiled lo-fi modern sci-fi classic-in-making glows even more brightly.In the first couple minutes the movie makes it known its served as if it was an episode of a fictional 50's sci-fi fantasy TV show called Paradox Theather, an obvious and acknowledged The Twilight Zone knock-off. The first act we spend following the lively and lovely main characters through their small home town of Cayuga (another nod to Rod Serling) - they are local radio DJ Everett (Jake Horowitz) and young switchboard operator Fay (Sierra McCormick). Quickly enough we see and feel the many qualities of The Vast of Night that'll stay with us till the end. One of them is the setting of 50's, which is fulfilled with great attention to detail, both visually and mentally, it's the time where small towns seemed more intimate and unified, and when future seemed like an endless and uncertain stream of far-reaching possibilities. Another point of great charm is the cinematography, perhaps one of my favorite examples of this art in a long time. There are many long takes, some mostly static, some moving one-takes, one of which might prompt a silent whoa. The longest take was, I believe, about 9 and a half minutes long. Cinematographer M. I. Littin-Mentz (Hands of Stone, Resistance) has made the camera a presence of sorts, a force of intimacy and uneasiness. In regards of editing, there are some choices that might prompt some why's, but there's nothing that'd really take away or take out much of anything. The sum of the elements come out on the far positive side, providing an atmosphere that immerses, you'll be a citizen of Cayuga before You know it.The main story kicks into gear at the start of the second act, as both our heroes encounter an eerie radio signal floating on the local waves, and start trying to unspool the slow descending mystery. The Vast of Night pays homage to multiple sci-fi and horror classics, yet it constantly feels original and inventive on its own, somehow mixing together sticky and sweet feeling of nostalgia with a breath of fresh creativity and originality, letting the latter lead the show at all times. Same can be said about the haunting original score, composed by Erick Alexander and Jared Bulmer, to whom this is also the very first endeavor in movies. The movie, for the most part, is essentially a talking piece, and the overall idea is as ominous and ambiguous as you'd probably guess, so action sci-fi fans and lovers of structured and concluded stories might find themselves frustrated.Props also have to be given to the previously mentioned Jake Horowitz and Sierra McCormick. The Vast of Night is Jake's very first full feature acting debut, and I'd never guessed that while watching the movie, for both he and Sierra do a terrific job in their roles and carry on with the night's vibes in admirable synchronicity. I'm not the guy to know, but I felt like even the accents, the language and way of talking of the 50's was generally nailed.It's one of those movies where it's better to go in blind, yet I believe it's healthy to estimate what not to expect - and so we've got that out of the way. As the credits were rolling, I found myself happily thinking that the sense of wonder still exists, there are secrets to uncover, and that creativity, as well as some forgotten and amazing vibes, is alive and well.

For now, it's playing the film festival circuit...and I saw it at the Philadelphia Film Festival. I am glad I did, as the movie really managed to produce a huge bang for very few bucks. To make up for the low budget, the movie is very dark and makes the most of creepy music and a creepy atmosphere.The story is designed like an installment of a 1950s teleplay--a movie made for television. It opens on a television screen and soon the camera pans in and the movie begins in earnest. It is set in a tiny Texas town and stars mostly two folks, a young man and his teenage lady friend. The pair hear strange sounds at night that are unexplained...and the rest of the town never notices since nearly everyone else is at the local high school basketball game. What are the sounds and who is responsible? Watch the film!The director is the star her as well as the folks who created the look of the picture.

This film is shot well but ends with the most generic ending you could possibly get out of a sci fi film. This film is 99% dialogue. Aimless meaningless stories that drone on and on. Aimless meaningless dialogue between characters for the sole reason of making the Era the film takes place in seem authentic. Let me put it this way, and I mean this in all seriousness, you can actually not watch this movie and listen to the audio only and never miss a single thing. I'm dead serious and actually challenge you to try it. This is legitimately and audio book put to film minus the last few scenes.There are 2 characters who tell their stories of what they think might be going on but they go on and on and on while the camera remains static for 10 mins at a time. It is mind numbingly boring and barely important to the story. Again with this new generation of writing and movie making very little is explained. The only thing I could gather from the 2 stories was some light social commentary on race and human nature although I may be way off base there. I honestly have no idea how anyone is rating this boring film so high. It is actually misleading to me that this almost rated a 7. Keep in mind this film is made by Amazon and I firmly believe reviewers are being paid off for favorable reviews (85 on meta critic). I was actually looking forward to this film but am so disappointed by it that I canceled Amazon prime.

I know it is only an hour and 30 long, which shocked my when i saw it because it felt like nearly 2 hours. The scenes kind of meander along at a sluggish pace with nothing rally happening. The first 20 minutes of this movie is a walk home from school. I am not exaggerating. It is just them leaving school and walking home for 20 minutes. Now i will say they try to keep it interesting with the shots and the dialogue is fine but it doesn't take away from that fact that its too long for such a simple scene. I guess you could argue that it is used to set the characters up but i got that with in the first like 3 minutes of meeting them.I honestly think this would have been better as a 20-30 minute episode of The Twilight Zone. Even the 2019 version because there is a good idea somewhere in this movie. Moments had me intrigued, i wanted to know what was going on then you would be hit with nothing happening again. I understand the budget wasn't a lot and that probably contributes to this as they didn't have as much sets and locations.The actors did a good job and they had a lot of work to do as like 90% of this movie is just them talking sometimes with no one else in the room so i think they did a good job.The only reason that i think you should watch it is because there are good ideas in here and i think this writer/directer could make great films in the future. I think he did the best he could with the budget.

I get the impression that for every dollar spent on this production, ten dollars somehow ended up on the screen. The level of craft here is pretty high.What's most impressive about the movie is its pair of lead performances. These two nerdy small-town dreamers are believable and charming; we feel their low-key affection for each other, and quickly begin to love them ourselves. The supporting cast is top-notch all the way through: natural and understated-but this is almost a movie for two actors, and they're so damn good they carry the movie.This is a quiet movie about small-town life in 1958 that becomes something bigger in an unexpectedly moving way.The Twilight Zone framing device was stylish but unnecessary, and the movie would have been better off without it.

Imagine if Steven Spielberg had no talent for storytelling, no budget, no composer, and no stars to work with 3. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to know how much patience they could suck out of an audience without inciting a riot 4. I think the cameraman fell asleep a few times, himself ... there are some times when it just shut off to black for no apparent reason for several minutes. It seems the only logical conclusion. Or perhaps they were just trying to save room on their MacBook? 5. There is a LONG scene where an old lady tells a story, which is a clever metaphor for the entire movie. It feels like you are being told a story by a senile geriatric, constantly looking at the time, and trying to think of some way to get out of it.

Once it did start I quickly and thankfully stopped noticing the bites. If you don't like Sci Fi this isn't for you but if you do enjoy it I'm not sure what you could complain about. It has no one you'd recognize and it's not big budget so those could be issues to some but and I guess if you have watched TZ so much your sick of it but it's really excellent for what it is. I got the same creepy feeling I did the first time I saw several TZ episodes. It had a tense, naive honesty that made TZ a show that's still popular and has another version of airing right now. It reminds me of the summer nights as a kid when you could stay up late or camp in the back yard and a staple of that was a portable tv in the tent at midnight as that's when it was on tv in my hometown every summer this was our routine.

It doesn't build the characters, it doesn't add anything to the story. It just fills the time. (budget-Tarantino style, and I do not use that as a compliment - for me he's the pinnacle of style-over substance film-making)The much-vaunted, very long tracking shot half way through is creepy because it is shot as a creature POV, which turns out to be a ruse as it is simply intended as an artistic cinematographic shot to tie together locations. So that's another bit of screen-time wasted. The lighting was certainly moody though, so some credit is due for the basics.The ending when it finally came was very much a who cares moment for me.

This movie felt to me (just an average lower to middle class 40-something wife and mother of 3 boys in the mid-south of USA) a presentation-well, more like slipping in to a silent, invisible observation or spectator mode, ...the literal fly on the wall experience. I'm not an expert or officinado of directors, the movie-making process, or 'whose who' of the Hollywood world. But I DO know what I like and our family loves watching movies and TV and love even MORE finding that rare unique gem of a story amongst the crap that's daily regularly served on platters of glitzy CGI (which CGI does have its place but is rarely used in conjunction with an actual interesting thought-provoking story with an actual interesting thought-provoking cast who credit the audience and camera a measure of dignity and intelligence) and stuffed with sickening sex and violence for absolutely no purpose at all but to constantly OUT-DO each other like high school jocks to see who can shock and horrify and traumatize our children and all of us in general, worse. But back to the movie, because there's a whole bunch more I can say about that, but I genuinely REALLY liked this movie and want to focus on why. And it surprised me to see myself SO annoyed at the low ratings which surprise me at all. But it moved me to write my own review and speak to those who may not give it a try because of the grandiose arrogance of shallow folks who think they know what makes a movie Good quality. There is a place in the entertainment industry for the likes of Dumb and Dumber, 007 stuff, the whole Marvel and DC comic franchises (the modern day movies-not the original comics), slapstick and shoot'em up-blow 'em up and let's not think too hard kind of entertainment. I love a good light comedy, love a good sweet romance, a silly wacky gutbuster, bold epic sagas with sweeping, breathtaking CGI...there's a place for that in our hearts and in our wallets for our entertainment budget. But that's not the only entertainment worth noting and making space for.The Vast of Night introduces itself as mentioned by others as an episode of something like a Twilight Zone, a 50's version of X-Files. Yes, there were periodic tones of it that feels reminiscent of Close Encounters,...or something similar. But it was mere 'tones'. It wasn't identical. The bulk of the story and 100% of the presentation of the story was entirely unique.As the old 50's TV set complete with 50's style black and white, pixelated and fuzzy projection proceeds with this 'episode' we're gradually sucked into the TV both literally and metaphorically. The black and white shifts to sepia, to mixed and grainy, back and forth throughout, but not jarringly so. The shifts in filters seem to fill a purpose on its own.As the story commences we're introduced to the main male lead. He character is assertive and rough and confident and ambitious...but not overly so. He's also very ordinary. Besides the fact that we've never seen him before, this actor, Jake Horowitz, is utterly believable as Everett. And for that matter-they ALL are. I've never seen any of these actors before, and I'm generally-speaking pretty good at remembering the names and faces of actors in the many movies I've seen over the years. And my basic experience has been, if I've never heard of at least half of the cast, nor the production company, then it's going to suck. Mostly I'm right. Occasionally I'm pleasantly surprised. And this is one of those extremely rare (if ever) times that ALL of the cast comes off as completely authentic. And what that means is, from what I sense of the purpose the director was trying to achieve was: here's exactly what it looks like if a creepy, science fiction event were to happen to UTTERLY AVERAGE ORDINARY PEOPLE. Not cool, famous Hollywood sparkly unrealistic cookie cutter, airbrushed people. But flawed, real, ordinary people. Now for those surface folk who daily live on pre-packaged synthetic junk-food your typical Hollywood flashy 'air-food' that are so gluttonously ADD-addicted to fast-moving scenes stuffed and overflowing with action and the only dialogue they have to mentally process is the occasional cliche phrases of few words...then yeah, Lol, um, you're not gonna get it honey ... Did you ever go to school with that girl that was a science geek that talked really fast,...she had a crush on an older boy, and saw something in him others missed? Not just that he was confident and had a cool job at the radio station...She saw past his gruff, straight-forward manner, he was intelligent and capable and bold. He made things happen. She could trust him. Yes, she really talked fast and really talked a lot. We wouldn't know that about her is she didn't actually TALK A LOT. We don't have to hear every word and know exactly every word she's saying. That's NOT THE POINT. What we're supposed to be gleaning from these long scenes and long extended conversations is the essence of these are real people. And we gather enough from the dialogue of her personality. Her curiosity about the future and advancement in technology...her fascination with what's possible. She's an ordinary intelligent girl...and possibly annoying to some. You might not have liked her IRL. But you're missing out on a whole slew of golden nuggets of movies if you're only watching movies with likable characters. And it's actually pretty immature. You don't have to like her for it to be a quality movie. War Games is noted as an all-time classic quality movie with quality acting. Ally Sheesh to me is one of the most annoying actresses of all time. Several of the roles she plays are the same typical silly, giggly 80's girl with that annoying Valley girl way of talking that apparently Hollywood thought was cute in those days. But when one has the capacity to accept that you don't have to LIKE her character, to see that she's actually a GOOD actress just playing an ANNOYING character. You move past the annoying part, let it go, and just let the movie tell it's story. Youre able to appreciate something authentic and genuine. I didn't find Sierra McCormick's character as Fay annoying at all. And I saw that we're purposely being drawn into what seems as monotonous, idle, chitchat...you just ride along on every step and every moment of these two kids night-suddenly turns out to be not so average and not so ordinary turn of events. But to see it stunningly brought to life by these achingly honest ordinary real people ...you're hooked in. On the edge literally of my seat.The abrupt turns of the camera to face the character, the sudden pauses focusing on a facial expression, music and audio strikingly clear but just as muffled and dull both at exactly the right moments, the viewer being firmly poised as the camera drifts and glides and hovers without stopping, low over the ground, sliding up awkwardly over a characters shoulder, whirling around-not to give the viewer the greatest vantage point of view-but rather presenting a sensation of an actual invisible spectator keeping the scenes completely seamlessly connected giving the viewer the vivid intense feeling of living each moment with the character, of ACTUALLY witnessing something of the extraordinary.It does not come off as arrogant or bully you. You're left to draw your own conclusions and opinions. I most certainly will keep an eye out for more from this director and curious to see how the two leads' careers move forward."}, {"id": 475, "text": "The Vast Of Night captures the essence and makings of an unforgettable sci-fi flick.

Very low-key, grounded, with no real action - I feel some people were perhaps expecting something a little different.Personally, I found it really compelling once things start happening, though the first 20 odd minutes are perhaps unnecessarily long as a scene-setter.I would also complain that for those first 20 minutes, it was genuinely difficult at times to hear what the characters were even saying - fast, muffled, speaking.Overall though I really enjoyed it.

But The Vast of Night plops you right in the middle of small-town 1950's life and in long extended take scenes you follow a character (soon to be two characters) around as they chit chat and, basically, give you a chance to know them as people. It must be a very difficult way to make a film, which is why most directors are lazy and rely entirely on cut/cut/cut and facial closeups of single characters, never allowing the rhythm of real live to be felt.None of this would have worked if the acting wasn't superb, or if the camerawork felt gimmicky. But the effect is to allow you to feel as if you're really there, in their town, right alongside them in their lives.Once the sci-fi angle comes in, the suspense is skillfully built, and the film doesn't overplay its hand.If you're looking for a standard sci-fi thriller, you may be disappointed ... there aren't huge explosions and an overbearing cinematic score to cue you for how you should react ... but if you're in the mood for something surprisingly different and well done, try The Vast of Night.

However, the director, who is close to a first timer (its his first movie released 2016) brings sound suspense to a whole new level which was impressive across the film's face and leaves a fresh sense of wonder and childhood small-town nostalgia.For the very invested, which I am, i would give it 3/10. Barely anything built on itself and the characters were never really given space in the plot to show-off themselves in unique ways. It feels like this film showed up to Thanksgiving without the southwest broiled chicken they talked up over 4yrs, but never brought it to the feast...The film hardly accelerates to a next level until after 60ish minutes into a 90min film, which is bullcrap. I honestly believe the director could have make an excellent short film out of this, but sadly his full feature only had about 25min of actual plot development. Cinematography,small town setting, sound design, and unique suspense building kept me strapped in. Overall, for me though, its was a big letdown, BUT i look forward to what the director cooks up in the future."}, {"id": 482, "text": "GRADE: C-Despite its low-budget and good intentions, the movie is a dreadful Twilight Zone retread.JIM'S REVIEW: The least said, the better about The Vast of Night. It's an awful title for an awful movie. Granted, the film has a clever enough premise, but the whole enterprise is amateurishly done in direction, acting, and production values.Andrew Patterson's film is an homage to Twilight Zone, but it is more an insult to its memory. This small independent film may have big aspirations, but those are limited in the poor execution of its story. For a sci-fi mystery, the film has very little tension, logic, or suspense.We are plunked down in an episode of a television program called Paradox Theatre, a framing device for the film that resembles the old Rod Serling series. This is the sleepy small town of Cayuga, New Mexico. It's the 1950's and everyone in town will be at the high school basketball game except for telephone receptionist Fay Crocker, (annoyingly played by Sierra McCormick) and radio jock Everett, (a forgettable Jake Horowitz). Somehow Fay receives a phone transmission of a strange high frequency sound. She shares this with Everett and they investigate in the loopiest way possible. We all know where this is going and it leads to an unsatisfying and foregone conclusion.Mr. Patterson shows some promise with his camera movement, but he frames his story with a Twilight Zone format that undercuts the narrative and the pacing is slow-moving throughout. The screenplay by James Montague and Craig W. Sanger needs to have better character development and stronger dialog. Except for the acting of Gail Cronauer in a supporting role, this essentially two-person cast has little chemistry. Their relationship reminded me of the old Saturday Night Live skit about The Nerds with Lisa Loopner and and her friend Todd, without the humor factor. While one can admire the inventiveness of the filmmakers and cast on such a low-budget production, the end result is ultimately an exercise in disappointment.I am truly left in the dark as to why critics seem to love this movie and have heaped praise and awards on it. The Vast of Night is a bad retread of other sci-fi fare. It's Close Encounters of the Third Rate."}, {"id": 483, "text": "The Vast of Night is truly a film for classic sci-fi lovers. As many other reviewers here have expressed, this is clearly not the kind of movie that a general audience expecting lots of action, plot twists, and visual effects will like. However, like sci-fi movies of its genre, it has been written for audiences that are willing to invest in a story where they are already familiar with what to expect from the beginning.The movie itself starts with very little setup since it is assumed that the audience will already be very familiar with the classic trope. That is, two naive adolescents thrown into awakening about a future that is broader than they were ready to accept. The dialog is at times fast. But attempting to follow it is more critical to enjoying it than in most movies. The film itself is largely a homage to many classic sci-fi movies. As such, it is unlikely to please anyone looking for flashy gadgets, strange fantastical worlds, or fast paced action. However, if you already know and love classic sci-fi, and are still willing to accept it for what it is, you will more than likely to enjoy this movie too."}, {"id": 484, "text": "I can't remember the last time I watched a film as unique as 'The Vast of Night'. It's hard to think of a single film that I could fairly compare it to. And amazingly it worked. The film is enthralling to watch. Long close-up shots of characters simply talking on the phone should be unbearable to watch, but in 'The Vast of Night' I was captivated by them. This is partly down to some great acting, partly down to how well the dialogue is written, and partly because the mysterious story unfolding is mesmerising to watch.This would not be an easy film to act in, because the actors aren't being given a lot to work with. Sure, they have some terrific dialogue to deliver, but they have to do so in a very confined scene throughout almost the entirety of the film, and with almost nothing else going on to divert the audience's attention. Sierra McCormick and Jake Horowitz absolutely nail their performances here. They deliver their lines at an incredibly fast pace, while still being very easy to listen to. These two have a big future ahead of them I suspect.People are going to ask me about this film and I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to describe it to them. A description of this film could easily make it sound terrible, when in reality it is anything but. All I will say is make sure you see this film for yourself and form your own opinion. I highly recommend it."}, {"id": 485, "text": "Here is how you can be entertained without $100 million worth of CGI and special effects - with writing, music, good direction, good acting, and movement. Where do I start? I'm a writer, so I'll start there. The script by Andrew Patterson, and whomever worked with him, was fabulous. I've listened to every old radio show there ever was and the script reminded me of the very best of radio scripts. Fitting that the center of the story was a radio station (wrong call letters though; should have started with a K but that's minor). The story unfolded with words and stories, strengthened by the score, heightened by the movement through the town, almost like Steve McQueen's The Blob with two high schoolers running all over town at night to warn everyone of the gooey invader. But these two characters, also a boy and a girl really, were unraveling a mystery that was revealed at the end of the film. This looks like writer/director Patterson's first big outing, so the budget was lean. In that regard, it brought back what was done with The Man from Earth in which a compelling movie was forged essentially from one set, good writing, and a bunch of talented actors talking. Watch it!"}, {"id": 486, "text": "So, I watched the trailer and read it as based in the 1950s. So I was ready to watch it. The intro of the movie with the knock off Twilight Zone is why I say it feels cheap. Like they were trying to use something familiar to get people interested. It just feels badly done. That is the Twilight Zone knock off part.Then it just goes into showing the main guy and girl. Zero introduction of who they are and how they know each other. Like their age, if they are in school, or anything. Just a bunch of talking that mixed and blends together. Nothing that is easy to understand. Thats if it were meant to be understood. Which it wasnt.It has a lot of overdrawn dolog with zero backstory. Like who these people are and why we should even care.The story of the 1950s, aliens, lights and ships in the sky, weird sounds and such is old and outdated. Like cliche and generic lets make a old timey movie based in the 1950s or 1960s....The movie was boring, long, and just bad. It felt like a cheaply done indie film. The going in and out of shots of the CRT/tube TVs was horrible. The camera work and shots were bad at times, The music felt like it was written as if they movie was going to be better than it was. (It was over done bad)Ever see the movie Monster House? Well this movie could have been something like that! It would have been better too! Draw it across a few days, the kids doing research on stuff and so on building up to the big thing thats was gonna happen. Not everything all within a few hours...Like where did those tapes come from, who is this girl and guy and how do they know each other, why are girls crushing on him and acting like he's something special, why does this girl have a tape recorder and so on and so forth. It was boring, long, rushed, and felt like a lot of pointless stuff was dragged on for no reason. I had to keep myself from pausing the movie to wanna go watch a YouTube video or look online at random stuff. I was my hour and half back."}, {"id": 487, "text": "Several reviewers have already said that this could have been a 25 minute Twilight Zone episode, but it gets stretched to 90 minutes. That is an apt description. The film's major flaw are long, unbroken scenes of dialogue that aren't interesting and don't advance the plot. Someone needs to tell the writer and director that watching an actress talk for five minutes at a switchboard is only impressive insofar as the actress is able to complete the scene, but with no cuts or anything visual of interest happening it becomes boring and after that, aggravating. These sorts of things happen several times with a caller to the radio station, a long unbroken shot of two characters talking (shot from behind) as they meander through a small town at night, and later in an old lady's house.However this is a very well made movie - the production design and sets are impressive, but when your best scenes are in the high school gymnasium that has nothing to do with the plot but are only interesting because something visual is happening, you have a problem. Did Cayuga win the game?In terms of plot points, there are several that just don't make any sense. The lead actress is working the town's switchboard - which she leaves multiple times. How are people supposed to make telephone calls in town if no one is there? The lead actor has a radio show - which he leaves. Does he leave his radio station with completely dead air? How much are the sponsors paying for that?The cinematography and production design is very good. The tracking shots are very good. The acting is wooden, but given the absurdly long scenes of dialogue the actors are forced to deliver in one take, I applaud them for their ability to memorize. The rest of the movie is slow and boring. I'll give it 4 stars for the attention to period detail and the tracking shots. That's about the most I can do."}, {"id": 488, "text": "I found out about this movie from a sci-fi forum I have been visiting for well over a decade, and the general consensus was favorable. I don't think they actually saw the movie, but perhaps the trailer (I did not watch the trailer). I convinced my wife that we should give it a shot. I now wish I hadn't. The opening sequence pays significant homage to The Twilight Zone, which I found enjoyable. Afterwards, unfortunately, it descends into a rather spectacular, negative-IQ mess. It finally gets better (a bit) when our telephone operator gets to her job. I'll stop here with the blow-by-blow, and will explain my 4/10 rating. The cinematography is very high quality. Excellent sound as well. Production-wise, it's excellent. But the writing. Ugliness. I'm sure the actors gave it their all with what they had to work with, but it could have been so much more. By the time the final scene plays out, I don't think I could've cared less. I can hear my wife crying in the bathroom as I type this. If you want something similar (independent/low-to-no budget), check out Cosmos (2019) starring Tom England, directed by Elliot &amp; Zander Weaver. While not perfect, it is several orders of magnitude better than this. We just saw this a couple of nights ago, and couldn't believe how well-done this was, and on a budget of ZERO dollars. Check it out, and judge for yourself."}, {"id": 489, "text": "The spoof Twilight Zone-style prologue, complete with Rod Serling soundalike spoken introduction, immediately takes us back to the early 60's. We're in a remote, small American town on a Friday night and most of it is at the local college basketball game, including confident wise-guy Everett who buzzes about the premises engaging in meaningless nerdy conversations with all and sundry, before settling to his main occupation for the night elsewhere, as a local, interactive dee-jay playing psycho-billy tunes while fielding occasional calls from the resident nighthawks of the area.Then, while on air, he picks up a strange-sounding unintelligible message amid other reports that there are lights in the sky. Calls start coming in on the subject, put through to him by his 16-year old switchboard operator friend Fay, especially one from a black ex-soldier who in an extended call tells of the time he and a group of fellow-black colleagues were sent out to investigate a similar occurrence. Later, an old lady calls into the show, offering Everett a scoop on the same subject, which sends Everett and Fay racing through the night to her spooky house with their bulky reel-to-reel tape recording equipment in tow as they scent a big story and from there it's really only a matter of time before they too encounter what has been strongly hinted at from the start.I'm not sure how to describe this quirky, offbeat movie, it's sort of Twilight Zone, meets The Blair Witch Project crossed with Close Encounters Of the Third Kind, but I must admit it wasn't really to my taste. A lot of effort is put in to establishing time and place but I was put off by the grainy, out-of-focus photography, initial rambling hipster dialogue, several fades-to-black and static camera set-ups. Young Everett gets to play commander geek while even younger Fay, a wizard at connecting the wires at her console, runs about everywhere after him, occasionally engaging him in insignificant conversation before it all ends up as you know it must with their own E.T.-type encounter in a darkened wood.Anti-climactic, confusing and over-indulgent, it just didn't connect with me despite my love of The Twilight Zone TV shows and Amazing Stories comics of the 50's, despite the obvious energy, enthusiasm and even love for the source material. You still have to provide a strong, original story and maybe an arresting ending to what we've seen many times before and for me it just didn't do that."}, {"id": 490, "text": "I think the actors and director are about as good as anyone for being new. This is sort of like a thesis film as far as quality goes. It required a lot of talent to make but a hell of an attention span to stay awake. I feel like making a movie requires some risks to stand out. This movie was easy as pie. Just no real substance.I love the 50s era, the Twilight Zone, and Sci-Fi. This movie blended elements from all three. However, The set was not a very believable one. It's set in a very tiny town in New Mexico. Many scenes are filmed in one take which doesn't really add anything to the film (besides a longer and painful duration).For a movie filmed in the dark, the lighting was AWFUL. Just very dark to the point that the glare from your room will spoil the movie AND increasing brightness would spoil the movie with splotchy blacks and artifacts. I don't believe the camera quality was high either. There are no jump scares or special effects, so I feel like it could've started at twilight and ended in the dark.One last gripe... every car in this podunk town looked like a ground up restomod. The cars were all flashy and in unbelievable condition. The parts with half decent lighting were on a lit street and it looked like everyone just put a second coat of wax on.Besides those gripes about the visuals, the story and script was very dull. The climax was at the very tail end of the movie, and it was the most obvious possible ending. I won't spoil it, but if you read the synopsis and take a guess, then you've got a 99% chance of guessing up something more interesting.All in all, if you want to see a great Sci-Fi movie that is ACTUALLY from a Long gone era, watch Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind."}, {"id": 491, "text": "If you're hoping this is some clever original sci-fi story with elements of time-travel and paradoxes or similar mind-bending concepts like I did then you will be disappointed like I was.But this film does keep your attention, it is original as a piece of film-making even if the story itself has been told a thousand times.The 50s feel is very authentic and the acting by the two leads is very good for the majority of the film.The high-pitch screeching of the lead actress is a bit over the top at times and fairly annoying. Also the constant chatter at the start about the various townsfolk is unnecessary and also quite annoying as it is repeated again about half-way through the piece.But overall as a piece of film-making it is an ok hour and a half of sci-fi, just not what I had excitedly anticipated.By the way, I gave this a four star rating but I was torn between a four and a five, but never a six in my book.And also it wasn't a vast disappointment, it was a disappointment from the point that I was expecting something else, I used the word vast for pun value."}, {"id": 492, "text": "This was a great movie I thoroughly enjoyed it!At first, I had my doubts to be honest and then the movie just started to draw you in.There are two main characters that are focused on throughout the movie and you really begin to love them from the start.It was a truly magnificent film and if you ever get the chance to see it, definitely go! It was a mix between Stranger Things, The Goonies and The Twilight Zone.After the film, we were able to talk in person to the producer of the film. We learned a lot about the film, how it was made, where the shoot took place etc. We even learned a little about how they filmed a piece of it with a super long shot and moved across the town(I'll give you a hint, it included a gold cart and a camera). They stories they told us about how they were able to use all of the old 50s equipment like cars, radio gear and how they engaged with the town in making a gravel road on top of the paved one was truly mind blowing!!Thank you Melissa Kirkendall!"}, {"id": 493, "text": "Sometimes I am easily impressed by some basic movie tricks and sometimes I immediately swoon over Matthew McConaghuey. This film opens up impressing me with its vivacious, non-stop dialogue going on about typical small town after school stuff with a DJ putting on his absolute best Matthew McConaghuey impression, and some extremely long uninterrupted takes as he mingles with some people and casually walks to work hanging out with a telephone switchboard operator girl named Fay.From there, the story is one of subtlety, with the majority portion of the film hanging entirely upon two elderly people calling in to mini-McConaghuey's radio show telling stories related to an unusual electrical disturbance heard over his broadcast. The storytelling is done flawlessly and it's incredibly easy to hang on every word and just not want either story to stop. From this simple drama it's exceedingly difficult to entice us to want to move away from it and focus on the events transpiring in the town. What is transpiring sounds for all intents and purposes like a UFO sighting, which matches with the two distinct stories told by the people. From there, it rushes into a gorgeous climax with some absolutely amazing looking miniatures and effects for an ending highly reminiscent of The Twilight Zone of which the influence is immediately obvious with the Rod Serling-esque introduction. For such a small film there is a need to offer more than just a singular good storyline. Big budget films can often get away with hinging largely upon one or two things, but smaller budget films like this often need to go above and beyond in each aspect (writing, directing, acting, dialogue, sound, cinematography, costume, etc).This film manages to do just that, as even without the sci-fi story, it is genuinely fun to just sit and watch these two characters interact with their small town and gossip with the neighbors and listen to callers telling stories on the radio."}, {"id": 494, "text": "So, I fell for the hype that's being pumped out about this movie and watched it.

I do have to give them a few props, but I you never see this movie, you're not missing much.None of the characters were very fleshed out or three dimensional. Most of them weren't even likable. The stereotypes were so strong, I felt like I was watching puppets in a play. The story was thin. Like microns thin and stretched out so long that it was nearly see through. There was a little bit of build up and suspense, but even that didn't really amount to much. It felt so, so much like a old timey radio show, which might have worked, because seeing it on the screen didn't add much to it. I feel that they put everything they had into creating the atmosphere and said screw the rest.I am a devotee of sci-fi. Avidly watching even some of the most low budget to shows. The Vast of Night barely qualifies for this genre. It touches on a few sci-fi notes, but, wow, there is not much there to satisfy a lover of sci-fi. My advice? Skip it and re-watch something good.

As my father said at one point, the only thing that would make it worthwhile is a Predator showing up.I thought I had the twist figured out early on, and honestly, it was awesome.

I must add that I grew up with radio dramas as well as reading sci-fi. Yes, the film is based on ideas that had been developed before, but I was still intrigued by how they were presented here. I liked the acting - even the actors who appeared as disembodied voices on radio and telephone lines. I liked the stories within the story. I liked how the camera moved around the town. I liked the little bits of humor - was it a chipmunk or a squirrel? I gave the movie an extra point simply because it was not the product of a major studio with accomplished seasoned and famous actors. Indeed, the acting was better than I expected and much better than some of the recent Hollywood blockbusters with famous actors who appeared to be phoning in their lines. Here, the apparently naive amateurish small town characters are amazingly and enjoyably believable. The beginning seemed a bit weird until I realized how much the fast paced stepping-over lines dialogue was reminiscent of - perhaps even a tribute to - Orson Welles. And how many of you out there remember Welles' radio play of The War of the Worlds? I suspect that if you like classic sci-fi, Twilight Zone, X-Files, One Step Beyond, - and you like camp, kitsch and retro - then you'll enjoy this homage.

This was never going to be Star Wars or Star Trek or Aliens, anyone expecting big flashy cgi was clearly watching the wrong movie. The biggest dissapointment was actually the big reveal at the end, I personally don't think the film needed it, a far simpler less dramatic visual would have been a more powerful end to the movie. A very well made enjoyable movie that felt as though it was made in the late 50s early 60s,yes there was lots of dialogue, go watch some actual 50s 60s movies they were all filled with over the top dialogue.

The two young actors are fantastic at keeping attention through long takes - I found I couldn't peel my eyes off either one of them. The story itself doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's both satisfying and leaves you wanting more. I personally would love to see a podcast sequel to this. This is a love it or hate it movie. There are plenty who don't understand why you would sit for 90 minutes just to listen to 4 people talking. That's understandable. As a culture, we don't have much time to devote our sole attention to listening anymore, so it's not a skill or an interest that everyone has, nor is it something that will always appeal. There are some days you want to watch some big budget aliens get blown to smithereens, and that's fine! We have plenty of movies that do exactly that!

And the story is, well, we've seen it all before. But as to the interesting elements - the homage to Twilight Zone begins right away with the voice-over intro of a program voiced by a Rod Serling imitator with the same elements as that of the original TZ. In addition, the Cayuga reference nailed it. As a child watching the original Zones, I'd seen Cayuga Productions listed at the end and wondered what that meant. Other interesting aspects include the continuous-motion camera carried to the nth degree, back and forth to and from different locales, and the overall hyper-1950s sets and props - the oversized cat-eye eyeglasses for example, which were an exaggeration of the originals. The aura was sufficiently weird and foreboding in a 50s kind of way - although self-consciously so, which kept bringing one from involvement in the story to, instead, mere observation.

We were both glad when it was over."}, {"id": 505, "text": "In brief, this is very much (for mostly better, only a little not) a debut film made by a director who is hungry and more than ready to show us something we haven't seen before. Patterson does have a history in commercial work, so his stunning control of the wide angle frame (at least mostly in the first 20 minutes) isn't a surprise there. But what glued me in was how he had his two main actors (Horowitz and McCormick) deliver the rather lengthy and bordering on but not quite Nerd-screwball dialog, with speed and naturalism (I'm reminded of how Barry Sonnenfeld in interviews lately for his new book said he directs actors to talk faster so they're more realistic on camera and Patterson has that same impulse, but I digress).What's marks that whole opening, leading up to when Evrett gets on the phone and on the air with that first caller who gives some... Perspective about that strange frequency or what have you that alarms Fay so much, is that the camera feels like another roaming character, but focused on these two as Everett brings Fay along and we immediately know who they are and what their connection is (or could be after some more time); he's cool, she's a bit more nerdy and inquisitive, but Patterson makes it feel like a mini-Altman film, with shots that linger a little longer than we're used to. At the same time he makes his own, unique aesthetic as he follows the two of them on their nighttime walk and talk, mostly not getting too close but so this dialog feels ethereal somehow.That opening first act - which was one of the times in 2020 since the pandemic I really felt saddest I couldn't experience this in a theater (not to mention the expressive sound design, which is exceptional and creative and drives the idea of communication tools that is a theme of his film, on a McLuhan level) - is so good that the rest of the film cant quite live up to it. Don't get me wrong at all, the story that unfolds as these two kids with ambition and drive and a simple question of what is going ON? go on in this night to find out the origin of this signal, is captivating...But it also turns a bit more into a filmed radio drama, with two (very well performed) monologues by that aren't shot with quite the same level of formal originality as before. And the ending is in a way disappointing simply because it's like the air is let out of the balloon and what we might obviously expect to happen comes to be. I also didn't care for the framing device of it being a Paradox theater production with a Serling voice to start it... I mean, we KNOW, dude. Dont remind us this would probably make for a better 35-40 minute Twilight Zone episode.All the same, if you like your sci-fi with a bit less anxiety than what JJ Abrams puts out there, or want something by a director who has a real voice and knows how to turn the camera into a nearly spectral presence a times - that one shot that just glides over most of the town is incredible - one can overlook the slightly lost potential in the characters once the plot kicks in. I absolutely look forward to what this director does next (and these writers too while we're at it) as it's quite a compelling calling card."}, {"id": 506, "text": "This movie starts off with frantic ramblings ala Birdman, then slows down abruptly. Then we see some very noticeable cinematography attempts at attaining some great oners and they're successful at it. The look of the film is not a classic/vintage one although that's where it's set in. By now, I'm almost waiting for the usual random uber liberal musings to creep in and there it is: minorities being used for covert military work because no one would believe them if they decided to whistleblow. Then there's a girl's locker room scene where a girl says the team with the Indians in them will beat them like a drum, before clarifying (as if it's 2020 Twitter and not a movie set in '60s?) that she's not just saying because they're Indians. Like Clockwork, folks. Anyway, halfway through. Now we get an elderly woman blabbering at great lengths about some uninteresting, meandering story and you wonder if this is now an audiobook/podcast. Quite a contrast from the nervy edits and busy camerawork we saw in the first few minutes. The final 15 minutes are an absolute travesty. You would be laughing your heart out when they show up predictable nonsense with violins blaring at full blast. And yes, the final shot is an absolute non sequitur, as often is the case with such films. To summarise, the film lacked any cohesive flow or purpose. Contrasting energies never let you settle, and in a really bad way. The climax is extremely boring, and I shouldn't dress it up with any other term either. The low iMDb rating (6.7 now) gets it right again (what's up with that Metascore of 84???)

With reluctance and boredom, in my common absence of sleep, I decided to give it the same chance I often give the many motion pictures that receive decent ratings from my favorite genres.

I describe it as marvelous because it says so very much with so very little time, reaches into the past, and touches an amazing note in the jaded heart.

In line with that, is a unique and refreshing focus on dialogue, pushing action into the backseat, and why not? The main characters are a radio DJ and telephone operator; talking is their business, especially in the 50s time period. In fact, it's the conversations - or rather interviews - that are the highlight; they're eerie, mysterious and help build a level of intrigue and suspense.But it's a slow build. Too slow. But not too slow for the characters. They get quite excited early on, overreacting, really, in a way that grew annoying and tiresome early on, and running around constantly, their behaviour never quite matching the situation. Sure the 50s were innocent, and sure the town is small, but their near hysteria seems strange. Why isn't one of them a skeptic, such as the science buff? (Perhaps I would know if there were more characterization?).Then, after the slow build the climax hits, and it's a let-down. For me, it should be the beginning of Act 3, after a slow, intriguing build up, perhaps cueing another round of mysterious radio signals, perhaps at the radio station, where actual interaction occurs. Perhaps requiring the characters to resolve the matter before the game lets out, raising the stakes further. But no, for the screenwriter, it's enough to call it a day. Too bad.

It was awful to watch because there was no consideration for the audience to discover any entertainment.One thing I will point out, there was no coverage in these scenes. Very little cut to a close up coverage which killed its scene value. the story really began with that shot where the girl sits down at the switchboard. Why? Because of the angle of the shot, the lighting, and we can actually see the actor. These long tracking shots mean nothing.A great production value, love the camera work but it has to mean something.

The Signal kept you in suspense for the whole film, making you think that this story was leading up to something wonderful. There was a payoff in the end, but that payoff was so short that if you had closed your eyes for just a couple of seconds then you would have missed it. Literally. Everything I said about The Signal is also true for The Vast of the Night, except the ending is a little longer. However, both movies are an exercise in prolonged tension to arrive at similar endings.The Vast of the Night feels like a master class in low budget filmmaking. It does a great job with its long camera shots and its unknown actors who give stellar performances. The movie starts by showing an old fashioned television screen like it is playing an episode of the old Twilight Zone. The camera zooms into the screen and now we are following characters in a 1950's small New Mexico town on the night of a high school basketball game. It spends a long 20 minutes introducing its settings and characters, after which the local switchboard operator starts noticing weird things happening. She teams up with her friend, a disk jockey at a one-man radio station to investigate what is going on.Many of the scenes drag on a bit, mostly with conversation. But there is a frantic tension that builds toward the conclusion. Fortunately, the actors really sell this story.

Movie starts off with non stop dialogue from the main characters it just hurts the ears at a point. I literally went shut up already. It was annoying and it really did. Most of the movie you could listen to it and you don't miss much on visually. This movie almost felt like an audio book that was said everything in the movie. Half of the movie was utterly boring, we are waiting and hoping that everything will add up to something. The pay off is what you expected from like half way through. It was just way too draggy to actually get to the climax of the movie. This movie had one cool consecutive shot which shot through and covers the whole town. That was nicely done. End was a vast WTF.

This is more like a strange, atmospheric inquiry by two young people who can't figure out what's going on but are determined to flush out the truth.It takes place on a single night, and is centered around three long set pieces. The first has teenage swithcboard operator Fay hearing some unusual sounds coming through one of her connections, and alerting her DJ friend Everett, who patches into the noise and puts it on the air, to see if anyone can identify it. The second is a long phone call from a man (never seen) who says yes, indeed he has heard it before and relates a story of a job he once did as a soldier, the purpose of which was never explained to him.Finally, Fay and Everett visit a woman who narrates a tale from years ago, where her son vanished one night - she insists he was taken by the people in the sky. Her story at time confirms what Fay and Everett have learned, but also veers into paranoid rambling. What to believe?If you watch this expecting explanations to emerge from these long dialogue scenes, this isn't the movie for you. But there are some odd choices, starting with the title (shouldn't that be The Vastness of Night?) and the framing of the whole thing as an episode of a Twilight Zone-ish show called Paradox Theater. And what are we to make of all the old reel to reel tape recorders which are not only used as plot points, but are sometimes discussed in detail? You could write a whole thesis on this stuff.

But ten minutes into it you start to wonder why its taking so long to get going, and the dialog is meaningless jabber. Then after listening to the same two oddball characters banter for 20 minutes, you think about just turning it off. I actually did that, and returned the next day to finish watching, thinking that there had to be more to this. But no, basically the first 20 minutes sets the tone and what follows is simply more of the same. A movie with a wandering and weak script going nowhere fast. I typically am not one to bring up budget, because often low budget films show an increased quality of script. Not the case here. I really wanted this to be a great movie, maybe that's why I'm disappointed, but there's just nothing to it. I mean really nothing. It was filmed in three to four weeks at a cost of $700,000 and I have to wonder how they spent that much on it. For what? an old switchboard? The cast is minimal. The scenes are minimal.

Too much dialogue. Then some dialogue. Did I mention all the dialogue?And yes, most of the dialogue is mundane and often irrelevant. The axiom of show-don't-tell is missing and the ending is, well... uncreative, is probably the most polite way of putting it.So, not for sci-fi fans, or even Twilight Zone fans, as the ideas presented are deeply malnourished.

The interview feels fairly long, and I enjoyed every minute of it. During the scene, the screen cuts to black, and stays black for a short while (this happens a few times throughout the movie). This draws your attention to the audio, and gives a sense that you're really listening to an actual radio interview, and not just watching a scene in a movie. There's a strangely comforting feeling I get when I think about sitting in a nice couch with dimmed lights, listening to something mysterious like this.Still, the movie had some fallbacks. The plot for one, doesn't really get going until 20 minutes into the movie. And it's only a 90 minute movie. Sure those 20 minutes are spent introducing us to the two lead characters, but that could've also happened alongside some sort of introduction to the theme of the film.I'm also not crazy about the end. I don't know what I would've done differently here - I just found it unsatisfying and depressing. This movie feels like it could've had more. It's still really good, but if it just had something more, perhaps an adapted plot from some Stephen King short, then this could be a great little midnight feature.Also there's some stylistic choices I wasn't a fan of.

Haven't we seen that already? What's the punch line? That They are out there? Well, we already know that, thanks to the X Files. The grand finale would probably have worked in the 1950's, when the whole idea of the movie was still novel and in vogue, but in this day and age... seriously?!

The premise of the film is set in the 1950's and sees two people discover a mystery signal that could change the town and the world.Main Character Sierra McCormick and Jake Horowitz play the two leads and they are okay. They have some decent chemistry together which is nice to see, but it is clear to see that both of these performers have not done too much yet. It doesn't help that their characters are given no development whatsoever and I did find it hard to care about them as the film really gives you no reason too.Supporting Characters This part will be very brief as there aren't really any supporting characters here at all. There are some people that appear but none of them are important and again they offer nothing to this film.Story The story has an interesting investigation to it, you are wondering along with the characters what exactly is going on here and what is the mystery here. But it takes so long to get the plot going that you might not even care by that point, and as I mentioned before the characters aren't given anything to work with in terms of making them interesting.Script The script has its moments there is some nice banter between the main two characters but that is about it. The drama doesn't work nor does the humour and there chemistry really carries this script to mediocrity.Style The style of the film is unique, for a first time director I was impressed by some of the techniques used here as they stood out. I also liked how it looks like an old film and doesn't try and make it look modern which was a good choice here. But possibly the biggest criticism here is just how slow this film is and how long it takes to get going, it goes at a snails pace, it also makes scenes last way longer then it should and it just takes you out of it.Overall Overall, this is a below average mystery film that didn't quite work for me.

We've heard the line, or something similar, in most every UFO/Alien invasion film for the past 70 years. However, while employing a few conventional tropes of the genre, the brilliant directorial debut from Andrew Patterson is somehow simultaneously familiar and inventive. The director seems to thrive on serving up a story that proceeds as expected, with an innovative style that marks a true visionary.We open on an early model television set as an exceptional Rod Serling impersonator introduces 'Paradox Theater', a riff on the classic series The Twilight Zone. Tonight's episode is The Vast of Night. The black &amp; white picture dissolves into color and we find ourselves in the late 1950's outside the Cayuga, New Mexico high school gymnasium. A terrific opening sequence, filled with rapid-fire and overlapping dialogue, introduces us to Everett (Jake Horowitz) and Fay (Sierra McCormick). Everett arrogantly struts through the venue as he assists with the electrical issue, pranks the band's trombone player, and begins chatting with Fay about her new tape recorder.The two characters remain on the move through the gym and back out into the parking lot, where Everett tutors Fay on the basics of recording interviews. See, Everett is the evening DJ at WOTW, the local radio station, and director Patterson uses their journey through the gym and parking lot, and back into town, to not just introduce us to Everett and Fay, but also give us a feel for the town and its people. As Everett heads to the station for his shift, Fay resumes her evening job as the switchboard operator. In yet another terrific sequence, we watch as Fay handles the calls and the bizarre 'sound' she hears. Again she enlists Everett's help and he plays the sound over the radio. This elicits a call from Billy (Bruce Davis), who recognizes the sound from his days on a secret military mission, and from a shut-in elderly lady (Dallas' own Gail Cronauer) who wants to tell her creepy story directly to Everett.The fun here comes not so much from the story, but rather HOW it's told and how it's performed by Mr. Horowitz and Ms. McCormick, who both wreak of energy and youthful spirit. The latter is exceptional with her giddy and nervous approach as eager Fay, while donning her cat-eye spectacles. She is mesmerizing in a 10 minute uncut shot of her executing the switchboard. Director Patterson and cinematographer M.I. Littin-Menz (RESISTANCE, 2020) employ long takes a few times, and none is more breath-taking than when they take us through town, into the basketball game, out the gymnasium window and back to the radio station. I was left wondering how they pulled it off, yet impressed at how it visually informed us that the town was almost deserted during the big game.Not only is this director Patterson's first film, it's also the first screenplay from co-writers James Montague and Craig W Sanger. They have worked together to capture the feel and atmosphere of the era in the sets, the costumes, the Soviet Union concerns, and the attention to UFOs and aliens. JJ Abrams' SUPER 8 (2011) may be the closest comparison, and there's also bits of Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), The X-Files, and even George Lucas' AMERICAN GRAFFITI. Rarely does a first time director burst on the scene with such craftsmanship and innovative vision, and it wouldn't be surprising to find Mr. Patterson hired for a significantly higher budget movie project very soon. This one is pure joy for us movie lovers who thrive on creative approaches ... from a realm between clandestine and forgotten."}, {"id": 528, "text": "14 viewings later and this quirky, wonderful throwback is on my Top Ten list of Go To films.Why did this film get under my skin the way it did? Possibly because every single actor in The Vast of Night inhabited their roles to pure perfection. They live in as small, New Mexico town in late 1950's that is so textural, believable and charming that you want to live there. The writers, director and actors took a huge chance on creating something thoroughly unique in today's cinema. The creators all knew that this is not be a film for everyone's taste, but they also knew that there were enough of us out there who would truly get what they were trying to accomplish.The story is presented in the compact, stage play manner of the original Twilight Zone, Jerome Bixby's, Man From Earth, Primer and The Day the Earth Stood Still (1950). A sequel is definitely in order. The actors, writers and director are clearly the ones to look for in the future. This is the kind of original, first-time effort that winds up making HUGE film careers. You can be sure that Vast has caught the attention of the major directors and film executives in Hollywood. Every element- from the casting, actor's, script, lighting, staging, editing and fantastic musical score is unique and perfectly executed. They took a standard, 60-year-old film genre/ story line and created an absolute gem of indy cinema.I may be way beyond here in my assessment, but I believe we're actually seeing something NEW in cinema with The Vast of Night.Bottom line? - ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!"}, {"id": 529, "text": "Look...if you're one of those people that pays to see the Fast and Furious or Transformers movies, you probably won't like this.

Yes, it's a slow building nail biting experience.This movie is something special. It's one of those movies that will stick with you long after you've seen it. It's beautiful, it's fresh (in a retro way) and it's not treating the audience as if we have a three minute memory span.The characters don't need a complicated tragic backstory to make you pull for them. The town looks period accurate. The vibe of the whole thing just sucks you in from the start, and it never stops. Watch it at night...lights off, sound up. Instead of the Michael Bay treatment of massive CG explosions and mindless dialogue, let this movie tell you an actual story. Sit back, relax, and soak it in.

The slow pacing does give the film space to unfold, but there is also a lot of wastage - camera panning facades lingering establishing shots. The dialogue faces a similar dichotomy: I really enjoyed the play-like nature and much of the dialogue alone, but again there was a lot of waste, the opening sequence seems to go on and on - Everett's character seems to talk at a thousand miles per hour (which is good acting on Jake Horowitz's part) but it gets wearing as there is so much of it. There are a couple of bits of exposition that could have been better handled. All that said, if the wastages of dialogue and pacing were removed, the film would lose some of its character, so are they really waste?The acting is really good, as is the cinematography and actually the direction. The film pushes lightly on a couple of hot button topics, namely racism and division in society but that really isn't in your face. For me I guess the biggest let down is the plot, some things are left unexplained and the actual ending actually fizzles put. The story itself is a pretty linear, something unusual happens, they speak to people who help the unfold the mystery, leading to a conclusion.Personally I enjoyed it, I get both the bad and good reviews - it's pretty well done but not everyone's cup of tea."}, {"id": 531, "text": "This is a simple movie from a simple time.

The main characters are a step behind for a while but eventually, they get closer and closer to the truth.The dialogue is great. It is the way people really talk. Conversations run over each other. Friends speak in a way only friends understand. Characters act earnestly.Direction and mood are pretty good.The ending isn't surprising but it has style.

The point isn't the story, which will turn off some viewers, but the carefully constructed and extremely precise atmosphere - a mounting sense of a dread, a hypnotic mystery, a remarkable sense of geography, place, time, and character. The Vast of Night is not so much about aliens or small towns, but about the things that we love about great movies about aliens and small towns. Put simply, it beautifully deconstructs the genre.Not everyone will like it. You have to appreciate the fantastic dialogue - and fantastic stretches of monologue that draw you into the story by sparking your imagination; the performances, both by the two leads, and the ancillary actors, who sell the time period, and the mounting quiet dread building throughout the movie; the cinematography, which not only immerses us in the town of Cayuga, but lays out its geography with innovative precision, particularly through its technically superb tracking shots; and the great audio work, which complements these elements. The direction here is astounding, particularly on such a low budget.The Vast of Night can be appreciated as an exercise in style, an example of peak cinema craft, and deconstruction of a genre that draws out that genre's best elements (and rises above it). This is a movie for movie lovers."}, {"id": 533, "text": "This movie is almost absurdly bad. The saving grace to some degree is it was trying to be artsy and the acting is ok.That, and it was somewhat period accurate, with the two leads smoking (one just sixteen) and them riding around in a car holding a baby (no car seat of course).But it is all dialog with unbelievably lengthy static shots, particularly when they are interviewing the old lady. Over ten minutes almost entirely of this lady talking, in profile.The padding is just ridiculous. In one action sequence, they show the leads running. First a wide shot, then their legs, then his legs, then her legs, then wide, then her legs, then his, then theirs, rinse, repeat, wow.And, this movie absolutely did not earn its ending."}, {"id": 534, "text": "Perhaps thirty minutes into this film, two teenagers on a walk across town have a conversation about technological prophecies. Fay (Sierra McCormick), one of the local telephone switchboard operators, is a reader of futurist magazines, which give forecasts of technological innovations on the near horizon, some of which border on sci-fi silliness. With utter conviction, this sixteen-year-old in 1958 tells of what they can expect to see in their lifetimes: self-driving cars, a GPS system with a voice that can tell you what turn to take off the highway, bullet trains, smartphones! The dates are all wrong, and some of the details are off, but what she describes is surprisingly prescient. Everett (Jake Horowitz), however, a slightly older, wisecracking radio DJ--and, it seems, the local celebrity--doesn't seem very convinced, humoring Fay for her naive gullibility.Fay's magazines are quite accurate in their technical details. What they get wrong is the accompanying social changes. Everyone will have a smartphone with a color tv screen and they'll carry it around with them everyone--yes, indeed. And if you call your friend and they don't answer, then you'll know that they're dead, she explains. Because if they've always got their phone on 'em, why wouldn't they answer? The fact that many young people would stop making phone calls altogether, in favor of texting, is never even considered.I think this is a movie about technological change, the social repercussions of such changes, and all the hope and anxiety and fear that come with them.The film beautifully conveys the sheer pleasure of new technology--of Fay, having purchased a tape recorder, being afraid to touch it at first (out of the fear that in her ignorance she might break it), but then being delighted and astounded when she finally hears her voice played back to her for the first time: Do I really sound like that? I remember my early experiences with tape recorders and how thrilling it was to capture myself saying random nonsense, to record other people's rather mundane statements and feel like it was a momentous occasion. The film is tactile in its depiction of analog technologies--tape reels, switchboards, tiny televisions. How much of our lives is mediated by the demands of technology? How many moments of our days are directly influenced by the limitations and features of that technology? Everett having to rewind the tape recorder blindly, listening to random snippets along the way, in order to find the spot in the recording that he wants to hear again--for those of us of a certain age, that used to be a frequent occurrence. Now it's a forgotten thing of the past. What moments have replaced it? How are those moments shading our lived experience?Director Andrew Patterson has captured in vivid detail a time that seems not very long ago and not especially different from our own and yet somehow uncanny in its differences. A time when communities gathered to watch local sporting events and filled the downtime before those events not with staring at their phones but with socializing, reminiscing, and crossing paths with neighbors who weren't strangers. When people paid attention to lengthy, mesmerizing stories on the radio, narrated without any visual accompaniment. When interacting with a third-person operator was an integral part of communicating with someone else. But THE VAST OF NIGHT doesn't paint these old-fashioned glimpses in the rosy tones of nostalgia. Rather, the film shows that their era was the same as our era: they, too, had cutting edge technologies, minor inconveniences as a result of those technologies, pride of how far they had come, hope for the future, anxieties and fears and political divisions. We have always been modern.The film conveys the fear that has been bound into society's response to just about every new technology. (When novels first emerged as a a new genre of literature in the eighteenth century, people weren't impressed by how reading makes you smart; no, they were worried that reading would make people lustful, immoral, and prone to uterine cancer.) Is it going to brainwash you? Will it change who you are? Will it make you a slave to some other master (Russians? advertisers? the deep state?)?I don't think the film ultimately has any message, per se. It's not telling us to throw away our cell phones, or that social media is destroying, or that we need to get back to some golden age when people were less dependent on technology. I think the film is mostly just telling us to stay conscious, to stay focused, and to listen to each other.It's a beautifully shot film and a superbly directed one. The performances are immersive; after a couple of minutes following the characters around in the high school gymnasium, I felt like I was witnessing genuine members of a community, each with their own personalities and backgrounds and relations to each other, interact on a random, serendipitous night when anything could happen. The movie is something you can settle into. It's transportive. The ending was a little anticlimactic and disappointing--framing the film as a Twilight Zone episode sets up certain expectations for a whopper of an ending that this film doesn't really attempt--but I'd still highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for some thoughtful thrills."}, {"id": 535, "text": "The Vast of Night is one of the most well-crafted films I have seen so far in 2020. It's not going to be a film that pleases everyone, but I think there is definitely some enjoyment to be had if you go in with the right expectations. This isn't a fast-moving blockbuster. It's slower, full of tension, and has some amazing character development.The camera-work is my favourite aspect within The Vast of Night. There are long takes as characters are talking, and it's all thanks to the incredible direction by Andrew Patterson. This film is his directorial debut, but I am excited to see what he does next.It's fair to say there not a lot happens in the film, but the screenplay is phenomenal. Patterson builds so much tension by not showing us the aliens and building them up through character dialogue and interactions.The Vast of Night is set in the 1950s, and they managed to do an excellent job at making it feel like it was filmed back then. From the entire atmosphere, to the cinematography and the costumes, everything felt very old-fashioned and authentic.The sound design and use of music was also very effective. I really liked that the ending was ambiguous, because it plays into the element of the unknown which the whole film explores.Whilst The Vast of Night is a very short film, it did slow down a little too much in parts and I can see why some people would get bored with it. I also don't think that it has much replay value, but those are my only criticisms in a film that is otherwise flawless and masterfully put together.SCORE: 87%"}, {"id": 536, "text": "1. The opening 20 minutes of this film can be chopped off as it had absolutely nothing to do with the film. During this time, The lead actor (From here Boy) 's accent is unbearable that one wouldn't understand what he is speaking without any subtitles. I felt like slapping him and also the director for not correcting him. The lead actress (From here Girl) talks incessantly and she is not only loud but also annoying. 2. The camera placements were so irritating that a probable nice close-up shot was taken as a long one. 3. Unnecessary long takes where nothing happens. After the first 20 minutes nonsense, the girl starts operating switchboards and observes some eerie noises. The director chose to tell this through a luxurious 10 mins long closeup take of the girl. What harm did we do to go through this? Choosing to watch this film? 4. There are some track shots for about 5 mins where we get to see some roads, houses and a basket ball match which are annoying to the core and absolutely time fillers. 5. Some guy named Billy calls and tells his story about his classified missions during his time in army. You already heard those stories. Though this is important to the film, You don't need to watch the screen while this story runs. 6. Why does the girl keeps running from one place to another even when the boy has a car to pick &amp; drop her? All those scenes can be chopped off saving atleast 10 minutes. 7. What's with those frames at random places? (5 mins can be saved by editing that out) 8. Then, an old woman calls them to visit her place as she has a story to tell. She blabbers something for 15 minutes. Whereas the essence is of only about 5 minutes. She lost her son to people from sky. 9. In one scene, the boy and the girl happen to meet some guys (don't know whether they are friends or some random people). They literally shout at each other very loudly that we don't understand what the hell is wrong with all of them. It was absolutely annoying and one of the most unnatural conversations I ever saw in a film. 10. Now, The girl runs (again) to get her toddler sister. During the entire scene, she keeps yelling at everybody around. 11. At last, people from sky takes not only the boy and the girl but also her toddler sister. 12. Very good. What the hell is law enforcement doing when school kids are airing interview about classified material? Don't they use radio?Finally what I want to say is that the makers could chop off 60 minutes length without any affect on what they want to tell. Even during the remaining 30 mins, one can simply listen without bothering to look at the screen. Anyway there's literally nothing on the screen. The climax shot is also not effective making The Vast of Night a complete waste of time &amp; energy for viewers."}, {"id": 537, "text": "The Vast of Night tries to be cool. It tries so, so, so hard to be cool. It manages to be, sometimes. But only sometimes. Mostly, it's just slow, and very, very in love with itself.This is technically a movie about aliens and UFOs, but it's mainly a lot of talking heads and retreading old ground about extraterrestrial mythology. If you've ever been surfing the reality show channels on cable TV over the last 20 years, you'll know a lot of what this movie has to say about UFOs before it gets there.It tries to treat it as so special, so wondrous, but personally speaking, I've heard it all before, and The Vast of Night struggles to take it beyond this basic interpretation. People talk all throughout this movie about there being something in the sky but rarely does anyone ever actually just look up. Instead, it would rather spend several minutes obsessing over pieces of vintage recording equipment, or showing off with long, digitally altered, unbroken camera movements.There are some moments of legitimate tension, when the movie finally stops trying to prove its own coolness and slows down to actually say something. When Fay and Everett sit and listen to the stories of UFO encounters these people tell, it's easy to be captivated -- but then, that stuff should have been the movie, not this heavy-handed Twilight Zone riff.It reminds me of a phenomenon I encountered a lot growing up around some artist friends, where they'd suddenly pivot on a dime and become deeply obsessed with a certain piece of subject matter, like an era in history or a certain genre of media, only to drop it completely out of nowhere a few weeks later for something different. That's the kind of vibe I get from this movie: the director fell down a rabbit hole and this movie was born out of a short-lived burning obsession.

The movie is also heavily reliant on dialogue and character interaction to tell its story which is done well and I'd say on par with Phone Booth or Locke in terms of audience engagement, but those looking for a first contact movie with similar delivery to Contact or Close Encounters may find themselves disappointed with the chosen approach.While The Vast of Night is flawed, it is a promising debut for director Andrew Patterson who shows a firm handling of his craft and assures greater projects in the future, even if his flourishes should be dialed back on later projects."}, {"id": 541, "text": "Watched this on recommendation from someone who loved it, but I had a hard time going past the sound of this movie.

Littin-Menz, who mysteriously and meticulously follows radio DJ Everett and switchboard operator Fay across a wild night of high school basketball, terrified residents and ex-government employees who may or may not know about extra terrestrial goings on.There are a huge number of moments within the film that usually aren't found in either debut features or small-scale offerings but Patterson and his capable team deliver the goods in a production sense with Vast feeling like a far more polished product than other similar affairs of this ilk, with the landscape in which Everett and Fay play out their story in feeling alive and vibrant in the films entirely night-time set locale.Where Vast struggles to maintain its effective opening act is within its central mystery and also the development of both Everett and Fay.With so much of Vast taking the mantra of show don't tell there's initial suspense and intrigue that is built up around the strange happenings our duo find themselves in but as the film ticks past the half way mark, one does begin to grow tired of the antics of running to and fro without much scope outside of tense conversations.You keep waiting for an impactful moment to strike but it never really comes, not even in a fairly out there final stretch.Amongst all of this is the consistent chatter and back and forth between Everatt and Fay, well played by Jake Horowitz and Sierra McCormick respectively, the two main characters in the film aren't overly endearing as they talk over each other and explore the information they've become privy too while delving into a strange sound they hear.It's like the film is in an ever present state of hinting at moving into the next level or delivering a gut punch moment that wows us but it never comes, despite the fact the craftsmanship and strength of how its all been put together is undeniably impressive.Final Say -A film that will no doubt get director Andrew Patterson some serious attention from the big players in Hollywood, The Vast of Night is a strong debut from the new director but one that threatens to achieve greatness rather than one that actually gets there.3 tape recorders out of 5"}, {"id": 544, "text": "Flying saucers are real. Too many good men have seen them, that don't have hallucinations. Captain Eddie RickenbackerSometime around the '50s, pop culture became serious about the possibility of alien visitation and its love child, abduction. The spirit was forever enshrined in Rod Serling's Twilight Zone and Stephen Spielberg's Close Encounters of a Third Kind, about as good as it will ever get for fantasy and humanity wrapped in UFO vibes.For the stunning new online fantasy drama, The Vast of Night, set in the early fifties, a strange sound comes over the airwaves of a small radio station in New Mexico. To the rescue are 16-year old switchboard operator Fay (Sierra McCormick) and charismatic young announcer Everett (Jake Horowitz), who spend time tracking down the sound and the invaders.Toward the beginning, when Jake and Fay are gossiping, new director Andrew Patterson does a brilliant job of bringing his characters into Howard Hawkes' wacky world of screwball repartee, this wacky romanticism sounds familiar, then join the millions of seniors who today become immediately nostalgic about the groundbreaking Orson Welles version of War of the Worlds.New director Andrew Patterson expertly guides today's The Vast of Night into that twilight zone of giddy exploration and imagination with an innocence and quickening pace reminiscent of the past. He is adept at cranking up the tension as we learn of missing persons and hear from a survivor of the sound some 60 years ago.Although visually the adventure is nowhere near the splashy sci-fi films of days past, Vast has an excitement to match its conceit, a youthful energy best exemplified early on when Fay and Everett bandy about the sound and their plan to pursue it. In their unbridled optimism rests our lingering love of sci fi and imagination.Saucers exist (I saw two). They were intelligently flown or operated (evasive tactics, formation flight, hovering).

While everyone in town is at the high school basketball game, there are two students who have to work at their jobs. The male protagonist in a small local radio station, and the female protagonist is the local telephone operator. In the beginning, all seems routine for all we have learned by watching episodes of Happy Days and sentimental movies like Peggy Sue Got Married, Back to the Future and Grease. Waxing nostalgia, I waited for the plot to thicken. It didn't take long. Early on, a phone call comes in to the switchboard, and the teenager holding down the fort hears strange sounds. She keeps the call on line, and forwards it to her fellow student who is working at the radio station. The sound comes over the radio, and a few pivotal callers dial in to the radio station via the switchboard. Soon, the young teenage operator is involved, and a coverup of galactic proportions seems to enter the plot. As the story continues, more unexplainable incidents happen, and the two protagonists move on in the story to find the truth. Without giving too much of the story away, I found echoes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a sequel to this movie. Sierra McKenna and Jake Horowitz are delightful as the two protagonists. They are excellent in their portrayals of the innocence of youth, and their earnestness to uncover the truth as they keep the story moving and credible."}, {"id": 546, "text": "After an incredibly slow and honestly boring exposition, this film eventually becomes a traditional American sci-fi film about small Western towns and flying saucers.

Unfortunately, the film was extremely short and the sci-fi aspects were surprisingly shallow after all.Overall I enjoyed the drawn out shots, the rusted radio aesthetic, and the score. There were a few points where the score certainly faltered, but it was an important part of the impressive atmospheric highs during the film's climax. The film clearly lacked a large budget, but for what it was given it definitely makes itself feel like a true film festival movie, and it definitely hits the mark on that front.The development of the central two characters is what really surprised me. Obviously, the film takes place over the course of one night, but you can see how the two of them evolve over the course of the film, especially the boy. At the beginning he is witty and even a little cocky, but once he realizes what he's dealing with he drops the act and becomes very serious. As more information is revealed to him, he attempts to deny what is unraveling before his very eyes, and by the end you can tell this night would have changed him forever. The girl is a little bit more static, and comes in as a curious and often shy high school girl. By the end she is more confident, and as the boy is revealed to be less confident in himself, she becomes stronger. It's amazing what the actors do in the short 90 minutes they have to create convincing characters.Overall, I liked the aesthetic although it failed to hold my attention in the first half.

In fact, it's very common for me to watch terrible movies and think about reviewing them on here, but I rarely do it out of laziness. NOT THIS ONE. I had to log in just to say how much I hated it! I was watching it with a friend and when I turned it off he thanked me. The little I saw of the cinematography that everyone is praising is also not impressive at all. Not only the boring dialogue goes on forever, but you also can barely see the characters' faces, the camera keeps a big distance from them and the result is basically an audiobook + stock footage.Oh, but you didn't watch until the end. That's the point. If you can't make your movie even slightly engaging in the first 15 minutes, then you can't possibly demant that I watch the rest to make a judgement. I usually finish even terrible movies, but this one I woudn't even try. If you're gonna make a bad movie at least try to start it well so you can trick your audience."}, {"id": 549, "text": "Sometimes I can't stand what I'm reading.Most of bad reviews are pointing to this movie was boring or this is mainly people talking (I can't believe that this was an actual critic). If you like movies where people don't talk you should go and see Cast Away or some.This movie is not Men In Black, Cloverfield nor Independence Day. This is a subtle science fiction movie where the most gripping thing is the acting of the cast, the long shots, the disturbing atmosphere and the fact that the camera is actually travelling from a site to another. If you are looking for devastated cities by a huge creature or maybe you are looking for to be thrilled with a couple of guys with energy weapons slashing and butchering some aliens, you are going to be dissappointed.But if you are looking for a movie with a very low budget and a really good thrilling, intriguing and gripping story, this movie is for you."}, {"id": 550, "text": "This group of filmmakers do an amazing job of recreating the 50's and I'm sure it took them a lot of time.... because it sure looks like they didn't leave themselves any time to make a decent movie! That's the feeling you're left with after watching this. They nail the setup but then can't think of anything to do with it. It makes for a film that's very boring, missing a climax and, maybe worst of all, asks us to care about very one dimensional, annoying characters that you'll wish would get abducted in the first five minutes... but of course they DON'T... because that would actually be exciting! Another problem is this movie starts off incredibly poorly and slowly. We follow the character Everett around for way too long while he talks fast and makes wisecracks. You can tell the filmmakers thought it was going to be charming and funny but WOW... it's not. I was legitimately excited about this film but watching this character for just five minutes killed all my enthusiasm and I turned off the movie. I came back to it a few days later and hated it even more but this time I toughed it out through the beginning. However, the movie had dug itself a hole which it would never come close to climbing out of. There are some interesting sections and ideas but everything takes too long, there isn't much that ever happens and the first act makes you hate the characters that the film wants you to care about. Like everyone with a brain has already said, this should've been an hour shorter. It feels like the first act to a GOOD alien movie stretched out 3 times longer than it needs to be. With better characters, writing and a legit 3rd act, this could've been a decent film because the setting they create is the perfect premise for this kind of story... but you have to make sure you actually HAVE a story or the great setting is just a waste. Better luck next time!"}, {"id": 551, "text": "When I think of some of the best movies - ever - I think of the ones that told the best stories. Vast of Night is a collection of individual stories strung together like jewels. One story is only a disembodied voice on a phone line. It conjured all the visuals in my mind without the need for filmed special effects. Compared to my mind, industrial light and magic relies on a failure of the imagination. This movie pulled me in and let my mind fill in all of the the visuals inside of the dialogue. Brilliant, and satisfying. I could deliver spoiler after spoiler (which I won't) and it would still be worth watching to see how the stories are told.Direction, cinematography, production design, etc.... again, just brilliant. One take is 9 minutes and 4 seconds long and the only action is a human interface with the mechanics of a 1950s telephone switchboard. Later, an older woman tells her tale of woe in one seamless take filmed in profile, engaging, believable, and as fantastic as the best ghost story told around any campfire. I will watch it again. It is the look and feel I hope to see often in our post-superhero era."}, {"id": 552, "text": "By far one of the most fascinating and nostalgic films I have seen in quite some time, The Vast of Night proves to not only be a throwback to classic 50's sci-fi, but an incredibly well crafted work with some great lead performances. I regret waiting since June to watch this one, I loved this movie. Now, granted, this isn't the most entertaining movie I have ever seen. It has more of a slow building factor than some may be used to, but by god is it worth the pay off, and by god is it interesting all the way through. There are moments that will have you on the edge of your seat, moments that will have you in awe, moments that will have you yelling at the screen in excitement. This is what I call good filmmaking, and this is what movies were made for. The film is excellently directed and written by first time of both, Andrew Patterson, and I truly cannot wait to see what else he has to offer in the future. The films performances are lead by Sierra McCormick and Jake Horowitz, both of whom do a fantastic job, but Horowitz truly takes the cake, providing for one of the best male performances I have seen all year. Its cinematography is fantastic, truly capturing the 50's vibe, as well as the outstanding set direction. The film was originally filmed in 2016 and took nearly a year of editing. It cost less than a million to make, a budget of approximately $700,000- with a large majority of the money going into creating the 1950's look of the gym shown in several scenes. Finally in 2019, it entered several film festivals including Slamdance (not Sundance) and was eventually picked up by Amazon Prime. This just goes to show that you don't need a lot of special effects, money, or notable talent to make such a great film. This is why filmmaking is magic, and why movies are such a magical experience. With all the odds against you, you can still make a true gem of a film, and that is one of the many reasons why I admire and love this film so much. My Rating: 10/10"}, {"id": 553, "text": "In the vastness of the night is a pleasant surprise that goes unnoticed by the general public, it is certain that the film may bother some, with its slow pace and si-fi theme, but it is certain that the feature film directed by newcomer Andrew Patterson is a of the best films of the year.Andrew makes clear at all times his love for the pulb and the si-fi of the 30,40,50 years and, above all, his love for the radio, a film that mixes emotions and feelings and manages to leave the viewer stuck in the chair, with a plot very simple - which in moments even resembles the great Signs of Shyamalan - the film tells the story of a radio host and an attendant who pick up a strange signal, and thus, the investigation begins which is conducted slowly, always through monologues and constructions simple but very well elaborated scenarios, the film still manages to transmit a terror psychologist of first quality through its excellent direction that is not very expository and very intelligent, the director does not use simple resources to scare but creates a tension through the unknown, the fact that the invaders do not have a defined physical shape makes it all the more frightening, because afterwards we realize that at any moment they can be among us.Another good thing about the film is how small social criticisms are inserted in a simple way during the tape, without having to give spotlights or do great engineering to expose such criticisms, as they come in an organic way and are weighed in the same way.Returning to the direction, it is beautiful how the film manages to focus its acts on monologues all the time, for some it may seem boring, but all monologues are very good and the film is conducted almost like a podcast even though the use of image is great, with very few cuts, very flat sequences and bold camera transitions.In addition, the performances are great, the scenario, although extremely simple, is also great, the fact that it is a small country town in the early 50s leaves everything more sinister . Not everything is perfect, the various references that the feature makes during the course of its plot take away some of the tension, but even so, In the vastness of the night is poetic, enigmatic, fun and scary.

In these strange times, nostalgia is strong and so is a past that feels as foreign to us today as an alien from outerspace would feel on this planet.This directorial debut from Andrew Patterson does just that, as we from the future follow a young switchboard operator and a radio DJ whose discovery of a mysterious audio frequency sets off a series of discoveries that lead them deep into the unknown.The Vast of Night is not only a suprisingly suspenseful, low-budget spin on the genre to classic sci-fi thrillers, it's also a nostalgic throwback to those B-movie style thrillers of old.A slight criticism would be that paying such close homage runs the risk of alienating some audiences, but if you treat it like a small (un)contained Twilight Zone episode and let yourself go, as you venture further into this visually visceral radio play, you'll find your goosebumps begin to act like little unwelcome visitors encroaching all over your skin."}, {"id": 555, "text": "Never heard of the film, never heard of any of the cast, but I caught some trailers /excerpts that persuaded me to look for this film.

The tension created by the interplay between the radio station broadcaster, (Jake Horowitz), the apprentice switchboard girl (Sierra McCormick) and the caller (Bruce Davis) and other callers to the switchboard is very atmospheric, building an amazing amount of tension and proving that sometimes less can be more.. There are some points that will bedevil me for weeks - what was the fate of the trombone? Who actually won the match? How did they generate such a feeling of the 1950's from a few shots of cars and a basket ball court? For such a simple film (no real CGI, no dazzling special effects) and such a simple location (dim streets in a small town) the drama relies heavily on the actors and actresses,. Their performance is the bedrock from which the credibility of the film is successfully built.. I haven't seen any other work by the director (Andrew Patterson) and his IMDB profile simply informs me that he would be serious competition in a Hagrid lookalike competition. However I will look for future work by him with interest."}, {"id": 556, "text": "From the very beginning one can tell that this movie is a tribute to 50's Twilight Zone or similar Radio plays. In 1950's the curiosity about UFOs and Aliens was very fresh. Human race was not much aware the space and the secrets it holds. Outer space was a mystery. This movie tried to replicate that mystery. But gets successful in a very low percentage.It relied heavily on creating an eerie atmosphere and then stunning people with a blast in the end. But somehow the final blast, that grand reveal of the finale was not as impactful as the makers thought it is. The story works best in a radio play OR audiobook format. Putting on big canvas enlarges its problems. It has only 2 creepy stories, it doesn't know what to do with the camera when a lady is telling creepy story (So it stays in one place for 10 mins literally. They should have find some interesting angle or camera movements during that story).Though I can understand why some people would give it a very high rating. As I mentioned, it is a well shot and well acted film. It has some good film making techniques also. But we should rate the final product which includes many other elements (such as, story telling, script, editing, camera work, direction) also.That 20 mins opening scene deserves special mention. It should have been cut to 10 mins. It annoyed so many people and it's filled with so many unnecessary elements.Overall, it is just above average because of the good film making techniques and camera work.

It takes its time to establish the rapport between its two characters before things begin to go awry and Patterson's direction is impressive for the atmosphere he is able to create &amp; maintain.The period details are apt, plus the small-town setting fits its small-scale premise.

As soon as it starts, it hits you with its unrelentingly fast but often empty dialogue and strange, pseudo 'Twilight Zone (1959-1964)' framing. It's difficult to keep up with the flick until it slows down somewhat and brings attention to its two lead characters as they meander across their small, sleepy town and discuss recently read sci-fi. Though it still remains 'talky' throughout, the picture manages to infuse its narrative with a distinct style and some barely disguised but undeniably interesting exposition dumps. It plays with themes of unheard voices and the dismissal of marginalised groups, but it primarily focuses on its cold-war era UFO fever. Its potential extraterrestrial threat still mirrors that of a Russian invasion, but the piece has enough distance from the legitimate fears of late twentieth century US folk to not be an actual allegory. The filmmaking is mostly straightforward but sometimes brazen, stylistically taking a tour of the entire town in one shot or straight up just cutting to black while people speak. There's an enigmatic quality to the movie that keeps things feeling fresh, but a lot of the experience relies on the fact that it's a smoke and mirror act. The narrative is far subtler than you may expect, which works well for what it is. However, the overall result is a tad forgettable and, in a way, a little odd. It doesn't have all that much staying power and it's only properly engaging up to a point. Still, it's always interesting and is typically enjoyable, too. It's a solid, if somewhat forgettable, effort. 6/10"}, {"id": 559, "text": "Quite impressive work all around, but as entertainment, I found the film slow and a bit uninvolving.This isn't to say it's bad movie; far from it, the economy of storytelling is outstanding and is a great example of what can be done on a miniscule budget if one has talent.Sierra McCormick is the standout performer in the film. All tech credits, including the direction, the little special Fx work on show, and the score, punches well above it's budget category, and often rivals the work of studio pics.However, I would only give it a 5 as a movie. The story is as old as the hills, and I dislike the twilight zone- like framing device which i felt calls too much attention to itself. Two key events in the movie are also narrated by characters instead of shown - but obviously, this is due to the lack of budget. Generally, I found the movie to lack the required mystery, suspense, or wonder associated with sci-fi of this type.Certainly, the makers of the film are people to watch out for in future, but vast of night probably remains as just a very impressive calling card and a promising debut feature.

About halfway through there's a tracking shot that flies through the whole town that's beautiful and impressive enough to take your breath away. There's solid acting and endearing characters to accompany these technical achievements.But on the other hand, you have the bizarre choice to frame the film as an episode of a Twilight Zone-style anthology show, conveyed by random shifts to an old fashioned TV set point of view. It's a bonkers creative decision and very distracting. The biggest problem, however, is that the movie is mostly tense, atmospheric build-up, and all of that anticipation depends on a satisfying conclusion. Unfortunately, it's anything but: the end is equal parts abrupt and vague, and ultimately squanders all the good the film had going for it up to that point.

Extremely exaggerated modern takes of what should have been period props that could have been used instead at a minimum cost. Silly that such a small thing could have made such a huge impact for me, but the movie tried hard to be a period piece and they just ruined the whole experience. Which is crazy, because the film was successful in almost all other matters concerning trying to be of a certain period - cars, the gymnasium, street fronts, etc all worked really well but those damn eyeglass frames were just outlandish and a stupid error. In that same vein, they showed some dummy pic of a huge City Library, which was totally out of place for a town of a few hundred people. Just stupid minor errors that made it hard to buy into the period.Secondly, this is a tiny town in New Mexico deep in the southwest. If I'd not had signs telling me that, I would have sworn it was taking place in New Jersey. Not ONE of the actors talked like someone in the Southwest. They were all fast talking Eastern seaboard actors who sped through the dialogue at such a clip that I'm glad I had subtitles on so I could understand what was being said. I mean they talked FAST and with either New Jersey or maybe Long Island area accents. Again, totally spoiled the ability to buy into the story.And I'm one who is easy to sell a story to and it was a very good first effort for possibly the entire cast and crew, but if you want people to suspend disbelief and buy into the movie, you can't have MINOR errors in props and speech totally spoil the effort.I had read some glowing reviews, but was really disappointed by the amateurish mistakes. With just those minor tweaks corrected, it could have been a much better movie.But the story itself WAS an original take and a good one.

If it was from a major filmmaking company, I would have probably given it no more than a 7/10, but it was filmed in just 17 days, with a budget of 700.000$; which is ridiculously low for a film that actually made the theaters (generally, anything below $2mil. is considered a low-budget movie).Taking inspiration from everything from The War of the Worlds to The Twilight Zone and The X-Files, this is a mystery sci-fi film bordering on horror, which takes place in 1958. It begins quite misleadingly; 20 minutes of rapid dialogue virtually about nothing; we follow a pair of co-workers of a radio station around a high school campus in a non-stop conversation FOR TWENTY MINUTES. This little intro did two things: almost made me loose hope, because of how dull and hard to follow it was; but also instantly made me feel the atmosphere of the sixties. That atmosphere was so well-created, that it was literally unbelievable that you're watching a modern 2020 film. It felt more like a film about the sixties that was filmed in the eighties; I had hardcore throwbacks to Back to the Future throughout most of it; in terms of how the dialogue was created, how people talked and even how color was conveyed by the camera. I talk this much about it because of how actually impressed I am in retrospect; you instantly notice that the director Andrew Patterson can really immerse you into the story. And that's exactly what this film is about.The pair finally reaches the radio station, and discover that there is a strange, creepy, ominous sound being played continuously on one of the channels. It isn't terrifying, you barely take it seriously, but it is so subtly creepy, that it's like a tiny itch on the inside of your skull. It begins to grow on you. Then the station gets a couple of phone calls from people who claim that they know the origin of this sound. This is it. This is where the horror begins. We literally just listen to voices of random people over the phone tell some unbelievable conspiracy theory story that you would usually disregard completely. But when you tune in, pay close attention and listen closely to every word it gets unbelievably scary. I am not easily spooked at all anymore, and I'm not bragging, I'm complaining: its quite annoying. I was a huge fan of horror lets-plays and horror films, and now I have a sort of immunity to the basic horror stories; so in order for something to truly scare me, it has to be out of the ordinary (like Midsommar), and this film definitely was. It is exactly the same kind of scary that you feel when your uncle used to tell creepy stories beside a campfire, or when you read a horror novel or play a horror video game: it is all about immersion. Through intelligent use of strange, unidentifiable sounds the film plays with your inherent fear of the unknown, and it is just unbelievably effective. Turn the lights off, don't speak during the important scenes, listen in, feel the story; and you're in for an outstanding experience.Quentin Tarantino said: If you truly love cinema, you can't help but make a great movie, no matter what you budget is.

When they discover a strange frequency of air waves, their lives and the whole world may be about to change dramatically.Director Andrew Patterson's project is very simple. He uses darkness to his advantage to develop dialogues that are often shown in the middle of a black screen.You can get a sense of what the film will be like, right at the beginning, when for countless minutes, the love of the main characters on the radio is explored. The problem with that? At no time is the actors' faces shown up close. Seriously, it bothers a lot.Even so, the film develops and seems to finally get back on track. That's when Sierra McCormick gives a show. Interpreting the character Fay during her job as an operator, the actress has a long blunt scene with MANY lines.There will come a time when you will think: What do you mean, you haven't had a cut yet?Broadcaster Everett played by Jake Horowitz is also an interesting piece. Fundamental to the plot's progress, he is responsible for unraveling the mystery. The problem here is how it happens. It is very slow.At the first signs it is already possible to discover everything that the film tries to reveal little by little.The main problem with the film is that it takes too long to develop and thus be weakened.It could easily become a franchise with great characters and a nostalgic tone, but the lack of events and the slowness to tell the story, makes the simulation of a radio inside a movie not cool.With a very mild sense of suspense, you can watch with children, although, I'm sure, it won't please any.

I could not help thinking many times during the movie that this is not any kind of new directing atyle, this is actually old style directing like director Howard Hawks unique style of directing. I wonder if this director is a descendant of his? Hawks mastered the art of actors talking over other actors... he did it incessantly during his movies. a little of it was intriguing to make it seem realistic but he went overboard and did it all movie long making it irritating like in the movie The Thing or Rio Bravo.

I was told in the 50s, many many people did not even have cars, they took streetcars and ones that did had cars, had kind of like old tanks... but these kind of movies like American Graffiti and the Vast of night and Grease, and others always have teenagers having cars that are gorgeous that look like they came off the showroom floor. I guess directors just can't avoid the temptation of getting beautiful classic cars on the screen.... you mean nobody had cars with rust on it back then?
