It was absolute rubbish. The story made no sense. The acting was ridiculous. Everyone seemed like they were friends or family of the director/producer to have achieved this role. If you are wondering about the high rating, you can have a look at all the reviewers who rated it highly, and see how many other movies they have rated. That's right, all the reviewers have only rated this one movie ever, and rated it 10 out of 10. This should tell you how the rating has been manipulated. My review won't even get published because I am speaking the truth. Don't waste your time on this rubbish."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Ye film bht hi jhakas lagi mujhe I love that type cinema nice Characters Robo and Badshah"}, {"id": 3, "text": "The movie served complete justice to the time invested.
