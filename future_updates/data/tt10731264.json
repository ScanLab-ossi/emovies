Diljit Dosanjh playing the character of 'Suraj Singh Dhillon' is exceptional. This is a very light-hearted comedy entertainment of the year.

The movie goes on like rat &amp; mouse race between Manoj Bajpayee &amp; Diljit Dosanjh. It will definitely put smile on the face.

I can get behind any film which begins with Diljit looking into the camera and saying, 'Hi Peoples.' He plays Suraj, a 28-year-old desperate to get married. The actor works like an energizing shot of goofy charm and adrenaline. You have no option but to smile. His signature Punjabi liveliness contrasts nicely with Manoj, who mines his tightly-wound intensity for laughs. Manoj plays Madhu Mangal Rane, a private detective who specializes in investigating prospective grooms. He is a master of disguise on a mission to ensure that no woman settles for a substandard spouse. Mangal wrecks one of Suraj's rishtas. So Suraj decides to take revenge by romancing Mangal's sister Tulsi, who has some secrets of her own. It's a set-up with potential but director Abhishek Sharma, who earlier made Tere Bin Laden: Dead or Alive and The Zoya Factor, botches it up. Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari saddles its solid cast with lame jokes, inane plot twists and dull storytelling.READ THE FULL ARTICLE ON FILM COMPANION"}, {"id": 41, "text": "After 8 months of all the tensions finally a relief, a film to make you smile and laugh.

Marathi mulgaa Mangal is Tulshi's protective brother cum wedding detective who spies on prospective grooms and destroys their marriage. His latest victim is Punjabi munda Suraj whose beer guzzling photos land up at his hone wale in-laws place.Next, Suraj falls for Tulshi who reciprocates his advances and its only a few minutes of screen time until Detective Mangal gets to know..The screenplay is filled with illogical situations like a brother spoiling his sisters marriage just to get even with someone looks unconvincing, to say the least!! The humour element is intermittently spread across the narrative but dont expect too many lol moments here.Of the cast, Manoj Bajpayee struggles to get the Marathi accent right which mars his overall performance. The various get-ups he dons to investigate his cases havent been utilized optimally. Diljit Dosanjh fits in to the Sardarji character perfectly and is completely natural as Suraj. The pretty Fatima Sana Shaikh pitches in a decent act as the Marathi girl who aspires to be India's first DJ. Her performance is much better than Thugs of Hindostan (2018) where she was lost in the crowd but again, not as effective as her debut Dangal (2016).On the tech front, the production values are akin to a TV serial and the sets appear fake even for a 1995 era. There are two songs and both are enjoyable - I preferred the Karishma Tanna item number right at the beginning of the film.To sum up, Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari is an average fare better suited for an OTT viewing. Glad I didnt risk the theatres!!Regards, Sumeet Nadkarni."}, {"id": 69, "text": "This film is neither good nor bad, just in the middle. The + are: Good humour.Entertaining enough.Not the best film, but Will keep you satisfied and it's an original story, which is very rare in Bollywood as majority movies in Bollywood are South remakes nowadays.The drawbacks: Poor work by the Camera man. Many scenes look like some TV serial type of Vibes.Very dramatic towards the end and really feels like a pain the @$$ tv serial.Overall: 1 time watch."}, {"id": 70, "text": "'Suraj Pe Mangal Bhaari' may not belong to a great laugh riot movie club but it certainly one of the best comedy movies seen this year. This is a pure family movie with no nonsense scenes and foul languages.The story is very simple, and the treatment is good. The first half was bit slow and the movie seems dragged a bit here and there but overall it was a good time pass.I have always been a Manoj Bajpayee fan and he steals the show here. We are not used to seeing Manoj in these kind of roles but he aced it. Diljit is great and he seems comfortable playing these type of roles. Another good movie for him after Good News. Fatima looks stunningly beautiful throughout the film and did well.Anu kapoor deserve a special mention as he was simply great in a limited role. It is always pleasure to watch him.The music was a letdown even the title track was not good enough.All in all a good family entertainer."}, {"id": 71, "text": "Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari (2020) : Movie Review -Abhishak Sharma known for delivering the only great film in his career so far, Parmanu, has failed to give anything on that level. Parmanu was intelligently written and smartly presented film but the same smartness was never seen by Abhishek Sharma in any of his film. His new release Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari adds another unintelligent product in his filmography that people might even doubt about great film like Parmanu was directed by the same man. From the begining till the end Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari does not overweight in any aspects to justify the use of Bhari word in the title.Madhu Mangal Rane, a wedding detective spies and destroys the wedding of well mannered guy Suraj and when Suraj decides to take revenge he falls in love with Madhu's sister Tulsi. How Madhu and Suraj both try to defeat each other is all about rest of Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari. Basically, the script doesn't look like having something new except for the word like Wedding Detective. So, the obvious question is, will the comedy and actors be able to save this weak script? The answer is No. Manoj Bajpayee was never out of form like this. His expressions and characters doesn't make any sense anywhere. Why was he supposed to talk with an accent like a woman when he is a man? It looks nothing less than a Panzy character.Like mentioned above, almost all the characters in the film are written poorly. Maybe the 90s formation wasn't right and that's why all this fiasco happened. Diljit Dosanjh is somewhat funny but nowhere close to hysterical character he played in 'Good Newwz'. Fatima Sana Sheikh looks gorgeous as a Marathi girl but the accent and attitude are below par. Annu Kapoor has very little to do, Manoj Pahwa is decent and the rest of the cast is strictly watchable. When the basic writing fails nothing can save the film but this film somehow manages to float on surface for some time before sinking. Some comedy scenes are funny and also are the only enjoyable scenes in the film.Abhishek Sharma should have gathered all the scattered things in the screenplay before taking the project in hands. When your characters and storyline look unorganised and faltered then no matter how hard you try and how smartly you wanna make things up, the cumulative result was meant to be disastrous. There is hardly anything in the film to watch and in such time when there is nothing good coming from Bollywood it feels even worse to recommend something like this. Skippable!RATING - 4/10*"}], "reviews_amount": 72}
