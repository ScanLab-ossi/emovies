{"name": "Archive", "titleId": "tt06882604", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "I'll start off by ranting that anyone who says this film is just a rip-off of the Keanu Reeves film Replicas obviously didn't actually watch this or they weren't paying attention at all. Other than it being about a man trying to use technology to resurrect his dead wife, the films are completely different in substance.Also, I feel like many reviewers don't get what actually happened in this film, but I'll try to explain for those who need to know. Maybe it was a fault of the film itself, the writing, that buried the truth too deeply, and so I'll fault the writing for missing that part, but if you do get it, it's pretty profound.I'll explain.Heavy spoilers below...watch the film first.Okay?So for those who did watch it, obviously at the end you learn that the protagonist is actually dead, this was all a dream, bait and switch M. Night-style ending. But not exactly.At its surface that was how the film ended, but there's more to it than that. The protagonist invented the Archive, it was his creation. Now being a customer of the device he created caused a unique outcome. He continued inventing in this reality, even as he was actually near death. It makes sense, as he did this sort of thing his entire life, so he continued it when he was in a near-death state, as it was all his mind could do to continue to live and make sense of reality itself.Like The Sixth Sense, he didn't know he was dead (until the very end), so he continued living as if he was alive. Everything was a coping mechanism. His wife's absence was explained by his mind as her being dead, etc.But the amazing twist was that he really did invent artificial intelligence. From inside the Archive. He found his wife's mind implant in the Archive, which he mistook as her file (it was actually just her initial mind scan when they signed up for the service), and built A.I. Around it.Late in the film the teenage and adult A.I. discover the truth, they are part of a simulation in a dying man's mind. How tragic would that be? Discovering you are a sentient being inside someone else's make-believe world? (Very Rick and Morty meta). Anyway...The teenage A.I.'s reaction to this revelation is realistic for her maturity level, she ends her life. But as they are based on his real wife's mind the A.I. do truly love the protagonist, so at the very end his wife A.I. pleads with him not to answer the phone, as doing so will make him realize he is dead, and the simulation ends once the dead are ready to move on / they realize they are truly dead.In some ways it appears to be that the simulation acts as a kind of go towards the light effect (like on a ghost that doesn't actually realize it's dead yet). Once the protagonist realizes I'm dead, he can die. Hearing his child speak does that.The characters in the simulation were all aspects of the lead's own personality. His boss represented his fear of failure, the guy from the bar represented the danger that he was truly in, the A.I. he built represented not being able to let go of his wife.But, his overwhelming reason to still live, what was holding him tethered, was his love for his wife and wanting to see her again. Once he literally brought her back to life via A.I. downloads, and was reunited with her, his mind was able to finally be at peace, which was represented by him answering the phone.Unfortunately though, the tragic part was that the A.I. were real too, in his quest to be reunited with his wife, he made real living beings.It was fascinating to me. The ramifications for what happens when a guy who invents an afterlife (sort of), becomes a customer of his own invention.I do fault the film for not writing this conclusion more clearly, however, but I think it was a good film, overall. And deep. Maybe far too deep for some, based on these reviews."}, {"id": 1, "text": "This is one of the best science-fiction movies I have ever seen. Some maybe won't agree with this but for me it was damn near perfect. It's definitely a slow movie but it has a great story and thought-provoking ideas to consider. A man who is an engineer in artificial intelligence has his life blown apart by the death of his wife, right after he lands the job of a lifetime. It follows his work in developing artificial intelligence in the wake of his wife's death.Set in Japan, the main character is the only person who works in a facility devoted to researching and developing artificial intelligence. In the future, if a loved-one dies, a company called Archive can store that person's essence in a hard-drive like state but the remaining family only has a short time before the archive of their loved-one deteriorates completely. This company works to give people a chance to say goodbye to someone who died if they didn't get the chance to do so in life. There are fascinating implications that this brings up with life and death and what comes after. Our main character here has been working behind the back of the company he works for in order to insert his wife's essence into a new robotic body.Along the way the engineer has completed two prototypes in his efforts to perfect the technology required to be with his wife once again. The first model is very child-like and doesn't have much of a human-like body. The second has arms and legs similar to a human and displays cognitive abilities of a teenage girl about 15 years old. As the development of the body for his wife progresses, the second prototype displays jealousy and resentment towards the engineers new interest in making a body to download his wife into. This brings about new issues as the engineer progresses closer to his goal.I really enjoyed the characters of the first two prototypes and it really brings a depth to the story as a whole. The effects are great and the music score was enjoyable as well. The production was amazing all the way around. If you like science-fiction I think you will enjoy this movie. It brings up many thoughts to ponder on about existence and life. Give it a shot. I'm glad I did."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I expect a lot of people will compare this to Ex Machina, and for good reasons. Excellent story, interesting character development, great acting and directing, this is definitely the kind of smart, evenly paced sci-fi I love (if you're expecting explosions, lasers and flying car chases, you're gonna have a bad time...). While it may be using familiar tropes and the occasional cliche, this truly is a 7/10 throughout that earns its 8th star in the last 15 min. Highly recommended, especially for sci-fi fans!"}, {"id": 3, "text": "What an awesome and visually impressive movie. Ending blew my mind and never saw it coming. Highly recommend!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "... and thats probably partially true. Anyway if you enjoyed the seeting in Moon with Sam Rockwell and you aslo enjoy the emotional awakening of AI theme then I believe you will enjoy this one. It is very hard to express the difference from all those similar movies you have seen without spoilers so I wont go into plot any details. But it is different. The setup is very similar to ExMachina and the first half of the moive is a real slow burner. Beautiful shots and scenery but really nothing happens for a while. Then it starts to catch up in the second half. I was even emotinal for a bit for a robot, and no it wasnt the pretty female robot. All in all I recommend this movie to any sci-fi addict. Its more of an enomitional and visual ride so you should not expect any action here. What you can expect is beautiful cinematography, pretty good acting and a truly surprising twist at the end. Im not saying its flawless because it has some plot holes here and there but overall its one of the better movies of the AI awakening genre."}, {"id": 5, "text": "The movie looks great, solid special effects, wonderful production quality, with very competent cinematography and editing. In 2020, this should be the expectation, and as with most film and television media made in 2020, the writing is the weakest link. Unlike many infamous examples in horrific writing seen in these mediums lately, this film is at least competently written. The issue is what story it's trying to tell, and how it's told.There's a twist ending that actually works within the rules of the films universe, which shouldn't be high praise, but in 2020, it unfortunately is. The issue with the twist ending is that it undermines the entire journey the audience takes with the characters and plot. I won't ruin the twist, but it's on par with and then (s)he wakes up. This writing device destroys the entire story, because none of it really mattered.Another issue with the writing is the characters, and their character progression and growth. Again, given the twist ending, almost none of the characters we get to know really mattered. But, even disregarding the twist ending, there's another issue with the characters. When a robot with almost no visual human characteristics named J2 is your most sympathetic character, you've done something wrong.Sure, it's an accomplishment they've written J2 to be the character the audience sympathizes with, and is the most invested in. The issue is, the film is Georges story, and once J2 exits the story, the audiences investment in the plots outcome drastically diminishes. Even J2 doesn't matter once the twist ending reveals itself, which only compounds the issue of the ending.Even disregarding the twist ending, there's still another issue with the writing; what is it trying to say? What subject matter does it explore, and what issues and topics is it addressing? Besides just telling an interesting story, this is usually the primary focus of science fiction. To explore social issues in a setting that amplifies the subject it's examining. This is where the writing truly fails from similar science fiction films like Her and Ex Machina, because this film doesn't seem to have much to say at all."}, {"id": 6, "text": "This was quite a well done movie. These days most movies you know where theyre going long before they get there. I thought I had this one pegged thru out but it kept coming up with surprises. These days they dumb down a lot of movies so everyone in the audience gets the story but that tends to let you guess the end long before you get there. Im happy to say not this one. Everytime you think its going to be this type of movie it turns into another type and that continues until the surprising ending which the film gives nothing away about until the last couple of minutes. Great acting great cinematography. Definitely worth a watch through. Enjoy"}, {"id": 7, "text": "Maybe my first time for a review. I really think that movie deserved it, at least. A very good SF movie and very well directed.Just watch it .... and after ...you will be thinking what the F....."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This film was beautifully shot &amp; acted. The premise is quite thought provoking and really makes you question what would you want when you pass away. Theo James never disappoints and this is another phenomenal performance. It takes an amazing actor to carry a film and he does it effortlessly. I was not familiar with Stacy Martin prior to this film, but was extremely impressed by her. She takes on the challenge of playing the different forms of Jules and makes you feel for each version. She beautifully brings the human essence to J3. I love a movie that gives you that dropped mouth &amp; OMG moment - this one does not disappoint!"}, {"id": 9, "text": "Good hard sci-fi. The setting is supposedly 2038. Maybe a bit early. I'd say 2075.In any case it's a good science fiction story that has writing and acting flaws, but the plot is solid and carries it."}, {"id": 10, "text": "I watched it twice...the first time I missed so much of the symbolism and I had many questions.....until the end. The second time I was able to focus on what it all meant and the feelings and interactions of the characters. I don't usually watch sci-fi movies, but this is so much more...it is thought provoking.....grief, loss, humanity. Theo James is wonderful as George and Stacy Martin shines as J3.... Congratulations to all involved."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Sorry but if you are going to make a Sci fi film on AI's then please don't revisit Any previous attempts.

I would rate it 4 only for cinematography and special effects."}, {"id": 16, "text": "This was fantastic. The acting was superb. The plot set up empathetic characters. I wasn't familiar with the Female lead. I would look for her again in other media. She did an excellent job portraying a robot with AI. I think this is maybe the most dynamic role I have seen Theo James play. I love the way it ended, which is unusual. A lot of movies these days fail to tie things together and give a satisfying ending, but this one made so much sense to the storyline. I can't wait to watch it again for all the little things I missed. Two Thumbs Up"}, {"id": 17, "text": "A story that could've been told in 30 mins. just drags on and on and on and... you get the point. Even visual effects cannot compensate for the excruciatingly slow pace. By the time they got to the plot twist at the end, I didn't even care anymore.Not worth the time.... I don't know how this managed to get decent ratings to begin with. All them reviews speaking about depth and great sci-fi must've been watching a diff't movie altogether because I didn't find any redeeming elements.One of those movies where the trailer is better than the movie itself.

Not even recommended for the sci-fi crowd..."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I tried to like it but 45 minutes was enough. Nothing was happening, Boring dialogs, nonsense story and bad directing.

Without irony. Anyhow.. terribly slow and plodding. Utterly disjointed and not at all believable even within the sci-fi genre. Shamefully silly premise and story-line. Tries so hard to be melodramatic yet its emotionally hollow and empty. Vapid, sterile garbage. Oh, and the 'surprise' ending is just adds insult to injury. There are so many good indy sci-fi films.. why waste time on an awful one? Few things disappoint me more than people who think awful movies are great. 10 STARS? REALLY?!?"}, {"id": 21, "text": "The goal that the creator of this film set for himself remained in a question mark for me.

Snooze fest."}, {"id": 23, "text": "You are watching this movie as it has generally good reviews and you are intrigued by the apparent 'twist' ending advertised so well in these genuine reviews. Let me save you some time and tell you right now without giving away any spoliers....There is NO twist. The ending is as predictable as the rest of the film is boring. I really don't mind predictability, just not when it's disguised as some WOW moment that never comes because I have a brain in my head. If you are shocked by the ending, didn't see it coming, you seriously need to go watch some great movies like Se7en,The Sixth Sense or Primal Fear. This is trying way too hard to be a great like those just mentioned and fails completely, utterly and very miserably."}, {"id": 24, "text": "The concept isn't original (Transcendence is way better). Didn't like musicalization.The storyline is flat, sad and unclear."}, {"id": 25, "text": "This sci-fi drama is ANOTHER ahem, rehash of Pinocchio/Frankenstein's Monster. Only this version has Geppetto cast as another remorseful scientist that has lost his loved one and can't let go. THANKFULLY there's technology to keep her as a digital copy until he can build a new model (literally). If it sounds familiar, it's because Hollywood is notoriously bad at coming up with original material. These stories are so cringe now in their predictability,that they are literally unwatchable. Basic plot line goes like this; 1. A loved one dies. 2. the grieved has the ability bring the dead back to life. 3. There is no God or mention of God other than in cursing. 4. Ethics don't matter. 5. The dead rebel against the imprisonment at first, but then give in and accept/even try to embrace their false life. 6. But then the creator rejects the created, with complete callousness and disregard for the being's love for it's creator, it is rejected and left to dispair. 7. It will experience the range of human emotions without the ability to ever feel reciprocal love or feelings. 8. The end usually results in the death of one or both of them or one of them living on in a cold hard reality of jealousy and rage. Sooooo Oooooold. Please come up with better material than this script which has so many plot holes, unnecessary dialogue and character development that ultimately goes no where. This movie had so much potential but gets lost in the same old cliches. The shadowy corporation, the dystopian society are hardly relevant on screen to the point that their inclusion doesn't add substance to the story and comes off as an unfinished thought from the script writer to the audience. Toward the end it seemed the script went through several rewrites in an attempt to fit an appropriate ending to an otherwise pointless story. This has the effect of leaving the audience dissatisfied with the conclusion, and wondering what the point to any of it was. Plot twists can't save this disaster. Overall this movie is like a bag of burned microwave popcorn. It started off promising, but ended up in the trash."}, {"id": 26, "text": "This could have been a short film.

In 2009, Rothery was a key figure behind Duncan Jones' sci-fi masterpiece Moon: the moon base, Gerty the robot and all the vehicles were all designed by him. Now, Rothery gives another proof of his visual talent with Archive. Some people said that Archive is a sort of Ex Machina meets Black Mirror, but I think that's not the right comparison. In my opinion this movie is more a spiritual sequel to Moon, with the same depht in all its charactersations and the same taste for world building and atmosphere. Yeah, maybe Moon was more innovative, but I don't care. This is a kind of sci-fi that's extremely difficoult to find today. This movie is precious.

The various forms take on characteristics, and voice, of his wife who he still gets to talk to via an archive contraption. One robot get jealous, version #2, and almost sabotages the entire effort.This is an interesting movie to watch for those of us who enjoy this theme, with certain similarities to Ex Machina. We naturally wonder where all this will lead and the last 10 to 15 minutes flips everything on its side, giving a resolution that I didn't see coming. And to me it is a more interesting resolution.I watched it on Amazon streaming movies, my wife skipped.SPOILERS FOLLOW - As we watch the story unfold we take it for face value, however we eventually find out that his wife didn't die in the accident, George was the one who died and all we were seeing was his own final and fading dreams as his wife accesses him via the archive."}, {"id": 54, "text": "It was quite impossible to become fully immersed in the story being presented. The spoken dialogue was drowned-out by an oppressively loud music track that wasn't even good enough to warrant that degree of focus on it. There were quieter moments in the movie where the music track was absent, allowing one to begin to become immersed... and THEN the oppressive music would return, yanking one back to the realization that one is just watching a movie with terrible sound mixing.Brian Gilligan should have been fired and the audio re-mixed before release."}, {"id": 55, "text": "I read about this film a while back and based in the initial reviews, had low expectations. However, I was surprised to learn the reviews were mostly wrong. The premise of the movie is an engineer suffers the loss of his pregnant wife and spends the majority of the film attempting to build an AI to replicate her and bring her back to life inside a robotic body. The various prototypes are his attempt to create the perfect human/machine blend. The entire time, he is continuing to be threatened by the mysterious employer, threatening to shut down his project. Much of the film references these unseen intruders and their threat to his facility. Throughout the movie, the man communicates with his dead wife via a program called the archive. Upon finally creating the perfect AI to reconstruct his wife, we learn that the man himself is the one who died and has been living inside of a simulation the entire time and it was him that had been existing inside the archive. It's essentially a scifi version of The Sixth Sense in which the protagonist finds out he is the one who has died. I have always enjoyed Theo Jones' acting and he did not disappoint in this film.

The director is trying to paint a mood with these long slow shots of the trees and waterfalls, etc. But they just go on forever and are used way too often. I found myself constantly skipping ahead because I was incredibly bored. Others may find it adds to the mood of the film. There's a fine line between setting a mood and boring the viewer.

The main character delivers the humblest performance, clean and real, he really makes you believe he's the big brother of the robots without trying. I liked that they mentioned black mesa, it got me hoping that this would start a half life universe, but I believe the writers must have been just fans having fun with an easter egg.

If you are into that, or if you have never encountered such thing called story before - this film can be your new favourite. My biggest criticisms of this motion picture are that a lot of scenes have really lo-fi video quality look to them, like early digital camcorders, film's juvenoia, and that J3 and J3,5 are damn humans in body-paint. I understand that the guy makes a human proxy, and that this is a low budget film, which looks (probably) way above its budget. But at that point, if you are not going Bicentennial Man, you might just go damn Kokaku Kidotai (or Ex Machina) and say Our skin-technology is just this good. Her parts are already that complex, to be recognizable as just human. So there were no reason for excessive lines and gamer-design. Last model even has damn arm-hairs and goosebumps. And they go overboard with the close-ups to entirely ruin the illusion of a movie, and leave you with a filmed stage-play visuals. Writers are bashing J2 for having development of a 16yo, as if that's not enough. You have a development of a 16yo. You are a direct and complete continuation of that you. Even 6yo J1 is already too much of development. That's already 95% state. The rest of development is actually just constant acquiring of new information - of life experience. The brain is not your cpu it's your hard drive. The 7-22 period is your actual life, it's you living it and getting new experiences. It all goes downhill since ~23. From that point it's you trying to conserve what you managed to get while you had a chance. It's you constantly losing what you can't maintain. It's you slowly turning into a rabid conservative to preserve vanishing glimpses of your former self. It's you memembering, instead of learning.--------Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity. At the beginning of the film i actually though that this may be a proper tidied up version of Ubik. Dick is an interesting subject to study if you have storytelling-related hobby, but he is a terrible writer. I hoped that that barely coherent meth-trip is finally properly adapted into a feature-complete work. But alas. Ubik is a complete mess, but at least the messiness makes it open to possibilities. In a world with no rules everything can happen. And then the kitten woke up. The twist here is as meaningless as it can be. There's not a single second of the run-time to set it up or tie into it. It's a twist for the twist's sake. Nothing in the whole film is related to it. Not the plot, not the story, not the writing, not the themes. You can add such twist to any film on earth and it would have the same effect. Usually this twist is at least somehow set-up. Here, you just know it will happen, because you've read a story at least once in your life. Not because of diegetic reasons, but because you know what a story is. It's so meaningless, it doesn't impact your experience at all. It doesn't even invalidate it retroactively. The movie is a movie you watched, and the twist is a separate thing which exists.On the other hand, it just means that this film has no story, has no ark, has no ending.

Some of the footage was spectacular of the waterfall and the winter scape where George was working.On the negative side, the film's narrative was convoluted, and the flashback sequences were awkwardly inserted. Another flaw was the character of James himself, who seemed naive about his creation of the sentient beings. He never grasped that he was, like Dr. Frankenstein, endowing beings with consciousness who felt human emotions. Robots #s 1, 2, and 3 were all too endearing, and it was sad that George was not in touch with their feelings.The film's big plot twist was also disappointing.

That's because most often the emotional response provoked by most recent movies has been overwhelmingly negative. This film did not do that, and did just the opposite.This film has been one of the most thought provoking and philosophical treatment of various themes included in the film, themes that include Artificial Intelligence, the moral implications of such, and the possibility of uploading someone's mind into a computer, to give a form of life after death. These themes have been explored to great extent in a number of other science fiction movies in the past 20 years, including Replicas, Transcendence, Ex Machina, and The Machine....but this movie does it better. This movie was a pleasant shock, rather than a pleasant surprise, and I think this movie deserves and Oscar -- which it will never get, because Hollywood society thinks science fiction is for kids, rather than for adults smarter than anyone in Hollywood society.All that being said, there are reasons why I give this a 9 out of 10 rather than a 10 out of 10. Minor spoilers below, read at your own risk..... The first 90% of this movie explores most of the themes outlined above, particularly AI and the moral implications of such, including discarding earlier iterations in favor of newer improved versions. However, there is a twist in the last few moments of the movie that change it entirely, and leave me unsure of how I feel about the movie or how I should rate it. It becomes an entirely different story at that point. It's such a radical twist that I suspect executive meddling, and have to say that it feels like two entirely separate stories were somehow meshed together, with the second one essentially invalidating all that came before. I still like the movie, but as I said, it becomes hard to say how I feel about it as a whole.However, I wholeheartedly recommend you watch this movie. I expect your feelings will also be mixed when all is said and done."}, {"id": 155, "text": "This is an exceptionally thought provoking film which questions some of our most basic understandings of the mind of an individual and what it means to loose someone.

Personally I found it to be way too brief considering how much effort was placed on the foreshadowing yet it works. It could have easily included more information about the 'outside' world especially from the wives perspective and both companies to explain why Theo's character wasted so much time in this Archive illusion to create the perfect AI for his supposedly 'dead wife' when in reality it was all done for the Protagonist to die after reaching the end. Lots of questions about his 'illusions' or 'dellusions' of breaches to his security, company wanting to sue him, etc and in the end it was all in his imagination. The film might make some feel cheated and for myself I feel it was a marvel accomplishment even if lots of holes in the plot it ends up being extremely entertaining...and might have a Sequel to answer all these questions.

It was just an insult to the viewers, probably made, because the finished version of the movie was so bad and the writers had to somehow mask their creative weakness. It got the readers confused and disappointed and for one second some people maybe thought the movie was bad, but maybe I didn't get everything because of the twist and then never think about that movie again. Probably the reviews, giving 10 stars to this movie because of the twist are bots with the level of intelligence of robot No 1.The guy is at the same time expert on robots (hardware) and artificial intelligence (software). He works alone, building super complicated things from scratch and doing research. Yet he looks confused and never repairs the security system in his remote house.Repairing the security system didn't matter anyway, so why was even mentioned (and took half an hour from the movie)?He builds one very simple version of a robot with AI, then a very good one, then one perfect/state of the art super amazing robot. He built a perfect robot using parts of the old robot, yet never bothered to put hands on the first version. Why?He was acting like an a****ole to the second robot and looked surprised when the robot got upset. For most of the movie, he was either yelling at or ignoring the robot and making it clear that robot No 2 is unwanted, leaving the robot alone for long hours and then wondering why the robot freaked out. The character obviously never watched any horror movies.Conviniently, his wife dies just when he accepts a project to build a robot with artificial intelligence and now he is super inspired.None of the robots had GPS tags and were disappearing like crazy, running around, getting wet, and so on - no care for very expensive prototypes.He was doing research, but completely ignored the No 2 robot, which was willing to learn and expressing feelings and complex emotions - a very interesting thing worth pursuing as research. As a researcher, he was taking zero notes. Yet, this is probably explained with the twist, right.He was obsessed with robot no 3 aka the wife, but acted weird around her and did not explain to her anything.The guy that he met in the Japanese restaurant was only in the movie, so they could show some smoking. Obviously, Hollywood has a quota and has to show smoking people in every movie. No other reason.The movie was not that boring, but it was unnecessarily long and dull.

I was getting a little bored after the midway portion, and the slow pacing of the 109 min runtime really felt like the film was dragging its heels, but the satisfaction and reward towards the end made it all worthwhile, at least for me.Take into account that the brilliant writing and on-point directing, is the first full length feature film by Gavin Rothery, with only one prior short film for this new filmmaker. So for putting such a high caliber, wonderfully vibrant and expertly captivating feature film debut, for this first-time filmmaker, much respect and mad props to him. Rothery is certainly a filmmaker with a ton of potential and one to watch.It's not your typical sci-fi, as it had many layers, and creates an engrossing study of human frailty and obsession intertwined with AI. The cinematography was outstanding, with exceptional and gorgeously shot scenes, production-designed sets, and S/Vfx. The score was very fitting and really set the tone for the entire film. Theo James and the rest of the cast, nailed their characters.Had this film's pace been a little faster, and/or 10-15 mins shaved off from the runtime, this film would've been perfect. I'll definitely be watching this one again, but only after the stunned feeling leaves my stomach. It's a well deserved 8/10 for this film and newb filmmaker from me.

It even has its own abysmal attempt at the Ex-Machina dance scene.But with that said, there is one very good touch to this movie. One that's unfortunately let down by the other 95% (that doesn't allow it to have the impact that it perhaps should have done). A nice idea, but poorly executed.Also, this movie is a perfect example of how NOT to use a score (music). More producers need to understand that it's not necessary to fill every second of a movie with an over-bearing score in the background. Because in doing so, the viewer loses the ability to notice which parts of the film something profound, sad, exciting, revealing or exciting is about to happen. The whole movie is filled with futuristic sci-fi ambience music; making every scene/segment of the movie feel exactly the same. Not helpful when the entire plot of the film is already set in one compound with very limited characters.

The last 3rd let's it down, the shock ending is anything but a shock and simply burns the first parts down. I think the Toby Jones scene finished it for me in retrospect. Nothing to do with his performance which is great work as always, but it demonstrates the lack of closure the film winds up at by pulling the same tired twist as other, better works.Hint. When being interviewed about your tripe filled film that ends with a tried and tested one, don't tell us you burned all the usual tropes in your search for originality.A pity, as the emotional nuances provided by the bots ARE really good, it deserved a more eloquent ending to match the set up, which is done well.

Theo James has the looks of a young De Niro or James Franco from time to time, but he (or his character) is quite charmless.It's strange that this reminded me of Moon so much, when you consider that the director of this film worked on Moon back in 2009. But that film is buoyed by an engrossing Sam Rockwell performance. And Ex Machina has the balance of Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Issac's performances. Theo James can't really anchor this whole movie.

It achieves the goal of good (literary) SF by telling an interesting tale, in an unusual environment that the viewer slowly comes to grasp, but with something to say about the human condition.The film shares DNA with Ex Machina and Moon, with some Silent Running in there as well.

Another addition to the artificial intelligence and robotics films, among which was Ex Machina, which focused on the pursuit of artificial intelligence freedom and slightly on romance, only this one goes much further. It focuses on deeper and more serious bioethical issues, such as how one could hold the consciousness of a person who has actually gone for a bit longer by storing it in the archive, a system where one could communicate with one phone call. The consciousness would gradually weaken until it was completely lost. Through these calls, one could get more time and to properly say goodbye to loved ones that are gone. But what would be the essence of this consciousness? It would have e.g. soul, or would it be a mere imprint of the dead, memories, thoughts, images etc? If consciousness still existed could we say that the beloved ones are not dead yet? What if someone took it even further and tried to store consciousness in robots to keep their beloved ones? So the film raises serious issues for the first time and despite the slow pace that characterizes the films of the genre in general, it is a pioneer in the genre and has a huge plot twist at the end that reminds of the movie 6th sense with Bruce Willis. Of the films of this genre, Ex Machina is clearly one of the most well-known, but of much value is now the much older film with Robin Williams, the Bicentennial Man (1999), which I recommend as a reference film to artificial intelligence.

It was so painful to watch because most scenes are heartbreaking, and depending on what you believe in the emotions will pour out. If men create something it could have feelings and this film show the consequences of building phase after phase to perfection in a different humanity perspective. The decisions of the scientist made me feel sometimes hurt even though he has a sentimental purpose, but one can't be blinded to other things.

In the process, he has created two prototypes - a bulky one with the intelligence of a toddler, and another smaller, leaner version with the brains of a teenager. Both the prototypes (treated as sisters) develop a connection with their creator. George, however, wants to build a 3rd and final prototype which has the potential to perfectly carry his wife's sensibilities and demeanor.The story gets a little dramatic in the middle portions, with one of the prototypes feeling jealous of her creator's newfound enticement with his latest, brainiest android. There's also the evil corporate angle which only drives the film faster towards its finale, but what catches you off-guard is that incredible last-minute twist. It leaves the door open for repeat viewings and multiple interpretations. Since Archive takes the predictable route to get to this cracker of a twist, it doesn't get a rating more than what's currently assigned.Theo James is ideally cast as George; to think this is a film that's primarily about a human living in an isolated lab with 3 robots, James pulls off the stoicism quite well.

There have to be some engaging characters, some sense of narrative direction and a modicum of originality... and this is where the movie stumbles.The good looking chap straight from the cover of GQ is alone in a remote lab busy putting together a robot to house the consciousness of his dead and equally good looking wife. Both of these people are annoying and do stupid things. It's like a Hallmark movie set in space.But the biggest sin of all is a filmmaker who thinks that women give a hoot about sci-fi.

He talks to them like he would to children and they in turn act like sisters. J03 is in the works. At first only a humanoid torso like a prototype from a Westworld lab. Later we learn that indeed, J01 has the brain faculties of a 5 year old, and J02 those of a 15 year old.

Unfortunately, not a lot happens. Moreover, this is the kind of movie that doesn't do much to explain itself initially. At the beginning you don't know what's going on and it's not clear the movie wants you to know. That's not a good way to start a movie. It's only once the flashbacks start that the viewer can make sense of things. For a sci-fi film it unfortunately lacks some scientific angle. There's a bit about how consciousness is stored but I would have liked to see more science. Music is typical sci-fi emotional poignant stuff. Everything depends on the twist at the end then whether the whole movie redeems itself or not. I would say, it almost does.

So far he has made J1 (Chris Schubert) and J2 (Timea Maday Kinga) and they help him while he makes J3, who is almost done.In flashbacks we see Jules and George as a very loving couple. We do note that J1 and J2 are robots that for purposes of the movie have human beings inside them. They are big and bulky and it's easy to Imagine that in the making of the movie, that they often fell.One of the robots, J2, becomes jealous that George is spending too much time on J3 and not on her, but George tries to calm her and promises to do better.Notables: Toby Jones as ARM rep Vincent Sinclair who wants to know how ready Jules is for burial; Richard Glover as Melvin, an associate of Vincent; Hans Peterson as Mr. Elson, the Risk Assessor, who gives George a case to only be used in an Emergency, Stacy Martin is also the voice of J2 and the robot J3 and does a very credible job and she, basically, steals the show.We do see some attempts by other companies to invade the house to get all the AI (Artificial Intelligence) that ARM is protecting.This is quite a more interesting Sci-Fi story that we have seen in the past. The music is very loud at times and with it we see what appears to be videos of the insides of a robotic brain with transistors, diodes and memory sticks along with other units that make up a robotic brain.This may remind some of the movie Ex Machina, but this doesn't go there regarding sex or nudity.All in all this is very engaging and oh, there will be a very big twist later on........just so you know..................ha!

Wasnt expecting much. However the tenderness of the some scenes showed deeper layers than just a sci-fi flick. One scene was heartbreaking. And meanwhile I understand that everybody can have differing opinions, to miss these points and say this movie is stupid and boring, they must be missing a humanity/sensitivity chip. I also don't get why some say this movie is confusing. Did they watch it to the end? I liked the serious tone mixed with the goofiness in the flashbacks. It made the film seem real and relatable. Only drawback was the religious type expletives. Didn't need it. Aside from that, this movie had me reflecting back on it the next day. If you are looking for a dumbed down-explained in your face-movie, this may not be for you. This one takes at least 2 or more brain cells to understand it.Decent acting. Nice that there wasn't any nudity.Reminded me a tiny bit of Wall-E in a weird way with the robots."}, {"id": 247, "text": "I found it very hard to get invested in this movie for much of its run. I'm actually not even really sure if I was just not interested enough in it or if the movie just wasn't strong enough on characterization to keep a firm enough hold. I kept fading in and out, picking up the movie's information but not really feeling much of its overall theme or tone. It played out very plain and straightforward for the most part.Toward the end, it starts to get confusing (again I am not sure if this is just because I was emotionally detached or if the film was just too light on detail) and a lot of very important key concepts are left unfortunately vague. Flashback scenes become increasingly disconnected from the main narrative to the point where at one point I was unable to tell whether a certain scene was a flashback or not, even though it had a robot in it. The entire somnulence thing was not given a proper explanation so I could not tell if it was some manner of suicide program or digitization or duplication, and could not understand why it was limited or what expiration meant specifically--- does it mean the customer has stopped paying and so the digital copy will be removed by the company? Or does the company enforce expiration due to whatever laws regarding making AI copies of people? This isn't answered until the very end. As well, for some reason I cannot even begin to understand, the movie gives off the impression of being somehow post-apocalyptic or post-scarcity in some way. A scene in which a random stray dog gets into this guy's remote house seems to enforce that theme, especially since he's apparently living in the middle of the woods far away from civilization.The robots he makes are utterly adorable, named/numbered J1 and J2 and eventually J3, they are progressions in sophistication, with J1 being big, bulky, and childlike, J2 being smaller, more nimble, and talkative, and J3 being essentially a complete human replica android. The Guy seems intent on making the perfect human replica, in the form of J3, to upload his wife's somnulence AI copy into after she died. For some reason, his boss, who yells at him over holophone every so often, cannot find this out and this is to be kept secret. Why is never explained. At the end there is a very big and huge twist which answers much of the technical questions I had earlier, but only raise more and significant logical questions. The core of a good story is in there, but this film just didn't do a good enough job of telling that story. It went for an indie arthouse feel to it, and I feel in the process it ended up losing a lot of its storytelling capability as a result. Emotions and themes are lost in service of moods and ambience. The human story, which is the forefront of the plot, feels almost suffocated by the environmental story.It would have worked so much better as a book or a miniseries, or with just a bit more narrative information, like Moon which it seems to be compared to."}, {"id": 248, "text": "Looking at the comments I can say that Sci-Fi means different things to different people. This one is all about masterpiece writing, subtlety and art - not about action, combats or cool tech. It's closer to Blade Runner 2049 or Ex Machina than to Star Wars.Ironically the movie makes you think that it's about AI, while the title is exactly honest. I don't want to copy what has been already written, but I agree with almost all insights of user rmmil (you can find his review on imdb). The only thing I don't quite agree with is that the protagonist invented the Archive - I can't find any clues in the movie that thats actually the case (perhaps I need to rewatch).I'm giving this movie 10/10 because it's brilliant and haven't compromise on any aspect even though it didn't excite me as much as Transcendence did. In contrast Transcendence embodied some of the deepest truths about intelligence, but then decided to go for a remarkably stupid ending of we humans win even though we would have exactly 0% chance."}, {"id": 249, "text": "To start off, I think that to really, fully appreciate this film, one has to be quite familiar or even better a fan of Japanese anime. The scenery, the flow of the film, the background music, the atmosphere, the set, and just the film in general reminded me quite a lot of my favorite anime flicks. Also while watching this film, I was reminded of various other works that to me seemed to have influenced this film, most notably being the original Solaris film made in the Soviet Union, the Ghost in the Shell anime series, the Ex Machina film, and even the Half-Life video game.Without giving away any spoilers, a good metaphor for this film is like watching a long magic/illusionist trick evolving right in front of your eyes. After watching this film, you will see why.The story is very well written and leaves so much to think about after the movie finishes. This is always a sign of a good film when one continues thinking about it afterwards instead of just forgetting about it.My negative critique of the film is quite minimal, so I won't write about it here but instead let the viewers decide for themselves. This film is really a journey to be appreciated and I'd go further to say that pretty soon in the future these types of films will not be in the sci-fi genre anymore because so much of this is already becoming our reality.Just watch it!"}, {"id": 250, "text": "REVIEW - ARCHIVESomeone once said, from the day we are born there is only one thing we can be sure of, that is that some day we will die, but what if you could be saved in a hard drive somewhere and your loved ones could call you and speak to you?Would you?Could you?Interesting story, where a guy is working in a remote lab trying to download his wife into a robot he has made but also dealing with the 2 previous versions one brain wise aged 6 and the other brain aged wise at 16.Interesting film as it asks a lot of questions, how he treated these younger versions of the final robot, is commuicating with a dead loved one really a thing you would do and with a twist at the end that I only guessed just before the reveal because you are drawn into the whole world of the guys desperation of bringing his wife back in robot form.Confusing at times, especially why the calls had to stop but for me the most questioning aspect was can or should the whole concept of ringing in to speak to a past loved one even be commercialised and be run by big business?Good watch, interesting, though provoking.Rating 8 out of 10"}], "reviews_amount": 251}
