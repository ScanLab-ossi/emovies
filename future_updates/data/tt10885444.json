Firstly, writing isn't strong enough. They took the old school movie making style but couldn't develop any of the character like it used to be in 80s (Manmohan Desai's) movies. Secondly, It is a love story but there is hardly any chemistry between Ananya &amp; Ishaan. Thirdly, acting- Ishaan is a decent actor &amp; could have done a lot more better job, Ananya was obnoxious. I couldn't connect to her character even for 10 seconds. Jaydeep didn't had much to do, his character was also very underdeveloped but still managed to pull out something out of nothing. Comic sequences are forcefully inserted. Editing of the movie isn't either that great. The screenplay of the movie stands on half a dozen of flash backs.

Bollywood is obsessed with telugu - tamil movies that even their tv channels are ruled by dubbed south indian movies. Khaali Peeli follows the same template of those timepass flicks but to be honest it's not as bad as it looks.Khaali Peeli is the usual hero-heroine-villain chase with lots of guns,violence, and of course romance! If you're searching for something unique then this chase isn't for you.This bumpy ride moves at an uneven pace with a flat writing. Yash Kesarwani,Sima Agarwal duo's non-linear narrative confuses at most places but is unique especially the switching of timelines. The initial half of the film is a fun watch but sluggish presentation in the latter portion spoils the whole fun of this journey. Ishaan Khatter gets into the skin of the character smoothly and has given a noteworthy performance. He excels with his sizzling dance movies and is fierce in fight sequences. Ananya Pandey as the glam doll finds it hard to emote yet does a pretty decent job. Jaideep Ahlawat's baddie is nothing sort of different from those badly written commercial villains.Khaali Peeli offers some well choreographed action blocks which would have created more impact if explored well. Songs act as a speed breaker and are not worth remembering. You can expect all the cinematic clich\u00e9s in this old school popcorn entertainer. If you're into watching mindless formulaic entertainers then this debut venture of Maqbool Khan may impress you."}, {"id": 533, "text": "KHAALI PEELI (2020) : MOVIE REVIEW -There is something called typical notion about Masala Films that makes it generally below par even if the potential or actual results are better than criticism but it all goes in bucket when we as an audience get to see a perfect Masala Entertainer in all manners. Khaali Peeli came with Average expectations already therefore there was no burden on it to carry still somehow it manages to hold for 2 hours. That's a big win sarcastically. It was almost certain to end as a decent film irrespective of what kind of masala if offered but like said above, that typical notion spoils it big way.Khali Peeli is story of 2 Taporis (best word to express the 2 main characters), who were once a childhood sweethearts, meets each other under disastrous circumstances. One's escape is a trap for the other and other's escape is all together a different mess correspondent to the main villain of the show. The ending seems bit stretched and dragged because all the city side localism suddenly goes into Village to recall some dark memories of past.Ishaan Khattar seems to have found something of his own in Khaali Peeli. He as Blackie gets free hands to try on and certainly looks impressive because of realistic looks and accent. Ananya Panday as Pooja was neither impressive nor disappointing. The best outcome from the cast members is Jaideep Ahalawat who plays the main villian and the supporting cast is okay-okay. The script allows too many past stories and all are predictable hence it all looks repetitive and irritating especially in the climax when all of sudden it all travels 10 years back for the sake of emotional drama. Dialogues are fine, cinematography is average, editing is decent and Music is dull.Director Maqbool Khan is a new name in the game and definitely needs to learn a lot while completing a Film. It is just not about starting the film well, or pacing it well but it is more important to end it well. Khaali Peeli begins nicely and unexpectedly goes on smoothly without any big issues but then it fumbles towards the end. At one moment it felt like a surprising decent film untill the last 20 minutes went for some extra curricular activities away from the basic grounds of the film. Overall, a below average and almost ignorable film which might hold you for 2 hours but mostly gonna waste your time for the sake of nothing.RATING - 4/10*"}, {"id": 534, "text": "It doesn't matter if Ananya and Ishaan are nepotistic actors or not, it is clear, this is a great masala film! One of the best films I've seen. The storyline, the songs, and the acting of the players are amazing! Congratulations to Maqbool Khan, Ishaan Khattar and Ananya Panday for doing their job well.Maybe, Ananya did not show an outstanding performance when appearing in the films Student of the Year 2 and Pati Patni Aur Woh. But this time the girl was completely different! Ananya has improved in her acting part, although Ananya's dance is still a bit stiff, it is worth appreciating because she put in the effort. For Ishaan, he did his job well. His acting is really amazing. His dance moves really wow me.As for the song, the two songs from this film are truly extraordinary. The music is fresh and makes me dance! Good job for Mr Vishal Shekhar who has composed the music in this film wonderfully. I love Duniya Sharma Jayegi's song (and it will be my favorite forever!) This is the best film of Ananya Panday and also Ishaan Khattar. I can't stop thinking, how there are stupid people who boycott this film just for reasons that are not proven true. To the people reading this, I hope you will understand what I am saying, that Sushant died not because of nepotism in Bollywood. It had absolutely nothing to do with Sushant's ill-fated death. Don't blame nepotism. Because you are the ones who make them successful, so that (maybe) hinder Sushant's career. You have brains, and please, make the best use of that gift from God.I guess this is all I can say. I don't know what else to say. And I hope Sushant's silly fans can understand what I'm saying."}], "reviews_amount": 535}
