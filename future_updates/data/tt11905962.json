Could this be one of those films that have stopped coming from big studios a long time ago? Could this be a decent, well-made and thought provoking story in an interesting setting with great visuals and acting? In 2020?Well, yes! Leave it to the Russians to bring some loving Sci-Fi back. Set in an intriguingly nostalgic feeling USSR of the 80s, Sputnik is a slow-paced, but increasingly intense story that manages to make you think a bit.

It captures the atmosphere of Russian military and alien amazingly. Yes, the relationship and motive between two main characters is debatable and feel unrealistic.

It's like seeing those movies of the 80's or 90's that still weren't that formulaic and doesn't try either to lecture you on morals or is totally devoid of any moral standing. The pace is slow but not boring (something American movies have lost the ability to keep) and the story evolves naturally and never fails to its own logic (there is no you gotta be kidding me moment as it all matches and fits without foolishness or absurdity, given the preset premises).

Ridley Scott's Alien is the one that most compares with this film. The other is the 2017 film Life. This movie is about an alien parasite that impregnates and uses its host as a literal space-suit so-to-speak. The movie also questions the fact whether the organism is a parasite or a symbiotic organism.Plot: A pair of Russian cosmonauts return back to Earth on account of their spacecraft malfunctions. One of them is critically injured and barely kept alive, while the other is miraculously unscathed. Both of them are kept in an isolated military facility, where Dr. Tatyana Klimova, a young psychiatrists under review for her controversial approaches, is brought, recruited by the officer in charge, Colonel Semiradov. Soon the doctor will learn the terrible truth of what happened onboard the spacecraft...Egor Abramenko makes his directorial debut and he has done a fine job. I am sure he will improve vastly with more films given to him. The cinematography, background music and acting is top-notch. The C.G.I. special effects are also very good. Horror and Sci-fi fans will not be disappointed here. The only problem with these C.G.I. effects I see nowadays is that they are executed to fast and the viewer not given time to digest.But overall, the flaws of the film are minor and the good points outweigh the bad. The movie is an original concept and I loved watching every minute of it. There are many Hollywood movies I have seen where my mind wonders away from the screen to something else.

It kept me glued the whole time, everything is done so well and meticulously thought out. Story wise, nothing seems out of place, everything is explained in a plausible scientific way. It felt fresh and original, although it has some similarities with a couple movies I've seen before. The USSR atmosphere, the horror/mystery aspects are portraied pretty well, but they're not the main attraction. The gem of this movie is the main protagonist, Tatyana. She felt like an effortless marriage between Eleanor Arroway (Contact) and Louise Banks (Arrival). Very practical, smart, stoic and effective, with a lot of emotion and care. She grabbed my attention with every word she spoke, and all the actions she was taking. The acting from the main cast is very good as well, found only one weak link but they redeem themselves close to the end. Very tight and interesting script, great cast and writing, amazing original soundtrack. A strong 9/10 for a international mystery/thriller and a solid 10 for a Russian made movie."}, {"id": 11, "text": "The astronaut - alien parasite theme has been explored with mostly disastrous results by Hollywood.

The first hour is indeed full of suspense as we are slowly told what creature is in Vyshnyakov' s body and how they coexist or try breaking the bond.

I usually can predict a sci fi plot, and a typical American sci fi will eventually have a predictable plot outside of the rare few very good ones, like Interstellar, Annihilation, Ex Machina, etc. This was not predictable and was not a typical horror film, either.

I can never watch a Russian film without having the sense that I'm missing something; that the director is also communicating a deeper message through metaphors, hence why many Russian films stay 'inside me' for a long time after I have watched them. I did wonder if the alien represented the old 1980's soviet communist state that Russians grew up with inside them and would identify themselves with although it was actually alien to them: a symbiotic relationship that ended, disastrously in many cases for both when communist Russia died.

I assume the Soviet era was chosen to minimize the mix of modern tech. Everything i read about the 80s in Russia makes sense why they would choose military for the movie and hope of superiority: Brink of Star War, Cold War, and the big mess in Afghanistan.Well done, good job!

Russians dare to go a bit further by starting on the second stage in similar kind of movies. We all have to thank them for it.

There's a great build up to a fantastic finale as well that serves as a nice payoff for those slower times. For the most part though, this is a very well shot, well acted, and well scored new entry into the alien genre. I was thoroughly impressed with how crisp and fluid the cgi on the creature was.

Excuse some of the misogynistic themes ahead. I didn't make the film, I'm only trying to analyse it ;-) The return from space was the birth process including the way the alien (representing his mother's will) kills his brother who represents his free-willed alter ego. The conversation in the shuttle showed the protagonist has some kind of troubled life while the partner, who ends up dead on arrival, is a happy-go-lucky character without hang-ups. No fun allowed with a controlling mother around! So the father figure, played by the military officer who seeks out the psychiatrist, sets out to find a way to understand this mother-son conflict. He brings in no less than a very attractive young woman to present a way forward for the 'son.' Upon the first meeting between the young woman and the alien-mother, there is an immediate wary respect. They recognise in each other a fair rival for the protagonist's life and love. They continue to study and circle each other. Finally when the woman goes to meet the alien-mother, it strikes out at her and wounds her. Such is meeting the in-laws in some families ;-) I could go on. There's a lot to say on this. Including how the father-figure wants to harness the power of the mother for destructive purposes. But to get to the point, we find that the alien-mother and the hero-son are so totally entwined that he will not survive without her. The young woman determines that separating him from her is the only way to save him. Eventually she tries this and he 'kills' himself to destroy the alien-mother and its hold on him. In the final scene we see her collect the hero's progeny (son) from an orphanage. This represents her final rescue of the hero-son and starting a new life with him as his new independent free-willed self. The question left for me is what she will become in time. A new mother-figure? Ok, enough. It was a very interesting film. I hope you enjoyed it too."}, {"id": 47, "text": "Hard to believe this is the director's first feature.

Maybe to imply there is some sort of symbiotic link between him and the woman that he never met that suddenly shows up to adopt him? Who knows? The whole sub plot with the child could have been left out completely.On a different note, the acting is pretty good in this film in my opinion and the CGI work on the creature is right up there with some of the best and really sells it, but the valuable time spent shoehorning the kid into the story could have been spent that was very much needed."}, {"id": 57, "text": "It is a bit slow in some parts but an amazing movie.

The design looks like a combination of Calvin from Life and the Symbiotes from Stargate. I doubt any of the movies/shows I've mentioned directly influenced the writers or directors. The acting is good, it feels very Russian in the tone and mood they set.

Tarkovsky's SOLARIS (1972) and STALKER (1979) being notable genre classics.Now we have SPUTNIK, a 2020 movie set in the former Soviet Union of 1983. And its not half-bad.The plot is a re-tread of Nigel Kneale's seminal 1953 British T.V. serial THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT and later 1955 Hammer movie version THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT. In both serial and film, a space mission (British) goes horribly wrong when only one of the three astronauts returns to earth. He is one sick puppy, having been infected by an alien invader and gradually evolves into a murderous monster that must be destroyed.Sputnik-1 was the name given to the first artificial Earth satellite launched into orbit by the Soviet Union in 1957. Sputnik roughly translates into English as attendant, companion, travelling companion or fellow traveller.In SPUTNIK (the movie) something bad happens on a two-man space mission, and upon returning to earth there is only one survivor. He is one sick puppy, having been infected by an alien invader and gradually evolves into a murderous monster that must be destroyed. This time the alien invader can shrink itself down to live inside the astronaut, emerging when he sleeps to feed on cortisol drenched human brains. The astronaut is being held under armed guard at a military installation in Soviet controlled Kazakhstan, where the Colonel in charge recruits a female psychiatrist with an unorthodox approach to help in separating the alien from the man. His objective is to weaponise the alien - now where have we heard that before?Probably goes without saying, it does not end well.This film wears its influences prominently on its sleeve. Mostly, Quatermass and the Alien franchise. That said, if you can get past the feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - and they do leave weighty impressions, unfortunately - there is a fair degree to enjoy. Gorehounds are well-served with juicy blood splatter and bone crunching sound effects when the alien chows down. And the creature itself is pleasingly rendered in all its slimy, slithering semi-translucent glory, complete with high-pitched scream before it attacks.Performances are adequate, but personally I found I did not relate to or care about any of the characters in any significant way. Konstantin, the astronaut, does not seem all that tormented or concerned about his plight as such - more focussed on escaping to retrieve the son he abandoned to an orphanage. Quite how the kid would respond to being rescued by a father who has an unbreakable symbiotic relationship with a brain-eating alien doesn't appear to be an issue for consideration. Tatyana (the psychiatrist) suspects that if separated for any length of time, both host and alien will die, yet still perseveres in a faintly hare-brained way, and Semirov (the colonel in charge) is little more than a by-the-numbers military villain of the piece - cold, cruel and emotionally blank.It is a bleak little fable, well-made, nicely shot, with a lean and spartan feel to it. Fans of the genre could do worse. A lot worse. Just don't expect a classic."}, {"id": 73, "text": "It's a low budget monster thriller worth watching.

Overall, the characters seems real and are well acted onOn other technicalities: Good set design, good cinematography and sound design. Some anachronism, but it is 'possible' that the interior of the base is modeled on a fancy hotel from the era.

Why the attempted escape? Why the drive to separate the specimen when? Why attempt to do all this when it feels like an impossible to the viewer?it is because she had experienced something that is suppose to impossible before as a kid. A medical miracle to realize her dream to walk and run. That also explains what motivated her to attempt to cure cases deemed hopeless, by controversial means (the latest case of hers was adjudged by a committee hearing early on in the film).---critique on critique:some others has said that there is a love interest in this movie.

This time instead of just having random carnage like in a computer game (hint: Alien or Doom), there is an actual symbiotic relationship between the creature and his host, and this is explored (quasi) scientifically, and from several dramatic angles as well: something we're not used to from American movies which are nearly always very straight-forward and dumb with this theme.Sure, there are the usual military-wants-to-use-alien-as-weapon cliches, but at least for once it isn't the U.S. military but the Russian military - or to be more precise the Soviet one. This is set in 1983.Considering that Putin's tyrannical, mentally ill regime has a rather schizophrenic attitude toward the USSR, it was interesting to see how the USSR would be portrayed. It is portrayed as corrupt and inhuman, here at least. Perhaps the next Russian movie set in the USSR will be pro-Soviet? That would be in line with the afore-mentioned schizophrenia. This is assuming that Putin's censorship team is in full control of all scripts (i.e. scripts depend on their approval), which is a logical assumption in such a control-freakish 100% dictatorship such as the one in current Russia.I do have an issue about Oksana's common sense though. She is against feeding the creature with live prisoners. Considering that these prisoners are all child-killers (or similar scum), then not only is the decision justifiable but ingenious. What a great punishment to have such deviants fed to a head-crushing monster! Furthermore, Oksana wants to risk bringing the cosmo-nut into the civilian population, completely disregarding the havoc the monster could wreck there. She seems to believe that the life of one person is more worth than that of many. The hell?...Besides, the real Soviet Union wouldn't feed deviants to the monster, it would feed political prisoners to it. They'd actually recruit the deviants into the KGB. (The more intelligent deviants would become spies, the dumb ones would sweep the floors.) Could this be how Putin got recruited into the KGB? Did he slaughter children in a kindergarten? Just speculating...The writer wanted so badly for Oksana and the astronaut to escape the base but... well... escape from a top-secret Soviet military base would have been pretty much impossible, which is why the writer resorted to some rather flimsy, unconvincing plot-devices:1. Allowing the cosmo-nut to have more freedom made little sense. The creature was extremely dangerous and it may have been becoming more independent, or at least stronger, with time. Giving him new quarters was illogical.2. Allowing the cosmo-nut to mingle with Oksana outside - pretty much unsupervised as far as conversations go - made very little sense too.3. Oksana convincing the Nobel Prize hopeful doctor to help her - hence pretty much to seal his own fate - also seemed far-fetched.4. Oksana and the cosmo-nut being shot at by Soviet's elite forces at close range, yet missing her, was far-fetched.5. The jeep leaving the base: also not realistic.Still, despite the movies screenplay flaws the story is developed interestingly and fairly competently. The dialog isn't the kind of Mickey Mouse crap we get in American monster movies (whether 50s B-movies or recent big-budget: not much difference there). That Oksana falls for the astro-nut is a bit too convenient for the writer, but I guess he needed certain things to play out the way he'd intended.A slick movie, but with a better written, more logical first half. But then, isn't that nearly always the case in such movies? The resolution (in thrillers/horrors/mysteries) is usually where most of the nonsense occurs, when the logic falls apart i.e. is sacrificed to the needs of the story, but at least I wasn't bored with it. And none of the nonsense was too annoying or hugely stupid.The movie offers a unique situation, whereby the host of a body snatcher - in a way - takes part in cannibal behaviour (though not intentionally).

Indie Russian filmmakers mostly do other types of films and there are lots of great Russian films out there, like Durak (2014), Leviathan (2014), Zhit (2010), Zavod (2018) and many more.This film is not an exception in terms of Hollywood copy-pasting. Up to around 1 hr mark, they just copy scenes and concepts from popular films like Annihilation, Venom, Gravity (opening scene), Arrival, After Earth, and Alien Covenant. This is a common practice since sometimes they just straight-up rip off scripts and whole films like Nochnye strazhi (2016) (MIB rip-off with vampires), Den D (2008) (Commando scene-by-scene ripoff), Voin (2015) (a rip-off of Warrior (2011) and many, many more.They do this copy-paste pretty well, the cinematography is great, the 80ties Soviet-era setting works although they never really dive deep into it since this film was made for international release and most of the more complicated stuff just wouldn't be understood. In this film though they re-create those scenes not exactly knowing what they are meant to establish. Many scenes are supposed to be emotional but not in this film, they clearly misunderstood the tone of some of those since the music is heavily misused in this. Like the scene where the doctor is transported to the facility, which was taken from the Arrival, but they play military-style music which does not fit well into the delving into the unknown style of the scene, more like an action film build-up.Right around 1hr mark, they run of these and just start making their own stuff up, making really big stretches in terms of the script. Since the premise was a mix of other films they didn't really know where to go with this and thus, the film transformed into a mess of unbelievable scenes and random unnecessary subplots. Character motivation is completely dropped and all the things the characters do make absolutely no sense, nobody knows what and why they are doing.The kid subplot was so incredibly unnecessary and disconnected that removing it from the story would change absolutely nothing. I have absolutely no idea why it was even included (probably because of using this mix of ideas they didn't really know what genre the film is supposed to be, a sci-fi horror? a family drama? who knows).The ending is very messy and kind of defeats the purpose of most of the unmotivated character actions, which is a staple of these types of films.We will surely see more of these since foreign markets are very profitable, and since most of these big productions are co-funded by Fond Kino (Cinema Fund, Russian governmental organization), the creators are not really scared of losing money and are just trying to build up better visuals and more recognizable imagery to sell their product worldwide.Even though this film was quite a mess, I still want to give props to the filmmakers (one of which is the son of a great Soviet director Sergei Bondarchuk (the author of many great films and even an oscar-winning Voyna i mir (1966-67), who plays the commander in this one) for achieving a technical level of a good Hollywood production.Too bad they had no original concept or a general idea of what they are trying to show.Hope this review makes it easier for foreign viewers to understand and appreciate this film for what it is."}, {"id": 142, "text": "This movie starts off well enough with an intriguing, if a little slow account of the aftermath of a Russian space craft's return to earth. There is a good deal of suspense throughout the movie and its well acted and reasonably well directed. The problems stem from the failing plot that surfaces about an hour into the screenplay where the focus shifts from the extraterrestrial and scientific aspect of the events, to one of inter-Soviet self interest, coupled with professional ambition, deceit and posturing.This is all done fairly badly and is incongruous with the preceding story line. The result is a sudden and very disjointed feeling from what was a quite immersive film experience. I'm not sure why this was done, but I suspect it was a foolish attempt to add depth and dimension to a plot that really needed something quite spectacular to successfully bring it to conclusion given the topic at hand.Though this isn't Alien, or anything like a number of other titles involving extraterrestrial or extraordinary beings unwittingly coming to be present normal life, It is s subject that has been breached numerous occasions, and finding a unique path for development which is successful isn't always easy. Here, the plot becomes messy, the scenes and dialog delusive, and progression of the story becomes dependant and the characters making unrealistic decisions, poor choices, and atypical behaviour.I definitely liked it initially, but sadly I began rolling my eyes with the later developments and by the end I was fairly disappointed with what really should have been a good film.Old Hollywood films always had romance in them. It didn't matter if it was a Spy film, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Thriller or some other genre. There was always some romantic subplot thrown in for good measure. This movie had aspects of this dated approach included for reasons I can only guess, and the results made it feel stilted and hackneyed, especially because it was done so obtusely.I can't recommend it in all honesty, though I think a six is a fair enough score given it did have some good aspects."}, {"id": 143, "text": "I am happy to see that Russian scifi films are finally moving towards the Russian scifi literature that I loved so much as a child. This is a wonderful little gem, a Russian version of Life, but with more focus on the people and less on the special effects and action scenes. Not perfect, mind you, but so far the best Russian science fiction film I've seen them make recently. And the special effects were very good, too, which makes the decision to keep them in the background so much more laudable.The weakest link is the main character, unfortunately, who does things that make little sense for a scientist. Yet her contribution is not that of a character, but as a carrier of the audience, so what she does is really not that relevant.I hope Russian cinema will start bringing back the intellectual slow burn story, the civilian scientists that have to solve problems without relying on strength or weapons, but on their own thinking."}, {"id": 144, "text": "Cinematography (camera, pace, lighting, angles) is top-notch. Score is majestic and utterly suggestive of a dark, claustrophobic atmosphere and the sense of grappling with the unknown. Acting is good enough. However, the story goes nowhere really. The reach of the plot runs out at just over an hour, once the picture has become clear of what the situation is. From there on, it becomes nonsensical, as it lacks a credible motivation for the main characters' choices of course of action. There is also little reason behind a middle ranked army officer keeping all of this secret from headquarters. And the child subplot is rather superfluous and contributes nothing. The resolution of the story is hasty and fairly commonplace, a sign of the script having run out of original ideas.The film is, therefore, a mixed bag. Technically, it stands its ground very well against better and more expensive sci-fi productions from Hollywood . It is true that special effects and CGI are sparse here, but this film is not meant to tread the same roads as thinly-scripted, CGI-heavy, teen sensations like Transformers.

As derivative as the story IS, the storylines intersect on occasion of past alien host films, but they soon evolve into something beyond what you have seen before. Old world USSR political ideology, aliens seen as the future of super weaponry and power moves within controlling the host, the doctors involved with treatment and containment of the hosting astronaut along with his past trauma just make for a more interesting take on the genre.Ambiguity and mystery shroud the ending a bit, but a more than enjoyable neo-classic genre entry.My only complaint, and a mild one--- was the conceptual CG design of the creature, but the film was more than likely, not knowing the budget while reviewing this, constrained a bit---knowing this aligns more with arthouse than Hollywood blockbuster production scaled budget7.8/10Worth a look, Russian language film/subtitled in English"}, {"id": 149, "text": "There's a genuine sense of creeping dread in Sputnik.

Let me start by saying it only superifcally bears a resemblence. This is very much its own film. Its a slow burn sci fi, monster mash up, that's as much psychological, as it is literal.Does it work? Well, sort of. There's some moments of genuine tension and terror, as well as a sickening sense of what people are capable of doing to each other.

In fact, I hadn't even heard about the movie prior to actually sitting down to watch it.However, I must say that the movie's poster and cover was definitely interesting and served to lure me in.And I am glad that it did, because writers Oleg Malovichko and Andrei Zolotarev really put together a very enjoyable and entertaining movie. I liked the storyline and how it panned out. And truth be told, then there wasn't really a dull moment throughout the course of the almost 2 hours that the movie ran for.Don't let the fact that this is a Russian movie put you off, because you will definitely be missing out on an interesting movie if you opt to skip on it solely because of the language.I can't claim to be familiar with a single person on the cast list, and that is something that I enjoy. And I will say that they had a great ensemble of casted actors and actresses to portray the various roles and characters in the movie. And that definitely added to the overall enjoyment that is Sputnik.Normally sci-fi is not my go-to genre of movies, nor is it one that I actively avoid. But every now and again there are sci-fi movies that catch my interest and entertain me. And Sputnik was definitely one such movie.Right, well before I forget, then the special effects and CGI should be mentioned. Wow. Just wow. The special effects team and CGI team definitely knew what they were doing. And the alien creature looked really realistic - if there is such a thing to be said about aliens, if you believe in them or not. But color me impressed. It was really nice to look at with such great CGI effects.All in all, Sputnik turned out to be a great movie, and if you enjoy a darker sci-fi movie with elements of horror to it, then you should most certainly sit down to watch Sputnik. My rating of this 2020 movie is a solid seven out of ten stars. It is well worth the time, money and effort."}, {"id": 152, "text": "The criminally easy pitch for Sputnik is to assign the movie as Russia's Alien. Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece is inspiring, imitated and, most times, blatantly replicated, to borrow a word from another of Scott's resume. Fortunately, Sputnik is more inspirational work than a mere copy. Whereas Alien might bring more blood to the game, Sputnik counters with flesh, and all the emotions that come within.In these times of reboots and reimagines, Sputnik breeds nostalgia. More Stranger Things than slasher scare. More Starman philosophical than Predator rampage. And when the lights go out? As fun as Gremlins.The year is 1983 and Soviet cosmonaut Konstantin Veshnyakov (Pyotr Fyodorov) is a survivor of a strange encounter in space. Once back in the USSR, Veshnyakov learns he is host to a parasitic xenomorph that only comes out to feed at night. Soviet Russia, still engaged in a Cold War power play, seeks understanding with hopes of weaponizing the alien. A Russian doctor renowned for unorthodox procedures, however, wishes to save the man instead, politics be damned.Whereas the weaponizing plot is hardly original, first-time Russian director Egor Abramenko, with writers Oleg Malovichko and Andrei Zolotarev, uses that known factor to revisit a date in the past and inject it with modern day style. Similar to how the Duffer Brothers and JJ Abrams and Denis Villenueve have conquered known and familiar stories while making something unique, Abramenko mainlines on Gen X nostalgia and makes the clich\u00e9 sci-fi chase thriller a modern-day morality play. There are no shortcuts taken. The creature must eat.Or should it?Abramenko constructs a deceptively tight feel to his movie. In the sci-fi world where too much is never enough, Abramenko channels Hitchcock and masterfully restrains, builds pressure, awaits an inevitable explosion. Instead of a neo-spectrum of stars, he creates a Soviet utilitarian universe of concrete gray; of wood panels and analog devices. Sputnik looks and feels like a contemporary 21st century movie yet breathes Cold War complacency.A guarded Kazakh institute provides Earthbound claustrophobia replacing that of the Nostromo but the elements remain. Abramenko makes good use of those hallmarks of Eastern European war theater: the drab, twisting corridors and ever-vigilant security cams. Everything gives off a surface appearance of control. When that nighttime action does ramp up? Then fear assumes control. For Abramenko? Horror is cool.The story calls for three essential roles - the cosmonaut, the doctor, the colonel - all spot-on performances for basic, primary characters. Yet, each of them also seek to play savior. Veshnyakov wants to fulfil his role as hero for the Motherland. Tatyana's (Oksana Akinshina) desire, as a doctor, is to save the man. While Colonel Semiradov (Fedor Bondarchuk) plays all sides as father, friend, commander, and, possibly, a power broker.Aside from the occasional flashback or dropped hint, none of the characters are remarkably deep. Veshnyakov and Tatyana possess scars stemming from a lost childhood and empty parenthood. They form a friendship of sorts that, most mercifully, does not deviate into a carnal relationship. Remember, this is a sci-fi thriller. Russian stoicism is all that is required and here that is as plentiful as there are ushankas in Siberia.The creature F/X are a highlight. For a movie that delights in capturing a look from nearly 40 years back, the F/X are neither anachronistic nor dominating. The creature is believable, raw, and entirely physical. Likewise, the encapsulation of the facility is authentically practical.Sputnik revels in its classic inspiration while showcasing an accessible tale. The movie breaks away from genre tropes and highlights the drama between the three principals and their strange visitor from another planet. Language aside, Abramenko successfully delivers a universal movie where isolation and mystery and fear and acceptance are all shared emotions within the human experience. Sputnik, along with its American counterpart The Vast of Night, is a new class of sci-fi that re-opens those questions about life among the stars. Although those answers might not come easily, the question on whether Sputnik is a mere copy of Alien is conclusively answered with a nyet."}, {"id": 153, "text": "I hate that people are comparing this to Alien. This movie reminded me of Arrival in terms of atmosphere, pacing and theme. Alot of interpretations could be made regarding the Alien-Human symbiotic relationship, the theme of abandonment, adapting and fear going on.Oksana, the lead actress was the best part of the movie. Someone found her rigid, I thought she was very believable and nuanced.The cinematography and vfx are best features of this movie. There are some plot holes, unexplained things like the creature is sensitive to light, how did it survive in open space with blasting sun and radiation? And a few loose ends but the technical aspects make up for it.I would've liked the editing to compliment with the direction but it didn't. Tried to be fast paced in some places but lingered in other places. Background music and sound design are A grade.Must watch for those who liked movies like Arrival and Annihilation.Solid 7.5 / 10."}, {"id": 154, "text": "Thanks to Hollywood, we are really spoiled for choice when it comes to movies about alien arrivals, many of which result in scenes of death and destruction on an epic scale. With that in mind, director Egor Abramenko and writers Oleg Malovichko and Andrei Zolotarev should be praised for avoiding the urge to create another over-the-top shoot 'em up. Instead, Sputnik is a far deeper movie, and because of this, viewers who imagine this will be another man versus alien knock off, will be disappointed. My recommendation: go into this film with as few expectations as possible.Sputnik crafts a story that thematically explores love, family, what it means to be a hero, power, sacrifice, and the greater good. These are imbedded into the film's narrative, and treated competently. Unlike other alien films of recent years, where cheesy dialogue goes with it like peas and carrots, this Russian gem is intelligently written, with characters making decisions that are not only smart and logical, but make sense in regards to their character.The film is set in 1983. Konstantin Veshnyakov (Pyotr Fyodorov) and Kirill Averchenko (Aleksey Demidov) are cosmonauts, whose space module, that's returning them to Earth, is inexplicably hijacked. After Moscow loses contact with them, the pod mysteriously crashes in Soviet Kazakhstan. Enter Tatyana Klimova (Oksana Akinshina), a psychological professional, who is as brilliant as she is beautiful, and who is renowned for thinking outside the box to solve complex cases. Hired by a colonel named Semiradov (Fedor Bondarchuk), her task is to evaluate Konstantin, who is believed to be harboring something sinister from the missing hours in space.Characters are likable and well developed. Each has strong views and values, and the resulting conflict makes for a great back and forth between them, with equally believable chemistry. Even characters like the arrogant doctor, Yan Rigel (Anton Vasilev) have likable qualities, demonstrating that everything is both good and bad, an idea the film frequently postulates.Having similarities to movies like Alien and Life, yet developing its own unique interpretation of the genre, Sputnik is a film filled with terrific imagination. Despite occasionally resorting to telling the audience rather than showing, the explanations greatly assist us in having a perfect view of the complex situation. The pacing is really good, the feature slowly ratcheting up the evolving situation and tension, one event feeding into another.The orchestral score superbly adds to the film, the sometimes bombastic or eerie tones developing an unsettlingly ambience, though it can be surprisingly gentle at times too. The sound design, moreover, is just as effective, while the effects are phenomenally sublime. The movie is not bogged down by these, choosing to show us the creature in moderation, adding to the alien atmosphere. At the same time, the cinematography (example, shots of the steppes) is gorgeous to behold, while the set design tonally adds to the feature.The inclusion of a sub-plot about an orphaned child does feel a bit tacked on, considering we know more about the alien than we do about him, yet he becomes pivotal as the narrative progresses. Furthermore, the film does toy with a love story during its almost two-hour run-time. Despite there been scenes that subtlety explore this, this thread also needed further weaving to stand up to scrutiny.You can probably tell by now that I'm just nit-picking. As a creature-feature, Sputnik is delightfully entertaining in its design and execution, this aspect of the movie receiving the most attention and devotion. Sputink is a testament to the fact that diamonds can always be found, even in overdone film genres, and this Russian addition truly shines."}, {"id": 155, "text": "...became dull and cheesy at the last part.First, let me say one thing : the alien pictured in this movie looks like the Brain damage creature, Elmer. As it is a parasite/symbiote too, and seems to eat human brains as well. Nothing to do with an Alien because when the Alien exits an human being, it kills it. In Sputnik, that's not the case, as the alien can exits its human host, then goes back in it afterwards and so on.So, the story building is good, but no clues are given about what the alien wants.It looks to be bulletproof, can live in an human stomach, and can be fed with human brains. That's the story.However, this is going nowhere. I didn't understood where the writer wanted to lead me."}, {"id": 156, "text": "My feelings on this film get worse and worse each time I think about it but I think a 6/10 is fair for now. I really enjoyed the first half of this film a lot. The opening scene itself in space was beautifully shot and full of tension and the rest of that first half had some good character development and tension until we see what the creature is. After we see the creature for a little bit, the film took a harsh nosedive. Basically, I enjoyed this Russian boots on the ground version of Alien but after that first half, it wasn't doing anything for me. It become very dull and boring and the characters lost a lot of their motivation and become very dull. It turned into a B- action film with no tension at all until the film finally ended. I felt the film had some pretty good performances and was well shot for the most part. The one technical aspect I really enjoyed a lot was the music. It sounded great and worked well with most of the film even if it felt a little over dramatic at points.

Clearly a desirous attempt to incorporate discrete perspectives; doing so it lost its proposed way in transition.This being my entryway in 'Russian' filmography; I'm guilelessly astonished by the production quality they endured. The comprehensive look &amp; feel felt no different from Hollywood! In all seriousness, That's definitely a plus. Albeit the substratum is derived from the aforementioned Hollywood blockbuster. In other areas they wanted to make themselves distinguishable. Meanwhile; they messed it all up!The performances were reasonably competent, but an addled writing restrained their respective characters from further developing. An alluring cinematography; crafted with discernible expertise was indeed a pleasurable treat to the eyes! That soothing journey too hampered by an ordinarily composed soundscore. Indubitably unfitted corresponding to the specific ambience they created.Although the foremost Issue that I have is with the contrived execution as a whole. A befuddled resolution, result of blending more than two distinctive genres. It's a SciFi Horror right? They pointlessly tried to include social commentary in it. And that's not all; they did all they could to overly dramatize few sections of the script. Especially emotion heavy moments. All these concoction unable to bear satisfying results in the end.In conclusion, this was a fervent endeavour that sacrificed a conventional route in order to exhibit unparalleled outcome; but all their good intentions have fallen apart due to inept hands behind writing &amp; character development. Such a pity!"}, {"id": 158, "text": "'Sputnik', the name of the Russian science fiction film directed by Egor Abramenko, immediately brings to mind the period of the beginning of the space era six decades ago, and the technological and political competition between the two superpowers of the time - the United States and the Soviet Union. If in terms of launching the first satellites and sending the first people to space, the Soviet Union had for a time a considerable advance, in the parallel competition, that of science fiction films, there was no doubt that the Americans dominated permanently. And yet, there was also a tradition of films about space exploration made by Russian studios and directors, materialized in successful films like 'Planeta bur', and from this tradition, renewed in the recent decades, descends the film 'Sputnik'. Its sources of inspiration however are also space horror films like the 'Alien' series. The two lessons are well learned, and we are dealing with a well-made science fiction flick. The dose of originality, at least for the spectators less familiar with this geopolitical space, can be found not necessarily in the story itself but in the placement of the action in 1983, the last decade of existence of the Soviet Union. The context in this case matters.The hero of the film is Konstantin, a Soviet cosmonaut (Pyotr Fyodorov) who returns from a mission on the space station. Something happens during the maneuvers of re-entry into the atmosphere. Konstantin loses consciousness for a while, and when he wakes up on Earth he finds out that his mission partner has not survived. The story takes place in the Soviet Union in 1983, a time when bad news were not made public, and Konstantin instead of the expected hero reception he expected is placed isolation in a remote military base and subjected to a KGB-like investigation by colonel Semiradov (Fedor Bondarchuk) and his assistants. As the presence of a living extraterrestrial entity is suspected, psychologist Tatyana Klimova (Oksana Akinshina) is called for help. She is of course blonde, beautiful, and brings with her a baggage of her personal traumas. If the line of the story seems familiar to you from movies like 'Arrival', I think it's not a coincidence but a direct inspiration. What is different is the atmosphere of permanent surveillance, suspicion and terror in which all the heroes live. KGB methods were still in used in those years, people were still dominated by fear, and the heroes were more likely to find allies among aliens than among their human fellows. Political thriller is added to space horror and the mix works quite well.Oksana Akinshina succeeds to create a credible, beautiful, intelligent heroine, sensitive to psychological nuances, which can be added to the gallery of female heroes who are space researchers who at least on screens balance the gender inequality still existing in this field. But the most formidable role belongs to Fedor Bondarchuk, the son of Sergey Bondarchuk, the famous Soviet director of the second half of the last century, and himself a multilateral personality (actor, producer, director). Colonel Semiradov created by him is a 'bad guy' that gives shivers, acted realistically with maximum attention to detail, in the style of good Russian cinema. If this film had been made elsewhere, Max von Sydow could have been cast. The cinematography is reasonable, the special effects are not the most spectacular, but it's hard to imagine space monsters after 'Alien'. The excellent sets combine a scientific research center with a prison or a concentration camp. Egor Abramenko is in his first feature film, but 'Sputnik' doesn't look like a rookie movie at all. On the contrary, I think that the director demonstrates skill in handling the tools of the profession and applying the lessons learned from different sources. I hope that he will have the chance to receive some original scripts, or maybe he will write them himself in order to be able to develop his talent creatively."}, {"id": 159, "text": "This in an interesting one. It is a Russian scifi/horror movie. The IMDB blurb states: At the height of the Cold War, a Soviet spacecraft crash lands after a mission gone awry, leaving the commander as its only survivor. After a renowned Russian psychologist is brought in to evaluate the commander's mental state, it becomes clear that something dangerous may have come back to Earth with him. As a sci-fi lover I wasn't expecting much but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The story is nothing new. We have seen the same astronaut comes back to earth but brought something with countless time, so the storyline is definitely not unique. It is set in the early 1980's when the space race was still raging and returning astronauts seen as hero's. The only surviving cosmonaut of a Russian mission is kept against his will in a remote Russian scientific facility and he is told that it is to monitor his health prior to him being taken to Moscow for a lap of honour through the city streets. A controversial female scientist is called in to assist with the assessment but she soon realises all is not what it seems.The acting is very solid, the setting is bleak and communistic and the CGI is pretty impressive, not over the top but rather believable and realistic (considering this is a sci-fi). What the story lacks in originality it makes up for in believable and likeable (and unlikeable) characters. There are a few twists thrown in for good measure and these are done pretty well. They all caught me off-guard and added to the story positively.I really like foreign language films and Netflix have done well with several German, Polish, Korean and French sci-fi and horror titles recently. This is not a Netflix title though and the only complaint I have is that the English sub-text is sometimes so fast between shots that you barely get the opportunity of reading it all before it disappears.The world is quickly catching up to Hollywood. We are so used to all the big ticket movies coming from the US and it good to see foreign non-English movies getting more main stream airtime.Well worth a watch if you love sci-fi/horror."}, {"id": 160, "text": "I'm new to films with Russian culture.

I liked how the plot was simple and yet classic and believable. As a person who never misses block buster sci-fi films, this is way better than sci-fi counterparts in Hollywood who had higher budgets. The actors did great in portraying their roles.

Unfortunately it's the things that don't work that make the movie--and the alien-fall apart in its own logic.What'a great about Sputnik is its atmosphere. Every. single. shot. is perfectly structured to feel unsettling. The lighting and placement of certain objects and characters throughout the movie generate a sense of isolation and fear. It's visually gripping from beginning to end.That being said, a lot of the movie seems to reflect American sci-fi cinema in style, but it is devoid of any understanding as to WHY certain stylings are employed. Hence, a scene that's meant to be heartfelt falls flat because what's needed to make such an emotion work--i.e. tone, dialogue, direction, color pallet--is replaced by stylish nonsense, as if the filmmakers are just repeating what they've seen in better movies. In fact, now that I think about it, the whole movie feels cold and heartless, despite many honest attempts to pack some emotional punch.As much as I ultimately didn't like this movie, I've got to give credit where credit is due. The screenplay is amazing. You can tell the filmmakers really care about the characters because much thought went into crafting who they are, even if their motivations aren't always clear. The story makes several literal and metaphorical connections to the fearful nature of human beings, the early 1980s time period and Cold War isolationism, and the irony of what makes national heroes... heroes.Where Sputnik starts to show its cracks, I think, is in the logic, or lack thereof. There are things about the creature that aren't fully explained, so when it does certain supernatural feats we are left scratching are heads with no thought beyond, Well, at least it looked cool. Characters seem to flip-flop in their decision making, sometimes arriving at conclusions that don't make any sense at all.And I'm no professor of anything, but when I find myself arriving at solutions to problems that our supposedly highly-educated characters haven't come up with yet, then the movie has a problem. Audiences shouldn't be able to out-think a movie's heroes.Sputnik has what could be called a surprise ending, but I think most audiences will just find it confusing. Without getting too spoilery, it's an ending that seems to come out of nowhere and for no clear purpose, although it does reveal something interesting about one of the characters. Regardless, why the filmmakers felt we needed that little twist feels completely unnecessary. It doesn't play into the movie's A-plot, or even the B-plot, and therefore feels like you could totally remove it without impacting the movie at all.Ultimately, as cool as Sputnik looks, it just more sci-fi space junk."}, {"id": 163, "text": "A cosmonaut with an alien parasite inside of him (which periodically leaves his body) is contained in a research facility.

The creature is reminiscent of Prometheus' (2012) Hammerpede design. Nevertheless, it doesn't stop Sputnik being an effective claustrophobic alien horror.Thanks to director Egor Abramenko's gripping set pieces, gross-out gore and overall production values Sputnik its own legs. The serious dark and ominous tone elevates Sputnik, delivering a satisfying, gripping experience.Notable are lead actors Oksana Akinshina, Fyodor Bondarchuk and Pyotr Fyodorov. Oksana subtle performance is impressive, echoing the leads in The Thing (2011) and Underwater (2019).

And the unique take on the monster was refreshing.I highly recommend this movie if you are a fan of the outer space/monster genre- you wont be disappointed![7/10]"}, {"id": 165, "text": "A solid enough effort for a first time outing, Sputnik is a competently crafted chiller that at first takes a procedural approach to its space alien horror premise and was going quite well until it chose to discard all of that and head straightforward into the clich\u00e9d territory to finish as yet another serviceable entry that exhibited potential but lacked the conviction to embrace its ideas.Directed by Egor Abramenko in what's his directorial debut, the story brims with an undeniable sense of dread from its opening moments plus the Soviet-era backdrop only amplifies it further. The first half is as thrilling as it is engaging and exemplifies the secrecy, distrust &amp; corruption within the Soviet establishments with finesse. But as it enters the second half, things start to go downhill.On the plus side, the horror elements are handled with care and executed with flair. The setup is brilliant &amp; promising even if much of it is squandered for a predictable third act. Also helping the ride is the neat camerawork and steady pace while the fantastic score drives the action expertly from start to finish. Performances aren't compelling, for the characters aren't fleshed out and fail to earn our investment.Overall, Sputnik delivers the goods in sufficient doses but with more refinement, it could've catapulted itself to a much better height than what it eventually settles for. The plot teases with many concepts but instead of fully embracing them, it tends to hover on the sidelines. Even the bloody action is held back for no reason. Failing to realise what was up for grabs, this Russian sci-fi horror is effective at times but it is far from its finest version."}, {"id": 166, "text": "This was a film that I heard about earlier this year and since I'm a fan of sci-fi horror films, I was intrigued. The director was on a podcast and was interviewed, so that gave me some insight to the movie without spoiling it. This was one where I watched a sci-fi horror film as a Featured Review on Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast, so I thought this would pair up nicely. The synopsis here is the long survivor of an enigmatic spaceship incident hasn't returned back home alone - hiding inside his body is a dangerous creature.We start this movie off with a couple of cosmonauts in their shuttle back in what I believe to be 1986. The one that seems to be in charge is Konstantin Veshnyakov (Pyotr Fyodorov) and with him is Kirill Averchenko (Aleksey Demidov). They're singing songs as they prepare to disengage and return to Earth. They make a terrifying discovery when a shadow moves past the window and it sounds like something trying to get in. They then crash land in Kazakhstan. Averchenko is missing a portion of his head from what it looks like and Konstantin seems to have survived. His eyes look black though as he screams.It then takes over to Tatyana Klimova (Oksana Akinshina). She is brought before a board as she did a risky treatment on a patient. She is at risk at losing her position and from what I gather, the ability to perform medicine. All she has to do is admit her fault. She refuses to do so though. Watching this is Colonel Semiradov (Fedor Bondarchuk). After it is over, he approaches her about a top secret research that he wants her to participant in. She can say no, but he wants her to come with him to at least give her assessment.When she arrives in this remote location, Colonel Semiradov explains the reason for the isolation. We learn later is that they've given a cover story to the news. They claim that everything went good and that the two cosmonauts are being held for routine testing. Actually though, Konstantin came back with something else. In charge of the tests is Yan Rigel (Anton Vasilev). He doesn't really like Tatyana being there as he feels threatened. We see that she doesn't necessarily play by the rules and goes in to interview Konstantin, who is interested when he sees her. Her assessment is that he is dealing with PTSD and that she isn't needed here.Colonel Semiradov doesn't give her all the information. He brings her back that night and she sees more of the truth. There is a parasitic creature inside of him. It comes out every few nights and while it does, Konstantin goes into a coma. She changes her mind and decides to stay. Her goal is to separate the two, but the more she looks into it, it might be less of a parasite and more of a symbiotic relationship. There is also more that Colonel Semiradov isn't sharing as well.To take this to my thoughts on the movie itself, we have an interesting set up here. Part of the interview was stating why they decided to set it in the 1980's. One easy thing is the technology is a bit easier to use here, but we also are putting this in the Soviet Union. I really got vibes of Citizen X here with how ineffective the government was working and the lies that are being fed to keep it a secret. Colonel Semiradov also being a military man is looking toward weaponizing this creature. This shouldn't be a shock with things like Alien and being this is ight in the middle of the Cold War/arms race.Going from here though, I like the characters we are working with. We don't necessarily always know what to believe. Tatyana will say or reveal things to get a reaction out of people. She is quite smart though and dead on a lot of the times though as well. She is brought here since she did this radical treatment. Colonel Semiradov knows if anyone can solve what to do here, it is her. I'm glad to see they went with a woman for this role as well. The Colonel is an interesting character too. He really seems to embody the Soviet mentality with only revealing what he feels needs to be known. He's a cold, calculating man and it works. There is also Yan, who is only looking out for himself. He never does anything unless he can see the benefit to be gained. Tatyana sees this and can manipulate him. What I will say, Yan starts out as a jerk and I like where he ends up.Another character I really need to break down is Konstantin. He is selected by this creature and the movie gives us some interesting reasons why. The major one I see is his will to survive. He has a mother that without him has no one. He might also have a son that he may or may not know about that is in an orphanage. Tatyana and him have interesting back and forth conversations where you don't always know what is real and what's not. There could also be a medical reason which I'll shift over to next.Moving next to the creature, from what I remember I think they went practical as much as they could. I still feel there probably is CGI here, but it is pretty seamless. I will give a slight spoiler here, this alien creature eats humans. The movie gets a bit more specific, it is creepy that it wants us to be scared of it before it eats us. There is a certain chemical it needs and something here comes into play why Konstantin was chosen over Averchenko. I'm also a fan of the comic book character of Venom. This entity is similar in that it creates a symbiotic relationship with Konstantin.Aside from the creature effects, I think that this movie is shot very well. I've already said I liked the time period it is set. It does feel like that with the technology. What I will also give credit there is that it does have a timeless feel to it as well. That is something that bodes with since it is ramming down our throats the era it is set.Since I've broken down the characters, I'll give my thoughts on the acting next. Akinshina I think is really good here as our lead. I like the character she portrayed and I think she fits it well. Bondarchuk is the same. He is a villain without being one the whole time. For a good portion it feels like he's adhering to the rules of his country, but we also see that he needs the control. Fyodorov has a good look for this cosmonaut and his performance was good as well. He's another one that feels like a villain at times, but the movie did a great job in humanizing him. Vasilev works well as this weasel guy while also having good growth to here he ends up. Demidov and the rest of the cast I thought rounded this out for what was needed.Quickly I wanted to go over the soundtrack. I really like how epic this soundtrack sounds. For me, it really feels like something you'd feel inside if you learned an alien like this existed. It is good that it really for the more exciting scenes we get this type of music to really help build that feeling up. Aside from that, I think the score fits for what they needed.If I did have a gripe and I feel like I've been saying it a lot lately. This movie does feel like it runs a bit long. There are aspects that we do need. The scientific process needs to be there and that works for me to learn more about this creature. The problem is that I don't know if we need 113 minute runtime. It takes awhile after the initial shock of seeing the monster until the climax that even around 10 minutes being cut would have made this run tighter for me.So now with that said, I really enjoyed this movie. I'm a fan of these sci-fi horror movies and I like setting this in the past without beating us over the head with it. It really makes a lot of sense for a Russian movie like this being that it would have been the Soviet Union with their strict rules there. The acting is strong across the board. I really like the concepts this movie is exploring with learning about this creature and the more we do, the more horrific it becomes. The effects were on point and I think the soundtrack for the exciting scenes are as well. If I do have a gripe, it is just a bit too long and it bogged down a bit in the middle. With that said though I still found this to be a good movie overall and worth a viewing. What I will warn you though, I watched it in Russian with the subtitles on. If that is a problem, I would avoid this."}, {"id": 167, "text": "Hi. So I finally was able to watch this movie last night, of all places in Hulu, which I'm liking more and more, in spite of the ads. What can I say? Can't really afford ad-free, for now. Well, actually my wife won't approve, because we're also paying for Netflix. But back to Hulu, it has good shows and movies, including The X Files. Incidentally, this review was in no way sponsored by them. Oh yeah, Sputnik, the movie. I digressed there for bit, sort of intentionally, because it's what I kind of did last night after the first 2 acts. I liked the setup, and thought it was a clever idea. Almost an actual X file. I always enjoy movies showing smart, professional people just doing their jobs, and actually being good at it. For me that was both the psychiatrist and the military boss who recruited her. But then there was a point in which the third act lost me a bit. Which in part might be because of something I missed. I was just reading another review in here explaining something about the end, involving a child in an orphanage, which I completely missed. I guess I'm not as smart as these Russians. Plus I was bit tired and dozed off for times. I do have good memory for actors, and as soon as I saw the gorgeous psychiatrist lady, I knew it was the girl from the end of one of those Bourne movies. You know, when he breaks in to her house and tells her he killed her parents. The actress has a sort of melancholy to her in both movies. Heck, I'm right now thinking it could be the same character. But Bourne doesn't show up. And neither do Mulder and Scully. Anyway. even though I don't know much about the technical aspects of movie making and am in no way a movie critic, I can say that this movie looks good, and has good production values, like they say in Super 8.

It borrows heavily from two masterpieces - Alien and Arrival - its not as great as those for sure, but i really liked Sputnik on its own - and the ending was very haunting + soundtrack was superb."}, {"id": 169, "text": "Watched this as an original with subtitles and throughly enjoyed this title, granted the the subplot was a bit weak, but I guess part of this was a clumsy telling of who's the bigger monster, the Human or creature?With just under a 2 hour run time, sputnik disn't bore me, nor did I have th eurge to do something inbetween, as the intertia of the tale kept me interested all the way through, even though as in all movies some stupid decisions were made, but if everybody thought properly, then we wouldn't have these stories I guess.If you enjoy Sci fi creature movies, then this is for you and it makes a refreshing change to see something other than the cliched Hollywood efforts that get churned out at an alarming rate.Creature effects are very good and the 80's post cold war setting adds to the bleak atmosphere of this film.This movie got an 8/10 from me, as it's great to see Russian cinema provide us with some valid alternatives to the normal diet of run of the mill junk we're bombarded with and I'm hoping that more Russian Sci fi hits our screens soon...can't wait!!"}, {"id": 170, "text": "This is my first venture into Russian films and I must say that I was very very impressed by this film. If this is the standard of filmmaking in that country then I think I'm gonna be watching a lot more Russian films.I would also like to say that as an Englishman, I don't speak or understand Russian and watched the film with subtitles. Even with that I still found the experience very emotional and moving, found it very easy to engage into the story and the characters. I know that foreign language films can be daunting to some people, who find reading the subtitles distracting, trust me you will be so invested into the film that it won't become a problem.I would comment on the cast however as I don't know any of them I will just say this, they were all very good in there respective roles. If I was going to give a shoutout to any of them I think it would be Oksana Akinshina who played the lead role and I thought she was very good. She is almost plays the character of the audience in the film in stages, we are exposed to things for the first time just like she is. All round pretty solid!!The areas of the film that impressed me most are Directing, Cinematography, Score and Production Design. Firstly the directing in this film is flawless from start to finish, combined with some gorgeous cinematography this film really is a feast for the eyes. I love the fact that the film is set in 80's Soviet Union, its always interesting to see how that era is played out on film and adds another dimension to the story. Last but not least is the score which is as haunting as the creature itself is, gave me chills.......its that good !!!!!Overall I really enjoyed this film however I do have a bias for Science Fiction films, especially ones that aren't run of the mill and take some risks. I love the horror elements added into the film, has some of the most nerve-racking and on edge moments I've seen in film for a while. Fantastic work !!!! 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 !! Please please don't be put off by the fact its not in English because it is well worth your time !!! It has everything you could want in a modern Sci-Fi / Horror !!!!!"}, {"id": 171, "text": "Sputnik Micro Review -Comrades! Sputnik is a new Russian Sci-Fi horror film that tells the story of the mystery behind a crashed Cosmonaut in 1983. While Sputnik in the United States is known as the first manufactured object launched into space by the Soviets, the meaning of the word Sputnik translates as a travelling companion. This distinction is incredibly important in the understanding of the film's theme as an International Film playing to a United States audience - the role of internalized fear on personal choice.Sputnik is quick to show the creature which is incredibly well done. The Soviet 1983 setting is a purposeful choice intended to play the creature horror genre against a backdrop of recent real-life nationalized based horror. The film uses its creature fantastically in this analogy. Although for the purpose of this theme the film does make several convoluted plot choices for the sake of progressing the story. Specifically, in how the Cosmonaut is not under 24/7 video monitoring?Sputnik is probably not the film for someone who is not already interested in Sci-Fi horror. I do not see this as a good gateway film. But despite the few larger leaps of contrivances, I had a fun time with the film. I am extremely excited to see what writer-director Egor Abramenko creates next."}], "reviews_amount": 172}
