Although, I felt there were certain loopholes in the movie. Nawazuddin Siddiqui's son in the movie is considered a genius and a lot of people believe this to be true. It's shown that the boy merely memorises stuff with the help of his father and pretends to be intelligent. Once it's shown that when the boy was asked by his friend to solve a basic addition problem, he couldn't do so. How's it possible to proprogate that someone is a true genius when he can't even solve basic math stuff? Isn't that easy to catch? How would you escape many situations that arise? It's shown that this is going on from 3-4 years and nobody has caught the boy."}, {"id": 7, "text": "As usual Nawazuddin Siddiqui did really good job and the child's acting was mind blowing.

All Star Cast Their character perfectly played, No Doubt. If you watch Something different with no expectation then this movie you never disappointed but you watch with expectation then I'll not guaranteed you'll like it or not.

How a father decides to make his child a genius and take away where it all comes to the charm and glory but, can a child take that pressure? well, you will see how beautifully is that thing presented in the Serious Men by the amazing performance of Nawazuddin Siddiqui and the child artist Akshath Das in the lead roles with an amazing direction by Sudhir Mishra.not just the lead roles, but all the performances are up to the mark and we see a brilliant camera work with amazing camera placement and focus game at several places. Dialogues are pretty good and suit with the characters, but it may create a problem watching a content related to a kid with abusive language in it, although it brings a sense of comic touch in between.Basically, there is already a lot of cinema that has been made on the topic that Serious Men mainly deals with, but it comes with a new touch and with a new environment taking caste, jealousy, and things like that along with it."}, {"id": 66, "text": "Nawazuddin never disappoints and he shines bright once again in this funny and poignant film. His son is just adorable. The film is a great tribute to the book and the director has done it justice. The story is simple: a lower caste man who is mistreated at work every single day, decides he will not allow this ruthless, judgemental and prejudiced world to mistreat his son. He fights to get basic respect in a very prestigious space project office. At his humble abode, he teaches his son to memorize facts to portray himself as a child genius. It's an emotional ending with the little boy having a breakdown which is punishment enough for Nawaz as his father. His son comes first and anyone who suggests that he was in it for the money is wrong. Anyone who also suggests that the message that you should make your way in the world through fraud is also wrong. The message is clear: India's caste system is a disgrace to the nation and despite laws to suggest there should never be discrimination based on caste, it happens even today in every walk of life.

The writer-director has created an exit strategy for Ayyan and Adi.But consider that this is not the end of the fight of the fighters for their rights because the status has no connection to the IQ and the talent also has no color (black or blonde).Some of the film's dialogues are quite effective. At the same time, some scenes between Nawazuddin and Akshat touch the heart.The film starts off with satire and then becomes poignant and then poignant.The film based on the book slows down considerably in many parts. The main characters have been given a lot of time to set up, which makes it a bit bored and impacts the storyline.Films on social bias and discrimination have been made for years, but 'Serial Men' makes its characters different.As a father, Nawazuddin Siddiqui appears to be the best, while the strong side of the film has emerged as Akshat Das in the role of his son.He walks shoulder to shoulder with Nawazuddin in every scene.Nasser is perfect in his character.But, the director has given very little space to a good actress like Shweta Basu Prasad.Apart from caste discrimination, 'Serious Men' made under the direction of Sudhir Mishra touches on topics like inequality, lack, corruption, politics. Director Sudhir Mishra has tried to put it in an easy way.The message of Netflix Serious Men is very important for making a serious and social taunt, but it is served that way easily."}, {"id": 101, "text": "Nawazuddin Siddiqui is one of the best actors working in the Hindi film industry. He's done so many interesting films and Serious Men is no different.Serious Men follows Ayyan Mani, an underprivileged man who decides to make his son a genius. However, he'll soon find out that his method is slowly destroying his son.Serious Men is a film that may linger on people's minds for some time. It's a film that a lot of people can relate to. Adapted from the novel by Manu Joseph, Serious Men explores the desperation and want to have a better life and how caste and class plays a factor into your societal status. A great aspect is the writing. The characters interact in a natural way and its commentary on society doesn't come across as preachy. Having four writers on a film can be scary as there may be a clash of ideas but Abhijeet Khuman, Bhavesh Mandalia, Nikhil Nair and Niren Bhatt all collaborated really well with each other and made a script that was thought-provoking and engaging. There are parts of the story which I did question because it seemed a tad unbelievable but otherwise I didn't have much of a problem with it. The cinematography is handled really well and Sudhir Mishra's direction was well done.The performances really shine in this film. Nawazuddin Siddiqui once again does a great job here. Ayyan is a very intriguing character that has many layers to him and Siddiqui plays him to a tee. Nassar, as the intelligent but arrogant Dr. Arvind Acharya, plays his character well. Indira Tiwari also does a good job playing Siddiqui's wife. I've always been sceptical about child performances but Aakshath Das was truly great. He conveyed the smart and confused nature of Adi well and I hope to see more of him in the future.Serious Men is definitely one of the better Hindi films I've seen this year. It has a fascinating premise and an interesting take on society that is sure to make you think."}, {"id": 102, "text": "The kid (Aakshath Das) shines in Serious Men, a social drama that reminded me of Malayalam comedy Salt Mango Tree (2015), and which is more about the stress that children feel at the hands of their ambitious and competitive guardians and less about class divide despite the montages that show otherwise. Here, the kid's father (Nawazuddin SIddiqui), hailing from a backward caste and having an antagonistic view of the world, uses the caste card and his child to aim for the stars, garnering applause and hollow fame on the way. But for what? Serious Men goes on to throw social commentary at you on how the rich and the influential act as parasites on the downtrodden with ample amounts of quirky humour and useless fillers. But, notably, it also gives you a peek into the ill effects of over ambition, giving a spine-tingling climax to an otherwise humdrum proceedings. Siddiqui, Indira Tiwari, and Nasser are all well-directed by Sudhir Mishra, who has finally had a good comeback since Yeh Saali Zindagi (2011). If you are not ready to accept what Serious Men tells, and not preaches, you, this will be a fine afternoon affair. A better watch to parents with young kids.

The movie on one side focuses on a High IQ child prodigy, who seems to blessed with natural intelligence and inquest while the other side parallels the games played by individuals from all the strata of society to get what they want. The whole premise tends to reach a boiling point when the core sub-plot unfolds sometime in the middle.Gradually though, despite the humour in the situations portrayed, especially in the satirical take on corruption that knows no social barriers, and despite the entertaining audacity of abundant strategies, the film reveals its hollow centre, only to pick itself up in the last 20 minutes with a liberal dose of practicality.Nawazuddin Siddiqui is at is usual best in his portrayal of a Ayyan Mani. Indira Tiwari and little Aakshath Das do their parts well. Nassar as Dr. Acharya a shrewd, no nonsense arrogant director of a government-run scientific research institute excels the most. Director Sudhir Mishra tries to put in too many punches but only a handful land on where it is intended. Adapted screenplay may not have done enough justice to a good story. Cinematography, casting, music, costumes and production design were decent. Make up was a little over done.Overall, not a perfect movie but Serious men is funny and poignant in equal parts, it's a mix of complexities that exist around us and the state of affairs that we live in and ignore. Watch it for Nawaz who yet again proves that he has the ability to play wide range of characters convincingly. It is high time that parents in India stop using their children as insurance policy for their future."}, {"id": 104, "text": "Reality TV shows in India figured out their way to an audience and emotional jackpot along the way. Their contestants, when it all began, came from the 'burbs and upper-middle class. Be it a dance or singing competition, or a mega quiz show, the spectrum of participants was limited to our view of plurality: PLU (people like us). But somewhere along the line, some smart TV exec cracked the code: reserve a quota for that cleaved societal lower base whose raison d'\u00eatre is to struggle to make it through the end of the day to garner sustenance on the family plate and haul their weary bones to begin again the next day. Suddenly our screens - and eyes - were flooded with the vision of what lay beneath our comfy, insulated lives. Sacrifices, shattered dreams, and tragedy, all rolled into before or after a song as judges sniffled, hitting the buzzer to open the gates for these talented, hitherto unseen strugglers into the next round. The TV channels grabbed eyeballs which in turn grabbed hankies, and we sobbed as the channels sprinted their way to the bank.That such reality shows, albeit in an inverted avatar, play out in everyday lives is brought to the fore like a tight, smart, and smarting slap in director Sudhir Mishra's 'Serious Men'. Based on Manu Joseph's novel and written by Abhijeet Khuman, Bhavesh Mandalia, Nikhil Nair, and Niren Bhatt, the movie opens to Ayyan Mani (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) conceiving, with his wife Oja (Indira Tiwari), of the next-gen, even as his voice-over sets the context for what'll be its encompassing arch: the exploitation, discrimination, and deep-rooted systemic structure and politics of caste. Ayyan's a personal assistant to arrogant scientist and director Arvind Acharya at the National Institute of Fundamental Research (NIFR, and a snook at the hierarchies in TIFR and other such hallowed research institutes ?) -Nassar, superb, bringing the upper caste superiority to his act and demeanor, his character's knowledge as deep as his shallow understanding and treatment of his assistant and anyone else who's below him: in rank and caste. For him, that's a spin to his own demarcated caste system.Full of smarts and blink-and-you-miss satire: Ayyan tampering with a quote on reservation attributed to Arivunambi Ghatak - melding a Tamilian name with that of a famous Bengali filmmaker - replacing that fusion noun with a famous economist, it's a sly dig at manipulating the narration. And that's precisely what Ayyan is good at. Controlling the narrative. And it is this street-smart talent that Ayyan brings into play for his own son Adi Mani (Aakshath Das) to beat the system that's jailed him in a slum dwelling all his life, which he wants to break free from for Adi's sake.It is this manipulative streak that's a terrific spotlight on the very nature of our societal system and parenting choices. Aspirational parents create their own reality shows, pushing their children into a circus that's a hamster on the wheel cable TV. Plus, if you're born into a lower caste section - Dalit, in Ayyan and his family's instance - the die's loaded with equipollent and opposite force. There's reservation that'll get you a job as the one Ayyan has, but Ayyan wants more out of life for his family and himself. And helping him achieve that is his half-crust of phrases that he's acquired from being a fly-on-the-wall in NIFR, listening to Acharya's rants and ravings about gravity, space, and alien microbes. In a delicious touch of irony, anything that Ayyan says that's closely related to science is dipped in arrogance and disdain for his listeners - be it his colleagues, wife, son, or us. That's thanks to the pejorative boss he reports to. In another satirical bite that leaves its marks on Ayyan and his family is that in his warped system, chucking away humility and carrying the bag of brashness is the way to survive and beat back the naysayers. And that high-handed tone exactly what Adi picks on.In forwarding his dispersed quotes and knowledge to the unknowing and wanting, Ayyan props Adi as a prodigy that quickly grabs the attention of the local Dalit politician Keshav Dhavre and his educated-abroad daughter Anuja (Sanjay Navrekar and Shweta Basu Prasad, both terrific) who set in spin their own system-within-system game. That Anuja has her own past trauma gives her the strength to wield a stick with brute force is another insight into director Mishra's character spin.As the politics at the NIFR (Acharya's run-in with his b\u00eate noire, Namboodari, played by Uday Mahesh, is the tipping point for all), the slum, and between Ayyan and Adi and the politicos begin to get intertwined, Manu Joseph's sparkling clarity that's evident in his columns bubbles like good champagne, rising to meet you and then delivering a swimmingly spritzy experience. That India's brightest and mature minds aren't insulated from deceit and shenanigans (Vidhi Chitalia as Oparna Sengupta the smart, younger shoulder for Nassar's Acharya, playing her role in another discriminatory gender system that runs parallel or superimposed on the caste track - and that's not the only time the movie looks at women's stories; the other one involves money, greed, and exploited women), and that who they inspire awe and hate in equal measure in, follow the same path, points to director Mishra's never-ending mirrors within mirrors structure.'Serious Men' cloaks itself in quick-footed dialogues with doses of cynicism, Karel Anton\u00edn's thoughtful score, and Alexander Surkala's quietly framed cinematography; and then, come the tipping point, breaks your heart as its machinations rip asunder tender minds and hearts, and the rot of rote and educational fraud spills out of its guts. Aakshath Das as Adi is top-notch, the actor carrying the burden of his character with all the strength of an overloaded, tearing-at-the-seams schoolbag. And when he breaks, he opens a flood of anxiety and concern inside of you. Indira Tiwari as Oja is beautifully raw and uninhibited in her act, making her character an integral part of the story, even if she isn't part of the mainframe.The cast is superb all around (casting director Mukesh Chhabra gets it pin-point accurate), but Nawazuddin Siddiqui shows why he is, in such projects, the last man standing after Irrfan Khan's untimely exit. Absolutely natural, dry like gunpowder, and exploding when the last straw is lit - his scene confronting Adi's classmate's father in the slum is powerful and moving, his voice breaking and yet trying to retain control - he's the driver and the teacher for this tell-tale of a movie. What he teaches and learns is this: that no matter howsoever much you're in control of a narrative that involves the system, the immutable latter's gotten something extra hidden in its sleeve that covers its upper hand. And that when it comes to funds for survival, your chances are much better as an alien microbe in outer space than as an earthling dweller in a crammed slum."}, {"id": 105, "text": "NETFLIX'S SERIOUS MEN is outrageously splendid.

Now we have Nawaaz playing a backward tamil guy willing to take any step to do the same. This is one of the best works from Sushir Mishra in recent years. The sharp storytelling not only sheds light on the cast and class divide existing in our society but also talks about aspirations of Indian parents. The expectations they have from their children &amp; the pressure it creates on a child killing his childhood forms the crux of the story. Somebody rightly said Nawaaz is our national treasure and you are constantly reminded of this fact while watching the film. He is in top form here supported brilliantly by the child actor Aakshath Das. Its a delight watching both of them as a father son duo. Rest of the cast is good in their respective roles.

But this film too can be added to the failed attempts list of Netflix. Serious Men centers around Ayyan Mani (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a smart and intelligent man yet uneducated and by his own accounts unprivileged, and his attempts to make sure his son has all the 'privileges' that he was not fortunate enough to have and make sure his son lives a better life than he did. As simple as the above task seems, Ayyan makes it a little too complicated with a few white lies and rule breaking. The story lacks depth and is a further reminder that, in the modern era of Indian entertainment films only with renowned actors will still fail if the film doesn't have a good story and a strong screenplay. As has been the case for some time now Nawazuddin's acting is unquestionable which brings life to the character. The film almost accurately depicts the lifestyle and living conditions of families that are not well of in challenging and fast paced cities of modern times. But that's about it as far as compliments to the film go. The film starts of well with a good portrayal and peculiarity of Nawazuddin's character and feels like a unique story building up, but it seems too unique for one's liking and the film loses interest &amp; attention of the viewer about halfway through the movie. So all things considered you won't be missing out on a lot if you choose to avoid this movie, with better options on Netflix to spend your spare time.

With unadulterated subtlety; it sheds light on Cast Prejudices, Societal Acceptance and the concernment of Responsible Parenthood!Sudhir Mishra's astonishing direction being the backbone here with eminently written dialogues and an evident display in visual mastery apace with a sublime soundscore, that fits accordingly. Disseminating through innate nuances, the director holds a mirror to our society as well as to us; as insatiable &amp; infatuated human beings. About the lengths we would shamelessly go for our everlasting persuasion of betterment.The same conveyed through this individual called, Ayyan Mani; impeccably played by Nawazuddin. A stubborn father so obsessed with his ulterior motives for his offspring, that he forgot the foremost responsibility he had of becoming a supportive, empathetic parent to his only son. A lesser presence by comparison yet Indira Tiwari as Oja; A strong maternal figure impresses. Akshath Das as Adi, simply stunning. The way he handled himself infront of such veterans in the game is quite awe-inspiring.Not only the performances, the effulgent writing communicates deep-seated issues dwelling in our country that everyone is aware of yet we choose to keep reticence. Loopholes in our education system, ever present class differences, few obsessive set of parents who only care about the marks their children are getting. Ignoring the feeble child psychology; inevitably triggering lifelong mental health issues, that starts from a very young age.It would take few more paragraphs to describe what I gathered from this brilliant piece of work.

Made even more awesome by Nawaz's fantastic performance as always who can carry any movie on entirely his shoulders. Salute to him, a forever fan!The movie is spot on by showing that upper caste people deny the problem as they have solved it from their end as most in India have stopped common practices related to caste. Which in itself is a good thing but the denial tends to ignore the systemic challenges still prevailing. And that we all need to at-least first acknowledge the problems.Another part I absolutely loved was how missionary schools and evangelicals prey upon lower caste people so that they can be converted into Christianity. They act charitable but the motive is aggressive proselytization. Another problem lower caste Hindus face in India.The problem I had with the movie was that the lower caste person was shown as someonne doing shady things who takes the negative route. While it's understood that is, but it doesn't help that in pop culture we always show lower caste people doing wrong things which doesn't exactly help with the systemic problem they face. It is insensitive. While I adored the movie, I hope that we focus more towards positive tales related to lower caste people who are able to overcome the problems of society."}, {"id": 112, "text": "An aspirational father gets his school-going son to fake knowledge beyond his age and calibre. This basic setup of the film 'Serious Men' is too far-fetched to be acceptable and thereby the film does not hold. The makers never focus on how the father gets his son to fake as a genius boy and you are supposed to digest it with a couple of convenient scenes where the primary school student shows off his mugged-up smartness. This is one aspect where 'Serious Men' does not take itself seriously!Director Sudhir Mishra might have wanted the audience to focus on the outcome more than the setup. The idea is how a father robs the innocence of his son by making him a child prodigy. The subtext is dignified. But the setup is flawed!The film meanders too long in character setup to come to its point. Literally opening from conceiving the child, to the delivery happening in the opening credits to the child getting admission in school, the film takes too long to arrive to its agenda. For quite some time, the viewer isn't able to figure out where the narrative is going or what the film is trying to say.However once the story comes to its point, it sticks to the father-son conflict. Thereafter the message is quite clear - let your child be himself rather than making him a prototype of your unfulfilled ambitions. Not that the theme is avante garde but still its pretty much relatable, despite being brought up several times in films of recent past.The pacing is slow. The acts are predictable. Nawazuddin is good in his part but seems typecast rather than tailor-made in this role. His monologues as a narrator, his dry wit, his intense face closeups, the victimized act - all of it has a stereotype rather than deja vu effect. Aakshath Das as his son is good. Nasser plays his part well. Others do not get much scope.Serious Men struggles to be different and in doing so, often seems pretentious. This could have been far more entertaining, while still having the moral and subtext in place."}, {"id": 113, "text": "Ayyan Mani (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is an ordinary man, leading an ordinary life. Professionally, he is the PA to Dr. Acharya (Nasser) the lead scientist at NIFR and is absolutely convinced that his boss is fooling the world with his wacky research on alien microbes but puzzled about how convincing and confident the latter is, in getting away with lies. With the birth of Mani's son Adi, he hatches a grand plot of exhibiting his slow learner kid to the world as a prodigy and a genius in the making, thus achieving the extraordinary aspiration of societal recognition and adulation.Adi grows confident due to Mani's incessant guidance, illegitimate mechanisms for catapulting him to fame and popularity, using which the latter gains the recognition that he otherwise would never have achieved. It's a grand secret between the father and the son, but like all good things, it must come to an end. The repressed childhood of Adi, and his inability to act without assistance slowly starts getting to the child, something that can potentially destroy him mentally. Mani has to find an exit strategy to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Adi, and is ready to pay the price for it.Serious Men, directed by Sudhir Mishra is a tale of a twisted mind that refuses to succumb to the ordinary and will go to any length to realize his dreams, by hook or by crook. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is par excellence as the master manipulator, who is least concerned about the lack of maturity of the young mind, piling on agony on the child with psychological overload. But Serious Men belongs to the child artist Akshath Das, who absolutely captivates with his charm, innocence and complex psychological emotional demonstration, especially when he is unable to handle the burden any longer. Serious Men is a diabolical essay that waltzes on the screen in the garb of a socio-comic drama that gradually returns the young mind to sanity and normalcy, but not without collateral damages. It does leave some important messages for parents who overload their children to rise to the competitive world, without being preachy."}, {"id": 114, "text": "Movie rating- 9/10 NETFLIX'S SERIOUS MEN is outrageously splendid.

Serious Men adds another paper foil in the dustbin of Netflix which can be read once if you have too much time and got nothing else to watch. The script offers something outstanding which could have became a nationwide sensation but did not end so.The story follows Ayyan Mani (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) a middle-aged Dalit working as an assistant to a Brahmin astronomer Dr. Acharya (Nassar) who is rude to him at the National Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai. He lives in slum with his wife Oja (Indira Tiwari) and a son Adi (Akshath Das). Furious at his situation in life about not getting equal chances due to low cast ignorance from high class people, Ayyan develops an outrageous story that his 10-year-old son is a science genius - a lie which later gets out of control.Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Aaryan is brilliant and there is nothing you can hate about his acting in the film. Indira Tiwari as his wife gives a natural and matured performance and Aakshath's dialogue delivery is incredible. Nassar as Dr. Acharya doesn't impress much which is shocking while Sanjay Narvekar in small role comes out as a big surprise. Shweta Basu Prasad's look is one of the finest work of make up artist recently as she looks like a real thing from the society and more than her beauty they focused more on her presentation as that smart girl with physical damages.The film begins and takes charge on a solid note with massive turning hold dialogues and fun factors. Then it goes on to find intellectual part to blow our minds that at one moment or for an half an hour to be more precise the film looks something outstanding and never seen before stuff. But while moving towards the climax it doesn't find proper answers to it's own intelligent theory and hurries up to the typical dumb ending. Screenplay is engaging, literally no dull moments except for one or two in the 2nd half. Overall narrative is entertaining and interesting even though it failed to make sense in the the climax. Dialogues are fantastic and Nawazuddin's dialogue delivery makes it even more funnier. Vulgarity and abusive Language are definitely 2 big issues here because the film has a child Artist in pivotal role and the Child audience cannot watch this semi adult drama.Sudhir Mishra is a genius director i must say and even in Serious Men he kept the tag alive for most of the runtime. He tried to put up so many things in one narrative such as Middle Class Man's life, his struggle, low caste issues, educational frauds, political conspiracy, a child's mentality and all this so humanly that it seemed impossible to have all these things together. Even after all this so good looking show where did he missed it? It lies in the climax. The film intends to be a sensational and intelligent stuff but it hardly tries to keep it's own words in the end. Its just another undone show by Netflix. In short, Primitive Film, i could't deal with it.
