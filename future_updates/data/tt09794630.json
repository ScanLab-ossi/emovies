I've got to admit I didn't expect the twist in the end. Worth a watch."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I'm still not sure if I actually liked this movie or not.....there was so much going on, odd subplots, and unresolved non-issues that made it all confusing. For starters, it was at least 45 minutes too long, several times I thought it was gonna wrap up, then off they went again in a new direction. A lot of character behavior that didn't seem terribly believable; I found myself laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny. And they made darn sure you knew that EVERY minor character could be the bad guy by giving them all exaggerated creepy habits, tics, and secrets that were quite over the top.It was plenty suspenseful in many places but at times again ventured into is-that-supposed-to-be-funny....?I give it a resounding meh."}, {"id": 2, "text": "The most creepy part is to read reviews from people who actually watched 10 mins or who watched till the very end and still didn't get it. I wonder why do they have this urge to leave a comment the most?I started to watch with absolutely no expectations but it turned out to be quite entertaining. There were few holes but all in all it's a pretty decent thriller with good twists. Good job!"}, {"id": 3, "text": "So many twists and turns that all makes sense in the end. Watch it! This movie deserves a better rating than its getting here."}, {"id": 4, "text": "I knew nothing before watching this movie. Thought it would be bland but turns out quite engaging and powerful once it portrays how a couple has to handle marriage life with gone kid. Twisted ending which I never saw it coming at all."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I found this movie very interesting. I liked all the twists and turns, and the ending is very surprising and satiating. Sure there are several misdirects that other reviews site as plot holes. But if you think about it later each subplot has a thread tying it back to the main story of the missing daughter."}, {"id": 6, "text": "It was not too bad and certainly held my attention as it tries to solve a missing daughter story. I was hoping it might be like Taken but it's mostly a psychological drama similar to Prisoners but not nearly as good. But still it was tense suspenseful watch with twists and turns. But the unreliable narrator storytelling has been done before but still never gets old."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Okay, so there's a lot going on in this movie the plot rambles around a bit. The acting is only ok, with good turns from Jason Patric (Sheriff) and Thomas (Paul). It's hitchcockian in its style and the ending threw me BIG TIME (no spoilers). It's no classic and has more holes than Swiss cheese, but stick with this one and you'll be glad you did!"}, {"id": 8, "text": "Starting 2 favorites Tomas Jane and Ann Heche. I had not see Ann in a long time, I always thought of her as a very good actress.Going in I thought was going to be just a formula kidnapping or lost in the woods film. Boy was I surprised. The suspense was gripping many twists and turns. I didn't get it till the end then it all made sense. Heche was just great. Tomas played that role so well, it throws you such a curve. How can it be only a 5.6 here. I give it an 8 and that is too low. Jason Patrick kills his role as the Sheriff. All the characters are very complex. I might have to watch it again to see more. It's hard to review with out spoilers.I really loved it, writing first rate. Thank you."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Really good film, and good twists. Superb acting by the wife, reminded me of my ex who suffered paranoia and was on meds. Similar behaviour. Those who wrote bad reviews haven't experienced someone with mental health problems. Very good movie. Realistic."}, {"id": 10, "text": "In a time where 90% of so called A-rated movies turn out to be a complete waste of time starring oscar winning actors, this movie stands out above the rest.

I've never seen Anne Heche or Thomas Jame act so badly. Jason Patric was a joke as the sheriff IMO. I was rolling my eyes way too much to stick with what I consider a hot mess. I mean, really...those two were acting in a forced way. Like some amateur B movie stuff. I just couldn't stomach this one. ugh.

Unable to find answers, our couple venture on their own investigation of self-destruction.Interesting film. I didn't see it coming and I normally figure out this kind of twist. Decent acting.Guide: sex. near nudity. Don't recall any swearing."}, {"id": 15, "text": "The opening header and first 10 minutes are enough for a genre sleuth to figure out the ending, which is a shame. Lots of attempted twists and turns, so worth a free streaming watch - but was really hoping the plot would have gone a different direction. Love the leading actors in other films, but the direction on this one felt forced and too overdone for the story."}, {"id": 16, "text": "I don't blame the actors.

Every time someone speaks it reminds you how terrible the film is."}, {"id": 21, "text": "There was nothing wrong with this movie! Suspense, action, thriller, psychological - it was all these things. Acting was on point - if this happened to you, wouldn't you be hysterical and all over the place? Both lead actors did great! Supporting staff, most were great too. 5.6/10? NO WAY! Not a solid 10 but definitely a 9!"}, {"id": 22, "text": "At 00:47 a female seen having an orgasm while intentionally been watched by a man at another RV, one of the main character.Uncomfortable to watch with a 15 year old, and should avoid to watch with a 15 y/o girl."}, {"id": 23, "text": "This is a very strange story, with plenty of suspense and an element of horror.The Anne Heche character is very unlikable and isn't easy to watch by times, but in the end I realized she was the right person for the role.The story is well-written and keeps you guessing until the end."}, {"id": 24, "text": "It comes in at an hour and 54 minutes. Take off 25 minutes and you've got a solid thriller. Lots of padded, boring dialog is what kills it. Tighten it up and it's not bad.Good first time writing and directing from Peter F, who also plays a sheriff. I remember back in the 90s when he was supposed to be the next Tom Cruise. That never happened but he's built a solid career for himself and will get other directing jobs in the future."}, {"id": 25, "text": "Wow Anne Heche does a great job acting in this movie.

Waaaaay too many. Endless amounts of words.The ending - it explains things and you still don't understand everything, which is not fun. Not even a little.I like Anne Heche because she seems truly certifiable - even when she's not in a movie - but this is crazier than even she is."}, {"id": 39, "text": "The Vanished is an interesting missing girl mystery whose end you don't really see coming. Peter Facinelli, an actor new to writing/directing, leads you down a bunch of rabbit holes so you think almost anyone on scene could've done the thing. But in doing that he stretches some situations/circumstances to aw c'mon places. Anne Heche delivers a fine performance among an cast of unknowns. The reveal is kind of interesting but pretty far fetched and you don't get the conclusive, satisfying click of the handcuffs at the end, either."}, {"id": 40, "text": "Idiotic writing and acting ruins what could be a promising movie. The lead female character was frustratingly stupid. The actress's acting of said character was bad too. Male lead was terrible but not as bad as the female lead. The sheriff was the most likeable character but the movie wants you to hate him so poor direction acting and writing all around."}, {"id": 41, "text": "One of the best thriller movies I have seen in a while. We need more cinema like this. Well done to Peter. The actors also did an incredible performance. RV thrillers are so edgy. A sequel would not hurt my feelings one bit. A MUST SEE!"}, {"id": 42, "text": "Its a movie about every parents and guardians greatest fears, when a child disappears. your shocked and merely helpless, and youll never forget it.the story and plot for this movie had the opportunity but they manage to wreck the whole story with an additional murder and a coincidental deaddrunk sheriff managing the whole case. the acting goes on low gear, the plot speed are deafening slow and without intensity at all.its a derailed crimedrama, made for the lifetime and tvshow crowds, its not a blockduster by all means and quite painful to watch, so its not a recommend from the grumpy old man"}, {"id": 43, "text": "Without a doubt the worst movie ever made.Bad plot, bad acting"}, {"id": 44, "text": "I just watched the movie. It kept me watching. To be honest, after half of the movie I knew it that both were delusional! That's why, ending wasn't a surprise for me! Peter Facinelli's 1st directing and writing movie. Script was really good. I must say, he did a great job! Unfortunate choices when it comes choosing the actors!!! I hope he chooses better actors! If there would have been great acting, it would have been top notch movie!"}, {"id": 45, "text": "This movie good have been very good, with a better writer some better direction and better acting. The story had potential but failed to hit its mark because of weaknesses in these areas."}, {"id": 46, "text": "It's a new take on the vanishing genre and for that it gets some original points. However the acting and dialogue is indeed as poor as the other reviews say it is. Lots of scenes to hate on with this one but a decent first effort from a new director, which at times is frustrating to watch. Hopefully he can build on this and keep getting better with experience."}, {"id": 47, "text": "You will wonder what level of hell you've wandered into when you first start watching this. The acting is dire. The editing is terrible. There are so many utterly baffling decisions made that you will find it very hard to sympathise with anyone at all. But, hang on...the last 10 minutes suddenly makes it all (almost) worth it, and with the benefit of hindsight you'll find yourself going...ohhhh...NOW I see... 6 stars because it's actually not awful and the ending is actually quite surprising and a little heartbreaking."}, {"id": 48, "text": "It's just come down to the point of not trusting any reviews. The movie is definitely worth a watch. Anne Hesch is great as always... this one leaves you guessing until the end. We enjoyed it."}, {"id": 49, "text": "I am glad I did not listen to the poor reviews on this one. Is the movie realistic, no not really and yes there are some questionable plot points, but overall this movie is entertaining from start to finish, pulls you in on a great ride and has so many twists and turns it is fascinating. Ultimately too, you feel for the characters, which is an accomplishment . Peter Facinelli has done a fine job with writing and directing and only given himself a tiny role in the movie, which is what someone should do , write, direct and then step out of the way. Never boring, keeps you guessing, this does not deserve it's bad reviews."}, {"id": 50, "text": "This sleeper is quite a surprise. One of the best low budget films I've seen. Some of the acting reveals the budget and drops it to a 9, but wow...what a story."}, {"id": 51, "text": "I read the mixed reviews and not sure what to make of it but I watched it anyway. It held my interest the whole movie. It was not predictable. I did have a few questions while watching it but the ending kinda explains it for me. Im not sure if I missed it but I dont know what happened to the female neighbour, is she dead or did she survive? I saw what happened to her husband when the boat tipped. Who killed the dog or is he imaginary? What's with the mention of the FBI if they're not even in the movie? I appreciate the mixture of weird characters to make the viewers guessing if they have anything to do with the disappearance of the young girl. Peter Faccinelli's role is almost useless as if he's just squeezed his character to be in the movie while directing it. The dialogues could have been improved as some are questionable. All in all I enjoyed the movie, I like being surprised with the twist."}, {"id": 52, "text": "This is a movie you must see. It is drama and you won't believe the ending! Jason Patric is great as the Sheriff!"}, {"id": 53, "text": "Me and my husband really enjoyed it I thought it was a aswsome movie has me at the edge of the bed!"}, {"id": 54, "text": "I was entertained by it for the most part, I liked the atmosphere too.I feel like there were many side plot holes tbqh. And without them the movie would've lasted less than an hour. They lost me. The ending was good for a mystery thriller.Kind of a meh mystery thriller for me. Liked the twist though."}, {"id": 55, "text": "Decent movie IMO. Kept me entertained and invested all the way through. Had me laugh out loud a few times just from the awkwardness. Good ol fashioned who-dun-it film."}, {"id": 56, "text": "We should be out there searching. I was. I hit the local Redbox because I had a need to write and wanted to check out a wilderness thriller.Anyway, 2020's The Vanished is my latest write-up. Don't try to confuse it with that movie from the nineties starring Jeff Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland. Vanished rather features Anne Heche and journeyman actor Thomas Jane. As a flustered married couple who appear to be on the outs, these kooky spouses do strong work here.Released on DVD in October, reigning in some Kubrickian overhead shots, and filmed mostly on a camping site (Alabama perhaps?), The Vanished is deftly directed by Peter Facinelli. Weaving many characters, a few plot lines, and a few whodunits, Facinelli fashions what looks like a modern day version of 1998's A Simple Plan. Sam Raimi well, he would be mildly dazzled.Along with Heche and Jane, Vanished also stars a subdued Jason Patric and Facinelli himself. They appear in a film that keeps you guessing until the very end (even though it's not too hard to follow). The Vanished while all too high-flown for its own good, contains a doozy of a conclusion and enough twists and turns to occupy Lombard Street. The movie as a near two-hour mark, registers as its own, reared red herring.With an original title of Hour of Lead and distributed by Saban Films, Vanished is just what it aspires to be. It's a flick about a husband and wife who try to find their daughter who was abducted on an RV family vacay. People get murdered in the process, everyone's a person of interest, and it all takes place during the Thanksgiving holiday (which is readily approaching). I'm gonna recommend The Vanished despite its yearn to project broad, look at me film-making. It's a decent rental and an up to snuff vanishing act."}, {"id": 57, "text": "I just finished this movie.

Very perplexed at why he took the role after watching it. The film is just awful, one of the worst i've seen in a long time and full of holes, for example why the police didn't search the campsite owners house or the other trailers; something that would've 100% been done in a missing child case. The acting is deplorable. I watched until the end out of sheer curiosity. The 'twist' if you can call it that, had little impact, given the film up to that point was dreary and an absolute chore to watch. It's the kind of film that kills careers.

I knew 10 minutes into this it was going to stink. I struggled to give it the 1 star but no other options were available. And Anne Heche? That was a real brilliant piece of casting.

The acting was horrendous and when I read the user reviews it didnt seem to get any better. But, thnx to some reviews stating it was worth the watch I pushed through and actually got stuck. The acting is over the top but after you\u00b4ve watched the whole movie and rewatch the first scenes, it makes more sence and actually fits. I cant say much more without spoiling.The ending is what does the movie. If I had stoped watching after twenty minutes I would have given a one-star review but after seeing all of it I give it a six.Its not a bad start for first time director but the writers and director made this one to hard on us. They should have realed in the acting so more of us saw the whole thing. They would have benefited greatly from that.In short; Its a decent thriller with weird acting, that kinda gets explained, and a great ending. Actually worth a watch./MrZinz"}, {"id": 100, "text": "And I don't think you will be hungry after this as it fills the moviegoer belly to the brim and more than satisfies the celluloid taste buds into the bargain.It is a story that has been done a fair few times but it keeps you guessing right until the final denouement which is a rare thing in movies these days and throws in some really odd sub-plots which unlike other viewers I found just added more flavour to the cinematic soup!Unfortunately, the only thing that lets the movie down is the awful acting of Anne Heche; I wish she would just give up and retire as every role she takes is the same old same old tedious, zero emotion, zero expression acting style. I don't know if it is because she is a lesbian but she just cannot play the wife and mother role in any movie be it the sci-fi series Aftermath which she also ruined or virtually any other role she has taken; she is miserable to look at and has a sour and deeply tedious acting style. Thomas Jane is one of my favourite actors but even he seemed to have a hard time in this film working with her on this movie and it shows. I also like Jason Patric but he does not shine in this unfortunately and gives a somewhat lacklustre performance but for me the story is all and it had me glued to the screen which is unusual as most of the movies I have seen this year have warranted nothing more than a 5 or 6 out of 10.Apart from these minor niggles, the first time director does a splendid job; bearing in mind he has to work with Heche and put up with her tantrums on set and so the story winds its way slowly; but never boringly to its riveting conclusion.A very good 7/10 from me on this one and it would have been an 8 if the acting had been better!"}, {"id": 101, "text": "Actor turned newb writer and director Peter Facinelli, wore all three hats in this B-grade film, and although flawed, it was still enjoyable. New filmmakers have to start somewhere, right? This was his 3rd full length feature film, and I've seen much worse from seasoned filmmakers lately. My biggest issue was the terrible acting by Anne Heche and especially Thomas Jane and his changing weird voice, but some of that blame also falls on the inexperience of the newb director not directing his cast and scenes effectively. Overall though, the directing was fairly decent as was the camera work. The cinematography and score were on point. The writing did have some plot and technical issues, and the pacing needed to be faster and/or the films 115 min runtime edited or cut down to around 90 mins. But the overall story with its twists and turns and surprise ending was conceived very well - it was worth the slow pacing and long runtime. If you enjoy mystery thrillers with some scary moments, you will enjoy this one. Watching it a second time knowing the ending is like watching a different movie, which is well put together.

This particular outing is a bit more ambitious than most, in that not everything is as it seems, and the usual formula is inverted. Kudos for that. What many will have noticed is the atrocious acting in several scenes, especially by the leads. While this is explained later on in the film, it still makes for a grating viewing experience. However, the overacting is interspersed with good acting, especially by Thomas Jane, Jason Patric and actor who plays the disturbed teenager. The direction is quite confident in some scenes. Thomas Jane's nightmare in particular features a very clever overhead shot. There are some tense moments here, elevated by the score. The one major weakness is Anne Heche. Her acting is painful to watch. Also the movie is about 30 minutes too long.Overall, this is barely a 5 star film, but i'll give it one extra star for the clever concept and a rarity when it comes to thriller movies: where they usually get worse and lose tension as they go on until a letdown ending, this one is the reverse. It gets better as the stakes rise, and the ending (almost) makes it all worth it.

Some reviews here say that Wendy was so detracting (or even that Anne Heche made here such), but for me husband was even worse. And played by action movies star ?? Character was real wussy, and practically did nothing intelligent whole time.What authors wanted with this at all ? To make viewers to feel bad ? Indeed managed it. But it would work better without overdone darkness - junkie boy, wife abandoning in hard time ...Now, as it is clear that movie quality, at least made in USA goes down this years, should I go thru in movie mentioned 5 phases ? Yeah, I was in denial phase previous year. But not in blaming others phase. And now in acceptance phase. Luckily, not same as with child loss - I can still dig out good, older ones.

And that is essentially all I knew about the movie when I decided to watch it.However, I must say that writer and director Peter Facinelli definitely managed to come up with a movie that was quite entertaining. And the storyline was very compelling and drew me in right away. I will admit that the movie wasn't as predictable as many thrillers tend to be, and the twists to the storyline were quite interesting and nicely executed.The storyline was good, and it was a nicely told storyline from writer and director Peter Facinelli. It was definitely a very entertaining story and one that brings the audience right in there with the grieving parents.Hour of Lead has some good performances from Thomas Jane and Anne Heche. But it also have a memorable performance by Jason Patric. All in all, the acting in the movie was good, and people were doing great jobs in bringing their characters to life on the screen.Normally I don't watch a lot of thrillers, but Hour of Lead is definitely well worth the time, money and effort. So if you get the chance to watch it, I can strongly recommend that you do so.My rating of Hour of Lead (or The Vanished) is a strong seven out of ten stars."}, {"id": 108, "text": "2.5 out of 5 stars.The Vanished is a child abduction thriller that has substance with its story but lacks a direction to keep your attention and iffy acting and script.

There daughter goes missing. Sheriff played by Jason Patric keeps an alert out and has a search party out. Warning the couple that there was an escaped convict out nearby. While Thomas Jane and Anne Heche obsessively searches the camp with others. While there desperation gets worse.There is a twist that i did not see coming which paid off with its ending. Sadly, the films direction is dull and boring. The performances also were not that good. The script is filled with atrocious and cringing dialogue from these characters.It is a film that lacks the thrills and a direction to make this worth watching."}, {"id": 109, "text": "The Vanished was directed and written by Peter Facinelli, and stars Thomas Jane, Anne Heche, Jason Patric, Aleksei Archer, John D. Hickman, Kristopher Wente, Alex Haydon, KK Heim, Sadie Heim, and Facinelli himself. It follows a married couple who lose their daughter during a camping trip as they take the search and investigation into their own hands.Plotting is fine, but has some seriously flawed moments; on the upside, the movie wastes little time in getting to the mystery while still providing a decent amount of setup. Paul (Jane) and Wendy (Heche) are taking their daughter Taylor (KK/Sadie Heim) on a camping trip at a lakeside park. initial impressions of the people there are not good, the owner, Tom (Hickman) is rude and standoffish, as is Justin (Haydon), the groundskeeper. While Paul meets Miranda (Archer) and Wendy is paying, Taylor goes missing. Sheriff Baker and deputy Rakes (Facinelli), along with other officers are called to the scene. There happens to be an escaped convict on the loose in the area and Baker tells the couple to stay inside. They elect not to and find a man who they think is the con, accidentally shooting him. After this, the couple can't come clean, so they work parallel to the police, trying to hide what they've done and get their daughter back.Characters are well set up, but where they go is more curious. Paul is a straight-laced father with a military background and a love for fishing, although he has run into problems romantically, much to Wendy's chagrin. Wendy is the caring mother who interacts well with her daughter and will do anything to get her back, legal and advised or not, to an absurd degree; and will manipulate Paul into whatever she plans too. Baker is a relatively standard policeman character, he has been on the force for a long time and takes pride in what he does; although does have some trouble with honesty. Miranda and husband Eric (Wente) are well-meaning bystanders that are trying for a child and have sympathy to their situation. Performances are passable for the most part, Jane does well with showing stress, sadness, and curiosity. Patric is good as the sheriff, bringing some gruffness to the role, and the supporting actors are good enough, but it's Heche that struggles; frequently going wide-eyed and angry at the drop of a hat, but she does have believable chemistry with Jane.Criminal actions are kept in focus, although the movie does deviate from the kidnapping a lot. The first 40 minutes are very well done, showing what lengths people will go to to find their loved ones; it is after this point that the movie starts to wobble and cross the line of absurdity. It is conceivable that Paul and Wendy would have kept quiet about what Wendy did, but her actions following make her seem just as bad as the kidnapper; from breaking and entering to interrogation, to guilt tripping Paul into joining her. Baker, upon meeting the couple tells Rakes not to let them know about the escapee, but they already knew, effectively planting a seed of doubt in the audience. This by itself would have been fine, but red herrings are thrown around left and right and leads to the movie becoming more and more implausible.Technically the movie is mixed. Facinelli made some good choices with the cinematography, and DoP Cory Geryak does a strong job of presenting locations with beauty and flair. Some of the tracks on the score are downright great, but others are generic and borderline inane. Sound design does have signs of a struggle, when characters shout or argue at each other (which is frequent) the audio can get a bit fuzzy. And as mentioned, the writing starts strong but drops off a cliff in quality and proceeds to fluctuate from then on. It's best when it actually focuses in on the kidnapping, and not the miscellaneous red herrings and side plots.Peter Facinelli's directorial debut shows some potential; his suspense and shots are well crafted, but his writing leaves a lot to be desired. The core of the movie is interesting, as are the characters and the performances from Jane and Patric; but during the many times The Vanished strays from the plot it feels like the visualization of an identity crisis.57/100"}], "reviews_amount": 110}
