Love it.In all my years of being a Taylor fan, honestly I never imagined her work could or even needed to get any better. But man!!! Did she prove me wrong.She is good. She is really good. She is great. A living legend.This film is raw, to the core, touch your soul kind of amazing. Taylor like you've seen her before, at her greatest, but better. If that makes sense.# Grammys Album of the year......"}, {"id": 62, "text": "This is my very first review ever and I had to write it, not because I have the illusion that I can capture with words the sense and magnificence of this album but because I feel humble and in awe that I' am able to sneak into Taylor's brilliance, even in small snippets. A truly inspiring artist and a beautiful human being."}, {"id": 63, "text": "I didn't think I could love this album anymore, but these live performances have given me a whole new appreciation for it. Taylor (and Justin!) sound amazing and I was almost moved to tears for certain songs. Had goosebumps nearly the whole way through. It was also really special to hear about the story/process behind every song; this is obviously such a personal album to Taylor, and yet one that manages to simultaneously be so relatable to so many people. This is her best work and she should be incredibly proud of it. Really recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of Taylor, or a fan of music in general. Hearing them talk about how the album came together is magical, and I will probably be rewatching this over and over again."}, {"id": 64, "text": "Something above great. From the very start to the end it was so great"}, {"id": 65, "text": "As I'm in my mid 40s it's not surprising I've bever been a fan of taylor swift before but the whole album is so calming, poetic, and beautifully written.

If you want me to keep paying $7 a month for Disney+ instead of pirating it for free. Keep putting Taylor Swift specials on and see how quick I cancel my subscription."}, {"id": 68, "text": "I loved every second of it! I love the way she has gone out of her way (again) to bring us Swifties an album during the era of COVID-19. Taylor Swift is one of the most talented artists in the world and everyone should give folklore a chance. \ud83d\udda4"}, {"id": 69, "text": "Actual hipsters let Taylor Swift pretend to be as profound as them ... and by the end, through their generosity, you see Taylor in a new light. Their chemistry materializes slowly as well, which is true to life. Take the song with the guy from Bon Iver. I've always enjoyed (and made fun of enjoying) Taylor. But Bon Iver feels more substantial and artful. But the guy works with her on a track, which feels like a condescension (but he doesn't act like it, because he's a gracious person). And then she hangs, and I see a new and exciting potential direction for Swift in the next decade. Her lyrical fun is still there, but with a bit more imagination and - oddly - depth. The collaborators eyes seem to glaze over occasionally, but therein lies their transformative generosity."}, {"id": 70, "text": "Whether you're a Taylor fan or not, this storytelling is masterful. Even if you leave out the soul-stirring songs and meaningful lyrics, this film accomplishes something we've not seen since in our generation's most trying times of wars, uncertainty, cultural and racial division. It jerks us awake to the fact that we, together, are living in one of those dire climates with COVID. The Vietnam War had Dylan to peel back our humanity and think about peace. John Lennon, too, lays bear how we really should treat one another.In that caliber, and perhaps born from desperation, Taylor Swift invites us to be a part of this experience with other artists who collaborate. A part of this moment in history. In isolation, she manages to look further inward and blossoms an idea to turn a vulnerable situation into a new-normal discovery.At the same time, she distinguishes herself yet again as a pure song-writer and artist. There's little doubt that other artists will re-think their true purpose for music creation. Shouldn't all artist be driven to create for the sake of the art, and less about the business motivation. Wouldn't that be nice. This is what happens when you remove the ego and affluent side of the process and bring back simplicity, purity.The ensemble of song and phrasing leave you with a lasting impression that there are others who are experiencing what you are going through. That's powerful. And that's enduring.Taylor Swift is a rare gift."}, {"id": 71, "text": "Folklore, the 8th Taylor Swift's album, surprise-released on July 23rd, is a already a critically-acclaimed record and the longest-running number 1 album of the year (8 weeks). Besides that, her work was most notably praised by her six 2021 GRAMMY nominations, which proves artists longevity and high relatability during the time of the global pandemic. With this release, Swift took her songwriting and singing skills to the next level, by recording a full-length film, which consists of a live performance of all 17 tracks, a short talk about the writing process and overall album recording and most importantly, a discussion about every song on the album between Taylor Swift and one of the writers. The live performances truly show the beautifulness of Swift's voice accompanied by a few instruments. The production also reveals the enigmatic process of recording an album during the pandemic. What's most fascinating and absorbing, is the explanation made by Taylor and either Jack or Aaron (or even all of them), track by track, right before each performance. They show the viewer the other side of those rich and meaningful lyrics and also encourages to dive even more deeply into this body of work. In conclusion, this films shows the viewer a new perspective on the album and its diversity in lyrics. It also provides a deep insight into the album-making process during the pandemic, which adds a sense of mysteriousness because of its unusuality. Because of that this film deserves its appraise."}], "reviews_amount": 72}
