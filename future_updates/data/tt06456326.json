The movie could have easily been 1.5 hours, or a bit less and been a lot better for it. As a result it is highly repetitive with the same scenes playing out multiple times.The effects are good. The acting is ok, although I don't think there is any character to identify with. The action was ok. The concept isn't new, but what is anymore. It just dragged on and on and on. Eventually you begin hoping the robots will hurry up and kill everyone so the credits can roll."}, {"id": 1, "text": "So as of writing this film is at 4.3/10. More than a little unfair imo. Look it's not high-brow entertainment, and premise is pretty dumb. The notion that the US would do a field test on AII killer robots in Cambodia and have them massacre (mostly innocent) villagers (including kids) and a group of young US doctors doing humanitarian work is indeed pretty sketchy - even if you think the US Military Industrial Complex is a heartless killing machine. But the execution of this goofy premise I think was pretty well done. Of the four killer AI bots that are supposed to be semi-controlled by operators (who inexplicably weren't aware of what the military was planning), one of the bots goes rogue and becomes self-aware. So we have multiple moving parts here, the doctors and villagers fighting for survival, the robot operators trying to figure out the morality of their orders, and a rogue AI bot trying to come to terms with sentience. The pacing is mostly fine, despite a very long (for this type of film) 2 hr 11 run time (tbh 15 mins could have been trimmed), the action and robot effects are well done, and the characters generally behave in a believable manner. So an eclectic combination of 80's action movies - think Predator, Commando, and especially Terminator blended together in a semi-high-brow action movie."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Every single character in this movie was so annoying and unrelatable that I was actually rooting for the killer robots."}, {"id": 3, "text": "After 10 minutes you know it is going to be a bad movie, it is impossible to connect to any of the actors, they all act like morons.

Normally in my reckoning movies over 90 minutes tend to be OK. This one met this condition, but it was a bit too long and could have easily been 20-30 minutes shorter and lose none of the story line. The acting wasn't brillant, but the actors did a good job. The CGI was good and didn't make the movie look cheap.

Robots fortunately (for the movie) encounter some resistance, and it is decided that they have to eliminate all witnesses. Rampage starts.

More close ups than a Indian soap opera, people acting angry for no reason, people tripping and stumbling around worse than in an Irish pub, acting childish, directing atrocious. Quote of the day: In a cave - We can stay here in the open ??? 10 steps in the same cave ok we should sleep here  ???!!! And other gems like that, shh be quiet next thing some random actor yells something completely idiotic. A robot gets stuck and drops its gun, they all pass by it, no one picks it up, a top notch high capacity gun, saying hurry up before it gets unstuck ... bullets don't affect robots but the stock does... And the cherry of the top, EMP can destroy everything electric but not the will of a robot. The amount of intelligence put in this script is below zero.

Effects were also good.Annoying parts were characters far too whiny. Constantly giving their location away by crying and screaming. I forwarded those bits and saved about 20 mins off the film.But the film really lost me when the hard-as-nails Navy Seal decided to do no harm to the lethal robot that was hunting them when it got stuck in some rocks. Could have tried to kill it using it's own high powered gun that it couldn't reach, or cave its head in with some rocks, but no.

There were no obvious logic holes in this movie which is nice for a movie so close to our current reality. What? Don't you think so? The movie was a bit bloody, but seriously, I guess it's a warning for reality. If the producers did not intent to send this message, well, you hear it from me. Robots and AI does not fit, but hey, I don't want a flat screen in my car either, just dials for rpm and speed. I hope they get away from the idea to stear the world with computers.

Let me preface this by saying I love action movies, sci fi, and killer robots. But this one???I'm giving it a 2 because, well, I did watch to the end. The DP was also the director... that's ALWAYS a huge mistake. The film WAS shot well, but there was literally NO direction. Action scenes, followed by ridiculous emotional drama, and people doing stupid stuff repeatedly that should have gotten them killed far earlier in the film.This one had every $%^#ing cliche in the book. The evil bad guy government/military types. Our unknowning tech guys who built the robots, and an innocent group of people who just happen to be in the 'test zone along with an ext military guy...Now I could forgive the cliches if they actually had decent dialogue, and what they did made any sense.The dialogue was atrocious. First they call Our hero a Navy Seal. Then someone else refers to him as Special Forces (That's Army guys, not Navy.) then the actor himself calls himself a Navy Special Forces guy. Really? The writers couldn't look that up? The Navy has Seals, the Army has Special Forces. Why didn't you jut call him a Marine Recon Seal Special Forces Delta Guy and cover all the bases?Not once does our Navy Special Forces guy try to trap, ensnare, etc the robots. On multiple occasions, they have the opportunity to do some damage, and instead, they elect to run.Every Single Time...Even when the damn thing is trapped in some rocks, they manage to get past it, but don't try to disable it. Freaking DUMB.A bunch of doctors who freak out and scream at the first sign of stress, and repeatedly, when being chased by killer robots, they feel the need to scream at the top of their lungs for their friends... how did any of these people pass medical school making judgement calls like that?The best part of this movie was the little kid. Great little actor.If you're going to write a movie, get millions to shoot it, then Jesus, do some research... and spend the time writing dialogue that isn't freaking atrocious.Of course, our ending sets it up for a sequel, which frankly, I'd be amazed if it ever happened because this was just So bad. .Again, SOOOOO much potential , just wasted."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Totally captivated from start to finish watching this!!"}, {"id": 36, "text": "I wasn't too sure about this movie but man I loved it.

Well, the film holds together pretty well, but there is a lot that does go wrong, or rather doesn't go sufficiently right. Firstly the script &amp; the characterization is somewhat weak. Although there is arguably a hero / main character, the narrative suffers because POV the focus on the characters generally is somewhat confusing. This seems in part to be deliberate. The writers seem keen for us to be aware that these killer robots could at any moment take out any of the characters &amp; towards that end there are a few attempts to shock us. The most obvious example here is the beginning flashback scene, where we see one of the girls in the movie horribly imperilled beneath the foot of a robot. Well, half-way through the movie we re-encounter that scene only to have the robot (off-screen) stomp on the girl. Does this make for a better movie or more thrilling movie? I'd have to say it doesn't really work that well, &amp; rather comes across more as a deliberate &amp; unnecessary violation of narrative convention. Narrative wise the scene serves no purpose. Letting us know that 'anything could happen' isn't a good enough reason.That's just one example of poor judgement that marrs an otherwise good film. There are many points when characters die or are about to die, or have some 'moment' with each other, that just serves to remind us that we don't really care about them that much, and those moments, sometimes accompanied by platoon like music, just makes the story drag out unnecessarily. Some tighter writing &amp; better editing could in this respect have made this a far better film.The antagonists are variable. As stated the robots are pretty good, although barring one, they are simply personality-less machines. The military guy villain is good, as is the pentagon guy, but a few of the other actors simply aren't that good &amp; deliver sub-par performances.There are also a few annoyances. For example one character being hunted down by a bad guy pulls a knife out of her leg, then despite it being the one possibility she might have of evening the tables, just leaves it there, the better to die helplessly at his leisure. Same occurs later on with another enemy weapon.Over all, it's an ambitious and generally successful movie that could have achieve a 6 or a 7 if it had just had some tighter writing, a bit better acting and a lot better editing. I'd give this a 5.5. which I'll round up to 6 in a spirit of generosityOh, and the whole AI becomes self-aware was beyond cliche, but if the above points had been addressed it wouldn't really have mattered."}, {"id": 41, "text": "I was confused with the 4 robots.

The British Military just released a memo recently saying they are planning on having half of their soldiers replaced with AI Robot soldiers in the next two decades! What people do not realize is the machines the US military and other 1st world nations have is TOP SECRET so what we think they have is nothing compared to what they really have. I wouldn't be surprised if they already have robots that operate like the one they had in this film. But the concept of the film is very realistic!What I do not get is why they chose the Golden Circle in South East Asia? Why did they want to experiment there as opposed to somewhere in the Middle East etc? But that's irrelevant. I guess the location made for a better story.The idea of AI and robots are going to be a very real reality in the next decade and most people do not realize their jobs are soon going to be threatened by AI and robotics. They are already having robots perform surgeries, and these robots are performing better than the best surgeons out there, so surgeons will be out of work in the next 2 decades for sure! Laugh at my comment all you want, but it is a reality! Another example, they have been using AI robots to work in science labs and these AI Robots have already made huge scientific discoveries because they think far quicker and more efficiently that humans, and they can work 24 hours a day doing tests in the lab. I saw a news report just a few weeks ago about how robots were making discoveries having to do with the human genome and this is just the tip of the iceberg. With AI, we are at the equivalent of AOL days when comparing it to the internet. Another example is Tesla where they use so many robots to manufacture the cars that they won't need a huge workforce and same with Amazon because they just use robots to do what humans can do but at a far slower and inefficient speed.People really need to wake up to the reality of what the future holds with regard to AI and robotics. All of our jobs are at risk, and if they start to use robots as a form of policing the population, then we will be in a slavery 2.0 situation, and mankind will be in a lot of trouble.But in regard to the film... I think the filming, acting, and everything about the film was great!

Sometimes when you are so close to a project it's hard to put yourself in the audience's shoes... That being said, there are some cool sequences. The setting is cool. The camerawork is relatively sophisticated and well done. The acting is extremely uneven and overall not great. The sound design is decent. The music is all over the place, but mostly tells you how to feel and calls attention to itself. There's not much in the way of themes here just ambient cue after ambient cue that is far too common these days. Unfortunately, the film is largely tone deaf and didn't work for me. There's not much in the way of work towards suspension of disbelief and for sci fi there are some implausibilities and dumb stuff that just doesn't work especially for how largely serious the film takes itself-- but it's tonally all over the place. There's awkwardly inserted exposition and very little character development so consequentially it's hard to care about any of the characters. As an audience you can emapathize, but that's not enough, especially with all the bad acting. The gore feels unearned, especially the onscreen murder of children. Huge turn off and again goes along with the tone deaf nature of the directing here. The plot itself is very ambling and honestly considering how simple it is, a little hard to follow at times. It's so inconsistent. The fx however are pretty intense and will please fans of the violent gore genre. The CG is actually pretty decent considering and the mocap/compositing feels fairly natural. The editing could have used a few more passes and might have been able to turn this film into something better than the 2+ hr version, it gets repetitive and feels unfocused. For example restructuring and would be more effective with 25-40 minutes cut. This could be a 5 or maybe even 6 star but it just missed the mark.

However, there are no many other failures in the movie. Considering is obvious a low budget one, is able to be quite believable in all its story. In fact the movie is more Science than Fiction.Since Kubrick's' 2001 (and perhaps even before Artificial Intelligence) has been treated as the Demon who will destroy humanity. I am a tech person and believe me we are very far from that; however the events portrayed here are quite real for a fiction movie.A group of five weaponized robots are drop in the Golden Triangle; a place famous for the Asia drug dealing, in order to be tested. One of the robots parachute fail to open and a piece is missing so the robot with AI in it goes rogue.Three programmers are also taken to a city nearby to conduct the experiments guarded by a Black Ops and in continuous conferences with an Army representative and the private weapons company management.Unexpectedly, a rogue Navy Seal and a group of Doctors without borders get mixed with the locals and attacked by the robots too.Obviously Army no Private sector want witness so robots are set to massacre everybody; plus the tech programmers had to deal with the rogue robot that is getting conscious of the environment and trying to reconnect with the main server to acquire information.Places within the jungle with people living like tribes, had been used from many years back; to test lots of things including medicines and weapons because nobody (much less local government) cared about those people there. Artificial Intelligence first requirement is to collect information and establish relations between data. The second step is basically statistics.To be more clear; based on the data what are the probabilities certain events to occur.In this movie, weaponized robots are controlled by people. The concept that one rogue robot try to make decisions for itself (collecting information from the environment) is basically a failsafe that most devices have and is quite logical in sophisticated systems designed to be autonomous if necessary.Characters (particularly the people being attacked ) act realistically. The Navy Seal try to save everybody but when thinks get ugly he takes of doing nothing and letting people being killed, in order to avoid worse things.People are really afraid and act based on their stress; not always right but with a logic.Sadly there are some melodramatic long scenes that should have been edited or changed. Those scenes slow down the pace and are somewhat unnecessary.The end even in my opinion too melodramatic, follows a logic; nobody will create a machine that powerful without a safety rule of protecting human life (Asimov).I can only say that Director and Screenwriter Mark Toia has made an incredible job in what appears to be his first and only film.

In fact, I was rooting for the robot to clean house and just blow them away.Some of the acting felt really forced and try-hard, like a 9-year-old was trying to impress their parents with a dramatic reenactment of what they saw an amateur do on TV.I've noticed this trend in recent movies - this forced kind of acting, even in huge budget movies like the most recent Star Wars installments. Take note of how many times the actors hyperventilate when they are afraid, excited or just trying to talk to someone. Forced and one-note.If you want examples of fear expressed wonderfully, watch Ripley in Aliens when she first discovers the queen, or the scene when Tom Cruise pulls off his mask in the middle of a gigantic room full of menacing masked onlookers in Eyes Wide Shut. These are great examples of believable fear emoted without having a damned asthma attack.I feel like writers and actors of today don't understand nuance or subtlety. It's all over-the-top popcorn variety schlock. Just fill the screen with screaming meat targets and that should be enough to make the audience to feel sorry for them when they die.They think the way to invoke tension is by directing actors to shriek and shout at everything when things get a little tense. They don't know how to balance it out with some humor or downtime.Millennial writers and actors could learn a lot from old school classics to learn how to better their craft and make characters relatable and even likeable.Movie wasn't terrible, but this trend of mediocre acting doesn't help the its rating."}, {"id": 99, "text": "I went into this movie not having even seen a trailer and honestly with the current situation new releases are few and far between I have been watching movies recently that I never would have under normal circumstances.Although fairly simplistic in it's plot, Monsters of Man was very good for what it intended to be with a good story, good practical effects, those robots looked good, and fairly good acting.

Sure this film had its flaws, but considering Mark Toia has never been a cinematographer, never written, produced, or directed anything in his life before, I say mad respect and serious props to you sir!So to those wannabe critics who gave this film 1's and 2's, give your heads a shake and learn to respect the work of an amateur filmmaker trying to make his mark in the industry. They all have to start somewhere, right? And I have to point out, that I've seen much worse films put together by seasoned filmmakers. So for Toia to wear these many hats and pull this off, this film should not be rated anything less than a 6/10.Now my main disappointment that could've so easily been avoided, was Toia's writing. Aside from some of the plot and technical issues (e.g. when you're caught between a rock and a hard place, always take the weapon!), the length of his screenplay's final cut runtime of 131 mins was absurdly long. There were far too many long, dragged out and unnecessary scenes. E.g. when kid's gangster dad dies, the ongoing crying, group hugs and whines was utterly and annoyingly ridiculous. And there were many of those scenes. So when I said could've so easily been avoided, Toia either needed an experienced editor and/or seasoned writer to look over his script, and cut out at least 20-30 mins. His pacing was actually quite good, that a 90-100 min runtime could've made this film great, instead of just good.Aside from Neal McDonough and Jose Rosete being the only recognizable and experienced actors, the remaining unknown and unexperienced cast performed impressively well. Sure, some where a little over the top and borderline annoying, but keep in mind they were being guided by an inexperienced director.The film's location settings were beautiful. The score was actually not bad and fitting, especially considering almost every B film's score is usually unfitting, overbearingly loud and annoying. The S/VFX were on point... I'm mean those robots were Chappie quality viewing.Toia is certainly an upcoming filmmaker to keep an eye out for. Thus with more positives against a few understandably amateur negative mistakes, Toia's Monsters of Man gets a very deserving 8/10 from me. I sure hope with his ending, a Part 2 will get made.

It was crowdfunded! It's actually an Australian film. I believe the majority was filmed in Cambodia. And I also believe that their website says something about it being filmed in 4 countries.I'm really not quite sure what the budget was. The film's website does not specifically state what the budget was. What it does say is that so many people donated so much money each. And it says that twice with different numbers, so it's kind of confusing. I may be wrong but it appears that it cost approximately fifteen million dollars. I may be doing the math wrong, and I may be way, way off. And if so I apologize. So to be honest, I guess I should probably say that I do not really know how much it cost to make.What their website does say though, is that the film was produced for only a very small fraction of the amount that it would have cost a major motion picture studio to make.I have seen movies from major motion picture studios that cost $150,000,000 that were not as well done or entertaining!I would have to think long and hard to think of another movie that had entertained me so well! Don't get me wrong, there are lots of other movies that I have seen that were very entertaining and well done also. But that's not the point. The point is that this is an excellent film.From the very beginning the action starts and it never ever really lets up! Every single aspect of the film was excellently done.You won't want to step away for a second. The acting was excellent. The music was excellent. The Special effects were excellent. And the scenery was excellent and beautiful.The whole movie was top-notch. I could not find fault with a single aspect of the movie. Well, there is one little tiny little nitpicking detail at the end that I could complain about. But to do that would require telling too much. And I don't want to do that. And to be truthful, it's not really something that was wrong about the movie, it's just that I think that I would've preferred something different to happen. But that's just my opinion.Anyway. I could go on and on and on. But suffice to say, that it was the best 2+ hours I've spent for a long long time.It never dragged, and the movie kept my attention the entire time.Kudos to all who were involved in the making of this film.

The innovations were very subtle in how the script was both allowed to flourish, and also flounder in areas. (probably executives in expensive suits holding him back when it DID flounder a bit) The slight faults really don't outweigh the overall brilliance of the production as a whole. He got this done in a very solid and satisfying way. My ONLY peeve with most movies is that they tend to over dramatize the grief moments, or hugging each other when they should be running for their damn lives. Cutting those moments by 2/3rds would be ideal. If I was a multi-millionaire, I would back his sequel to this film balls-to-the wall with ZERO 'Hollywood' influence and interference. It's very hard to keep a movie like this on-path with so many production people(and princesses) wanting to have a hand in the outcome. Despite all that, he succeeded, I believe. It's a film that has extreme subtleties that are missed by most viewers. There was a great amount of suspense in this film, albeit short-lived, but palpable and effective.Most scifi indi-flicks fail because of ego, a lack of ingenuity, laziness, bad writing and acting, but barely ever a lack of funding. That brilliance is usually always manifest, regardless of funding by appropriate script writing, casting, attention to proper editing, and especially believable acting. I can see some Hollywood executives wanting this film to disappear from the public's attention because it's premise is absolute gold! As is a sequel more than worthy of expectation. Seems like like Mark did indeed see that as how the ending resolved itself. I rarely stand in awe of such attempts unless a certain dedication of integrity to consistent story telling shows itself. I should also add that most reviewers of films on IMDB should be allocated to small islands in the most remote of places on earth with a few bananas and zero internet access. As a writer, I would work for free on Mark's next production because I solidly believe in the dream he has created. I wish him and his family the greatest success and future promise of building this franchise to greater heights, if only to finally set a new standard for what it is, and what it could eventually be.

Quirky bugs in the robots make them certainly less effective than a terminator but help to balance out a lopsided match-up.The human characters do a decent job and I quite liked how the bad guys were portrayed, Jose Rosette turned in a solid tough bad guy performance, but on the good guy front most of the characters were not that compelling, but certainly passable.For a movie that's over 2 hours I was entertained start to finish, I can think of probably dozens of movies this drew inspiration from and it was blended into a stylish modern good looking sci-fi action flick, with plenty of nostalgia, go into it less seriously and I think anyone can find something to like."}, {"id": 111, "text": "Some parts of the film had real potential: the drama of the tech guys stuck between their job, their passion and their principles or the semi conscious robot, but they went nowhere. Also, the other parts of the film were pretty bad. Overall I would say that it was a good effort, but way too long for its valuable content and ultimately boring. Wasted opportunity, this film was. I mean, it wasn't that far apart from District 9 in terms of acting and effects, but the story and plot were vastly inferior.There were easy fixes, too. For example instead of a bunch of random Americans in the jungle, the main character could have just saved a bunch of the locals. The whiny young people that wasted most of their screen time brought absolutely nothing to the story and they probably got paid quite a lot for their mediocre efforts. And there is a scene in the trailer that makes you believe this could be something else, but it's the end credits scene, which is a dick move.Bottom line: mediocre film in which the most sympathetic character was a mute robot."}, {"id": 112, "text": "My wife was amused as I was screaming away at the storylines. But not complaining the story. It's one of those movies that has characters that are believably real. Plots happens coz it could and are logic. We see nerds tripping over rocks and stairs while running coz they don't run often. So they fall. We see frustrations when things go wrong. Real frustrations. Frustrations that make them do the exact same thing when they are stressed even though they know it has consequences for themselves. But it's their character. We see people who can cope well with stress coping well (they are the higher ups). Actual medical students attitudes are almost real. I've trekked through jungles before and being a doctor, I can relate to them. There's always the high strung one, the wannabe-cool one, the panicky one.The robots are good. Design and animation flawless for me. There's robot vs robot action. Man vs man action. Some robot vs man action and they do not drag on. It's short coz logically in real world normal people, even trained people in normal situations get tired. Anyone who has fought in competitions would not that 2 minutes is a long time.It does become draggy a bit in the middle. There are some plot holes. Overall good. Might have been better if they get a well known actor but then if it's an action-hero, it's gonna focus on that; the fighting action. This movie is kinda like Predator + Short Circuit + Hard Target + Halloween (maybe).Hope there's a sequel!"}, {"id": 113, "text": "Rapid paced dialogue with a gaggle of unlikable idiots who are apparently controlling a squad of killer robots in some outback craphole. I mean, what?What is the plot of this movie? It seems the morons make the robots more violent, then they are surprised they are killing civilians. Somehow the plot keeps dragging on and they get another robot to attack the other robots? I don't know, why can they command this one and not the other one... because of reasons.The entire wafer thin story is stuck together by spit and bubblegum that is technobabble and unrealistic unfounded sci-fi nonsense bordering on magic. Please do some research on programming, AI, robotics and anything else related to this topic before writing an over 2 hour long movie.The film was dragging at 15 minutes in, and got worse. By half way my brain felt like it was oozing out of my ears. There are no characters for you to get behind or two like and enjoy. There is no character development, none.If you wanted an annoying and illogical robot movie there are tons to pick from that are at least watchable like 'Robocop' or even better go watch the entire 'Terminator' franchise. Yes the later movies are crap but they are at least better than this.4/10 below average sci-fi with annoying idiots for characters and little plot."}, {"id": 114, "text": "In 1973 a groundbreaking science fiction movie was released entitled Westworld, written and directed by Michael Crichton. If the Monsters of Man script had been slightly revised, the title could have been SouthEastworld, written and directed by Mark Toia, featuring a bunch of college students on spring break visiting a sci-fi theme park in a Florida swamp, and getting way more excitement than they paid for.If nothing else, this movie serves as a warning to new writer/directors, even those who feel they are at Crichton's level, to confer with straight-talking critics, and do so often. Some of Monster's many problems might be avoided, including an overlong run time, dialog appropriate for potty-mouthed adolescents rather than adults, and the vomit scene that appears to be obligatory in all action movies these days.Ending on a positive note, the lead actors did fine considering the script they had to work with; e.g., some of them sitting at desks for half the movie looking really stressed, and others looking even more stressed as they try to escape trigger-happy robots."}], "reviews_amount": 115}
