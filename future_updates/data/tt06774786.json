There is NO WAY any honest person could give this a 9 or 10 rating. NO WAY.   Borrowed this from another review because is says it so succinctly:Complete waste of time. The acting was mediocre . The plot , story and message, was a total waste. Worst sci-fi movie that I've seen in years.Editing this movie down to 60 minutes or so would have maybe brought it up to a 3 star and wasted an hour less of my life."}, {"id": 4, "text": "I had high hopes for the first ~twenty minutes, then the laughter began.The aliens could only see living things, so it was disclosed that they were invisible by blending into the plants around them - why didn't they wear plant camo?!Why, for the final battle, didn't the humans attack from the surrounding corn fields where they are invisible to alien scanners, instead of out in the open in a suicidal attack?Why didn't the humans wear the alien armour after killing them? Or use more alien guns, even attaching them on Earth aircraft?How did the alien at the end know that an extended hand meant you put your hand in it and shake it in friendship? (Handshaking is a historic gesture to show you had no weapons)WHY did that one idiot at the end think that the aliens could now live in peace among them, ---&gt;&gt;&gt; when aliens demonstrated they had the knowledge to make a virus that could wipe out all human life, so now they could make more in the future in secret while pretending to be peaceful?! &lt;&lt;&lt;---Why didn't the human camp have perimeter guards? Instead the aliens just walked right into camp and opened fire.Why did the producers and director of this show make humans the bad guys in a few of scenes, like while trying to wipe us out by annihilation we're supposed to feel sorry for the female alien with an alien baby hurt by a battle, or an exaggerated display how brutal the human was beating to death the murderous alien, after his wife and son were captured and used as slaves before intending to release the virus to kill all humans?There's lots more wrong with this movie, I look forward to others adding to the list...if you are tricked into watching it despite all the warnings here lol!"}, {"id": 5, "text": "It's clear the 98 reviews are the directors friends giving this terrible film a 7.4 average.

I'm ashamed that this was even produced and filmed in Australia, only good thing it employed a lot of australians, but that's it., we have, as still do better than this in this country.

Production quality surprisingly good for the small budget (a fraction of what Hollywood movies of similar standards usually cost!), great casting and camera.Unfortunately, just as in many Hollywood productions these days, the writers or producers of 'Occupation' tried extremely hard to deliver politically correct messages to the audience: so we are speechlessly witnessing a whining football player in the arms of a strong Asian woman who tells him he 'shouldn't worry'. Later on, the former hamburger cashier lady turns into a military soldier commanding the Australian elite forces around. Over time, while the movie is still somewhat entertaining, the obvious political agenda became so annoying that I turned the sound off, until the final scene, when the same Asian woman had suddenly turned into the chief negotiator of the world, making peace with the aliens. Yet another movie destroyed by outerworldly political messages that turn entertainment into an unasked-for annoyance."}, {"id": 33, "text": "Occupation knows what it wants to be.

I'm very impress with the visual effects overall, and it feels like the effects team knows how good they are and sometimes gets corny with it, but that's ok, cause the thing is so live. They are trying to do an Independence Day like movie on a minor budget and it's working on me for the most Point. Some of the action sequences are strangely dramatic and a bit surrealistic without trying to be that. Very Ozploitation in it's tone. It's pretty cliche with the theme of everyone uniting over a common threat, But I'm far too impress with the large amount of sci-fi in what looks like a pretty small movie.

Here you will find an honest review of the film. I rate this a 5/10. ONLY watch this if you are dying for an alien invasion flick or have a lazy afternoon and have watched literally any other big budget alien invasion film. In a vacuum of the Australian film library, as one of their rare big action pieces this would have gotten a higher score, but based on other past and present movies I just cant. If this film had come out 8+ years ago or as a TV movie, I could forgive it, but not as a full release film. The film stars several semi-famous people from the region such as Temuera Morrison (Jango Fett from the prequels) and Stephanie Jacobsen (Kendra Shaw on Battlestar Galactica: Razor) and everyones acting is honestly all over the place. At times its quite good, but there are far too many eye-rolling moments that it completely torpedoes the decent moments of acting. None of the other supporting cast does much to help or really draw you into the movie, which is a shame. The plot itself is similarly to the cast just all over the place. We start out in a small town and at first I was worried that it would be a Signs-esque flick, where we barely see the aliens or their tech (Yes, I know the Signs theories, I mean in relation to how the movies are compared to one another). Fortunately for the audience we dont have to sit back and watch 45m of paper-thin 'character setups' as the alien attack happens quite quickly. Unfortunately we then stick with the characters as they hide out in old buildings, forests, and.... in corn. They hide in a corn field. The aliens are shown to have some kind of 'Predator vision' through their helmets but then half of the aliens arent wearing helmets and their predator vision is garbage. A majority of the film is just alien ground troops with an energy blaster-rifle. Almost no fortifications, heavy weaponry, or vehicles (even when the humans use attack helicopters on the ground troops). Their home base ship is nearly undefended, with a handful of ground troops on the outside and thats it. There are no weapons or defenses on the ship or surrounding their MOST IMPORTANT bit of technology, no cameras, no shields, NOTHING to defend their most important assets but literally just an open door. Also, this is supposedly happening all around the world, not just Australia, yet when we're told that humanity is fighting back, we still see no help from outside, nor do we see reinforcements when the mothership(??) is destroyed. We then end with Random Chick #1 (Stephanie Jacobsen) meeting with Random Alien #1 and making a peace treaty... I guess? Yet soldiers are still shipping out and there is world economic shattering damage done JUST to what we see of Australia at the end. We get a voice over about rogue alien factions and how humanity is working with them, but this *should* have been shown, not JUST told, while we see the aliens that just devastated their entire country on their side! Just smh... Lets just summarize by saying: Dont watch this for the plot. Get popcorn out, turn off your brain, and put on your best laughing pants. The aliens themselves are passingly done, fortunately not looking TOO much like cheap halloween masks, with touches of CGI (?) where appropriate, such as eye blinking. Their weapons and armor seem to change their mind CONSTANTLY as to what theyre able to do; sometimes theyre bullet-proof, other times not, sometimes you can just punch an alien to render it unconscious, other times they're invulnerable. Unfortunately, instead of using drones for ground troops, or providing them with vehicles or buildings, after the first assault using odd car-looking assault vehicles there are ONLY ground troops left. These aliens are supposed to be so technologically advanced yet they are using defensive tactics out of Game of Thrones. Just stick a few guards out front, we'll be fine. The aliens themselves are a bit of a......... very confusing point. They've destroyed their home planet and came to Earth to take it over. It seems that the aliens also have a civilian population with them, but the majority are soldiers and they only know one thing: killing humans gets them a new home. With their level of technology, it doesnt seem that they would need to travel to Earth just to make a new life. SURELY if the aliens have gotten to this point technologically they would have some kind of brains in their skulls but... the writers were more concerned with spectacle over any kind of reality. One of the things that will bother many, I'm sure, is the score. Its bland, generic, and pumped up WAY TOO LOUD frequently. It seems to be trying to emulate a lot of recent Hollywood action films with sweeping orchestral and thumping patriotic music but it comes off more like Battleship than Infinity War. With ALL THAT being said, this isnt a terrible movie. The effects are passing, the acting usually gets a pass (usually), the script and plot were a joke so its hard to tell to what extent this was the writers fault. The director and cinematographer had several decent points though neither was amazing.As stated, this isnt terrible, its all done decently well. This isnt a B flick, maybe somewhere between A- and B+? Honestly, if this movie had someone behind the film to tighten things up like the script and pacing and logic, this could have been a solid movie. The movie looks bigger than it is due to a lot of unpaid extras, which helped add a realistic touch to the film of random people being in your party after a disaster. If you are looking for something thought provoking or mind bending, this is not the place to look.

Plus, let's be real, the Australian accent is just fantastic. I thought the acting was actually fairly decent and even though the effects weren't Hollywood they definitely didn't disappoint. One of the only downsides was that the movie had what we like to call the Stormtrooper effect.

Clearly on a budget but the acting is solid and the cgi is acceptable. Comparable to a high quality straight to TV flick within this genre. Not an A list but not a B Movie either. Somewhere in between."}, {"id": 95, "text": "There were a couple of reasons I went out of my way to see this film, one of them being that it was an Australian sci-fi, and secondly because it was made on a budget of $6 mill. Honestly, I am amazed at how far you can stretch $6 mill these days when it comes to film making, and sometimes I wonder why it is that some of these Hollywood blockbusters blow out in cost the way they do. Then again, big name actors, and marketting, really isn't all that cheap, and one of the problems with this film is that there wasn't all that much in the way of marketing. In fact, I found out about it from some posters stuck on the side of a building in Brisbane.  Now, don't get me wrong, the acting in this film is absolutely appalling. In a way it looked as if the director sacrificed acting in favour of special effects, and the effects, for a low budget film, was pretty impressive. For instance a swarm of apache gunships dog fighting with alien fighters. Now that was cool. Okay, when I saw it on the big screen, it did end up looking like some really bad CGI, and in a way I probably can't forgive the film for that. The thing is that when you have the ability to make a low budget film in the end it can make or break you, and you really need to do it well for it to work. Unfortunately that wasn't the case here.  The thing is that the plot was basically one of those well worn plots. In one sense I would describe it as being Red Dawn with Aliens, though since it has been set in Australia, I suspect that the director is probably more familiar with Tommorrow When the War Began. I can sort of understand where he is coming from though, and having aliens as opposed to an unnamed invading country does work. Except that I've seen the plot before, and there is no real twist in it. As such, as a film, it does end up falling down. Basically the aliens attack, a small group flee to the hills and then become resistance fighters. There really isn't anything all that new here.  Sure, there are some pointed remarks about how the world has changed with the invasion, and that there is no going back to the way it was before. Basically they point out that this was what happened when the British landed in Australia. The problem here is that the people of Earth are actually much more adept at fighting back, and it also appears that the Alien's technology really isn't as great as to hold off not only rebels, but also getting their ships shot down. Then there is also the argument that there is probably no reason whatsoever that an alien race would want to invade the Earth, for multiple reasons. Okay, land is always a factor, but then they also work on the premise that there are many Earthlike planets out there anyway.  Honestly, I don't really want to give this film a bad rating, but unfortunately there isn't all that much to redeem it. Sure, the constant bickering between the rebels is somewhat more realistic that what we see in Red Dawn. For instance, we have a group of people who have never been trained as a military force, have little to no discipline, and are pretty disparate. Okay, we have an army reservist, and we also have a couple of footballers, but that is about it. Also, the animosity between the two footballers means that while they might play on a team, they aren't actually team players. So, while it wasn't a bad film, the acting, and the fact that it has all been done before, really means that in the end it is pretty average."}, {"id": 96, "text": "Dreadful doesn't even start to give it justice.

Plenty of action, and some equipment and technical help from the Australian army helps. The character development is quite adequate and the plot moves along well. Its long at over 2 hours, but that time passes quickly. Recommended for those who like action/sci-fi that is good basic entertainment.

The acting was solid. The characters were complicated and true to their strengths and faults. I had two issues with the film. Each individual scene were portrayed well, but the transitions were getting rough to the end. Something seemed off and the scenes were not tying well together. I believe it may be something with the script and not the directorial. The cinematography was spot on. The last issue was the music composition.

Right from the opening scene it is full of cliched garbage and bereft of a single once of originality. The cast play stereotypical white country bumpkins, with a handful of token Asians thrown in as a poor salute to multiculturalism. The story line is hackneyed and been told countless times previously. The actions scenes are beyond amateurish and enter the ridiculous almost from the first shot fired. The bunch of misfits who escape the initial attack should be in clown uniforms so bad are their combat scenes. For example - aliens attacking from the air with superior firepower and a Mothership the size of a small moon looking down upon all and yet these idiots drive around and into hiding with their vehicle spotlights on full and we are supposed to believe the bad guys don't notice? And it gets far worse! The Commander of the Australian Army troops is a woman wearing a uniform that is so ill-fitting and nothing like an actual Aus Army uniform and who has all the military bearing of an empty box ... and about as believable, poor casting that even stands out in a movie full of poor casting. Direction is sloppy and lacks originality. Little wonder the Australian movie industry is in dire trouble when they produce crap like this. I gave it a one out of sympathy."}, {"id": 156, "text": "I can't recall an Australian movie that embraces action in the way Occupation has done.

Pretty people rule!"}, {"id": 159, "text": "When I watched this film its rating was 6.0; that seems pretty inflated to me.The premise is OK: aliens arrive on Earth to take over, humans are caught by surprise in a small town in Australia where everyone was watching the teams battle on the football field and certainly didn't expect to be battling for their very lives. Some escape, others get rounded up by the aliens for unknown reasons. The reasons remain unknown, all through the film: if anyone knew why the aliens wanted captives, it'd have been nice to tell us.For me the letdowns started fairly early in the film, as I had trouble understanding the relationships between the main characters &amp; what made them tick. There were a lot of characters to keep track of too; it would have helped if there were fewer main characters, since the focus kept changing as we went from one to another. There wasn't much time in the beginning to get to know anyone, it went into action quickly.The acting wasn't terrible, and the actors seemed competent- what let them down was the script and the direction. The script says, drive away from the battlefield with headlights on, right down the highway; good thing the aliens are too stupid to have expected that, and apparently couldn't see them go. Any number of times people did things which seemed really peculiar for people facing the end of the world; again, the script could've used a lot of improvement. So many plot holes that made me groan could easily have been avoided.The CGI wasn't too bad, for a low budget film it was better than expected; but there were a lot of places I expected to see things but didn't. We saw a nice looking CGI starship, but when one got destroyed all we saw was the actors presumably looking at it being destroyed. There were any number of scenes where suddenly we went from an action film to a daytime soapie, and it wasn't just the women who were emoting all over the place, sometimes for nothing that I could fathom. This film wasn't really bad, it just irritates me that it could have been so very much better with a more polished script and a better director.

The picture theatre is about entertainment and enjoyment sitting with ya mates sharing a box of popcorn and just relaxin without a care in the world.

Too many subplots, and hardly any of the various story arcs involving the numerous main characters reaches a satisfactory conclusion.

But the pacing's great, I was gripped for all two hours of it, I didn't want it one bit shorter. I loved the seamless transition between small-town life and full-on war movie, that was handled excellently. I loved how the characters were developed so fast without it feeling rushed or implausible - I could really see that situation bringing out those traits in people. And I felt I was getting a close-up of one arena of a whole, vast conflict, not just a 'war' happening in microcosm that should have been easily squashed by groups from outside the area. It felt like it was part of an Earth-wide conflict! But where this movie roared was in the heart and belief everyone put into it. The whole cast were totally behind the director on this one, it's his second movie, the work of all lifted it into something that should have been released internationally. OK, 200 million dollar Hollywood movie it was not, but it had more heart than many of those I've seen. It totally deserved to be out there, to show what this guy can do given a sniff of a chance. Me, if I won several lotteries(!), I'd give him double the budget to take the follow-up Out There, humans and aliens in space together, using alien technology to see other worlds for the first time. See what the other races make of Humans, the new kids on the block, what we learn from them and what, if anything, they learn from us. Most alien invasion movies lead full circle with Earth killing all the aliens and going back to exactly how we always are afterwards. I've a feeling this movie could lead to a franchise/TV series (as did Alien Nation) and show what co-operation between species can achieve. I loved it (And the sound-track, which others gripe about, but then I love New Age music which it basically was!) And I'm looking forwards very much to the next one.

Pure balderdash!Anyway, Occupation while never lacking in energy, brute villainy, and a tonally inconsistent musical score, is one of the cheesiest and worst movies of 2018. At a convoluted and overlong 120 minutes, Occupation strives to be Independence Day meets War of the Worlds meets The Walking Dead meets Red Dawn meets Signs meets Arrival (uh talk about copycatting). Instead, director Luke Sparke fashions something in the vein of Battlefield Earth meets Planet 9 from Outer Space meets Saturday the 14th Strikes Back. Sparke as Aussie's version of Ed Wood, shoots Occupation as a jerry-built, show-and-tell project. Like I said, cheesy.Along with cheap special effects, sloppy editing, some laughable slow-motion shots, and the tired adage of documentary-style footage, Occupation's school play acting is pure abomination with its stock characters appearing one-dimensional and childlike. They bicker in cliche as they reside in their prescribed, Army state. As for the parodied aliens involved, well they're no prize either. Do you enjoy E.T.s dressed up in tacky Judge Dredd costumes and spouting off poor man's, Evil Dead jibber-jabber? Neither do I man.

Anyone giving this more than 3 stars has a direct tie to the film somehow and to the people boosting the score with 10/10 scores, come on- you made a dud, just deal with it. It is terrible, terrible film making underpinned by the worst screenwriting you can imagine. My girlfriend actually got annoyed because I kept groaning and randomly laughing at the absurdity of what I was seeing. The film looks like nobody involved was allowed to criticize or question any other person. The aliens look like something from 1990's power rangers and I bet you can't find one represented in any of the official promotion material, the aliens sound even worse. There are way too many leads and few come off well. I am sure some of them are good actors but none can make the material work, the 'Aussie-isms' in the first 5 min were way over the top. Some of the story elements don't finish. For example, the young Asian lad risks his life saving a blond girl and his affection for her is a notable part of the first half of the movie, but she bangs the town bum and that's the end of that, they never speak again. The military element is awful, the tactical choreography and discussion of tactics and war planning is cringeworthy, the Colonel acts like she is playing a role on playschool. Again, it is the writing. The alien soldiers have no soldierly skills at all, think Battle for LA where the invaders actually act like the soldiers they are. There is a scene where a spaceship simply cannot hit an RV going probably 60kph and the 'boss fight' on the farm, just don't get me started. Overall the scope is just too big. If you have $6 million don't try to deliver an epic. They could have had the ship big invade Sydney as a background plot while smaller alien crafts landed in the smaller towns to secure quiet areas to put the women and children aliens. Focusing on one of these smaller crafts would have created a smaller environment in which to tell the story (and would also explain why they were in a small town). It would also provide a better vehicle to drive the final ending. I don't know, I'm not an expert but the scale of the direct invasion of the town is just stupid. Ok, so two positives: There is a funny gag re the bi-pass where the farmer rants for ages about how bad it is then once the aliens attack goes we better use the bypass, it is faster. And a kinda smart bit where one of the characters makes the obligatory reference to Captain Cook but then basically says they are more advanced so let's try to accommodate them and see if we can live, at this moment I knew how it would end but it was an insightful moment, still the way they work towards this outcome (handshake agreement to fight for us, now go kill your own species), is not fleshed out anywhere near enough. To the people involved I don't mean to be nasty but if you do something again for the love of God please get more critical eyes to go over the script and make a smaller, better looking movie. If as much effort is put into the script as manipulating review sites (97% positive audience score on rotten tomatoes- lol), you'll be golden.

There are positives in this film it's got decent action and some spectacle but anything above 3 would be way too much credit for a rip off of a rip off of red dawn a film that's basically been made like 10 times already.

It also has a slight comedy touch to it which makes you wonder initially if what you're going to get is going to be more spoof, at least not taking itself seriously, or a proper alien invasion movie (the overall premise). In the end it fluctuates between all three at times, often unintentionally. The lead into the action takes too long for a modern movie, and the delay isn't used to build really strong characters. In the end what you get is close to soap opera level acting, that builds to an invasion scene that doesn't really make any sense. The invasion sees alien craft followed by foot soldiers attack a small town in Australia. We are left to assume the same thing is going on all over the world. This is a common theme in alien movies, it happened in Independence Day and Battle Los Angeles, not to mention the Skyline, Battlefield Earth, and War of the World's movies. However, why would an alien race, one capable of travelling likely millions of miles in craft that would have to be hundreds if not thousands of years ahead of us in technological capability, need to deploy aircraft and ground forces at all? Would not such a race have biological weapons of such lethality that they could be silently and secretly released on to the earth by an advance party, and as a result the whole human population of the earth is dead and gone by the time the alien main force arrives?How about advanced weapons of mass destruction, i mean we have nukes, don't they have serious bombs capable of flattening whole cities to save the trouble of clearing a house room by room like happens in this movie?How about drones, millions and billions of tiny mass manufactured drones, they could do a better job and they're less susceptible to being shot, strangled, or punched. In the end, the path this movies chooses to take is an old, worn, and long past it's time one. What happens next is the movie becomes something of a mash up from Red Dawn (the amazing Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen movie - not to mention some of the great 80's brat pack era members) and Falling Skies. The idea of a small band of humans holding out against an advanced alien race is to be frank ridiculous (as noted, technology would see us disposed of quickly). However what undermines this more is that the aliens in this really look like they've been put together using left over costumes from Lord Of The Rings, Most of them are about the size of Orcs, they wear a metallic armour that looks like poorly cast steel or iron, and it lacks any sense of fitness in design. The big issue is the fact that they have the same body construction as a human, two arms, two legs, torso, head - yep, just men in suits. In this day and age, in a time where we can do some really cool stuff with CGI and effects, choosing to put a man in a suit is just beyond lazy. The alien is the central focus of your audience attention, they want something cool, original evolved in a different environment. What we get looks like a rejected Tin Man from the Wizard Of Oz. Follow the lack of alien originality with their weapons seem to be semi automatic laser type weapons. They're large weapons, they show no real advantage over any modern battlefield rifle used today. They certainly have no advanced optics or flexible rate of fire option. I bring this up as again, it is a lack of imagination. It's like the Enterprise showing up and we learn that Captain Kirk and the crew have never heard of a refrigerator and instead keep all of their food in a dark pantry room in an effort to keep it fresh - the technological disconnect would just demand too much suspension of disbelief. All of this points to the lack of originality and imagination on the part of the writers and the effects people (although i suspect it really is the former and budget is the constraint of the latter).Now, despite all of the issues with the above, the cast, crew, do a really valiant job at trying to pull this off. Yes, most of the acting is at Soap Opera level, but they work hard and hold it together, most give reasonable performances. Where they are let down as actors i believe the script is to blame. The script and story direction is pretty awful in places. It moves deep into cheesy territory at times, and at others has quite real dark moments - it's like a script written by committee or by an author over several weeks where their mood changed a lot. What we don't get is a consistent scary alien flick, or a comedy or a thriller, In fact, it comes across more like someone decided to do a pretty decent job of videoing a theatre production. The other let down is the lack of central characters. The survivor group is large, yet few of them are well enough written or acted to really make them believable or sufficiently enticing to root for. IMO Stephanie Jacobsen is probably the most credible. The rest have very much of an air of Australian Soap Opera about them. Because the story is spread thinly across a group you don't really have a strong lead, there is certainly no Will Smith or Jeff Goldblum in this movie. Finally, the movie does jump around a bit in time, skipping ahead to (i assume) progress the story to the main action. However this then introduces more characters and you're still left wondering why the aliens are really here and why they look like Orcs in badly made armour, and why they need to attack earth in some World War 1 style ground invasion. But, the clim progresses to a close, which unusually results in a peace being brought between the victorious rebel humans (I mean as if there were ever going to lose against an advanced alien race capable of designing a craft and then piloting from another universe - the advantage of technology in the discovery of America and Africa come to mind). Well, the aliens lose but hey, some of them form an alliance and battle together. So the ending falls flatly into the cheese zone - especially the awful handshake scene. So that about sums this movie up. The Australian Film and TV industry is really doing a great job growing up. You can't compare this movie to a hollywood blockbuster, but what you can see is that the Aussies are making a valiant effort, they just have further to go (but i'm rooting for you Australia). It's a B movie, it's not got a chance of being a blockbuster, but give them time and maybe a better story and script requiring less action and effects and they really could start producing something to rival hollywood. So all in, this is a hard movie to review and score, as it's a bit like that student in class who has really tried hard despite consistently coming in toward the lower half of the class, and yet keeps making a valiant effort and lands something aspirational even if it lacks genuine polish. You can't help but pat them on the back and congratulate the effort even if the final product left a lot to be desired. This movie is a C+ for a maturity as of yet E level Aussie film industry."}, {"id": 513, "text": "I was pretty excited when I read what the film was about, and even more hopeful when I saw who was in it (I really liked Stephe Jacobsen in BSG Razor &amp; Terminator series).

Had it been/done correctly, they could have cut the many dragged out scenes for the ridiculous 120 min length and made this a bearable 80-90 min film.The only redeeming qualities were the fairly decent SFX for a 4M low budget film, the cinematography was good, and the acting not bad for C-B-list actors, although they could have been directed better and would have performed better on a better screenplay. Some of the casting was just wrong - e.g. the 5' skinny blonde female army general(?) that couldn't act smh?I really wanted to like this film but I just couldn't bear the above negative points. I actually had to fast forward past the useless scenes.What's even worse is the once again 10/10 fake reviews these producers feel can sway the viewers. It's clear they are all fake when you click on the user and see it's their only review. Sad film making. A generous 3/10 from me. Don't waste your time with this one.

The actors and the FX team did their best but this movie slides from would be Hollywood, to Doctor Who TV show, to film school project in less than 30 minutes. I tried to enjoy the story but it makes no sense. I highly doubt if the writers have ever read any book about science or warfare. The characters are clich\u00e9s and you never really care about them. The film's high point scenes are cheesier than Pearl Harbor and The Patriot combined. Nearly 80% of the movie is shot on one location and again the director fails to compensate for it . The list goes on and on. Easily one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. Normally I would just rate this and move on, but when I read the reviews here I simply had to act.

A real portrayal of what the film makers believe would happen during an invasion of this nature. There are no precedents for a situation like this, and they have taken great liberties to create something believable and grounded, while also allowing for a wider scope to let the story grow.The cast are all tremendous with an ensemble cavalcade delivering touching, emotional and at times brutal performances. They take stock of the situations they're in, and are pushed and shaken, during victories and losses. For a number of the cast, this work is some of their best to date.Is the film perfect? No, but what film is. Are the performances perfect? Some, but not all, and again, no film has a completely perfect casting slate. But, this film deserves to be praised, for taking a chance, for pushing the boundaries of what local content can create. To achieve so much, wiht so little, is remarkable.

And there is a lot of cheese.What I did like was the locale, scenery is great, and whomever the extras are (I assume local folks?) come across as having a really good time.While not the best of movies, it's a slow but solid start to the producer, writer and director.

After that it's all downhill as the cast act out various scenes from Red Dawn and take the fight to aliens who have a lot of trouble hitting anyone with their superior weaponry. The humans are better shots with these weapons than the aliens.When not in their armour the aliens, for no sensible reason, wear rather nifty cloaks. Possibly to keep their wallets or their glasses in, possibly in some kind of homage to Clint Eastwood. We never find out. We have the usual cliched group of people and they form themselves into The Wolverines and the resistance in the woods that inspire the country's military.  Red Dawn 1984 plays a major part in this movie. Except Red Dawn 1984 was good and this isn't.The film benefits from not having the US Army saving the day and it gets #1 for that but as alien invasions go this has got to be among the worst.

I liked the music that was used, and the Movie was funny at times. I liked the use of technology and how it showed us the text messages on the screen.

And from reading some of their comments, I have to say it seems obvious some people are clueless on what consists of an actual BAD sci fi film! And ultimately how crappy some Australian films have been in the past! Australiens was a BAD Australian sci fi film.  Tarnation was a BAD Australian horror film.  Yet I found Occupation to be a fun romp, of a familiar nostalgic 80's vibe. Yes the aliens are somewhat stereotypical once their badass helmets come off. However Luke Sparke has proven in the past with his Aussie thriller Red Billabong, that he grounds his creatures in his features within physical reality.  So yes, naturally the common known rendering of an aliens image is going to be his first choice.  The helmets are very cool. A simple yet stylish, almost warrior like appearance, creates a fearsome image when these beings land and ultimately begin their massacre of humankind.  This is the film's main message. The threat to humanity from others. The need to battle to survive. Sparke does approach this with great class through his ensemble cast and the characters they each portray. Through everyday folks like you and I, who band together as a resistance team to fight back, we see the small take on the large. The weakened defend themselves against the strong. And that is where this story finds its heart. A small community in country Australia filled with everyday working folks trying to battle an intergalactic assault. With a dramatic quality similar to Tomorrow, When the War Began and the action sci fi edge of older films like Red Dawn, Occupation paves it's own path to an intriguing conclusion set to divide viewers.

I enjoyed it, and a big thumbs up to the Australian film industry. The acting and direction is great. The script covers many months of activity and reveals the personality of characters at quite a pace. The backstories are raced through so you only get a small background about them which needs to carry the characters personlaity behaviour that drives their actions through the movie and you don't quite get to feel immersed into the conflicts of characters as much as could have been the case. I think this story line alone could have been turned into a successful TV series of at least 4 or more seasons. This would allow each character's backstory to grow and allow the audience to be captured by the potential depth of light and dark sides of each character.

The main stars are Matt (Ewing), Peter (Morrison), Amelia (Jacobsen) and Jackson (Terrier). Other major gripes: why would aliens invade Murwillumbah, population 10,000? Why would they be playing Australian Rules and not Rugby League? Why do aliens always have to be humanoid &amp; approximately human-sized? Why do they need to have such large eyes? That being said, it's nice to see Aussie scenery &amp; hear our accent for a change and the filmmakers certainly tried.There's probably a bit too much shaky-cam and gun battles, but the main concern is that a lot of it comes across as too corny and/or earnest.

Over time, the group work hard to figure out the aliens' weaknesses and why they are invading Earth in the first place.While not perfect by any means, Occupation delivers the right amount of enjoyment one would expect from a film involving a hostile alien invasion. It's so rare to see an Australian film with such high production values and practical special effects, although there is the occasional scene of cringeworthy CGI. The aliens are smart and don't make stupid decisions, which helps add a sense of danger when the humans are fighting back against them. Also, I was surprised at how much I ended up caring for some of the main human cast, likely due to the fact that each one is given a distinct personality and aren't just boring cannon fodder for the aliens to mow down. However, some of the acting was quite poor in some scenes, with line-delivery on par with that of Neighbours or Home and Away.

Then not so much when the writers felt like tossing in an encounter between humans and aliens in a B-movie sort of way. Many scenes were just stupid and made worse due to poor directing, bad-acting and odd timing. For instance, for some reason a couple of rebels are suddenly running through the bush and stumble across a woman sitting in the field. The entire scene seemed odd and out of place. The writing and directing in this scene is also terrible and out of place.The army was also played by a group of low-budget actors who probably did their best.

I have no criticisms, no disappointments, no flat bits when remembering what I have just seen. On a scale of one to ten, I have no hesitation giving this a ten out of ten. Seeing Australia serve up how an action sci-fi movie should be done is quite remarkable, considering the budget and the cast. While there were plenty of familiar faces, none would be considered Hollywood A Lister's, I feel this movie will rectify that very quickly. I will be purchasing a copy asap, and waiting eagerly for the sequel, which, if this is anything to go by, will be a remarkable piece of sci-fi cinematic history. Kudos to the cast and crew, you have done Oz proud and from one avid sci-fi and action fan, a very genuine you bloody ripper.

By the way how they found our little planet amongst billions of stars from the opposite side with so much in between - who knows. It's so big even imagination doesn't help. It would have taken millions of years for our light to reach them so they should not have seen humans, and it would take millions of years for them to get here. 3.

Propulsion system never seen, but they hover as usual. 4. Alien spacecraft weapon looks suspiciously like exploding large firecrackers. Handheld weapons look like all other alien laser guns seen in movies. They must all go to the same arms dealer. 5.

It follows the residents of a small town as they struggle to fight back against alien invaders.Plotting here is immensely familiar, essentially being Red Dawn but with aliens. Not a bad idea by itself. The residents of a small Australian town; including Peter (Morrison), his wife Jenny, and children Bella (Stevens) and Samuel, Matt (Ewing), his girlfriend Amelia (Jacobsen), Jackson (Terrier), and his girlfriend Vanessa (Fish) are among the townspeople who are either going to see, or are involved with a charity football game. As the game is being played, aliens assault the field and most of the aforementioned characters, along with Dennis, Arnold, and Seth (Garred, Mesure, and Williamson) with the exception of Samuel and Jenny escape in Peter's RV while the aliens kill and capture whoever stands in their way. After killing a couple of aliens via strength in numbers, the survivors find out that the aliens cannot see them because of the way their visors operate. They devise a plan to fight back and save the captured humans using the enemy's own equipment. The rest of the movie follows the main group as they cultivate a resistance movement, lose it, and regain it via the army and take on the alien leader (Spence) before the aliens can release a virus that wipes out humanity.Characters are plentiful, but that does not mean they are exceptional. Matt is a mediocre leading character with little to set him apart from others in other films of the genre/sub-genre. At some points he gets too invested in the war (at least that is what the film makers want the audience to think, but how can you get too fixated on fighting for survival? Isn't that the point of the resistance?) And he seems to have a pill problem that never comes into play. Amelia is supposed to be his attachment to the world prior, but she never has much of an effect on Matt. Arnold, Seth, and Dennis are all fine supporting members that do not get much to do so they tend to get lost in the shuffle as the movie goes on. Peter and Jackson are the most interesting ones, both having promises to keep as they continue to fight on. Peter is trying to find his wife and son, and Jackson is trying to raise his newborn daughter in the midst of a war, if the character count was slimmed down the focus on these two and their problems would have been much more interesting. Performances are fine, with Morrison, Terrier, and Jacobsen being the only ones to rise beyond passable.Action is decent but suffers from the editing in some scenes. While some of the set pieces in the beginning are excellent (the initial attack on the football game comes to mind) in their ability to create mayhem and confusion in the best of ways, conjuring thrills and spectacle seldom seen in most studio tentpoles, there are times where a less-is-more approach would have served to benefit the movie. Some of the engagements are montaged like Rocky 4, having little in the way of clarity and lots of problems with visibility. Alongside that, clearly Sparke loves style, having unnecessary amounts of slo-mo in situations that do not benefit from it. Some good action does exist, but there is a lot that goes overboard.Technically the movie is very strong. Effects work is fantastic for a movie working with such a low budget, especially compared to something like Independence Day: Resurgence, a movie with a $165 million budget, and effects that are on par with this movie. The design for the alien armor is just plain badass, with scrappy, yet futuristic looking plating and helmets. Length is where the mechanics falter, with such a long runtime the movie fails to justify it. After throwing clich\u00e9 on top of clich\u00e9, and extraneous moments and characters, the movie does lose steam about halfway through. With a few rewrites the script could have been trimmed down by about 20 minutes and lost next to none of the impact. The whole virus plot point is just stupid, the alien invasion was already intimidating enough and there was just no need to add the extra act to the proceedings.Occupation is a serviceable, clich\u00e9, and far too long affair that would be trimmed for more enjoyment; but still has the highlights that warrant a single viewing. Maybe two if you've got to pick between this and other alien invasion movies like the 5th Wave or the Men in Black franchise.56/100"}, {"id": 537, "text": "Was this ever in a movie theater?

Furthermore crossing that distance for a single planet is absurd as it would be far easier to take one of the millions of other Class-M (Earth Like World) in our galaxy that would have been closer to this supposed races Home world.Lastly I lost interest in this movie after maybe 10minutes and found my self fast forwarding skipping to find good bits of actual Science or any small bit of Syfy.On a side note note Not having some kind of massive Armed Forces of Entire World and all the Nations of Earth uniting and rising up to meet this extra terrestrial threat is just a complete wash and discount of Ronald Ragand showing the budget for this movie.

He conveys stories so exceptionally well and his eye for cinematography is excellent.This was a movie of 2 hours that flew by all to quickly, whilst satisfying I really do want more of this film. Any great story makes you fell like this and this is.I can't wait for a sequel and there is already one apparently on the way.So yes a 10/10, was it perfect, not quite, but it deserves more that the trolly 1/10s so instead of a 9 this Aussie Sci Fi Spectacular gets a 10/10.P.S. I solemnly believe this may end up a cult classic like the iconic Mad Max ... time will tell."}, {"id": 539, "text": "Watching Occupation the second time around was even more powerful. More meaningful. Catching those little moments, those bits of dialogue, action, nuances, tones, subtle exchanges, glances, I had missed the first time, made the second viewing so much more rich and meaningful. It is rare these days to see an action packed film that takes the time to develop its characters, and places the focus on their inner turmoil. As viewers, we became intensely invested in their human tragedy and their safety. What a phenomenal movie. It is terrifying. It is electric. It is harrowing. It is relentless. But it is also beautiful, with its deeply moving moments of empathy, love, sacrifice, shattering grief, hope, redemption. Once the action starts - heart stopping, adrenalin pumping, recoil in your seat action - it never lets go. It does not give you a second to breathe. There is absolute chaos and utter terror. For the enemy is truly terrifying and truly brutal. I love the setting of the quiet little Aussie country town on the middle of nowhere. So real. So normal. So uneventful. So commonplace. So right. The scenery is simply breathtaking. Paradisiac and magical. But the real magic of this incredible film are indeed the people! The characters. And the artists who portray them. They are such a likeable bunch. There is an incredible, palpable connection and camaraderie between them all which gives this film a real sense of family. So many well known faces in Occupation, it does feel like watching family. Everyone is spectacular. It would be unjust to compare any role. Each one carries their weight in gold. But within this phenomenal powerhouse cast ensemble, I am truly in awe of the artistic excellence and mastery displayed by Dan Ewing, Stephanie Jacobsen, Zachary Garred, Izzy Stevens, Charles Terrier, Rhiannon Fish, Charles Mesure, Kat Risteska and of course Temuera Morrison, Aaron Jeffery, Jacqueline McKenzie, Erin Connor, and more. Occupation is that kind of movie, with its powerful message and endearing, stellar cast of characters that digs a little alcove in your heart and settles there.  I want to see it again!!!!"}, {"id": 540, "text": "It's 11PM. Netflix told me this movie was 99%. My wife just couldn't. She gave up after one hour.I'm writing this review while watching the last 20 minutes....in order to SAVE humanity of boredom and anger for refusing to give up and watch this Oscar winner to the end.To the Aussies: So you make fun of Americans for making some bad movies, eh? Well, if we're sitting in a bar drunk and you point to He-Man, I'll point to this masterpiece. And I'll win that argument. Case closed. At least Dolph Lungren had a shiny cool sword.Ok.

One of my simple ways of judging a movie is, If I'd gone to the theater, and paid money to watch, would I have gotten my money's worth? And yes, I believe this would have been worth it. It is not a GREAT movie. It has it's shortcomings, for sure. But it IS an entertaining watch. I suppose it depends on one's frame of mind. It reminds me of a very, very good B movie. It rips of many earlier shows. Falling Skies, Red Dawn, and many others. I thought it a bit of a reach that the aliens decide to launch their conquest at a ball game in Australia? And make Sydney their base of operations. But once I got passed that? I enjoyed it. Started it late one night, and watched the whole thing. Acting wasn't terrible; writing was ok. Effects were quite decent. In some ways, it reminded me of Mad Max. Not really a polished product, but entertaining. As I write this, I just finished watching Annihilation. A truly slow paced, big budget, Hollywood production. Utterly boring, over pretentious, and tedious to watch. Occupation is FAR better than that!

It wasn't even good in a bad movie kind of way on a par with something by Asylum studios.

These ratings are obviously cooked."}, {"id": 543, "text": "Most of the scenes, acting, special effects, dialogue were bad. The rest were just dreadful.There were some heavily-disguised clues that this movie had some cash put behind it, but the production team decided to waste it and make it look and feel like an ultra-low budget high school drama competition entry.Not a single character was believable or remote engaging. If they'd all died, I wouldn't have given a monkey's. In fact, if the entire cast had all been killed off within the first 5mins, I'd probably have rated this film a 10/10 for doing what I wanted to have happen for the remainder of the film.Whenever something truly shocking happened (death, explosions, being spotted by the aliens), the standard response by the actors was to say S&amp;@#! and in a manner that you'd expect to hear if they'd accidentally dropped an egg onto the kitchen floor.Rather than Occupation, they should have called it Dreadful. It would have given a far better indication of what the film actually was.It's an embarrassment, for a reasonable budget production. That's all. Really."}, {"id": 544, "text": "If you like Tomorrow When The War Began or Falling Skies then you will probably like this. Certainly there is never a dull moment. But it cannot be consumed by adults. The script is very ordinary, seen before and full of too often repeated phrases. The soundscape is old-fashioned and cliched, though it does do an admiral job of telling the story as much as anything else. The explosions and gunfire are crackling and terrific, but alas, make little sense, usually too small compared to the artillery, and a little like fireworks. There is way too much over-acting, and irritatingly this goes on throughout. It's as if an Australian movie making outfit is trying to compete with American B-movies from some decades ago. There is buckets of action and no blood, save some blue blood splatter from whacking the aliens. There is at least one scene of terrible violence against a captured alien that would put this piece out of bounds for any child under 16. I'm pleased that Australian film is prepared to put this much budget into a sci-fi movie. The graphics for alien spacecraft, jets, helicopters and 3D holograms was pretty good. The aliens are dress-ups, and that's not good enough for film anymore. Falling Skies got around the problem with robots, which makes sense. We are talking about a culture that has the technology to cross galaxies. Why would they use flesh and blood soldiers?

What's sad is that films with similar budgets have excelled. The problem with Occupation is that it tries to be a big Hollywood film, but fails miserably. Why didn't they scale back the story? In fact, why was this ever made in the first place? Just stop. I don't care its Australian made. If it's bad, it's bad.EDIT: I read a review below which, like most, was probably written by someone tied to the film.

There's no problem with tears. Except when they are on and off like a tap with no follow through of the background story. On several occasions Jacobsen presented on demand tears that felt completely out of context two seconds later.However, what really ruins the experience more so than out of context tears. Is the attitude of two lead actors, Morrison and Jacobsen, continually hunting for the limelight as if in some desperate plea to be remembered. While Ewing did his best to water down the impact of Morrison and Jacobsen. The viewer soon starts to feel an affinity for Ewing as he tries to bring balance to the battle of the egos. How soon does it start to become tiresome. About 30min in the movie becomes a chore to watch as your mind deals with the complexities of the toddler like behaviour from Morrison and Jacobsen vying for your attention.Neither of the characters Morrison or Jacobsen played are the type that demanded attention. The viewers attention toward those characters should have been earned. In contrast, Ewing's character, became more endearing to the viewer. Just the rant of an avid movie goer. DYOR etc."}, {"id": 551, "text": "As an Australian film attempting to appeal to a mainstream audience, I desperately wanted to like this film. So badly did I want to like it, I gave it concessions I wouldn't otherwise give a film.But in the end, Occupation (2018) made itself impossible to like, owing mainly to major failing in the writing (Luke Sparke) and editing (David Napier). Before we dig too deep into the details of this films failings, we should explore what there is to like about Occupation.In a pivot of the Australian literary and big screen classic Tomorrow, when the war begins, Occupation tells the story of a dysfunctional group from a rural New South Wales town who set about defending against an invading alien force. Art direction (Ross Wallace), costume design ( Tracey Rose Sparke) and Special FX (Spark FX) use the best of a small budget to drive compelling visuals for an immersive world. Sure, the break away walls are cardboard but most audience members won't notice.Veteran actor Temuera Morrison (Aquaman, Starwars III) does his best with poorly direction, scripting and a mostly Australian soapie cast; Dan Ewing (Home &amp; Away), Rhiannon Fish (Home &amp; Away, Neighbours), Zac Garred (General Hospital), Charles Mesure (Xena: Warrior Princess, Hercules: The Legendary Journey) and Charles Jazz Terrier (Neighbours).There is a certain amount of relatability to some of the visuals, where they could have been shot on the corner of any Australian street. Others are just down right beautiful, showing off the best of Australian cinema. These should have been strengths, building audience attachment through relatable sets and situations, unfortunately their effort is wasted.Characters are poorly written, with little genuine motivation and a distinctly soap opera style of dialogue. These characters don't feel at home in their scenery even before the invasion begins, and their conversations are an endless reminder that these aren't real people.The editing however is perhaps the most egregious failure, suffering from amateurish shot selection, weird cuts, disruptive pauses and a consistent lack of continuity. Montage is overused to rush through key plot points in order to make up time for overly drawn out sequences about ultimately nothing. Do we really need 51 seconds of pregame football shots that add nothing to the plot?At times shots from several minutes earlier are recycled for no discernible reason, throwing continuity off completely. At other times shots featuring camera moves that add nothing to story and actively throw off the mood are used seemingly just because the director thought they looked cool. The disjointed nature of the editing leaves the viewing experience disturbed, as if we are watching an acid trip through someone elses' eyes. That might have been a fun plot twist at the end to tie it all together, but sadly it would seem unintentional.As the writer, director, co-editor &amp; executive producer; the failings of this film can only lie with Luke Sparke. Occupation had at it's core the makings of a solid Australia sci-fi action film, but threw them away due to one mans ego. I have no intention of watching the sequel to Occupation, but one can only hope that Luke Sparke trusts in the ability of others to wear some of these hats, so he can focus on just one function in the film making process.Grossing just $21K worldwide at the box office, Occupation was poorly received on initial release in 2018. After being picked up by Netflix in 2020, it's likely to be seen by many more who will equally see little redeeming about this film. If you have a choice, Occupation is one to avoid. Plenty of better Australian cinema to watch."}, {"id": 552, "text": "I got out of worse situations than this. Been married three times.This must be the stupidest movie ever made about aliens who want to use our planet as a replacement. We already saw it happening in War of the worlds and Independence Day. But those movies overwhelmed us with expensive special effects and immense battles between earthlings and non-earthlings. The most original thing about Occupation is that it doesn't happen on American soil but on the other side of the world. Down-under in Australia in particular. What they did learn from the American versions, is the patriotic waving with a flag. So expect a half-burned Australian flag somewhere near the end.Right now, there's a 15-year-old Swedish girl who comes to the European Union to fight for better environmental measures before we all ruin our planet. Apparently, these alien invaders haven't listened carefully to their local Rise for climate movement and thereby seriously destroyed their planet. The moment the Alien chief announced this, I laughed spontaneously. I don't know if there were any environmental protests in the world when they released this movie, but I thought it was appropriate. But that was the only humorous thing I had to laugh about spontaneously and sincerely. The rest of the film makes you want to cry actually. Except for the first 15 to 20 minutes. I still had hope then. Admittedly, the special effects weren't impressive, but it looked promising. Those 20 minutes were fully utilized to present the entire group of people that formed the basis of the revolution.First, there's Matt Simmons (Dan Ewing) and his wife Amelia (Stephany Jacobsen). He's a recovering Australian Football player who re-enters the field after taking a dose of pills against his headache. Furthermore, we meet Peter (Temuera Once were Warriors Morrison) and his beautiful daughter Bella (Izzy Stevens) who happened to have chosen this small Australian village as a short-term stop during their trip with a mobile home.And then Jackson (Charles Terrier), a teammate of Matt who has taken over his role as the team leader and explicitly shows that, and his girlfriend Vanessa (Rhiannon Fish) is introduced. The moment the power goes out and an apocalyptic, stroboscopic light lightens the sky, it's the beginning of a murderous alien invasion. And this jumble of persons ends up in Peter's mobile home (along with local commentator Seth Grimes played by Felix Williamson). And yes, they know how to get away from this superior breed and end up hiding in a derelict farm.The story Occupation has been told countless times. Nothing new under the sun. Naturally, those randomly gathered individuals become the basis for an uprising against the alien invaders. For that, the very first mutual feuds and misunderstandings must be cleared up, in order to conclude that cooperation and togetherness are a fearsome weapon. Even against creatures that have evolved much further technologically.What really impressed me was how amazing it sometimes looked. Certainly when you realize that the budget was considerably smaller than that of an American blockbusters. The CGI used for the Martians' mothership was certainly not bad. The advancing ground troops certainly had an old-fashioned look and reminded me a bit of Scifi from the 70s. And yes, when they removed the helmets of the aliens, their appearance was kind of clich\u00e9 with those eyes of a fly. The most realistic thing in this movie was the time period. The shown conflict lasts more than a few days. A few months are being bridged. But the story is so full of unrealistic and ridiculous things that you'll forget about that real soon.A small anthology. Extraterrestrials conquer the planet with their giant spaceships and an army of laser-equipped stormtroopers. What do you do if they infiltrate into your hideout? Indeed, you just crawl behind a mattress or door. Guaranteed safe.And when you conclude that natural surroundings act as a kind of camouflage, why don't you use that to protect yourself all the time? Apparently, they realized this at a certain point in time. When they approached a legion of aliens, they were able to avoid a confrontation by driving into a cornfield. The upcoming troops immediately lost track of our heroes (Stupid aliens, they just turned left) and stayed behind just looking around in a dazed way.Do you remember the troops the Americans gathered to start their attack against the mother ship? Here they save the world by deploying an ultimate attack with roughly 12 people. Even in a Smart, prepared for the upcoming war. And when someone just escaped death and was lying in bed comatose for a long time, you can get him up and running immediately by throwing a bucket of ice-cold water over him. And the final boss fight is just too grotesque for words.But especially the end is totally whacked. Finally, they succeed in overriding the cruel conquerors and then suddenly they get all evangelical. Remember that phrase about turning the other cheek? In short, half the population was disintegrated or became slaves, and then they are going to shake hands and talk about improving the world by working together as a united force? Any spiritual or religious movement could use this as a study material.It's strange they are suddenly so kindhearted when you compare this with the scene where Temuera Morrison takes care of a captured alien. That was pure rage. But there are more of these oddities to discover in this courageous attempt by the Australians to prove that they are also capable of producing Scifi. In any case, I hope that if we ever have to deal with an alien invasion, these Martians will also be as tame and stupid as those you see in this movie."}, {"id": 553, "text": "HAHAHAHAHA!Oh I've never had such a hard laugh watching a movie.
