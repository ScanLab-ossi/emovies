The first one wasn't amazing or anything, but I liked it. I was looking forward to this, but oh my god it was AWFUL. I can't believe I wasted seven whole dollars to rent it. All they did was focus on the sex because they can show it now. That's all that happened. Sex and toxicity and completely unrealistic plot lines about being an intern. Plus a bunch of other terrible stuff. It just got worse as the movie went on. Don't waste your time."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I wanted to like this one but everything was just rushed. Nothing built up and it just felt flat. The only redeeming thing about the whole movie was Hero Fiennes Tiffin.

After 10mins i wanted to leave"}, {"id": 3, "text": "The relationship is just so toxic. There is no character development and the slut shaming is so disappointing.

Wouldn't recommend."}, {"id": 7, "text": "The first film was bad, that's just a fact, the trailer for the second one is absolutely horrendous. How is this a franchise? And there target demograph for this film makes it all the more disturbing. Young girls are gonna see this and think it's okay to be in a clearly toxic and abuse relationship as long as the guys handsome and a complete tool, it'll be fine. The first one was bad and I'm pretty damn sure the second one won't change my thoughts."}, {"id": 8, "text": "One word can totally describe this ,,movie'': Trash.

I'm upset with how it turned out. Hardin is problematic, chaotic, and so toxic. He had no character development, other than the same cycle of being hot, to fighting someone, to throwing stuff, to forgetting anything happened. Where's Tessa's independence? Where's the female empowerment? Where's the individuality? It's almost as if she has nothing to her other than being with Hardin. She even works in publishing, reading, and writing, and they STILL couldn't give her ANY independence and personality? This movie poorly represented diversity. I saw no plot other than s*x, and swearing. There was a bit of sl*t shaming in there, along with Hardin having s*x with Tessa TWICE while she's under the influence of alcohol. Even if she said yes while she was drunk, it doesn't follow the guidelines for consent. If you give full consent to s*x, YOU CANNOT BE DRUNK! Their relationship hadn't changed at all from the first movie. It's a shame people will see this movie, and begin to romanticize a relationship like the one Tessa and Hardin has. Although, because of the toxicity, I'm not sure I can even say they had a relationship, due to the horrible lack of communication. Please stop giving the antagonist, assumably Molly, nothing but the title of a mean girl. I get it, she's the villain. But sl*t shaming her, calling her a wh*re, and giving her no personality is boring, classic, and clich\u00e9. Oh, and I'd appreciate it if you would NOT romanticize and glorify using alcohol as a coping mechanism, along with destroying physical objects, therefore worsening the love interest, and their relationship with the main character.Oh, but it's ok, we can continue to pretend it's okay to do the following things I've just listed, because we like to ignore those points, do we?It's not a good movie, just don't waste your time on it."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I'm sorry I love the books but this movie didn't use major plot points from them. It barely had a story and yes it may be a bit better than the first one that's not saying much. I don't understand how anyone who read the books enjoyed this movie. Like it has no story whatsoever!"}, {"id": 12, "text": "It was so bad. There was no plot! Hardin is terribly acted and god knows they aren't recasting him for the third movie.

A total waste of money and time."}, {"id": 14, "text": "I wish I never saw this movie. I've never seen such a bad movie in my life. Do yourself a favour and don't watch."}, {"id": 15, "text": "After We Collided has to be the worst 2020 movie- if not worst movie- I've seen so far. And trust me this years movies haven't been too great. The whole thing is a toxic mess that is just a trainwreck I couldn't stop watching. The acting was awful and I hated Tessa more this time around. Hardin was just as terrible as before and the script had to be the worst part. This is possibly the worst script ever. I thought this movie would be better considering all the tens, but I found myself hating the concept and movie more."}, {"id": 16, "text": "This film was so good compared to the first one. The combination of romance and action with a bit of comedy keeps you hooked to the screen until the end. The cast did an amazing job bringing this book characters to reality especially the male lead. The actor portrayed his character with such conviction that its intensity was reflected on screen and at some point, you started to feel his pain and agony. Overall its something worthy of a watch."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Tessa is stupid. I watch this with my older teenage daughter and had to talk to her about how wrong the movie was. It's never okay to be in such a toxic, abusive relationship like that. Talking, cursing, yelling at one another like they did is never okay. Hardin needed to figure out himself first and be healthy enough to care for and respect himself before he could be in a relationship. That didn't happen. He didn't go through the healthy process and therefore their relationship will continue to be toxic. Tessa didn't have respect for herself either if she thought being treated like garbage is okay. Bad message for people in relationships. Highly disappointing and not a good message for teens!!"}, {"id": 18, "text": "I loved it. Big improvement from last movie. Really want to get sequel After We Fell."}, {"id": 19, "text": "A huge improvement from the first movie!! Much more interesting and actually had a proper storyline. I would definitely recommend checking it out"}, {"id": 20, "text": "I was really happy with what i saw, it stuck to the book this time and i was amazed with Hardin's and Tessa's chemistry\u2764 It was a bit rushed though but it was worth it as we got to see alot of scenes from the book! I hope the story continues and we get the last 2 movies\ud83d\ude0a\u2764"}, {"id": 21, "text": "To be honest i was disappointed..not the best movie and the acting of some actors is not that good and it's just so weird like how tessa went from 0 to 1000 in like a few weeks essentially not a totally bad movie just not good there's something missing from it like something big..and also 1 hour and 45 minutes is not enough to tell the whole story i like the movie i do but overall it is not that good..now i've read a bit of the books and i've watched the first movie and the first movie is much better. also the second film i don't like the way they shot a few of the senses just not really good. i would not recommend this to anyone..(well at least the second movie) i would just recommend to watch fifty shades lol"}, {"id": 22, "text": "AWC was amazing! The scenes were just like the book and nothing like the first film! 10/10 from me!"}, {"id": 23, "text": "I honestly loved the movie, it was 10000x times better than the first and i'm seeing forward to the next two films."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I watched the first movie so I wasn't expecting much but i found myself really enjoying this one. Like others have said, AWC is an improvement. Is it because it follows the book more closely? I don't know... I read the books and i can't say it was one of my favorite series. In fact I found book Hessa's tantrums, break ups and make ups quiet obnoxious. So i personally liked that much of the back and forth were cut out. AWC was entertaining - there's drama, comedy, romance. Was it hokey and cringy at parts? Sure, but with an easy story to follow, pretty people to look at and an escape from reality I say it's worth the 1 hr 45 min"}, {"id": 25, "text": "Sooo i read the books before the first film came out and was low key disappointed with how different it was to them, but awc definitely made up for it. i'm not one to cry watching movies but your girl was balling her eyes out in the cinema watching the 9 days, and when tessa was in hardins nightmare ... stop. the combination between the romance and drama was amazing. anna and roger did such an amazing job, and obviously hero and jo were just as good and definitely gave us the book hessa we deserved. so insane thinking it all started on wattpad and now it's on the big screen. can't wait for awf and aeh."}, {"id": 26, "text": "After We Collided stuck along with most of the scenes we read from the book I'm so surprised on how Roger did it! Every single detail he got right from the moment Roger got to be the director this time around, I definitely want Roger to come back to film After We Fell and After Ever Happy because he will surely bring it out a lot more like he did in After We Collided I'm surprised by how much footage they filmed for the movie with only having one month to film it all, so make sure you read the book series along with the movies so far because when After We Fell comes out it's going to be even more interesting! 10/10"}, {"id": 27, "text": "First of all this movie was way better than the first movie and much more true to the book so it makes you wanna see it again and agian"}, {"id": 28, "text": "Terrible acting, one of the cringiest movies ever really this movie isn't more than just a terrible love story for teens mostly girls. If you are 14 and still watch these kind of movies you need help."}, {"id": 29, "text": "If you've read the books there is no doubt you are going to love this! They so cleverly included so many important scenes even though there obviously isn't enough time to include everything. I wasn't sure I was going to like the new dynamic of adding Trevor into the mix BUT Dylan makes it impossible not to love him. Jo is absolutely amazing and the evolution of Tessa is striking in every way but Hero absolutely steals the show. His haunting looks, emotional vulnerability and insecurities completely embody book Hardin. The Christmas scene between him and Ken had me in unexpected tears. Cannot wait to go back and watch it again."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I personally think that this film is way overrated and I have no idea what is found enjoyable in watching two people struggle in a toxic relationship that's bad for them. Through the entire movie, all that happens is fight scene, make-up scene and then sex scene then the order repeats over again. Their is no plot or theme or purpose of the movie except watching adults yell at each other and act way too immaturely for their age. There is a lot of spins in this movie that you can't focus on one detail. The movie also mentions Tessa going through a life changing dilemma!! A dilemma that is not approached or pointed out in the movie so basically, there is no backbone or a point to the movie except the bad life choices."}, {"id": 31, "text": "I fell in love with the cast of this film from the 1st film and i was invested in the cast and the story .The 2nd movie was full of love making .What i love the most about this film is it tells the truth about how easy people can get the wrong idea or miss understand eachother it happens all the time .This movie shows you how easy that it can happen .I am so excited to see the story unfold ."}, {"id": 32, "text": "I was so surprised that it is even possible that anyone can seriously make a movie like this. So fake and predictable"}, {"id": 33, "text": "I understand that the movie is not supposed to be too long like the book but everything was too rushed. The scenes weren't developed enough to make actual sense and honestly the characters kinda lacked emotion. Even drunk Tessa looks so normal you'd wonder if she was actually drunk. If I'd not read the book, I'd be so confused as to what exactly I was watching. I still love the story but if there's to be another sequel, there should be more emotions and scene developments to make it make more sense to those who havent read the books before."}, {"id": 34, "text": "I love this movie!

I took my partner with me.. who hasn't even seen the first movie and he loved it. He made me watch the first one once we was home. The way this movie captures the pure emotions that are written in the books is fab! Can't wait for the next 2 movies!"}, {"id": 36, "text": "This movie brings to life some of the delicious scenes from Anna Todd's addictive After series. I have read some complaints about sex while drunk--come on. Couples have sex when they are drunk- they aren't on a first date or just getting to know each other. I am probably being generous with my rating as the storytelling could be better: less planned out sex scenes, more dirty words like the book, and a slower pace to really show character growth and introspection. But hey, they took this amazing roller coaster of a book series, found two gorgeous people to act it out, and by God, I am not going to complain."}, {"id": 37, "text": "As a huge fan of the books I was excited for this film is was more like the book then the first one and brought the book to life...the acting, the romance, the drama and the intimate scenes where amazing"}, {"id": 38, "text": "Massive improvement from the first book, storyline is just like the book, much more consistent and reticent of book Hessa. We finally get proper book Tessa and Hardin, the emotion was absolutely amazing and the chemistry was better than the first film by far.

Absolutely loved it and cannot wait for After We Fell, hope it's directed by Robert Kumple because he delivered it perfectly!"}, {"id": 39, "text": "This film was perfect!

I don't know what the problem was with this one, I didn't feel any chemistry. They didn't have Tessa and Hardin vibe at all.

They did so much better than the last time."}, {"id": 51, "text": "Was worried about how they did the first movie which was made without the foresight of a series. This does what it needs to and fills in holes made in the first movie. No way could they fit all the drama from the books in an hour and a half movie. I'm looking forward to the movies to come.It's a fun, young film. Don't go into thinking it's a serious drama, although some themes are pretty serious. Give this series time to grow with the characters."}, {"id": 52, "text": "One: I felt more character from all of the actors in the first movie. The more seasoned actors in here, Dylan, Candice, a few others; they weren't as painful to watch. I actually found the only scenes I cared for involved Sprouse because of his ability to stay true to form with his character: charming, intelligent, and sensible. However, this was (hands-down) a rush job. Little to no flow. The actors can only do so much with what they are given, but come on. I honestly expected better.Two: The fault most certainly originates in the script. Why? Just why...? I admittedly enjoyed After more than this one because of the simple fact that I did not read the book series until after I watched the film. After I read the book series, I appreciated that with such an annoyingly repetitive, drawn-out storyline to go off of, the film had potential to make Tessa &amp; Hardin's story more interesting, and thus, more appealing. But they ruined that chance with this film."}, {"id": 53, "text": "So much better than the First. The books were just amazing. When the first adaptation was released I was just so happy and right then so disapointed by that thing for young teenager, without any relation with the book. But this sequel follows the book very well. Hoping that there will be a 3 !"}, {"id": 54, "text": "I loved the second movie. Everything about it Hero and Josephine's chemistry has become so much stronger and their character development was amazing.

Sure it's from both their POV but there is much more from the side of Hardin and they come back to his narrative near the end. I feel that while the story between Hardin and Tessa is being told relative to the book it's lacking the outside parts that make their story that much more in the books. It's much less a college romance based around navigating school, clicks and romances and more of an adventure of young adults exploring themselves in a world of grown ups and familial hardships. The movie itself seemed a bit fast some scenes not falling into one another smoothly or making sense in transition in my opinion. I will however, despite that tidbit, watch it again and again just because I'm a fan of both the books and what the team is trying to convey with the movies."}, {"id": 62, "text": "Improvement from the first one and let me just say Roger Kumble is the man"}, {"id": 63, "text": "I'm so sad.

I was laughing, crying, but it was still all very beautiful and hot."}, {"id": 69, "text": "It's an abusive, toxic relationship. Not the sort of thing you'd expect to see glorified in 2020. The Hardin actor is wooden, uninspired and rubbish in all aspects. Loads of sex scenes set to dodgy music to make teenage girls who know no better think it's romantic when in reality it's not. This will give plenty of the teenage girls who see it a totally skewed perspective on what is a healthy relationship and what it means to have a life outside of it. The writers should be embarrassed by how poorly written it is. Razzies will come its way if it isn't completely ignored, which it probably deserves to be."}, {"id": 70, "text": "I loved it!

It was also promised by producers to be more like the book and I don't feel that it was. It lacked details and did not have enough of an appearance of some of the actors that it should have. I was very disappointed. We waited all this time with delay after delay and paid extra money to watch it at home because not all theaters are playing it and, in my opinion, it was a waste of my time and money. I mean no disrespect to the actors. They did their part, the producers just didn't hold up their end.

Just like the book.can I just appreciate the team behind the scene? you all did great! well done!I don't know where I lost the connection, but after the movie, I just kind a lost the AFTER feeling when I really love something.

The acting was weak and unpursuasive, story line predictable, cringey-100x already seen scenes. There was too much of uncomfortable sex scenes, screaming and swearing. The bad-boy who is actually good and the good-girl who has a little of bad in her is just so overdone that it hurts to watch when you add to the mix slut shaming and on-and-off relationship based on jealousy, distrust and lie it just makes it under the average movie. 10/10 would not recommend."}, {"id": 88, "text": "This movie was not an Oscar worthy movie which is fine because it never claimed to be. I feel like people went into it thinking that it was going to be award winning. It was always supposed to be a feel good chick flick that you can rewatch when your bored and that's exactly what it turned out to be. It's not the type of movie that is supposed to be realistic it's just fun. I personally liked it a bit better than the first movie and think it's a decent adaptation of the book. As far as the acting I don't think it's fair to judge them from a poorly written script with bad dialogue, I think they did however do the best they could with it. I've seen a couple of other projects by the main leads where their acting was spot on. I think that happens a lot, where an actor is deemed as bad because of one movie that was poorly written (there are many other cases). In conclusion I think this movie is for fans of the books and people who haven't read it probably won't favour this movie but with that being said my friends who haven't read them love it so I guess it's all about preference."}, {"id": 89, "text": "I'm not a fan of teen drama, but for some reason I love Tessa and Hardin.

It was rushed and disjointed. It lacked flow and character development. Tessa is just as immature as Hardin is, so not sure why she is made out to be the good one and he's bad (although in these movies I wouldn't even say he's a bad boy-he's just immature and moody). She's almost worse than him, she jumps to conclusions way too fast and acts irrational. She also forgave him pretty quickly for the bet without ever really discussing it in depth. That should have been a slower progression of her letting him prove himself at least. A month apparently passed but that was off screen, so it just seemed like they jumped right back into bed and ignored their issues. There was just no communication.But young adult relationships can be like this, all hormones and impulsive and crazy with fights and makeups. Many of us have been there. I used to fight with my teenage boyfriend all the time, so in a way maybe it's realistic. But there was still something off about this movie and the script. There needed to be more. More communication, more connection. There needed to be something that made you really want these two to work it out.In the sequels to To All the Boys I've Loved Before and Kissing Booth, there were fights and jealously too with the couples (all bad boy/player type themes), but the core of the interactions still felt genuine. You still rooted for the couples to make up. They addressed their issues as best they could.Trevor was supposed to be the new guy I guess, but their interactions were more friendly and awkward, no chemistry, so it was almost pointless.The idea is cliche and has been done so many times, but it could still be enjoyable if done right. The actors are decent, but they aren't given much to work with.

Although there were raunchy scenes that made the cheeks glow red and body run hot, there was little in depth explanation with the rival romance, only showing small scenes of flirtation. More details or back story would have been better. Josephine Langford (plays Tessa) did a great job growing the character into her own person, from a quiet and sturdy person fresh out of high school to a free spirited, experimental individual finding her path in both romance and career. Hero (Hardin) also did a fantastic job showing the more vulnerable and emotional side of the character in this movie. Both actors/actress did a great job bouncing off of each other, BUT the movie itself seemed to be focusing on the characters growth, which was a little bit boring, more than it did with a plot line which could have been more exciting and interesting. I do think they did not give any justice to the Trevor character and pretty much added it in like it was a forced requirement.

A perfect ROMANCE DRAMA bringing teardrops both ways."}, {"id": 112, "text": "I have read the book and throughout watching the movie, this one and the first, i've noticed a big differences that bothered me. The first one is the bet- the bet was the cliffhanger of Tessa's and Hardin's relationship, he took her virginity for a bet against Zed. When in the movie it was about making her fall in love with him then brake up with her and had nothing to do with Zed. Zed is not a significant character in the movies as he is in the books. In the book he, Tessa and Hardin have sort of a love triangle where the two boys hate each other. Where in the movie, they seem to be friends when Zed actually appears on screen, and Tessa and Zed have absolutely no relationship, even though he loves her in the book. The second difference is Hardin's behavior. In the books Hardin is a very violent and aggressive man, who hurt everyone around him. Where in the movie, he is pleasant and nice to others around him, and his relationship with Tessa is much better than in the book. We don't get to see his outbreaks and the way he apologized to Tessa after her mum came to their house before Christmas and Hardin's mum found out about the bet. He wrote her a letter to apologize, using the first paragraph from Darcy's letter to Elizabeth. The letter is what made her forgive him and the movie didn't portrait that properly. Also, in the movie, when Tessa is telling him about Trevor Touching her, he seems unbothered when in the book he would flip. The movie opens when we see Tessa and Hardin haven't spoken in a month, which in the book didn't happen at all, the first time they went nine days without speaking is after they got into a fight over Tessa's job offer in Seattle. Another huge difference is the relationship between Tessa and her coworkers. In the movie, they didn't build it to make it look like Tessa and Kimberly are friends. Where in the book they are. For example, in the movie Tessa answer the phone because her boss called and when she asks her to watch Smith they go to the office to watch him. Where in the book they are friend and Kimberly is asking Tessa for a favor to watch Smith- at Tessa's and Hardin's house. Where Hardin doesn't want to communicate with Smith and the little boy only speaks to him. In the movie, Hardin initiates the conversation. In the movie, after Tessa kisses a stranger in the new years eve party, she goes home and he stay's the night at the frat house. In the book, Hardin leaves Tessa at the house without her phone and Zed takes her home. The movie make it seem like Tessa does nothing wrong, but in the books she keeps her relationship with Zed in spite of the pain it causes Hardin. Another thing that bothered me is the lack of relationship with Hardin's family. Karen and Tessa don't have a relationship, and she doesn't live in their house. In the book, Tessa is particularly a family member at the Scott's and has a good relationship with Karen. Also, Mr. Vance didn't offer her a job or took her from the office to Seattle in the book, but in the movie he does and it's unrealistic. In the book he invites her to Seattle and she asks him for a job in the new office which he gladly gives her. The movie does not contain a proper plot-line and the difference from the books is implacable, I wish they stayed true to the books"}, {"id": 113, "text": "One of my favorite movie series..love for after.. waiting for the next after movie.

Her whole job is basically just drink and have fun. That is not how it works in real life. But it wouldn't even matter that much if the rest of the movie weren't so bland. The love triangle is also incredibly forced. It was there purely to provide fake tension.A lot of the characters' actions come out of nowhere. The fight Tessa and Hardin have near the third act was beyond contrived. A girl who hasn't appeared in the entire story comes out of the blue to tell Hardin: I don't kiss and tell. Then Tessa gets all pissed. WHAT?! That wasn't set up at all. It's lazy writing to its fullest extent. At least in the first movie their fight made sense.

I dread thinking that teenage girls (or boys) are watching this and think this is a love story. It is not. It is a sick story about a toxic relationship between two very immature individuals. The drinking, the sex, the parties.... Hey, believe me, I am not a prude. But when people keep stepping back into the same toxic relationship that is truly bad for both parties, its gotta stop. Instead we have a mother who pushes her kid to go back and continue to create toxicity in his girlfriend's life. Honestly, what is there to see in this movie that has any redeeming quality? Yes, sex is beautiful and we, as humans, love it. But that is the only thing I see that this couple has going for them. And lets be real folks, good sex does not make an entire relationship valuable or good. It just fools you into believing that you are in love, when really you are feeling an animal magnetism which is what via biology keeps the human primate together with their mate (to raise children). Sorry, human love is more advanced. It is about respect and honesty, and addictive or violent activities are not included in the definition of love. I hate this movie.

Some parts were good other parts felt rushed. Love the ending. No where in the book did it mention the uber driver talking little throwed off about that. All in all a good movie.

I watched the first movie about a year after it came out and I hadn't heard anything of the after fandom and books when those first came out either. So I basically just watched it on a whim. When I watched the first movie, I found it extremely confusing because Tessa and Hardin had had very little and insignificant interactions with each other that the sudden jump to the lake scene and their relationship moving forward made no sense to me. I thought the ending was a bit unfinished until I realised it was a book series. I was interested enough in the movie to read the books and was instantly hooked and even more excited to learn the sequel was coming out soon given the trailer seemed jam-packed with drama and a lot more true to the books. Anna's role also became more significant in the second film that they made a huge effort to be true to the book where the first one didn't. The only problem with this was that a lot of things missed in the first film made the sudden changes in the second tasteless as they were not sufficiently thought-out. In the books, Zed had a lot more to do with both Hardin and Tessa's development and not including him in the first movie meant going into the next books/film his character was/will be completely irrelevant to the story. The fact that the ending of the first movie allowed some time between Tessa finding out about the bet and beginning to move on with her life and starting at Vance, left a huge gaping hole in the recovery process of their break up. I didn't feel the pain of their separation like I did in the books. The second film is dated a month later but their experience and emotional journey in this time is not touched on. How has Tessa been handling it? In the book she is destroyed and lives between Landons house and her Mothers and a motel. Where does she even stay in the film once they break up since she can't go to the apartment and has no relationship or screen time with her mother at all? Why does she not have any real relationship to Karen like she does in the books? Why do they never mention Hardin has a job and how will this translate to his future career as a writer? In the second book, they spent so much time adding complexity and anger to Hardins character that was lacked in the first book that Tessa lacked any substance. There was so much drama and scenes from the book they wanted to keep within the strict 1:45 time limit that there is not enough pacing and felt distress of their break ups and fall outs to make a real emotional impact on the audience. That being said, the characters are quite brought to life and the chemistry between Hero and Jo is incomparable. I think for a story like this that is so human and character driven, they should have made it into a one off TV series like normal people."}, {"id": 163, "text": "So...

What made this worse is that they tried to add a sprinkle of humour, which did not work. I might have ended up liking this film more than any sane person should.

After We Collided delves deeper into the characters, their relationships with one another, the story, defining moments from the novel, Tessa and Hardin's sensual yet rocky relationship, and so much more. Not to mention, the chemistry was sooooo much more improved between Josephine (Tessa) and Hero (Hardin)! I feel like I can say for all After fans that this film hit the mark spot on.

They tried to keep the true spirit of after series as close as possible. As an after fan, I was glad to see so many notable scenes from the book into reality. But let's be honest it could have been a bit better. First of all, the film seems to be rushed in some places. Of course, they couldn't have put all the scenes from the book but I kind of wanted a few more dialogues at some scenes. Secondly, nothing against the actress but I was kind of disappointed with Josephine's acting and Tessa's character in general. She didn't seem as into the character as she was in the first film. She looked lost and Tessa seems to lack purpose rather than being strong as she was supposed to be. Where Josephine seems to be a downfall, Hero's acting seems to be redeemed. Of course, it wasn't perfect but it seemed like he was finally started to get the rhythm of Hardin character. As a result, Hardin was only the character that kept me captivating until the end. Though there are many areas where improvement can be achieved, its an enjoyable film for young adults and worth a watch."}, {"id": 194, "text": "I liked the movie because we got the real Hessa that we wanted from the books.

When I go in seeing a movie that is adapted from a book I know we are never going to get exactly the book or else that movie would be 10+ hours long which I know some people don't mind, like me, but realistically that just can't happen. I think for what they had to work with, with what happened with the first movie, I think Anna, Roger, and the rest of the crew and actors did an AMAZING job trying to give us the books as much as possible but still give the people who haven't read the books a great storyline too. Both Jo and Hero, I think, went above and beyond what I could've ever imagined, they truly gave us Hessa. And then the new additions of Vance, Kim, Smith, Trish, and the new Ken and Karen were all amazing as well. There was never a scene where I wasn't laughing, shocked, crying, angry, screaming, or in amazement that is AWC! Please give this movie a chance because I promise you will not be disappointed!!!!"}, {"id": 203, "text": "So, I watched the movie and I won't lie, for me, it's much closer to the book (which I read before watching the movie). The two leads, they really did bring the characters to life. I felt their chemistry. For anyone who has not seen the first movie or read the first book, the book and the movie are very different. But this movie, helped me understand their relationship from just a side character. There's a second character who was better in the movie than in the book. He opened my eyes when it came to the relationship of the two main characters. Without giving much away about the movie, or the books, I feel this franchise is giving people a view/ understanding of what addiction can do. How it affects lives and what happens when you think you can change someone or want to stick around and help them. This franchise makes people question their own relationship and possibly recognise the similarities and realise they need to walk away. This is just the second movie. I feel the first movie introduced us to the characters but only showed us the puppy love version. This film showed the characters from the books. Unlike other movies which are probably similar to this movie in terms of problems in earlier life, this film shows the audience that sometimes love may not be enough. The person themselves need to understand what the problem is and get help. Not rely on their partner. But like I said, there are two more books, and apparently they will become movies so let's just see what happens in this journey."}, {"id": 204, "text": "The first movie was a disaster but the sequel is enjoyable. The writers build up a strong plot comparing to the first one. The romance between the lead pair and the drama and comedy that surrounds them as they try to get back together keeps you attached to the screen until the end. The director did an amazing job of maintaing the harmonization between characters and casts. Though Josephine and Dylan did a pleasent job bringing Tessa and Trevor to reality, what completely fascinated me was Hero's acting. He completely turned Hardin 360\u00b0 and made up for the Hardin that the audience was missing in the previous film. The actor made it possible for us to love Hardin despite all his flaws.

I would have liked it better if Hardin went to the hotel and saw Tessa with Trevor and left in anger, it would have set the story better for Hardin to have to try and win her back. I was disappointed at the misunderstanding at the party which lead to a huge fight. Too many fights between them.I liked the storyline with his mother. I like knowing why characters act the way they do. I like they dug into his childhood, abandonment by his father, watching his mother be attacked, etc does give you an insight into his current behavior. I love the character Trevor.

I mean, sci-fi is a pretty unrealistic genre, but a story about an alien coming to Earth and getting back home with kids on flying bikes? It sounded absurd to me. Let's just say I was very incorrect in my assessment. This was one of the greatest movies I've seen, and I think it has to do with the pure light-heartedness of the story. I'm not usually one for movies with child actors, but Elliotts performance was simply moving. It amazes me how great the practical effects have held up after all these years, Spielberg is a genius and his hard work has not been overlooked. The pacing was excellent, the story was moving, and the performances were great. E.T. is just a family classic and my heart goes out to those who have never been able to experience the movie for the first time with their family. Moving. While watching it with my son, I'm pretty sure I shed a few tears. Part of the reason this experience was so great to me was because recently my best friend passed away, so it was nice to see the bond between Elliott and ET. Moving as hell. Let's not even get to the Halloween scene. A comedic yet moving scene if I've ever seen one. This movie is great. A masterpiece. Can not be beaten. Spielberg? Genius. ET. Amazing. My best friend?

There was no plot. The main characters are unrecognizable from one movie to the next. Tessa goes from a near virgin, heartbroken college kid to a grown woman with a job, high sex drive and alcohol habit in 'one month' with absolutely no explanation. It's silly, really. The one positive thing about this movie was Dylan Sprouse as Trevor; I would give him 10 stars. I was actually watching it rooting for Trevor?! There was just no reason to root for Hessa.

As a book reader it was everything i was hoping for!"}, {"id": 330, "text": "Hey guys, I saw the movie yesterday and I think the movie is way better than the first! The movie is close to the book and the most important things from the book are available in the movie. You can see that Hardin and Tessa had a huge glow up, which is very important for their story. We finally have our book Hardin and Tessa was as perfect as ever! One thing that disturbed me was the beginning! The movie starts with Hardin sitting in a car and Tessa's dad walks by and wants to ask Hardin a question. That scene confused me a bit because it never happened in the book and I can't understand why they put that in the beginning, because in my eyes this scene was unnecessary. I mean, they meet Tessa's dad Richard at the end of the book and not from the beginning and that confused me. Another thing that disturbed me, was the scene after Hardin meeting Richard. Tessa had her first day at Vance Publishing and I don't know why they started directly with that! Of course, they have to find a way to connect it with the ending of the first movie, but in the time where Hardin and Tessa broke up happened so much. She wasn't at Vance Publishing at the beginning and everything happened so fast. The day they went to Seattle was so fast I didn't like it. The last point that disturbed me, was that aftermovie posted too much scenes on Instagram! In my opinion, they should post some pictures of a scene but not a whole scene because sometimes it ruins the movie, because you can figure out what happens in the next scene or you already know it. The scenes that they posted were a bit long and one thing that I was sad about was the meeting of Tessa and Trevor. They just posted the scene and when I saw the movie it wasn't a surprise anymore of how they met. I often knew what will happen in the next scene, because they posted so much. Of course, they didn't post so many scenes from the second movie as from the first movie but it still felt the same. I just hope that aftermovie reads this and they will accept the criticism and implement something about it. I just hope that they won't post scenes from the third and the fourth movie, because it would be better if the whole movie is a surprise and no one knows what will happen. (Except the Trailer, there has to be scenes from the movie but I hope you understand what I meant with posting some scenes on Instagram.) In all, the movie was perfect, a lot happened and they put as much as they could from the book into the movie. Roger Kumble did a great job and all the actors too! The chemistry was everything and the plot was definitely better than in the first movie. I'm looking forward to the next two movies and of course I will watch After We Collided again in the cinema!

There was more dialogue of the book added this time around, and the mix of action, romance &amp; comedy in this movie definitely showed off the characters true personalities, which wasn't really shown in the first adaptation of the After saga.

I can't express how much I love this movie.It was like watching the book on screen, every word they spoke was straight dialogue from the book! Most of the scenes were from the book too. It was so much better than the first one. The movie was literally a roller coaster of emotions! Heartbreak, Drama, Tearjerker, and Romance. Everyone did an amazing job. But... Hero absolutely steals the show. Hero Fiennes Tiffin did a freakin unbelievable phenomenal job as the real book Hardin Scott! That raw emotion every scene - 110%. You can feel you're heartbreaking for him! It is impossible not to smile, laugh, or cry. The first time he appears on the screen to the last. His first and last words. It is breathtaking. He is a phenomenal actor. One scene that stood out to me that was absolutely incredible was the Nine Days. His nightmare scenes, the fight scenes, the break up screaming scenes, the everything! 10/10 - Hands Down - the best movie in 2020.

All the love, passion and even their fighting is really Hessa that we know from a long time ago, since they appeared on Wattpad then novels and finally they were really real in front of our cinema screen. I want to say a big thank you to Hero and Josephine for bringing the characters Hardin and Tessa to life. And of course thanks to Roger Kumble, you really saved After and us, Afternators! Thank you so much Anna for everything, at least After saved me in the current situation. Hey Anna, please let Roger Kumble direct the 3rd as well as the 4th film.

Overall I definitely recommend to watch this movie, it's funny, sexy and dramatic, so don't miss it!!"}, {"id": 344, "text": "Okay so during the movie I was baffled by how overdramatic Tessa, Hardin and the girl with the purple hair were acting. It didn't seem like real people to me until I realised that yes, sometimes young immature people behave and talk like that (I'm 23). They scream and make assumptions and have trust issues. They are egotistic, overly jealous and completely ridiculous in how they act in their relationships. I mean they truly think that this is what real love is and feels like. If your significant other isn't toxic and doesn't make you cry 80% of the time then are you even in love? And then one day you grow up and realise that true love makes you calm, and happy, and it makes you feel safe and understood. You never search for the knife in your back because it's not there. Sometimes real relationships are so good they get boring and that's okay. Of course there are always hardships but they don't look remotely like the ones in this movie. Let me be clear. HARDIN AND TESSA SHOULD NOT BE TOGETHER. At least not at this part of their lives. They are both very immature and toxic to each other. The trust is not there and they keep hurting each other. They retaliate and purposely try to hurt one another. I hope young people seeing this don't mistaken this for what it isn't. On the other hand who hasn't made mistakes regarding their love life. So I guess at the end of the day you should do you. Moving forward to the actual movie.. it's even worse. The dialogues, man, the dialogues. The direction makes me want to cry(not in a good way). I really think that many problems with the movie had to do with the problematic writing state that the books are in. Bad material can only get better to a certain point. If I were 14 I might have likes this movie. But I'm not."}, {"id": 345, "text": "The first movie was quite good in the sense that the two fragile characters were discovering themselves and had real constructive time together in building a relationship via trials and error with an emotional flowing storyline in the background. It was above average, but romantically touchy.The characters had amazing chemistry together and they still do, but with the second (movie), its shallow material and the over and artificial dramatization of almost every collision scenes, even having Anna Todd as the screenplay writer and one of the producers of the movie, doesn't save it from crashing gloriously.After We Collided, is empty, toxic and unrealistic with a way crowded cast, contributing to nothing. Even the original Writer couldn't save it; maybe she was too blinded by the sense of gloriousness of her own screenplay.Sad collision!"}, {"id": 346, "text": "I was excited for this movie, I'll be honest. The first movie was far from perfect but it intrigued me enough to read the books and they hooked me up completely. After We Collided movie is emotionally charged and intense... maybe even too intense (struggled to swallow my popcorn at times :) So much was going on in this movie, it was overwhelming. If I haven't read the books, I probably wouldn't understand all scenes, because everything was a bit rushed and fragmented. On the other hand, it will be still interesting to rewatch. Hero has improved his acting so much, I was pleasantly surprised! And comedic moments were nice for a little breath of air.However... Being a young adult, I didn't like how much alcohol was in the movie. It was unpleasant to see Tessa drinking so much, being a mess. She has gotten drunk twice and, what even worse, Hardin seemed to like it. In the books I admired her purposefulness and dedication to work no matter how bad things with Hardin were. But in the movie, it seemed like her intelligence decreased. In my opinion, this movie is very bad for teenage girls, as it sets a terrible example of unhealthy relationships and bad alcohol habits. For young adults though, it's quite entertaining to watch."}, {"id": 347, "text": "First of all, great improvements on acting abilities for the main characters. Hero did an amazing job portraying Hardin and all of his issues, and Jo is the perfect Tessa. The movie covers a lot of the main scenes from the book, however, some of the scenes felt rushed. There are times where you are just grasping the situation and beginning to feel an emotion, but suddenly something else is happening and you are still trying to process what happened before. I loved the comedy, however, there was just too much comedy for a book that is supposed to be angsty and dramatic. For example, the shower sex scene was displayed as a comedy, and it took away from the sexiness. I cringed during some sex scenes. The office sex scene was the worst. The way they were moving was just unrealistic and uncoordinated. Sometimes they appeared as if they didn't know how you are supposed to move during sex positions, which was a huge turn off because that makes sex scenes look too technical, unrealistic and too choreographed. Jo and Hero have repeated over and over how choreographed and technical the sex scenes are that it is palpable on screen and not sexy at all. I still loved to see my favorite book series come to life, and Hero Fiennes Tiffin is just makes the whole movie worth it even with all its faults. There were a lot of cute Hessa moments and that's what we are here for. Also, the new cast members were spot on and made this movie even more enjoyable. I would recommend it, if you have not read the books you may be a little lost, but if you are a fan you will get to see these characters come to life."}, {"id": 348, "text": "I read the After series 2 years ago and it was a life-changing experience. I re-read it again recently cause I've miss the characters so much. The second movie has done such a great job bringing our book Hardin and Tessa into real life. Anna, Roger and the crew have created such beautiful and amazing storyline. Of course there are differences, but like Anna said, something is better written than being displayed in front of camera. About the actors and actresses, all of them did such a great job, I almost thought the main characters are actually in love. Hero successfully brought Hardin's love for Tessa into real life, and Josephine is so talented. Love how they give Trevor some more stories than the book, but I was still hoping for more Zed stories. Overall, this movie is better than any romance I've seen. This movie carries depth and lessons, even if you haven't experienced but can still relate to. I'm glad that the 3rd and 4th movies are in production soon, but I hope more countries (for example in Asia) can watch the movie. Also, waiting for a release day on Netflix or DVD announcement. This movie is worth the watch. Tbh English is not my mother tongue, so I'm trying my best to express my love for After We Collided. Thank you for making Afternators' dream comes true."}, {"id": 349, "text": "This movie was awful. I wanted to like it, as I quite liked the first one but it just seemed very rush, no real story line and very very cringe.Within the first 5 minutes of the opening scene there are more 'swear words' than in the whole of the first movie, it just seemed like it was trying too hard to be more 'bad' that it was coming off cringeworthy. Also there were way too many sex scenes, I feel like half of the movie was watching them have sex.The movie was basically Tessa and Hardin falling out, arguing, making up, having sex and repeat. Elements of the movie were just completely unrealistic too.I only gave it three stars because hello It's Hero, obviously - and Dylan Sprouse's character was funny. Unless you're a fan of the books (which is one of the reasons why I didn't leave my friend who is a fan in the cinema) I wouldn't bother."}, {"id": 350, "text": "I'm going to keep this brief and to the point.I enjoyed the movie purely because I enjoyed the book (admittedly a guilty pleasure) and it was a fast, easy way to spark memories of the pages I so loved. However, all but cutting out Zed (a significant character in the novel) both confused and saddened me... Where was he? Why was he snogging a twiggy bitch? Why doesn't he love Tessa? And most importantly HOW will they make the third book into a film with Zed being struck from the script? His relationship with Tessa and war with Hardin is paramount to the events of in After We Fell.A am absolutely completely and utterly convinced that Zed was struck out due to his actor being less famous than Dylan Sprouse, as they neglected Samuel Larson' s Zed in favour of over amplifying Dylan's Trevor. I don't even really like Trevor in the books, why oh why is there more of him in the movie!?I am disappointed."}, {"id": 351, "text": "I don't actually dislike this movie, because it did relax me after a long day at work, but definitely not for the right reasons lol. The whole plot and the characters are so clich\u00e9-ridden, that I started seriously questioning whether this is some intentional meta, or just simply incredibly bland - I'm pretty sure it's the latter. The caharcters are basically cardboard-cutouts, they exhibit absolutely zero personality, I have never been this uninterested in the main charcters of a movie. They also try to portray them as having this super dramatic, passionate, wildfire romance, when objectively, nothing interesting has ever happened to them or between them, so it's just really awkward to see them screaming at each other and acting like they are driving each other crazy, when again, literally nothing has happened lol. I loved Dylan Sprouse's character though, he was a breath of fresh air, and it was nice to see the charming Candice King again (even though she was given zero interesting material to work with).This movie was OK to watch once with a coupon for the movie ticket, but it was incredibly forgettable, I have no idea how this franchise blew up like it did lol.The soundtrack is really cool though, you should check that one out!"}, {"id": 352, "text": "This sequel is better than its first film in some ways, but sadly it is worse in many more ways.A good attempt in the comedic parts in this sequel, and a good choice of new casts for the new characters, especially Dylan Sprouse. I think he did a good job portraying the role of Trevor, very close to what I imagined in the novel. The returning casts were also better than they were previously in the first film, except for Hero Fiennes Tiffin. I think his acting is weird, unnatural and exaggerating at most times.In the novel, Hardin is someone who has mood swings, someone who is mysterious &amp; secretive because he has something to hide about his past, yet charming still. I really have to give credits to Anna Todd (the author) for charming her readers with merely words, but I'm afraid Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) has failed to charm us in this movie adaptation.As for the story, some parts were different than in the novel. But like the Anna Todd said, certain parts that seem romantic when reading the novel, may seem cheesy in the movie when being acted out. I agree with that, and it's perfectly ok when some settings in the movie are different than in the novel, and/or some parts were omitted. BUT...... It is NOT OK, when most parts in the movie are being rushed through, neglecting the development of it's original story &amp; mood in the novel, which is a huge killer for me (this explains my low rating).In novel, there are a lot of struggles in thoughts, in emotions, in decision-making for these 2 main characters (Tessa &amp; Hardin). The reason why people loved the novel is because it carries you along to an emotional roller coaster ride with the 2 main characters (T &amp; H). The thoughts that ran through their minds, problems that they were struggling with, were meticulously &amp; beautifully written by Anna Todd, allowing you to feel, understand and emphatize with them.But this 2nd movie adaptation has failed to do the same, it has forgotten the importance of the PACE in storytelling. PLUS, there is a lack of good music/soundtracks in this 2nd film. If you recall, in the 1st film during the scene where Tessa &amp; Hardin spent their time at the river, it was beautifully filmed, not rushed and given time to develop its story and on top of that, a good choice of music was used to support the atmosphere. The scene where Tessa &amp; Hardin shared a dance at his dad's house is another good example, a beautiful scene accompanied with beautiful music. It's a shame... It REALLY IS A SHAME. They could have spent more time allowing the story to develop in the 2nd film since its runtime is only 96mins.To be honest, I am still looking forward to the 3rd film, ONLY BECAUSE I love the novel. I hope they won't disappoint me again."}, {"id": 353, "text": "I read fanfic as a hobby - it's my guilty pleasure meaning I have a high tolerance for badly written material but had never come across this. I now wish I had. I've NEVER felt this way about a film but it almost had me leaving the cinema.I saw the first film on Netflix, thought it wasn't too bad so decided to see the sequel. There were so many story lines crammed in - it was obvious it was based on bad FanFiction. If you had added some BDSM it would have been a knock off of fifty shades - if you have watched both, tell me that, at its basic, it's not the same story line...The only reason this got 2 stars was because even with the horrific writing and awful story line, the acting was good enough to semi redeem it. I honestly feel sorry for the actors, so many of the lines were obviously direct dupes from the fanfic that would never be said in real life.In short, if you have any form of taste in a film, do not watch this. Save yourself the cinema cost and watch the first one again, at least it's tolerable."}, {"id": 354, "text": "After We Collided is the sequel to the 2019 movie After. This sequel is directed by Roger Kumble, the director of Cruel Intentions and The Sweetest Thing.In the film, Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) and Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) are both handling their break-up in their own way. Their relationship ended after Tessa learned more about Hardin's mysterious dark side, which made her feel unsafe. Hardin retreats to a life of bad habits, while Tessa starts her dream internship at a publishing house. Here Tessa meets her new colleague Trevor (Dylan Sprouse) for whom she soon starts to have feelings. Although Tessa tries to start a new relationship with Trevor, she can't let go of her thought of Hardin. Despite all his troubles and secrets, Tessa decides to give Hardin a second chance. The two now have to spend a lot of time and energy in their relationship to get everything back to the way they once had it together.Just like the first part, this film is again based on the book and fan fiction by writer Anna Todd. To make this film more consistent with her book, she has chosen to largely write the film script herself.For better film quality, this second part has also been given a more professional director. Director Roger Kumble has directed many other romantic comedies and dramas in his career. One of his best-known directed films Cruel Intentions was also partly the inspiration for Anna Todd's book series. If you are familiar with this movie, this second part may seem a bit predictable or copied. For a better movie, you can actually watch Cruel Intentions for yourself.The acting is better done by the cast in this film compared to the first part due to the better script and direction work.

Overall I'd give it 4.5 out of 5. When Anna said it is much closer to the book, she sure wasn't kidding. Obviously the movie is an adaptation and not everything is the same but that is to be expected. At the end it felt like all the puzzles fell into one. The movie was more dramatic and sexier than the first one. The whole story felt mature and more grown up just like in the books. It absolutely had the intensity to it! Honestly if felt much longer than it was in the best way possible. I didn't want the movie to end at all. Tessa and Hardin have both changed and are just like they were in the books! I can honestly say I loved all the characters, even Trevor who was a bit different from the books but I didn't mind one bit. Dylan's performance was every bit of amazing and he brought a new kind of vibe to the story. Plus he is super hilarious! Jo and Hero did such a great job! Jo portrayed the change we see in Tessa beautifully and so did Hero. Hero's portrayal of Hardin definitely screamed the desperate boy hopelessly in love with a girl! He had the book Hardin feel to him throughout the whole movie! From Hardin's dry British sense of humor to his intensity. Jo was mind-blowing. After watching AWC and interviews with Jo, I can honestly say Jo IS Tessa in so many ways. Her performance felt super real and utterly believable. We hit a jackpot with her, no kidding. Plus I applaud them for the steamy scenes, their chemistry is off the charts. Anna is a superwoman! Not only is she a talented writer, but apparently she can write one hell of a script as well. I would say it is thanks to her that the movie was so close to the books. And Roger's directing - just wau! He also wasn't kidding about the sex, sex and more sex lol. He definitely knows how to keep the audience entertained and give them what they want. Only thing I didn't like was how they used the camera (and I guess it's an issue of editing as well) in some scenes where they would switch very quickly between the characters. But I think that's also about personal preference. I'm not a fan of it but I'm sure many people won't even notice it. Of course I do have to mention secondary characters - Inanna as Molly blew my mind! So did Louise as Trish, I fell in love with her instantly. Candice as Kim was super cute and Charlie as Vance? Hilarious. I can't wait to see more of them all in the next movies. All of them were just perfection.

But it's an enjoyable ride.If you enjoyed the first movie, you're likely to enjoy this one. It's sexier, raunchier and thankfully R rated rather it's PG13 predecessor which is much better suited for a movie like this. The first movie felt a little too tame considering the story content.Oh just enjoy it for what it is.

Also, their acting was amazing- especially in the emotional scenes. (LIKE, DAMN) Kudos to the other actors as well! I read the books ever since it got published and even though if I didn't read them, I would enjoy AWC so much. It has romance, comedy and drama. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST ROMANCE FILMS THIS YEAR. PERIOD.ALSO, THIS HAS TO BE CLEARED OUT------People say its CRINGEY, but have you seen OTHER NETFLIX/Awesomeness Films ROMANCE MOVIES? SPECIFICALLY- THE HIGH SCHOOL ONES- BECAUSE THEY ARE WAY CRINGIER THAN THIS, so yeah there's that (some examples: To all the boys, Work It, The Kissing Booth, Spontaneous- need I say more?) And I know a lot are really comparing this to the twilight and the 50sog franchise- IT IS NOT. BECAUSE, its a COLLEGE ROMANCE drama that is real and authentic- IT DOES NOT HAVE VAMPIRES, WEREWOLVES, BDSM AND FULL ON RICH STUFF. IT IS ALSO NOT A 1D FANFIC (NOT ANYMORE)- Anna Todd CHANGED ALL OF THE CHARACTERS NAMES before OFFICIALLY PUBISHING IT. AND- HARRY STYLES DID NOT FILE A FREAKING CASE ABOUT THIS. (Really don't get why some are mad about the After Series because it was a 1D fanfic- BUT HAVE YOU SEEN the 1D Fanfic story (LARRY) from Euphoria? Well.. ) And A LOT OF AUTHORS FROM AROUND THE WORLD, USE DIFFERENT ACTORS AS FACES OF THEIR BOOK- NOT THE ACTUAL CHARACTER- JUST THEIR FACES. I mean, some can't just move on..

Lol I bet most people that like the movies, read the books. The books show Hardin in a MUCH darker tone so it's ironic that people think he's so bad in the movies. If you read the books you'd see it's downplayed a LOT of Hardins issues. Even the bet from the first movie/book was a lot darker in the book. Also if you think they had sex too much: again read the books. The movies downplayed how much they have sex, and how fast they start having sex in the book compared to the movie. Honestly, the movie wouldn't have been a good retelling of the book if they didn't have sex a lot. But personally, I think the actors are amazing in their roles and I'm so glad I found this series. I've watched the movies a few times already. I can't wait for the next two movies! Especially to see people complain about how dark those get! And let me say, I absolutely loved the book series. I read all the books after I watched the movies and I finished all of them in a week because I was so hooked.

The plot line itself wasn't super original and probably wasn't fleshed out as well in the movie as in the books. Could be wrong. I haven't read them yet. I will say that I enjoyed the second movie much more. It was less about Tessa being some fragile goody-good and more about her coming into herself. There were still many moments when I was making eek sounds because I was so embarrassed by the dialogue, but honestly if you love romantic novels then you have to be able to deal with that. Even though I haven't read the books, the film translated like a book to me in many ways. I actually thoroughly enjoyed After We Collided. I may be cynical and jaded from my own real life experiences. I may yell at them about how dumb and naive they're being, but I feel like the second movie showed them maturing to an extent. People are too critical. Like they want something to complain about. I saw all the bad reviews and that's the only reason I posted mine, because I actually liked it.

I could not believe that a movie that it's also a sequel can be that bad but After We Collided succeeded on it. The plot of the movie was worse than the first movie and did not make any sense while creating some major plot holes that probably they will cover them in the next movies. The interpretations of the cast were as bad as in the first movie and I cannot mention even one that was good or just above average. Lastly, I have to say that if you have not already watched the first movie and you are about to watch this movie, make yourself a favor and do not watch it because I am sure that you will regret it."}, {"id": 362, "text": "This movie sucks on so many levels ...Yeah its better than the first one , but if you're someone here who read the books and was so excited to watch the movie which was a disappointment and then gave it another chance and watched the second one , then again was disappointed, you my friend are like me and we are not going to be satisfied:))I confess this one was better but still bad so Also , they omitted on the story to have more sex scenes, which doesn't make any sense , you need content to have a proper movie and this movie was lacking a lot of it , the storyline was so confusing , and I know the whole story ! And Hero's play is so fake I cant even start to comment on that ."}, {"id": 363, "text": "I absolutely loved this especially compared to the first one All the actors potrayed they're characters so well You should all be proud of yourselfHero your acting was so impressive i am so proud at how well you pulled off Hardin You're definitely the best Hardin we can get and im thankful for youJo you did so well you have improved so much from the first movie There is no better Tessa you really are a queenOnly negative would be the other characters should of had more time or no time but in saying that i know you can only do what you can it 1 hour and 40 minutes Maybe you could of cut out some of the sex scenes and replace it with more wholesome scenes involving Hero and Jo more heart to heart conversations and them talking about they're issues like we see in the book.Landon needed more screen time!!I am so excited for AWF AND AEH hoping Castelle will be able to get the crucial parts from those books into the moviesOverall a really good Movie i would like it in general but Hero and Jo are the leads so how could you not"}, {"id": 364, "text": "It would be so very easy to just pan this film, for good it is not. That said, it is infinitely better than After (2019) and the two stars are perhaps, just perhaps, starting to look like they might just go on to achieve something more substantial should they ever be given some characters with more substance to portray. As it is, however, this is just a light and fluffy late-teen angst film that follows the continuing antics of feisty Tessa (Josephine Langford) and the erring Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). The story hasn't the depth of a puddle - their on/off relationship is largely represented by sexless sex scenes; they can't keep their hands off each other for much of the film. However, he has issues from his childhood (broken home, drink problems etc.) that are creating plenty of bumps on their particular Yellow Brick Road. Hats off to HFT for not adopting a daft mid-Atlantic drawl, he is a Brit and that helps with a little of the charm of the story, for charm there is - and that's it's redemption. Perhaps if the director had given them actual dialogue, rather than just a stream of scenes riddled with profanities whilst they were snogging/shagging/showering then maybe we could have had a chance to appreciate the two young talents trying their best with this woefully banal narrative. I suspect it will only really attract those of us under 15, but I'd keep a look out for the two stars in the future."}, {"id": 365, "text": "I had such high hopes for this movie after all the built up hype around it from the cast, the director, Anna herself... and then eventually from all the fans that were starting to see it as it slowly came out.However my hopes were dashed once I actually saw the movie.Was there more book content? Yes. Did it feel more like Hessa? To an extent. But it was still a let down.The movie was far too rushed, scenes were choppy, Causing the movie to not really flow properly. And the story didn't entirely go in the sequences it should have like in the book.Adding the Trevor love triangle actually made even less sense than it would have if they just re-introduced Zed as the other half of the love triangle.Was Dylan's portrayal of Trevor good? Yes. But as I said this whole thing didn't really go with the movie.Another thing that really bothered me was the fact they tried to make it like a romantic comedy... AWC is anything but a comedy.And the R rating is just absurd.... there isn't anything R - rated about it other than 1 bare bum. And a bigger F- word presence. The sex scenes I'd rate as PG-13 ; 14a at most.Dare I say that despite AFTERS lack of book likeness it was actually a better more beautiful film, and actually made more sense than this choppy mess.I am actually shocked, because I LOVE Rogers other projects especially Cruel Intentions. I just feel he wasn't given the opportunity to really shine here, because of other *people* holding him back and not allowing him to express his creative talent.Josephine and Hero did a wonderful job (as did the rest of the cast) their acting has really grown with them. I just truly wish they were given the full opportunity to shine."}], "reviews_amount": 366}
