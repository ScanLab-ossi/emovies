The movie was very in the moment as far as the quarantine, and a lot of people can find that relatable. Plenty of jump scares and I was on the edge of my seat! Very entertaining and it kept my interest. The acting looked intense and real. These people looked terrified! Getting down to the point, I thought this movie was great and It's not even an hour, so even If you're a hater and don't like it, it wasn't much time lost. Peace."}, {"id": 1, "text": "An atmospheric chiller with believable natural characters that draw you in to their joint Zoom s\u00e9ance. The movies low budget was rendered irrelevant due to the good timing and imagination of the director. However it's weakness was the lack of narrative and short running time; the film was more an episode in a horror TV show and so should be watched in that light to enjoy an hour's creepiness."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This was nearly a perfect movie for me. Many studios and writers should take note that sometimes less is best. This is only 56 minutes. A minute more or a minute less would've probably taken the rating down two or 3. Acting-was very convincing. Not academy award worthy but good enough. Talented young ladies Special fx-not much but good enough. You can tell with what they had for a budget they worked hard to make it effective. Plot-some holes and come on, seriously? moments but nothing more ridiculous in most of the crap horror movies being released during Covid....check it out. Won't be disappointed."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I simply can't fathom all the love for this movie. It's not AWFUL. The banter between friends is kind of fun. And the idea is okay. But friends dragging laptops around their homes (even the apartments are bigger than my little house) while checking on strange noises goes beyond suspension of disbelief. And there's no build to the story (although granted,, they didn't have time for one). There's a jump scare or two, and it goes fast enough with the short run time, but...I just don't get these 10-star reviews. I feel like they watched one of the other movies called Host that fill up the results box on IMDB when I type a search in."}, {"id": 4, "text": "It's pretty well done but a really shallow movie.The Zoom angle adds a bit of freshness, but it's not as good as the first Unfriended.lots of loud noises, shaky camera's and essentially a long series of jump scares knitted together - even at 60 mins it felt a bit too longInane chat, but fairly natural conversations, zero story, but what it does, it does well. Just don't come looking for something engaging - it's a ghostrain on film."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I don't think I've ever been driven to write a review before but I had to for this. Giving it 10/10 purely because it's the first horror film to actual scare me in years. Cast are great, effects are as good as they need to be, and it's only 57 minutes which is refreshing. Obviously if you don't like found footage style horror you're not going to like this but if you do you're in for a treat. And of course there's some questionable decisions by the characters but it's a horror film, get over it."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Happen to see this movie by chance and was blown away. The best part of this is movie is original and the brilliant writing keeps us glued towards the seat. The entire zoom concept was nice and interesting, which makes this stand apart from other session based or found footage movies. All the lead characters portrayal was great and the casting was aptly done. All the vfx shots was pretty much credible and gives genuine scare. Though initial few moments dragged a bit, it was for the ambience to keep us hooked. Once in, it was dark and ominous then. Being an avid horror genre fan, have got accustomed to most of the cliche based movies. But this gem which was made on shoe string budget would be one to look out for! Don't miss this movie!!!"}, {"id": 7, "text": "This movie is terrible! Who on earth carries their notebooks around the house, to check on noises and such?!

It was short, but extremely effective! Bravo!!"}, {"id": 11, "text": "Totally agree with bigbrowncows review in that this is the first horror for many years that has give me a genuine fright rush.

First time review for me and this film inspired me to create an IMDB account."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I watched this with zero expectations and oh my what a movie . This movie was filmed during the lockdown because of the coronavirus . Although it takes half the movie to get to the scary parts Host keeps on the edge of your seat for the WHOLE movie . The acting is on point , the movie is awfully well made but it lacks in some parts . The main problem is the lack of originality it feels like a better version of unfriended . The ending was predictable . I didn't mind that much though because the movie features some of the most scary jumpscares i have EVER seen. My rating is 8/10 go watch this film if you want to get scared take some popcorn call some friends and have fun"}, {"id": 13, "text": "I liked this film because it didnt hang around and drag its feet like a movie that is 90 odd minutes long .its only an hour long and it certainly delivered!

All I can say is watch it. I hardly ever review but when I do, it's because it's worth it. This is well worth it. Very clever idea. I would get scared taking part in a seance if everyone was actually together in the same room, but the whole idea of this taking place with everyone in their individual homes, not being able to actually help each other. Brilliant idea and great acting by all. I had more than a few jumps. Well done."}, {"id": 15, "text": "If you've ever seen any found-footage movie, a demonic possession movie, or a movie about seances and the occult, you've already seen this movie. It does nothing new or even in a clever way, and relies on loud noises and jump scares to accomplish what a better movie would have done through creativity. The people who made this thought that they were being clever by making an hour long horror movie using Zoom, but what kind of idiot does a seance online? I mean, really. It's asinine, and just a little bit....lame?The story had been done to DEATH, the characters were all annoying and super unlikable (especially the lead actress), and the movie has been done better by much more talented people. If you can watch this movie for free, you could do worse. But anyone with standards would pass this up as it was obviously made for teenagers.As a side note, the COVID social distancing aspect was stupid, and I watch movies to escape reality, not be reminded of it. You have a girl break quarantine running down the street with a mask half off her face entering someone else's home and greeting her with an elbow, because god forbid two uninfected people might pass something to each other. Absolutely ridiculous."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Ok-so I'm an actor. An actor who does a fair chunk of horror. An actor, who does a large chunk of horror who also LOVES horror. This is one of the most well executed horror movies I have EVER seen, from a simple but well executed story to an absurdly strong cast, to pace that at no point lagged. It is a testament to Sheppard and Savage and their cast that I screamed at various points throughout the film-very few horror films elicit such a visceral response from me, and I watch enough of them that I can be numb to a lot of scares. Sometimes low budget and adverse conditions help facilitate a work that stays with you and that's exactly what's happened here."}, {"id": 17, "text": "I heard nothing about this movie, just saw it on Shudder this weekend and was completely blown away. The concept is a group of friends decide to hold a seance on Zoom. Things do not go well. Since the pandemic started I have used Zoom on a near daily basis and initially wanted nothing to do with this movie because of that. I'm certainly glad I gave in and watched it. There were enough jump scares to keep me riveted and the acting performances were pretty damn stellar. I didn't recognize any of the actresses in the film which made even more surprising. I do hope though that this does not become the new found footage trend. If it does though, count this movie as among the top."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Rob Savage's 'Host' plays out like the greatest hits of found footage. It takes the scariest elements of genre favorites like 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) and 'Paranormal Activity' (2007) and delivers a shock every few minutes. It is edited, crafted, and scripted well. The relaxed, naturalistic performances from the actors immediately create a sense of believability that helps when things start getting scary. A deceptively simple yet downright terrifying thrill ride."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Watched by myself in a dark room - not disappointedA creative way to adapt to the lockdown situation.

Really cheap. You know the ones you'll see floating around in various jump-scare memes? Yep, that amateurish. It just wasn't ominous, or intimidating, or even particularly demonic. They really dropped the ball with that creature design aka the lanky guy they painted like a discount Insidious demon.I know they couldn't rely on it too much with the runtime but the suspense is what makes these types of movies work so well. They kind of hinge on it. It worked briefly in Host but then escalated from the typical poltergeist tropes and cliches (cupboard doors flying open) to very suddenly people being suspended fifteen feet in the air and having their necks snapped. I think a majority of deaths or attacks were just people being lifted into the air and slammed down like a biotic attack from Mass Effect. Happens about half a dozen times, not kidding.Boy did they love that pulley rig they had setup in the American character's apartment... we got not one but two basically identical sudden chair drags then her being dragged into the same hallway in another scene. That whole thing with people getting dragged out of rooms by unseen forces is really played out.The demon was way too overpowered. Characters were being whirled around like ragdolls in Garry's mod and it seemed to throw any sort of rules or conventions out the window (not in a good way) with three separate characters being slaughtered outside. What's to stop ol' demon Jack from venturing down to the town square to launch some folk into shop fronts and force-snap some necks? Because they weren't in on the zoom meet? Can he not access address books?Venturing outside worked in It Follows because of the lore but it didn't work here. There needs to be some rules or boundaries which is why movies like this are generally contained within a house, cave or some other closed setting and rarely will you see a character outside unless it's after a moment of escape or when they finally overcome the obstacle and break free etc. At one point the blonde character tried to escape but the demon blocked the door. Later the Asian character not only gets out no problem but makes her way next door and breaks into another character's house.Where did the dead boyfriend come from? We didn't see him vanish or die and next minute he's dropping from the ceiling into frame for a jump-scare? Just such lazy plot contrivances that don't make any sense and with no setup at all...What's with the guy on fire? Did the demon douse him in lighter fluid because skin doesn't just combust like a wick but that guy went up like a Monk in 1960s Vietnam...There were no rules. There needs to be in horror movie like this unless you're going the avant-garde approach which this didn't. Same tropes and cliches redeemed only by the acting and timing. If not for how current it is and admittedly it really touched on events and utilised them in such a way that it epitomises tapping into the zeitgeist or contemporary culture perfectly, but if not for that I don't think this movie would be seen as anything other than a gimmick that's already been done to death. Granted it does a better job of it than films like Unfriended but it's overshadowed by how wholly unoriginal it is outside of the social isolation gimmick."}, {"id": 22, "text": "I didn't know much about it except it's length and that it was filmed during lockdown. Great acting, stunts and script. So impressive! I watched it when a massive storm was passing by and I was genuinely scared."}, {"id": 23, "text": "First of all, you gotta give the cast and crew respect for getting this movie out in such a short space of time considering that it's all filmed through the Covid-19 lockdown.It's a good little jump-scare movie that is better than some of the horrors coming out at the moment. The effects are great for a low-budget and ending at only 56 minutes, it's not too long and doesn't drag. Definitely recommend it and worthy of a repeat watch. Well done all involved."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Keep your expectations in check and there is a lot of fun to be had here.

It has been so long since a film actually scared me! I think part of it is because it was done in the concept of the current climate (Covid) and because it's something I know a few people have attempted. All actors were believable which is a nice bonus these days for non celeb actors. I had to pause it halfway through because I had to put my bin out in the dark and I didn't want to go out lol! The description doesn't do it justice. It takes a hell of a lot to scare me as a rule, so this was well made. I felt frustrated alongside Hayley. I felt annoyed about some people's behaviours and I was rooting for others. To me, making you feel emotional about characters is what makes a good film. Who would have thought that a film with so many others being so similar, could evoke such adrenaline in me? Definitely recommend this to horror fans!"}, {"id": 30, "text": "Original, refreshing, and very creative!

First, the execution is fantastic, scary as sh...t. It looks like a mixture of The Ring &amp; Rec. but adding the Zoom's idea. Second, acting is great. Natural and believable. Congratulations to the Director's and cast. Last, Hollywood should learn how to make good scary movies maximizing the resources like this one. So, overall a pretty good option of you're in horror movies and want something refreshing, cool, short and not tedious. Enjoy!"}, {"id": 36, "text": "I have no idea how out they were able to pull this off in the middle of the Coronavirus. Also, the budget had to have been relatively decent because the special effects are on par with movies like Paranormal Activity. I actually wasn't going to watch this is. I thought it was bizarre that the running time is less than an hour. It makes sense now. Most movies need a fair amount of time to build-up the characters and where the movie is heading. This movie is straight to the point, so there is no need. Just a group of friends on Zoom in the middle of our pandemic. In terms of anything negative to say, I literally can't. Anyone who loves found footage horror knows how hit and (mostly) miss the genre is. This is a diamond. I loved this movie and scrutinizing something good for negatives is just not my vibe. 2nd best Found Footage movie I've seen this year behind The Lost Footage of Leah Sullivan."}, {"id": 37, "text": "Unwatchable, horrible, cheap and fake reviews.

It's about a group of friends who perform a seance over zoom. It is really stupid and exactly what you expect. I even believe in the paranormal and this movie does absolutely nothing for me.I would be embarrassed if I worked on this project. You should never watch host, it fails at everything it tries to be, it's not scary or funny. Not worth an ounce of your time. The only reason I've given host 2/10 rather than 1 is because the directors name is Rob Savage."}, {"id": 39, "text": "After sitting and watching this movie I noticed the shaky camera work and camera spinning similar to the Blair witch project that I soon became disoriented and nauseated and soon after vomited stuff up stuff way scarier than this movie.

As for the jump scenes that can be done easily with any calming video like watching puppies playing and then a spider jumps out at you unexpectedly that's not scary that's just a jump scene."}, {"id": 40, "text": "This film taps into our current anxieties and fears during lockdown and tops them off with a heap of paranormal scares.

Perfect for Halloween."}, {"id": 42, "text": "I think knowing a bit more of the making of this movie makes it even more interesting to watch because it was during quarantine and all the actors had to make their own special effects for the most part.

Host had all of the elements that make a pretty decent scare fest. No, it wasnt perfect and some things were predictable and we've seen a few of them before. But those same scenes we've seen before somehow felt fresh here and the performances felt spot on. The entire premise was really cool and unique and engaging.

The movie is about a group of women who are all on a Zoom call during the quarantine. They want to conduct a seance, but they never really explain why. They reach out to Seylan, who talks them through the seance and how it needs to be performed. One of the friends makes up a false dead soul, and something evil uses it as their way in. Will anyone survive? If you love horror, supernatural and tired of the lockdown, I highly recommend HOST!!!"}, {"id": 59, "text": "I didn't think I'd like this movie as much as I did. I figured it'd be another low budget horror film with terrible events befalling the main characters for not taking their situation seriously. While that's kind of what this is, the difference is that the acting is well done, and you get to see the characters interact a bit before the creepy things begin to happen.The use of Zoom was a fun touch because it's relevant for the current time, the pandemic really is going on, and with Zoom you have creative backgrounds you can use and time limits for the meetings. All of that worked really well for some of the scares. While you don't get a ton of character backstory, you don't really need it in a 56 minute movie.The shorter run time helps this movie to avoid some of the tropes similar films have suffered from... there isn't needless fighting, the story doesn't revolve around predictable jump scares or irrelevant storylines to pad the runtime.Haley gets a group of friends together on Zoom to work with a medium to contact spirits. Jemma doesn't take it seriously and pretends to be contacted by a dead friend. Because she made this up, she inadvertently invited a demonic entity into their session, one that proceeds to target each person on the meeting until no one is left. Just when they think they've properly broken the circle and saved themselves, they find out how wrong they are and that none of them can run or hide from the demonic presence.Well done and worth a watch!"}, {"id": 60, "text": "Great fun, straight and to the point.

But I read good things and convinced her to watch with me! Turns out I was more spooked than she was!! I was surprised by how much was going on with jump scares and visuals. I was pretty impressed and also scared which doesn't happen too often to me. Few questions at the end but I don't think we are supposed to overthink it. Just enjoy it! This one really worked for me, I hope for a sequel!"}, {"id": 66, "text": "I can really appreciate this film for doing something well what hasn't been done truly before. A zoom movies that cleverly uses the time limit, backgrounds, and filters to create some delightful frights, I was pleased with this one. It was a bit slow to start and slow to end but the middle was legit some fun and wonderful film making. I hope people will take notes from this one of how to use this kind of tech well."}, {"id": 67, "text": "I don't jump easy but it had my clenching my bed in a few scene's"}, {"id": 68, "text": "Given this film is only 59 minutes long and recorded all on laptops/iPhones, it really is an excellent piece of cinema. Gripping from the first few minutes, believable storyline and acting/characters, it certainly gave me and my Mrs a skid mark in our underwear. Would definitely recommend this, but watch with the lights on!! 10/10"}, {"id": 69, "text": "Reasons I enjoyed this: 1. Throwback to Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch 2. Clever writing to acknowledge Covid-19 3. All female actors were likable and real. (The male character was written to be obnoxious, and that he was.) 4. Less than an hour running time. 5. Unsuspecting moments in the writing. Mostly unpredictable. 6. Did I mention it's 56 minutes?"}, {"id": 70, "text": "The concept is innovative, jump scares were top notch. Really enjoyed the whole time. A great horror movie if you are planning for a weekend or with friends at stay over."}, {"id": 71, "text": "This was brilliantly done.Good acting from everyone. They were natural and it felt real. There are cliched moments but they still worked. It's told from computer screen view like unfriended and searching so we've seen this perspective before.It's a good scary film that takes advantage of the coronavirus so it's clever to take that approach because it becomes instantly relatable.But the acting is what makes this work. Really good."}, {"id": 72, "text": "I found this movie surprisingly different, and in a good way. This fits snugly in between Blair Witch Project and a Zoom conference. The running length caught me off guard, but it fits the film perfectly. The progression of the story is fast and there is absolutely no exploration of the characters. But I think it was meant to be that way. The story has no depth, but it was nonetheless entertaining."}, {"id": 73, "text": "Went into this film very skeptical,, ended up really liking it as the acting was really good, and the atmosphere was built up well and the jump scares were on point , overall 9/10 best horror film I've seen in a long time plus it's runtime is just under a hour , would highly recommend to any horror fans out there."}, {"id": 74, "text": "I don't know about you, but during lockdown, when I'm in a Zoom seance and the guide tells us someone may have inadvertently unleashed a pissed off demonic spirit into our homes, and suddenly unknown sounds and self-propelled inanimate objects begin to occur, I ALWAYS sit with my back to the rest of my darkened residence. Because, hey, the Zoom meeting...Was that a spoiler?"}, {"id": 75, "text": "High recommend to watch it. Worth, best horror of this year ever I had!"}, {"id": 76, "text": "Excellent modern twist on a found footage type film. Perfectly paced, some great jump scares, very creepy in places and very well acted. I'm not lying when I say I had to watch the last 15 mins through my fingers as I was that scared. Highly recommend!"}, {"id": 77, "text": "I am a cinema fanatic, so I spent the film thinking about what the films of 2021 and after will be. if they do not find a cure for covid 19, masked actors respecting social distance, etc. or zoom in on conferences like this, I have no idea how they will turn the situation around because it is our current reality. This film is a good advertisement for the zoom videoconferencing system because everything else is too bad. I wasted my time although I was curious to see where this would take us, nothing new. Honestly it is not worth it and the Imbd rating is very high for such a poor and boring job. not worth it."}, {"id": 78, "text": "I've been a fan of horror since I was a young lad and its been ages since I've watched a film that unsettled me as much as this has done. Firstly its a very clever premise that works perfectly. The build up is succinct and to the point and you get sucked into the narrative very quickly. The characters in the film are surprisingly well fleshed out especially considering the short run time and that draws you into genuinely caring about what is happening to them. The acting from all of the stars of the film is top notch and very believable and this adds to the build up of tension. This tension builds throughout the film very effectively and leaves you feeling very creeped out. The jump scares are excellent, helped by the convincing acting.In short a very effective creepy film, well worth an hour of your time. I'm not sure why the low reviews but I've already re-watched it twice (trying to spot easter eggs) and found it just as unsettling every time."}, {"id": 79, "text": "I haven't watched such good horror movies in a long time"}, {"id": 80, "text": "Wow! How the hell does this have such high ratings. Waste of my time and $5."}, {"id": 81, "text": "So, here is a pretty fantastic horror movie. I had reservations about watching it because it's filmed entirely through Zoom, which felt like an irritating gimmick, but I got used to it pretty quickly and didn't even notice it after a while.This could be the newest Paranormal Activity, or Blair Witch Project. You know, low budget movie, no-name (but fantastic) actors, get together and make a genuinely scary movie.The fact that it is only an hour long is a strength, as there is barely any extraneous material in the movie.I say check it out."}, {"id": 82, "text": "Top marks for creative idea, inventiveness, acting and editing. HOST has to be not only the best shocker to be made during lockdown but is high ranking in the genre overall. HOST is going to face inevitable comparisons to Blair Witch Project and is similar in simplicity and execution. I can say without FEAR of contradiction that this film has more scares and is better executed than a HOST of high budget Hollywood thrillers. Relying on the imagination of the viewer it will appeal to certain tastes where minimalism and tension built through expectations is the key. Very good indeed, well done guys!"}, {"id": 83, "text": "A hanged demonic spirit haunted and killed them all after Jemma made him up by saying there was a good guy and he hanged himself. I could empathize with the characters. Haley was the person who set it up all with Seylan. The way Tony set on fire after his girlfriend became the bend neck woman in mid air. The hanged spirit in the attic and the one with herself walking behing all along while her head was being hit against the table was creepy. The chair moving around by itself, the footprints in the flour sprinkled on the floor, the outline of a ghost under a blanket thrown in the air, we saw it all but it was effectively creepy. The last scene was the best as Jemma got out of her home and went over Hakey after she has been dragged outside of her room. she found her in another room hiding. With the camera flash they moved step by step to leave the house. And the last shot was the photo of the demonic spirit. I loved it!"}, {"id": 84, "text": "This movie is short but sweet. It packs a punch for all of the genre fans out there. A fun little Halloween watch that I will be coming back to."}, {"id": 85, "text": "Rather like Blair Witch, if this gets under your skin it is seriously scary. It got under my skin. Haven't actually been so scared at a movie for a long time. And full marks for making it under an hour. It did what it needed to do, then it finished. Very, very impressive."}, {"id": 86, "text": "Great short horror film with OK acting, very creepy with few jump scares especially the one at the end eventhough I predicted that one it still made me jump I really loved this horror and I not a horror fan but this one felt real I thought I'd watching with it having good reviews and I'm glad I did. I can honestly say one thing though I'd never do one myself no way. The set up of this short horror all on zoom in different houses plus they didn't really do it right it felt rushed but overall good and creepy in be letting my girlfriend watch this one by herself one night."}, {"id": 87, "text": "They could have really done a lot with this storyline. And of course the zoom calls. But it was worth the watch. Some good jump scares and creepy atmosphere. I like the filters on the phones the pick up other faces in the room but you can't see. That concept is pretty scary. I just think they could have done a lot better with the story. But it absolutely was worth the watch. The actresses were great."}, {"id": 88, "text": "The story is very simple, a group of friends trying to organise a virtual seance.Nevertheless, the movie is original because everything unfolds through a VC where we see all participants chatting and the going through scary things. This element gives to the whole movie more authenticity and it makes everything realA must see for those who like horror movies or those who like to see something different."}, {"id": 89, "text": "You know when you stumble onto a movie that turns out to be a hidden gem of a movie? Well, this is definitely one of them. The acting was fantastic. Everything was believable &amp; not too much over the top. This scared the hell out of me. Bravo to this team! I'm highly impressed &amp; excited to see what else you all can do."}, {"id": 90, "text": "Honestly this is one of the best scary movies I've seen in a good while. Supernatural horror movies are my jam, and if they are yours too you'll likely love this one. It keeps surprising you until the end. And kudos for making it so relatable during this pandemic. Very clever. Yes the monsters could have been done better, yes the video quality could have been better (but it's online so it's not supposed to be great), and no there isn't much of a true story line. But I'm totally fine with all that."}, {"id": 91, "text": "A seance in the covid age, done by Zoom, draws out an unwanted guest. This found footage drew me along all the bumps in the night. Great scares, including a giant jump scare that is totally legit. We're in England with one American, the host of the s\u00e9ance. She has asked her friends to join her in this zoom s\u00e9ance having experienced one already with the medium they are to use. She asks that they respect the process, but that doesn't happen."}, {"id": 92, "text": "What a pleasant surprise. Was looking for something new to watch and picked Host. It was a compact, nicely acted and clever film. Turn the lights off, light a candle and sit back for 56 minutes of scary good fun."}, {"id": 93, "text": "I truly can't tell if the racism against the Irish is supposed to be self-aware or not. The narrative is a bit weak, however its biggest weakness is the lack of Contrapasso. It's just a bit too similar to Unfriended."}, {"id": 94, "text": "Very nice idea - Corona quarantine, a seance on zoom. Easy start as the friends meet up online - and then the s\u00e9ance starts and it all gets weird. The Zoom idea works really well - they are alone and can only communicate by screen and watch emphasises the sense of dread. We watch the screen as they watch it; we are part of the seance! Then it gets horrible. A lovey horror surprise!"}, {"id": 95, "text": "Brilliant jump scares well worth a watch !!! Only an hour long but gets straight into it pretty much good acting not your typical American silly horror !"}, {"id": 96, "text": "Love found footage horror films. Especially when they are done right with minimal unsteady hand camera shots and a decent suspenseful build up, with jump scare payoffs like as above and so below. This little gem is just over an hour long and was such a pleasant surprise. It has well placed original jump scares and was shot entirely on zoom! This was very creative and the makers took the right amount of time on character development and horror all in such a short space of time. Some of the actors are a bit annoying and eye rolling at times but If you like to be jump scared and appreciate low budget originality then this film is definitely for you."}, {"id": 97, "text": "More relevant than the South Park Pandemic Special, this live-stream horror flick via Zoom is original and crafty, and an easy watch clocking in just under 60 minutes."}, {"id": 98, "text": "Host is a refreshing modern experimentation of the worn out seance scenes played out in many horror films already. Using a mix of scripted and spontaneous dialogue, a air of authenticity is created. The jump scares in this revamped format of a Zoom call become surprisingly new - resulting in an entertaining and gripping piece. My personal favourite scene was where the spirit was revealed through the facial recognition filter effects."}, {"id": 99, "text": "I kept skipping over this.. So glad i finally decided to watch it..

A group of friends connect through zoom, during quarantine, to have a seance. It's all fun and games until it's not.Not bad. This had a far creepier atmosphere than Unfriended (2014). I believe they made a sequel to that but I've not watched it. This did, however, come across much darker. It has some decent jump scares and nice visuals. The actors were relatable and did a good job overall. It was pretty short and to the point too so it wasn't hard to stay interested as it held a fairly consistent pace.I liked it. Good watch for a night on the couch."}, {"id": 102, "text": "Just dumb. Watched because of reviews. Scary, ummm, no. Been here seen this. Dull."}, {"id": 103, "text": "Surprisingly scary, well acted, and well shot- Host makes the most out of our current situations by giving us a glimpse of horror in our all too familiar reality. I'll start with the flaws. The film can be a bit formulaic in its setup, mainly the slow start to build suspense, although it is obviously necessarily. It has a few tropes up its sleeve, but for the most part, Host proves to be a rather clever and wonderfully scary horror film that I quite enjoyed. Everyone really did give their best performances. Although I feel I can't necessarily pick a standout, since all together the cast is rather good, I feel the need to give credit to Emma Louise Webb- who carried the film single handedly in a huge chunk. The film isn't very long, in fact, its a little less than an hour, but it still makes the most of its time frame to provide for truly brilliant scares and suspense that will have you gasping of shock at the screen in front of you. In the end, Host is a low budget masterpiece, and on its own, a really good little horror flick. Give this one a try! My Rating: 9.25/10"}, {"id": 104, "text": "Not a bad movie. However, the incessant nonsense babbling for the first 9 minutes or so of this movie just dragged on and on and contributed so little to the movie. Ok, it shows a boyfriend who has a very minor part and some interference noise that is important throughout the movie, but that could have been done in a minute.

It ain't perfect by any stretch, but it is imaginative, creative, and even knowing there's a jump scare moment about to happen, it still manages to be blood-chilling when it pops off.

But not in these. It's so terrifying, yet they keep filming. It's so painfully dumb.The premise is also just as dumb. During a s\u00e9ance on zoom, one person fakes a ghost and somehow that opens the door for a real demon, of course, forgetting that every s\u00e9ance anyone has for fun or real always has one or more people doing this.Then we get the same stuff from Paranormal Activity, almost totally ripped off.The worst thing is this is just under an hour but the first 20 minutes is these people talking. Maybe interesting if you're a 13 year old girl, but an adult is going please, for the love of God just kill me.Also if you get a chance, freeze frame on the very last demon. Monster make up on the main part of the face, and then the rest is just human, regular skin - like a demon would have pink skin and a skinny body.

Thankfully the movie surpassed my expectations. It's not the best horror movie ever made but it is a very fun and mindless horror movie if you have an hour to spare. It's almost short enough to give an anthology type vibe. Like I could almost see this movie being a good fit for a VHS 4 ( if they ever make one and if it doesn't suck like the third VHS did) if it were just a bit shorter.

Due to the unusual precautions which the crew had to face in order to comply with health standards at the time of the film's release, I have to commend them for creating something despite the circumstances... but besides that, this film has no other redeeming qualities.The plot was lackluster, offering nothing new or interesting that hasn't been done before in a found footage film, and the pacing wasn't that great, with the first sign of paranormal activity occurring about halfway through the hour-long film, but what really nailed the coffin and cemented the idea that this was a bad film in my eyes was the cheap jumpscare at the very end. Before that, I was thinking that maybe it was slightly good, but the ending was the worst I've ever seen in a film and I couldn't bring myself to give it a favorable review.If the lockdown didn't happen and we weren't all using Zoom, I don't think I'd recommend this film to anyone, but if you're bored and looking for an easy watch to put on your quarantine watchlist, I'd say go for it simply because of the experience... but there are definitely way better films out there that you could be watching right now instead of this one."}, {"id": 140, "text": "I enjoyed this immensely.

A 56 minute long film shot during quarantine over Zoom. From a critique standpoint, it seemed like a quick cash grab, trying to push a product out for streaming services thirsty for content.From a filmmaker standpoint, I said Damn, this should have been me. When this all started back in March, one of the first things to pop in my head wasn't stocking up on water or ramen noodles. It was making a feature film with all this time on my hand.What I ended up with was a couple of made for quarantine fest short films starring myself. So when I first heard about this project a few days ago, one of my first thoughts was Wow, someone actually did it.Yesterday, I decided to check it out and all I can say is wow, shockingly surprised (emphasis on shock).Immediately I was reminded of Unfriended: Dark Web. A 2018 film that I highly enjoyed. It took a while to get into a film that was already considered short as a feature. It would say by 20 minutes into this, that's when things took off. And when it takes off, it didn't stop. Mixing a blend of Unfriended meets Paranormal Activity, one of the things this film does extremely well is the use of subtlety. One factor that plays well with this film is that there is no traditional soundtrack that would normally be used to emphasize a jumpscare. Because without that in this film, it made it even more scary. The one thing that stuck with me the most is that idea of Did I just see that in the background?.It is of course when the young female leads of this film think they are safe (even though you no that's not the case), when that use of subtlety is used the best. From that moment, this suspense train goes full speed with no intent on slowing down until the final minute. I am still extremely impressed on how well the effects for this film came out. I am still wondering with the limitations that the filmmakers had, how they did some of this stuff.Usually in the expectations vs. reality of filmmaking, it's the expectations in your head as a filmmaker that you want big budget Marvel like special effects, and it's the reality that you end up with more or less a B movie straight to DVD starring Eric Roberts and Michael Madsen special effects. My point is, in the rare occasion of small style filmmaking, this film pulls off reality beating expectations. I can't imagine the amount of patience the director had to of had with his cast and crew when trying to coordinate all of this. Overall, I was highly impressed with this film, giving it a 9/10 on IMDB. I definitely recommend checking it out, especially at night with the lights off. I watched it during the day with lights on and was still freaked out.Shudder is easily becoming the go to for quality content in the horror genre. They definitely take an artistic approach with their choices and are not just about quick cash grabs. Like A24, they are growing as a big player in this market and I am very excited to see where they go from here."}, {"id": 156, "text": "Does anyone really enjoy these ultra cheap desktop view films ?

I personally found the movie Dull and Boring and didn't find it scary at all. Like I was really hoping this was gonna be Unfriended but actually good, but no it was arguable less stupid then but it was still pretty dumb in my eyes.I mean more power to anyone that likes the film and found it scary, but I mostly board throughout the entire film and really I felt like this film is being blinded with praise because of the gimmick and that its set in a current event that all of us are facing right now and we're all on edge about.Here are a couple of problems I had with this film.There are literally no characters in this film, they're all just very one-dimensional character that only served to be a victim to this demon.15 minutes of the film is wasted on the usual, hey this is real life and in real-life there are boring moments... yeah, still doesn't change the fact that it's boring. Could have been used to really flesh out the characters, but nope, just do mundane things that do nothing but to pad the very short film.Each character pretty much does an in your face Chekhov's gun, like showing a video effect on the screen, which made it pretty damn obvious a scare is gonna happen using it.I saw no solid good reasons why these people would want to waste their time doing this sequence thing, to begin with.Yes, there is Lock-Down, but where not in like the Purge, people are still able to leave the house, call the cops, run next door to your neighbors (which one of the characters did) so I didn't felt the quarantine of this pandemic added or did anything to this film at all.You see these characters being tossed around and witnessing some crazy stuff, but they still think its important to carry their Laptops, Tablets, or Cell Phone around when they have no good reason to other than so us the audience can see what is happening.Why was the last person alive took her laptop around the room other then so we the audience can see what happens?A large portion of the scares in this film is the tried and true lazy in your face loud jump scare."}, {"id": 162, "text": "A genuinely good scare jump horror movie.

There are two obvious reasons this movie has doje so well. Firstly, the movie lightly touches on the coronavirus epidemic. The characters are all on lockdown because of the virus which is why they are all communicating through skype. Though obvious, this is told through very minor and minimal references. Audiences widely will automatically be drawn to this storyline as we can all relate to this. Our lives have all been ravaged by the invisible threat and it is a passionate and sensitive topic for most us.. This film was shot during the epidemic, but there are still far too little references to it rendering it nearly pointless and useless. The bigger and main reason this film did well is because it was released via Shudder, the horror and genre film platform. This is very fortunate for this movie because normally this is the type of found footage low budget schlock you'd find on amazon prime for free especially considering its confused runtime which never allows for a fully immersive experience. This movie is somewhere caught up in the confusion between a short and a feature film, and movies like this usually don't get seen by anyone except for true horror and film fans who dig this stuff up. Maybe found footage lovers like myself would seek this movie out if it were on amazon prime to watch on a Friday night but then would be taken aback by its runtime, thinking its not long enough for me n my girlfriend or my friends to settle into. So shudder GREATLY helped this film, if not entirely. So all in all this is clever promoting even if one dislikes the movie. The film itself plays out over one single skype call similarly to Unfriended and E-Demon. E-Demon is an example of basically the same exact storyline but is not released through shudder. E-Demon is unknown to most if not all and is no worse than Host. The scares you will find in Host are clever and for the most part effective which actually IS a bit rare in found footage the more these types of movies come out. There is a true terror held through out Host that lets up too soon. The part with the face filter was very scary and creative, however, the material isn't newly realized. Nonetheless, the horror and atmosphere is still tense and scary even with the overuse of jump scares and sudden loud sounds/bangs. So all in all this movie is pretty scary but not by any means is it scarier than many other amazon prime released found footage low budgeters. The all girl cast gets a little annoying for me as I think male characters tend to be more interesting in film. A much scarier movie is Murder Death Koreatown. Both films are very low budget and belong in the same realm but Host doesn't even hold a candle to MDK..Really this makes me sad to see the wrong films getting wide praise like this. What about the other 100 competitors for this type of acclaim? Still, Host is a decent found footage entry with some decent scares."}, {"id": 169, "text": "You've seen this movie before, and yes it is exactly what you expect.Cast: Jemma was very annoying, but the rest of the cast were mostly fine.Plot: They summon spooky scary stuff. OooOOoOoOo OOoOoooOo. Actual Plot: A lot of darkness, a lot of jumpscares and invisible threats. Ending: A jump scare. Just like the rest of these movies. Completely pointless.I saw that this horror movie floated under my radar. Excitedly I gave it a watch, and unfortunately. This movie is literally every other low budget teen-scarefest. If jumpscares and invisible monsters dont scare you, give this movie a HUGE PASS. While it is rather short, even for a horror film, geez did it feel like it was 12 hours long. Also, the characters dont really act like real people. If something invisible literally drags/throws you across a room, your instincts wouldnt be to just stay there, and get back to your position on your computer/phone. No one calls for REAL help (the police) or even friends/neighbors. Jemma literally says in the beginning of the movie that she can hear her neighbors! Yet all of her yelps and screams dont get their attention, nor does she yell for help, try to go to her neighbors apartment. No, they all just sit in their rooms (for the most part) while letting an unknown entity toss them around while wimpering.BIG SPOILER: The 'demon' is a guy with no shirt on, curly brown hair, a missing nose and F'd up mouth. I paused to check out the final jump scare and it was literally the least scary thing. Oh, he also had white eyes. Ooooooo spooky. For some reason, he also seems to be radioactive?

The best decision the film makers made was the run time. I would probably check out more found footage if it was kept to an hour or less. It's a good fit for that style of story telling. The down side to Host is that it features all the typical faults of found footage. First, the horror is hinged entirely upon jump scares. I will admit they do a good job of springing a few things on you unexpectedly but most scary moments were ones you could almost count down to. The other common flaw is what I call stretching the format. Host did a decent job of sticking to a believable found footage formate until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie where the characters begin carrying their devices as they search their surroundings in a manner that would never take place in a real situation. Ultimately, I think Host still ran 10-15 minutes too long but it's definitely worth a watch."}, {"id": 177, "text": "Bros this is Horrifyingly amazing!

I can think of numerous similar films better than this one. Dark Summer, Dark Web, Unfriended, Friend Request, The Den, Pulse ect. This one is specific to a paranormal entity being spread through a video chat but it's still similar to all the ones I've mentioned and this one is by far the worst of them. I have to assume many of these reviews and ratings are just fans of Shudder itself and not necessarily this film.

The summoning of the evil spirit lasts like 1 minute, if you blink you miss it. After that it's a lot of cheap scares. Some are well done but still predictable. The last scare is the exact copy of a scene from the first Saw movie when Adam uses the flash camera to see in the dark. After watching Host I thought that maybe I didn't like it because I'm not into paranormal movies but then I remembered I do occasionally enjoy some paranormal horror when it's classy and well done, like the Conjuring or Paranormal Activity.

Think Unfriended, but a bit more concise and British.Considering it was made under the restrictions of Lockdown, you can't deny it's a little impressive and while it's web-call haunting premise isn't entirely original, it's incorporation if Zoom helps it become a bit more relatable. There's not much room to make any performance shine, but all the acting's okay for the most part. The character's are also decent, I really didn't like Jemma, but I don't think you're supposed to.The jump-scares are kind of annoying and I think the film would've been better off with just the one, but there general execution's still effective.

This was an example of a couple of details that didn't work so well. The person running outside for a moment without a mask would have been safe to get the shot. The pacing is really slow, the first twenty minutes follows the paranormal activity cliche of things being calm and non-scary for a very long time until stuff starts going wrong. I will give the film credit for slowly ratcheting up there tension, the person's feet hanging was especially creepy and the background zoom effect coming in and out was inventive.

It is a horror film based in the idea of holding a s\u00e9ance over zoom, the video conferencing cloud platform. Host starts with this inspired concept and leads us into a horror scenario that lasts as long as a zoom session and delivers the ultimate malware - demonic possession. The film mixes original scares with more familiar ones. Camera filters materialise in the real world, a background video clip becomes increasingly unsettling. As the film progresses the scares become more recognisable and its debt to the found footage genre and particularly the first Paranormal Activity film becomes more apparent. Dark corridors, a creepy attic, always a house's graveyard, flour thrown on the floor to reveal footprints, cupboard doors swinging and banging, and characters pulled along the floor with the door slamming shut after them. These scenes work better in Host than in most films as it delivers them so many of them, and so quickly, you really feel the assault on the characters. The cast is especially important in making Host work so well. With no backstories or deep characterisation, the film relies on their chemistry to establish believability, which they do very successfully. The improvisation, their reactions and interactions grounds the film and gives the fear and horror a foundation to grip onto. The zoom multiscreen having all the cast in constant closeup gives an almost Blair Witch level of close tension. Host is one of the better horror films of the year. It's as contemporary as can be and harks back to some of the best recent horror films. The genre often stays away from new technology but there's really no reason to. A haunted screen can be as scary as a haunted house.

Watch it first for the story, and again for how did they do that? This is a movie of its time in its time; all the actors were socially distant, and there were no gaffers, or script girls, or sets.

It could've been a nice replacement for Unfriended, which is one of the better (albeit also very formulaic) horror films to come out in the last 10 years without the uncomfortable reality of profiting off bullying-related suicides looming over your head the whole time. Instead, what you got was a horribly formulaic film that, while executed well in some respects, just doesn't hold up very well. But it's always best to start with the positives. The banter between the characters is believable, although it comes off as forced a little bit. They've definitely gone above and beyond to perfectly replicate the Zoom experience, down to the limitations of using a free account.However, the movie gets bad pretty quickly. It's boring; nothing of substance really happens and, when things finally do start to take off, it's exactly what you would expect from this kind of movie, practically down to every microscopic detail. Cheap jumpscares abound as a cop-out to avoid creating any real tension that pays off in a satisfying way. And the effects, when they were used (not mentioned in specifics due to spoilers) take you right out of the movie. They're goofy, cartoony and only scary because they're accompanied by loud noises and flashes of light. Mute the film and it'll offer you literally nothing. There's nothing scary or even remotely unnerving about this film.Even the message of the film is old, one that's been done a million times. Don't contact the spirit world, because things will go awry. Duh. I can't realistically imagine a respectable writer in the business who would still see that as a subject fit for exploration.

I've also only used Zoom once, and rarely use video during conference calls, so in that sense I am not quite target audience for this. Despite this it worked very well. The plot sees a group of friends all stuck in their various homes, using Zoom to get together and do a virtual s\u00e9ance for a bit of fun. Sticking with the Zoom format in a sort of 'found-footage' approach for the modern age, it follows the s\u00e9ance as it 'goes wrong'.At a tight 60 minutes running time, the film doesn't waste a lot of time, but opens nicely so that we are in familiar territory - the technical issues, the glitches, the slightly forced air of 'fun', the people who put in too much effort, and the people who are showing off a bit too obviously. Whether you find that engaging or annoying, it is certainly convincing. From here we move into the bangs and odd occurrences, and things escalate quickly. The cast do a lot of good work in convincing of their fear - and given that mostly we are focused on faces looking at screens, it is an important factor. Mostly the scares are jump scares, but the consistency of them does create its own mood and tension. It is very much a genre piece, with Blair Witch, (Rec.), and endless other horrors in its construct - rather than seem derivative though, it manages to feel like it is drawing on the past to inform the current; it may not date well, but certainly for the current time the use of lockdown, isolations, Zoom chats etc, it does fit and works well.Best watched like you're on the call - on a laptop in a darkened room."}, {"id": 224, "text": "I want to get this out of the way: I am a friend of Haley Bishop's (who plays Haley, the lead and the host of the Zoom call). We met in college and lived in the same dorm, so we got close. I remember her as a good singer at the time, and since then I started to know her as a good up-and-coming actress. I have been supporting her as she's getting more roles, so when I first learned that she was in Host, I knew I had to check it out ASAP.Anyway, onto the film that I would coin as Paranormal Activity meets Unfriended meets quarantine (not Quarantine the movie, but our current situation heh). This 56-minute Shudder original production plays succinctly, and this becomes an advantage for the film's story structure. It might have helped because I'm personally connected with Haley, but because she was essentially playing herself I was easily able to connect with the other members in the Zoom call, seeing them as her friends. I didn't need massive amounts of character introduction, and they were able to naturally develop and distinguish themselves in quick and short order. They don't feel like campy horror movie characters, they just felt like people. It made it feel really easy to be involved in the session.The timing of this film is also noteworthy, and in my opinion it is most important that people who CAN watch it now are also able to. This flick is focused around a seance through online chat because they are quarantined. This is our lives right now, and this is the kind of way that something like this would and should have to occur. We aren't a stranger to the elements that the writers and director of Host wanted to convey most strongly. This helps brings a little bit more charm for us who are all feeling a bit insane during these times. This time, watch others live it for a little while, and watch terror occur in the process! Heh.The audience members who were critical of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk had fits partly with the lack of girth that could have been used to build the characters and story. In a similar sense, Host wastes no time giving you the characters, perhaps a foreshadowing item or two that you expect to arise later, and won't answer every question that you might have about what you see on screen. To this, I say that is completely fine. They work hard on giving you less and leaving you wanting more, and honestly the movie is better because of it. David Sandberg's short film version of Lights Out was impeccably creepier than its full-length feature film because they didn't try to provide exposition and background to everything, and this movie is like that but with a lot of character interaction in the process. I don't feel you'll be disappointed in this regard if you understand this intent.This is well acted by all parties involved. What was nice is even if the movie might not necessarily scare you in itself (depending on who you are), the way that the actors convey fear when appropriate (as you'll also get bouts of denial and ignorance) makes you frightful as they are. Unlike Unfriended, this feels a lot less produced, and that's a good thing, because I feel like Haley and the other actors could really play this in as few takes as possible, and even improvise when needed. There is at least one part that they had to play off an unintended mishap, and it was left in the movie not as a gag reel highlight, but rather as a happy accident.I started playing this at 2:00 AM, knowing that I wouldn't be able to stay awake even an hour longer and I'd finish it the next day. Come 3:00 AM, I'm at the credits and wondering how I'm tenfold more awake than I was when I started the movie. It never really lets you breathe too much to say what a good stopping point would be if needed, and that's kind of a cool facet that many other films aren't able to have as often. It doesn't really play in scenes, it's simply a session and I loved it for that.Anyway, I will completely acknowledge my bias here, but I like that it did the screencasting found footage format differently, specifically by trimming the fat of the run time. It really worked in its own favor. If people here haven't seen Searching, you'll get another different take on what this format has to offer and excels as well (given that it takes more than one kind of source, has a soundtrack, zooms on parts of the screen, etc.), so it just goes to show that this format can work in a lot of different ways and still be successful in the process. Again, this helps for the times that we live in right now, and I highly commend them for executing it well on top of it.If you're not a fan of Unfriended and Paranormal Activity, this MAY not be for you. However, if this review gives you slight hope of optimism, you have an hour to spare, and you would like to support my friend in the process, please hop onto Shudder and give this a looksie!"}, {"id": 225, "text": "REVIEW - HOSTAs we all know over the past 4 months there have been very few new films because of the pandemic, which in a strange way actually made this film even more enjoyable.Filmed during lock down and referring to the situation around the current pandemic a shot UK film was released that probably no one has heard of.A group of teens do an online Zoom session with a medium to try and see what would happen, of course things go wrong when one of them doesn't take it seriously and summons........Small budget, but hugely enjoyable and even actually made me jump in one place!Definitely one to watch but just a word of caution, don't watch it on a windy night and leave your Windows open so your doors move on their own, spooky.Rating 7 out of 10"}, {"id": 226, "text": "Just when we all thought it wasn't possible to make a film any cheaper than a lost footage film, along comes this made for TV film utilizing a free Zoom account, webcams &amp; selfie phone videos.

And there are a good number that are unsettling or disturbing for most of the movie. But Host is honestly the first horror movie I've seen in almost 30 years that was actually SCARY from the moment the action started up until the very end. Not since I watched the original Night of the Living Dead when I was 6... my very first horror film and still my absolute favorite... have I seen a horror movie that was perfect as far as what horror movies are supposed to be.It was a premise that's been in hundreds, if not over a thousand, horror movies... an unseen ghost or demon or entity terrorizing a group of people, so nothing new there. But it was HOW they presented a familiar premise that made it so great. The movie being presented as though you're watching the actual events on a computer screen does a perfect job of making you feel as though you're a part of the story, watching the events transpire in real time. No time lapses or cut scenes, it's one big, long event that you watch play out from start to finish. And what really sets this apart from the 30 other horror movies released each year is the absolutely PERFECT and effective use of tension, atmosphere, and palpable, believable fear from the characters. The casting was so well done because they all interact so naturally, it doesn't even come off as acting.Some people might be put off by the relatively short run time of about 56 minutes (which is probably slightly less when you account for beginning and ending credits)... I usually don't find short movies to even be worth it, and I may have passed this one up if I had seen that prior to watching it the first time... but I have to say, this movie did such an amazing job of sucking me in and keeping me immersed in what was happening, I didn't notice even AFTER it was over. It wasn't until the second time that I saw the runtime before putting it on.As I'm thinking about how to compare this horror flick to others I've seen, it really occurred to me that after 30 years and literally hundreds of horror movies that I love so much, this one is without a doubt my second favorite horror movie EVER. My #1 will always be Night because it's total horror perfection for so so many reasons, but Host has beat out countless other favorites (Alien, The Shining, It Follows, As Above So Below, Texas Chainsaw) just for the simple fact that it scared me to the point that, at 35 years old, I had to sleep with the lights on for the first time since seeing Night for the first time. Really. Obviously, Alien and Chainsaw and Shining were ORIGINAL and had INCREDIBLE STORIES, so as far as just being FILMS, they are far superior.

But once the board is set and pieces start moving, Savage unleashes pure terror on the screen. What's also impressive about his direction is that he is patient with the setup and ratchets things up only after the viewers are on board.Though there are foreshadowings, predictable routines &amp; genre tropes to be found here, the film makes the most of all resources it has at its disposal. Use of visual &amp; sound effects is neat. The plot is lean, fast paced &amp; doesn't allow the tension to dissipate once the horror aspects kick in. Acting is credible, characters are believable, and their fear &amp; confusion aptly mirror our own. Even jump scares are highly effective, thanks to their smart placement, timing &amp; execution.Overall, Host is a steadily escalating &amp; nerve-wracking horror that silently draws you in and then keeps you on the edge of your seats with unrelenting intensity. Providing the desired thrills in nail-biting doses and turning reality into nightmare by tapping into contemporary fears, this bone-chilling tale of a s\u00e9ance over zoom call gone wrong is a clever, effective &amp; genuinely frightening example of pandemic-fuelled creativity.

Well...probably the kind of idiots who do seances over Zoom. Does it seem that unrealistic that they would bring the camera with them for the other participants of the seance to experience as well? I'm surprised so many people couldn't figure that out.So normally I'd take away 5 stars automatically for it being a found footage. That's how serious I am in my campaign against that type of uninventive, lazy filmmaking. However, I found the idea a little creative and relevant with the runtime being the length of a free Zoom meeting, so I gave it a shot. That it was 57 minutes was a huge strength, any longer would have been unacceptable.

They still manage to develop the characters okay, but purely through their interactions rather than any additional exposition, an it's enough to give you a good feel for their personalities and relationships. Definitely worth a watch, especially while many of us are still in lockdown, and at less than an hour, even if it doesn't match the hype, you really won't be too disappointed.

Despite the shorter runtime which is usually a positive thing; A constrained time limit restricted its full potential to flourish! Having seen similar movies before such as 'Searching' &amp; 'Unfriended'; I must admit this fails to impress on so many grounds.Shall we begin with the positives first?To start with, the scares are well put. They genuinely makes you terrified about the situation the characters are in. Performances are solid and convincing enough for us to engage with the flow! The tension stays throughout the entirety and keeps you second guessing.Now the negatives...Due to its relatively shorter length, none of the characters got any chance to develop whatsoever! The fondness, the chemistry inbetween felt irrelevant and disjointed. Supposed supernatural happenings occur without any prior motives! A baseless showcasing of horror that simply doesn't mean much. Albeit they scare you and that's admirable; but how did it come to its existence? Were there any strong reasons behind for which the characters faced their penultimate consequences?

When this one works is due to the idea of this all happening at once over the video-call, where the darkened atmosphere in their rooms creates a somewhat intriguing setup that allows all the supernatural antics to feel somewhat believably. The longer it goes on, the more the strange knocks, flashing lights and smashing objects feel more intense and creepy, especially once the attacks become physical as that's where the intensity picks up. Several of these scenes are outright terrifying when viewed through the format, taking full advantage of the intimacy created to provide some fantastic shocks. These are what manage to hold the film up as there are several issues to be had with this one. One of the biggest drawbacks is the inability to care about anything that the girls do which rarely seems to bee worth following around. The first half here is insanely dull and bland before the seance starts with inane chatter and conversations between everyone about how they're handling the lockdowns or screwing around on the various processes involved with the computer call to get anything out about them. That they then go through the cliched notion of outright disrespecting the seance and then lying and arguing about everything like it wasn't their fault cements how unlikable they are. The other issue with this one is the strange series of choices featured here for the attacks that make no sense. The byproduct of this one being done through the internet video chat means that a lot of what happens should've never been recorded. Taking the camera or computer with them when they're being hunted and stalked by an unknown malicious source attacking them is the least of their worries and being able to capture what happens is quite unrealistic in this setup, while all that tends to crop up elsewhere on the chat is the others screaming without doing anything such as calling for help. This strikes as quite problematic and doesn't do much to help this one, lowering the film somewhat.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence."}, {"id": 236, "text": "This was a film that I kept hearing a lot about and was intrigued to check out. It seems that some people really liked it while others not so much. Since it was a 2020 film and had a short runtime, I decided to give it a viewing on Friday night with Jaime. I'll get into it a bit later how it effected us later. First though, the synopsis is six friends hire a medium to hold a s\u00e9ance via Zoom during lockdown, but they get far more than they bargained for as things quickly go wrong.We start this movie off with Haley (Haley Bishop), starting a Zoom meeting. She invites a bunch of her friends and we follow as she gets herself set up. While she is away from her computer, someone tries to join, but needs to be accepted. Haley hears things being thrown at her window and she checks to see it is Jemma (Jemma Moore). She then accepts her and Jemma goes home to get on her computer as well.The rest of the crew starts to join of Emma (Emma Louise Webb), Radina (Radina Drandova) and Caroline (Caroline Ward). We get to learn a bit about some of them through these early interactions. Jemma is a bit of a prankster. Radina just moved in with her boyfriend at the start of quarantine, Alan (Alan Emrys). Things aren't going great as they really don't know each other. Caroline lives at home with her dad and we see she also has set up in Zoom a background that is her walking into her room, opening a drawer and brushing her hair.Someone who also joins is their friend Teddy (Edward Linard). He has also moved in with his rich girlfriend, Jinny (Jinny Lofthouse) at her parents' place. Finally Seylan (Seylan Baxter) joins who is their medium. She tries to get them to take this seriously, but it isn't going well from the start. Teddy leaves when Jinny interrupts and closes his laptop.When they finally settle in, Jemma is spooked by something. She claims someone grabbed her neck and that his name is the same as someone she knew when she was a child who was nice to her. She is shaken up and something weird happens on Seylan's screen. She is removed from the Zoom meeting. After she disappears, Jemma reveals the truth. The problem though is that something really starts to happen as each of the women and Teddy, when he finally rejoins. There is something messing with them and it could be a spirit that they conjured.Now that's where I want to leave my recap as I don't really want to go into spoilers, but give you a bit more background and expanding on the synopsis. What I gave is literally half of the movie. What I find interesting is that from my understanding as I've never held a Zoom meeting, but the free version only allots you about an hour. This movie has a runtime of 56 minutes so I dig that they're keeping with the realism. I will say that I have done a few Zoom meetings with friends during this quarantine, so being able to understand helps.Next I should say this movie did freak me and Jaime out. I don't think it will work on everyone, but some of things that happen tick boxes for me. What I like is that we can see things happening behind characters who don't always know it is. Other characters on the meeting will notice it sometimes and that just helped to ramp the fear up for me. We get some effective things that are just glimpses at times. It is enough to freak me out, but not enough for me to critique it.I have heard some people saying that having been stuck in the house for this quarantine and needing to use Zoom to see friends or for work, they don't want to see it in their entertainment. Maybe since for me, I don't use it a lot, I actually really dig the concept and what they did here. Do I think this movie is great? No, I think it is good though. I have a feeling that when life goes to a new normal, we're going to look back at this little time capsule and be more impressed with what this movie did. I've heard a few different titles thrown around for what to call it and Desktop Horror seems to be the one gaining traction. It is a subgenre of the subgenre of found footage. The ones I've seen so far, I dig it.What really makes this work for me is the realism of what they're doing here. None of the actresses really stand out, but I could feel like they all have a relationship and know each other, so I give credit there. Haley gets annoyed with Jemma for not taking it seriously. Jemma seems like that friend so props to Moore how she played it. Webb seems like the younger one in the group where Bishop feels like someone cooped up who wants to do something different. There are hints that Drandova might make rash decisions that aren't always the best and her friends know it. Ward lives with her father and it seems like she's a good person there to help him out. The rest really do round out to help shape them, but this is all I got in such a small timeframe from their interactions. I find that to be pretty impressive to be honest.Being that this is a type of found footage movie where we are just getting the desktop video of all of them or from their phone, it makes it interesting with the frames we get. For a lot of the movie, we're seeing the gallery view of Zoom where all of them are on screen. What I liked here is that I'm trying to rapidly look through all of their frames for what is going to happen. It kept me engaged. It will zoom in and focus like you would get if you have speaker mode, to highlight the one talking. They seem to use as many of the features as you can as well of Zoom. I thought the look of the spirit in the movie was quite creepy. We only get glimpses, but that is more terrifying for me sometimes. Aside from that, we get some cool haunting effects that seem to be done practical for the most part. I can really only think of something with Jinny done with CGI. It didn't look great, but I'm not taking away anything there.The last thing to cover would be the sound design. We don't get music at all, which I'm glad. It adds to the realism of the footage. What we do get is ambient sound. There's a music box that Teddy has that is creepy when we hear it. There are bumping noises and things to this effect as well. It really helps to add to the ambience of what they're going for which helped to build tension for me.Now with that said, I thought what this movie did was pretty effective for me. Is this going to be loved and found terrifying for everyone? No it won't. It worked for me though. I like the realism of the length of the movie with a Zoom session. What they did for the haunting of people was good and it uses things that freak me out. The acting isn't great, but it doesn't have to be. It felt natural of a group of people that know each other and I picked up little things about each of them. The effects were good and the ambient use of sound was as well. I would say this is a good movie and would recommend it if all of what I'm saying works for you."}, {"id": 237, "text": "For a modern film in the 'jumpscare' sub-genre, it is amazing that all of the scares are the same tired cliches. Sometimes the same gag is employed in back-to-back scenes. Baffling.We are introduced to a group of friends in a Zoom call, all of 'em forgettable non-characters. They're just there. They engage in a seance (there is no artistry to this - it is them literally asking 'is there anybody there' next to a candle) and then a demon shows up. Any questions this may raise go unanswered. A spooky spook is gonna get 'em. That's it. I could forgive this extreme streamlining of plot, narrative, character and story if we were taken on a rollercoaster ride. But no. It's slow and often tedious. Not even the short runtime can hide this fact. Very little happens and when it does, you've seen it before.I'm not impressed by loud noises and 2-frame inserts of 'scary' faces. Horror is a genre with so much to offer. This sort of movie makes me wonder if the filmmakers actually like horror. I doubt it. I think this was made for cynical reasons. Nobody was burning to tell this story.The production is poor, which can be forgiven for the lockdown circumstances in which it was made, but that means we also lose out on costume, lighting, set design, score, etc. The writing is too scant to even criticize. The acting is barely present, with the exception of Seylan Baxter as the medium, who is the only actor that manages to present herself like a real person. She's good, and represents my one star."}, {"id": 238, "text": "I'd seen recommendations for this movie (does 56 minutes qualify it as a movie?) in a couple of online horror groups, it was pretty much unanimously liked by all who had seen it.It's a pretty simple premise - 6 friends in Covid19 lockdown having a Zoom chat (think Unfriended), something which a great many of us did. Difference is they've hired a psychic to conduct a seance with them. They giggle about how it's not real, mock the paranormal, then admit the psychic to the chat. From there on in it's a pretty creepy movie, quite a few jump scares, some very irritating actors (the one male friend and the girl named Jemma are just awful) and quite a few 'nods' to Paranormal Activity, The Blair Witch Project and REC (look for the camera in the loft scene and you'll see what I mean), as whatever has been invited in via Jemma's stupidity begins to seek out the participants one by one. It starts with little scares then builds to some pretty good jump scares.It's not big budget, it's not the best horror movie ever, it's not even top 100, but it's pretty good considering that it was filmed whilst the actors were actually locked down. Considering I was expecting another predictable horror I was genuinely surprised at how good it is."}, {"id": 239, "text": "* There is no end credit scene *The director Rob Savage and crew brought an intense heart-pounding horror film. The story sets when six friends and a medium hold a s\u00e9ance via Zoom due to the quarantine. I love horror films set in found-footage technique and in this case a computer screen film. I thought it was going to be the same level as Unfriended (2014) but it wasn't, it surpasses immensely the intensity and also with a better captivating story. Once my heart started pounding it never stopped, and I wanted more of this kind of fright. This film needs to be watched at night to be able to experience a complete horror atmosphere and if you are desperate to watch and it still not dark then I recommend going to your room and shut everything, do not even let a single light in. How I loved it touched the theme of taking a s\u00e9ance seriously and the consequences of making jokes out of things one doesn't understand.The narrative has a great structure giving the right amount of character introduction without focusing on it making it feel a real-life session and the cast performance was solid. This technique always sets a known conclusion that is why the main center is the unfolding fear in which creeps one surrounding and it truly delivers."}, {"id": 240, "text": "Watched this last night alone and genuinely scared the crap out of me. Basic, low budget and short and sweet at 57 minutes long it was effective as a supernatural horror film.Set during lockdown over a Zoom call which is current and we've all been through it.Turns out that you don't need a big budget to make a decent horror film. Pretty clever idea actually given this years events. Far better than the un scary big budget horror let downs lately. Was obviously filmed during lockdown with minimal crew.Not sure what the low reviewers were expecting. Maybe big budget with violence and gore? This effectively creeped me out and I slept with a lamp on \ud83d\ude02 So to me that's a good scary movie.Definitely recommend if you liked films such as Unfriended, though in my opinion this was better."}, {"id": 241, "text": "Six friends gather online for a seance during lockdown, but end up sending out the wrong invitation.Pretty much the same set up as Unfriended, using the tried and failed idea of getting the characters to sit around and face each other ... hang on - the cheesiest device in horror just found its perfect scenario!This is pretty good. With no opportunity for a wide shot of a car travelling on a country road, the director just gets down to business with the characters. The performances are fine, given there's so little back story or history to work with. The process of going through the looking glass is gradual, although the pace does pick up about half way through, and it all fits nicely into the run time.Some decent frights, but nothing original, and the mythos is fuzzy as a couple of kills happen outside the circle of the seance. Also, the title suggests a particular plot device on the Zoom platform, but I don't think that was followed through. A big problem with jump scares is that they need good sound design, but in this format and these circumstances it's not available. Plus the only music is internal, which really limits the horror effect.In the end, I was hoping for a reveal to cause a sharp intake of breath, like in Rec or Blair Witch, but no luck.Still, it's an improvement on Unfriended, which also had a neat concept but was way too busy with onscreen information and stuffed with gurning performances. But that was five years ago, and we have yet to see the computer screen deliver the same intelligence as the cameras in Blair Witch.Overall: One small step on horror's road to hell."}, {"id": 242, "text": "This is a very good computer horror honestly i really liked it.The lenght was perfect at 56 minutes. These movies at more than an hour tend to drag and you lose the fun of the experience. This is quite a jam packed 56 minutes.They made this during quarantine so there is a few clever nods to the pandemic. 1 of them was too much for me tho. One lady gets scared to death in a scene and decide to run out of her house. Scared to death she still takes the time to put on a mask...at night...when no one is around... i raised my eyebrow there. (Edit : I'm not anti mask at all but in the same situation i would have noped out of the house so quick without thinking one second about stopping to be sure to wear a face mask)I wanted to give it an 8 but the last shot of the movie was so clich\u00e9 horror trope that it almost ruined it for me i genuinely went Oh come on!. If the movie was not really excellent for 55 minutes i would have been pissed but it's very good. Very tropey last shot.The acting was excellent for some parts i forgot i was watching a movie it seemed super real the interactions between the characters. None of the girls did a bad job.

For starters, the runtime - 56 minutes - should be practiced in the future. It's enough time to satisfy your quench for film, yet short enough where it does not overstay its welcome. Had a studio forced the filmmakers to pile another forty minutes or so on, it would have felt dragged out.Host was the film I didn't know I needed. I haven't been able to go to the theatres (horror or other) in the past five months. It takes such a normal thing that we all use these days, Zoom, or skype, or any other communication tool, and makes it scary. No, not scary...terrifying. It does it well, and like any good story, they make every minute count. All the way through to the end credits - which I may like to add that I particularly enjoy creativity done with any kind of credits, and how they formatted the end credits was brilliant and very fitting.The effects were perfect, the startling scare scenes were perfect, the buildup was what makes it so damn addictive, and the acting felt nonexistent, meaning, it all felt real. Nothing was forced. This is not only a film worth watching if you're still stuck at home, it's a film that'll plague your mind with all the dread and terror that I was filled with.Still am, actually.A final word of advice, watch this alone.

I watched it alone at night and I'm a pretty hardened horror fan, I don't scare easily, but always find the lower budget and ghost type things with less gore and more left to the imagination, are more likely to give me the scares I seldom get these days. Now this little beauty definitely scared me, yes it's mostly good old fashioned jump scares, but do you know what, that's ok with me, they were well placed, no over hyped music, no great special effects and I honestly squealed on a couple of occasions! This is a low budget, shot on webcam/video messenger gem! It's short, sweet and I honestly think it was pretty damn scary! Cheers shudder it's been a long time since I felt like sleeping with the light on lol well done to the actors, crew and writers you did a damn good job of making a fun, scary little number using COVID quarantine as the back drop, if I had seen this at the cinema I think I would have peed my pants a little in a couple of occasions!

This is, for me, the most effective found-footage/screen-based horror movie since Unfriended. There isn't much in terms of character development or backstory but the narrative sets the ball rolling real quick - six friends get together on a Zoom call during the pandemic and invite a seventh guest to preside over a virtual seance. It's obvious that things don't pan out the way they expect.When you make a found footage movie based entirely on a video-conferencing app (Zoom, in this case) during a global pandemic, it hits you differently. Given a good part of the world has been completely indoors in the last few months and associate it with comfort and safety, breaking those walls down to bring effective scares really works like a charm. That you'll view the movie on the same laptop you use for a gazillion Zoom calls adds to the unnerving experience.The cast, while not A-listers, come up with solid efforts. The fear is palpable and their expressions compellingly convey the dread with each passing minute. The premise is quite basic but enhanced greatly by the application of neat visual effects. What's a downer here is that we've already seen most of these shaky camera scares in similar films and know what's coming every time a character investigates a thud or sees something murky. In that sense, Host is a not-bad but derivative effort.Host also comes with its share of unexpected humor in the form of grocery deliveries, sneezes, and pee-breaks. You'll also come across COVID-season-specifics such as wearing a mask while stepping out and characters giving each other an elbow bump. It also integrates the technicalities of Zoom such as creepy filters and call-end countdowns, However, if you ask what's the best thing about Host, I'd say the 56-minute runtime. Director Rob Savage delivers a succinct film that doesn't allow the tension to drop once it escalates. On that front, Host is worth checking out, especially if the found-footage genre interests you!"}, {"id": 246, "text": "9/10Six friends hire a medium to hold a seance via Zoom. One of the friends unintentionally sends an open invitation to the astral plane and something evil accepts her invitation.Very short run time. The story actually starts 10min into the film and those first 10min can be fast forwarded. The story is simple. The acting is very good but what stands out is the scariness of the film. There were multiple times I had to cover my eyes partially with an anticipation of a jump scare. The only negative is that one character handled the camera poorly that could have been easily avoided.If you don't mind shaky camera work or jump scares this will be a wonderful experience.

Although It is highly inventive, without a doubt, Host is one of the most uniquely ambitious horror movies to come along this year, It is just one unsurprising death after another. The entire picture takes place on one of the protagonist's laptop - is the only original thing going on.

However, I'm awarding an 'originality bonus point', one up from the seven I was going to give it.Why?Nothing to do with the actual movie itself. Though as found footage style horror movies go, this is near the top of any of the ones I've seen lately. If you're a real horror fan, you know scary things that go bump in the night style (not the torture porn variety of horror) you're probably gonna enjoy this.So why the bonus point. Because of the extra creativity in writing a movie that: For one uses our current corona virus situation and writes it into the plot without having it dominate the story. It's just a matter of fact life situation we all have to live with. Who here hasn't had a zoom meeting (or drinking session) with friends during the covid lockdown? And secondly, since movie and TV production across the globe is pretty much on hold due to the corona virus, the people that made this movie had to get really creative. How can you possibly get your entire cast of characters together on screen at the same time when you legally can't even get them together in the same room? Easy, if you've got a great idea. I think these people had a great idea and worked it perfectly considering the work constraints placed upon them with the mandatory social distancing and quarantine rules.So long story short a really good little indie horror flick made just a little bit better... thanks to the corona virus."}, {"id": 249, "text": "'Host' is remarkably short.

I would've liked to see 30 more minutes worth of this film (because it was incredibly good), but maybe the reason it was so good was that it didn't outstay its welcome. I'm a little torn on this issue. Would I like to see more films adopt a similar runtime in the future? Possibly. I wouldn't want to pay to go the theatres for a film this short, but if they're coming to streaming services I'd be okay with it.It's a well known fact that what you can imagine is far scarier than what you can see. This is why a film like 'Host' works so well. Similar to the brilliant 'Paranormal Activity' films, 'Host' presents a clear and present danger, but doesn't inform us of exactly what it is. That is such a creepy concept and works so well in movie form.The film uses some good innovation to create unique and unforeseen scares. It took me off guard on multiple occasions. And even late in the film when I categorically knew a scare was coming, and even how they were going to do it, it still gave me a hell of a fright.

One can say that the Unfriended (2014) or even Grave Encounters (2011-2012) and the Gallows series is an influence. But there are genres and particular pioneering films that initially fused the internet, found footage, social media with the supernatural.But within the millennial cinema of the supernatural and the internet: one needs to give credit to the Blair Witch Project (1999-2000). Yes, it's considered found footage genre and a mockumentary but it used the internet to gather its story (doubling as premarket tool for the film releasing) unlike Paranormal Activity (2007) initiated on the premise of found-footage then with REC's (2007) live-footage horror.The possible inspirational roots for Host could be most likely Joe Swanberg's segment in V/H/S (2012) using then video chat room with the supernatural, many refer this segment to mumblecore genre (although it's a rejected term) and the webisode series, The 15 Experience (think of the infamous make-up tutorial segment). The length of Host (56 mins) works fine, since it's supposed to be a Zoom session, that usually cut offs may within an hour.Many late Millennial/Gen Z viewers probably unknown to the aforementioned genres, may view this feature as pioneering and fresh. Even though this just a revisit (but in the process), it intersects past genres.
