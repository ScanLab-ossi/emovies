The people that rated this low apparently need more movies like this in their lives. It was beautiful, clean and added a bit of magic &amp; belief which is what we all need this Christmas. Wonderfully over the top - I highly recommend watching!!"}, {"id": 1, "text": "What a magical movie!!! The colors!! The costumes!!! The singing!!! The sets!!!! The magic!!! It's a cross between The Wiz and Greatest Showman. I enjoyed every minute and will surely watch Jingle Jangle every Christmas holiday going forward right alongside Polar Express and Elf.Jingle Jangle is such a pure, heartfelt movie. You will enjoy it."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I am a sucker for a good Christmas film, and a good underdog story. This one hit all the right notes. Yes, there are tooth-achingly cheesy moments-what would a good Christmas film be without those? But more importantly, when this movie hits your heartstrings, it really hits HOME. I was sobbing in the best, happy-cry way at multiple points, and when everything ties up with a bow at the end, it feels so truly well-earned. This captures the real meaning of Christmas-it's definitely going on the once-a-year Christmas film rotation."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Far beyond the usual Netflix Hallmark-style Christmas films, this one is high budget and very well produced. The musical numbers are fantastic and the costume design is marvellous. It's a tad cheesy and more than a little absurd, but the plot is solid and it's very charming."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Some people just have to spew hate but don't believe them. This is a WONDERFUL ADDITION to my list of 'watch every year' holiday movies with LOVELY ORIGINAL MUSIC and fun dancing. The cast's musical talent is off the charts and I love that it shows little girls as brilliant, and mathematical. I am so happy for my two young grand-daughters to have Journey to identify with."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Such a magical uplifting Christmas movie. Music elements make it even better. Just what is needed at this special time of year. Great cast, great acting, lovely story, great music, brilliant dancing and that extra touch of magic."}, {"id": 6, "text": "What a great Christmas musical comedy!! Filled with great performances, songs, characters, cinematography and direction. Definitely worth a look!!Tim Treakle"}, {"id": 7, "text": "I went in blind with this movie. I didn't watch the trailer. And I was pleasantly surprised. I love musicals hence my name. I adored some of the songs in the movie. The STORYLINE is EASY to follow if you pay attention. The people giving it negative reviews must be ADHD or just plain miserable and unimaginative. How can you say Felicia Rashad is crappy actor? What about Forrest Whittaker? Come on now. They are film veterans, y'all need to go back to bed and get back in on the right side.The story essentially is about family and believing in yourself when all hope is lost. The impossible is POSSIBLE if you have faith in your ability. And don't forget to ask for help when you need it the most! How hard is that to follow? Don't listen to the negative people!Watch it for yourself. Absolutely fantastical and purely for people with hearts!"}, {"id": 8, "text": "Absolutely wonderful Christmas movie. The costumes and sets are just stunning, brilliant actors and singing, the songs and choreography catchy and entertaining without being cheesy. Lovely cosy colourful movie to watch at any age."}, {"id": 9, "text": "It looks pretty and feels magical, but thats about it. The movie seems to want to check to many boxes at once and ends up forgetting to do the most important thing: be a good story. The story is rushed and not unique, the personalities feel completely fabricated and dialogs unrealistic. This movie is probably fun for very young children, but thats about it"}, {"id": 10, "text": "Great story line. Great actors. Beautiful staging with eye popping colors. Amazing singing and wonderful songs. Broadway on TV! I loved it. Not quite a Christmas movie, but What a great way to start the holiday season."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I love this movie!! So much Christmas magic and a beautiful story!! Yes i cried too"}, {"id": 12, "text": "Every moment of this movie was incredibly enjoyable to watch. From the set to the costumes and the wonderful actors. I had a smile on my face the entire time."}, {"id": 13, "text": "I just adored this movie from start to finish. I'm a huge fan of stage musicals and this definitely gave me a stage-musical feel all the way. The story's very heart-warming and I the message in it is even better - nothing's impossible when you believe it can be done. We lose so much of this feeling when we grow up that we most often lose our way and this clearly demonstrated this belief. Back to the film though - the sets were absolutely breath-taking, the music was fantastic and uplifting, the singing was truly awesome and the dancing was exceptional - the cast was fabulous too - it was a breath of fresh air to see such a fabulously diverse cast.Overall, this is one movie that will remain a favourite of mine for years and years to come &lt;3"}, {"id": 14, "text": "Looks amazing, sounds fantastic; and the costumes are nothing short of glorious. But this film needs to head back to the cutting room and loose about 30 minutes.with John Legend as producer, it's no surprise that the voices are impressive. The musical numbers and choreography top notch.The combination of digital animation and live action is seamless.But this film feels heavy and by the end of it, we were carrying kids to bed."}, {"id": 15, "text": "The diversity and talent of the cast and dancers, in combination with stunning production design, original animated transitions and world-building make Jingle Jangle the Christmas musical-fantasy classic unlike any other. Wow, David E. Talbert, wow."}, {"id": 16, "text": "This is a jumble of movies you've already seen. It's Wonder Imporium meets short circuit meets Christmas carol meets polar express. It has beautiful sets and a good cast but it's just a thrown together fruitcake of played out themes."}, {"id": 17, "text": "This was incredible! The story was so good, whether you're a kid or adult. Ignore what others say about trying too hard."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Children and most adults will probably love this film. It's got everything but in my opinion a little too much of everything. If you enjoy the greatest showman then you will recognize the similar music and choreography right off the bat. For me this movie is way too sugary, over the top and cliche without any real sincerity."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I'm not a fan of musicals, but I can give 10 stars if done right, like Frozen. On the plus side, this one does have the best sets I've seen in a long time and Forest Whitaker does a great job with his character. But the dialog and story are very weak and the songs are not inspiring at all. If I had it to do over again I'd skip this movie."}, {"id": 20, "text": "This movie is a magical ride and a very inspirational one if you have creative children. Loved every minute. Honestly don't know how anyone can write a bad review of it."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Recently, I took a Friday afternoon with my family to watch a Christmas movie. We were scrolling through our Netflix account when a spectacular cover with vivid colors, costumes, and steampunk aesthetics popped up in the recommended tab. Ever curious, my family decided on the title, Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey, for our evening's homemade theatre. I should note, holiday movies are one of my favorite traditions each year, so I was ecstatic about a brand-new release with a different take on the Christmas story. Released November 13, 2020, director and writer David Talbert took my family on a trip to the magical world of the fictional Jangle family. Complete with steampunk holiday magic, the story follows the famous inventions of the Jangle family toy store. Conflict arises when the antagonist steals plans for a future prosperous invention, leading to the downfall of the Jangle's fortune and toy store. Now, the fate of the Jangle's shop lies in the hands of Jeronicus Jangle's clever granddaughter, Journey. I would recommend the marvelous and sensational take on a Christmas movie because of the engaging set, magnificent musical numbers, and well turned out characters. I was a little nervous before starting the movie as the run time caught my eyes. The entirety of Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey lasted over two hours! However, only half an hour through the film, I became hooked on the artistic settings, environment, and stop-motion and CGI animations. I felt I could feel the effort poured into the glamourous buildings and detailed costumes, all through my TV screen. Despite the steampunk mood, the state of a Christmas town was evident. The high-quality camera captured each intricate brick, beam, and snowball in each scene. Overall, Rob Cameron's colorful set design earned my respect and attention during the lengthy Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey. The set was not the only aspect of the film to keep my concentration focused on the movie during the fantastical storyline. Music is provided by John Debney, who also contributed to numerous famous works such as Elf, The Jungle Book, and The Greatest Showman. Debney moves the tale along with tuneful numbers. One verse in, and I could tell the upcoming songs would be phenomenal. We found ourselves smiling and occasionally dancing along with the characters to upbeat music. To summarize, the music featured in the Netflix original added an enchanting element to the overall film. Further, the cast and characters in Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey amazed me. I recognized the name Forest Whitaker, who played the inventor Jeronicus Jangle, and Lisa Davina Phillip, who captivated me with her hilarious scenes and songs. Halfway into the movie, I did become worried the story would become monotonous and crowded as more and more characters continued to be introduced. Nevertheless, the ending nicely wraps up the storyline. The actors took the plot to another level through singing and character development. Since Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is geared towards children, I found the movie to be predictable. However, I was not let down by the loveable characters, especially one adorable CGI robot, Buddy. In summary, I would suggest the Christmas themed musical, Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey, because of the intricate set, delightful soundtrack, and diverse characters. I would describe the film as wholesome and festive. A holiday must-see, the Netflix original left my family with wonder and joy."}, {"id": 22, "text": "This is a true authentic Christmas family movie!! I was captivated by the amazing cast. It was magically and now it will be a classic for my family!"}, {"id": 23, "text": "Feels like netflix wanted a bunch of things in this movie, but this resulted in little time for each keyword. There was no time appreciating any relationship and decisions. When the characters lack motivation and logic as well the movie becomes lackluster."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I enjoyed this musical so much! I didn't know it was a musical but when they started to sing, the voices were so good ! Such a cute story reminding me of Neverending Story or The Princess Bride. The sets and costuming were top rate and of course Forrest Whitaker and P. Rashad! I love her sweet smile! Forrest is SUCH a great actor! Thanks everyone!"}, {"id": 25, "text": "This is a wonderful movie that everyone should watch! My two-year-old even loved it. It has great music, singing, dancing and acting. I could say more but just view it for yourself."}, {"id": 26, "text": "The costumes, hair, sets all AMAZING! I liked the story and premise too. The child actors are great, Journey and Edison. The songs however....torturous to sit through. I actually had to fast forward through many of them. They are not catchy nor inspiring. They actually take away from the movie. They should have cut 50% or more of them and shortened the movie to 90 minutes. The movie is over 2hrs long. I found myself pausing it several times and going and doing other things it was so hard to sit through."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Beautiful movie, great actors, my little girls recommend it..."}, {"id": 28, "text": "It's not horrible but definitely passable. The story line is just so predictable and familiar like bits of other movies were pieces together for this one. Definitely not Forrest Whitaker's best performance but some actors were fairly good. Also some weird parts that didn't quite fit or provide much to the story."}, {"id": 29, "text": "The robot 'Buddy' was treated with E.T level importance, the kids just MUST risk their lives to retrieve it, which would be fine were it not for the fact the kids spent only one (very) short scene engaging with it. There was never a connection formed for the kids (or the audience) to really care whether the robot would be saved, or would be repaired. By the same token the inventor and his love interest shared only one musical number together in the beginning, and then were apart for the rest of the film, and so once again it was very hard to care if they would end up back together.Only upside to the film is the musical numbers (great dancing, great visuals). Skip the rest of the film (it drags), and just watch those segments on youtube or something."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Finally a colorful Holiday story that was so enjoyable and filled with the joy and magic of the holidays!!!

Bad acting, must have used most of the budget on Forrest Whittaker. The songs were out of context for the moment, completely forced with lyrics that were nonsense. The plot is ok, but some if it just doesnt make sense. Its about an hour too long, its padded out terrible songs and scenes which are completely pointless offering nothing to the story."}, {"id": 35, "text": "One of the worst if not the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen. The disappointment is proportional to the size of the production, what a huge waste of resources. Photography and costumes are the only things I save. The story is terrible.

The singing and dancing Shakespearean Choic are just too over the top. Could have been good without all the unneeded theatrics."}, {"id": 39, "text": "Listen, I love cheesy Christmas movies as much as the next person, and seeing a primarily black cast in a stand-alone original movie was amazing! The characters themselves were hilarious and I believed in almost every actor on screen. The crew was literally amazing, and the movie isn't a horribly terrible movie at all...That being said, I couldn't finish it. Maybe it's the overtones of very obvious, repetitive (and honestly not all that great) singing, or the weird dealings with family dynamics... but that kind of ruined the vibe for me? I was watching and all the time I would enjoy the characters, yet cringe at every new stupid little annoying thing they HAD to add for ingenuity...Sometimes a Christmas movie doesn't have to be THAT complicated, you know."}, {"id": 40, "text": "This movie is not just for kids!

For a Christmas film, it didn't feel very festive despite the snow on the ground. Just when you started to get a bit of plot then they'd start with yet another song. Feels like a pick and mix of popular films that just don't gel. So disappointing. Oh Forrest what we're you thinking?"}, {"id": 45, "text": "Deus ex machina anyone?The opening scene has promise, but then quickly falls. The songs are good along with the dance, but the script, the story, is terrible.What I have a problem with is how he creates a living, talking toy, then completely ignores it, along with his wife and child. It's as if they have to ignore it and then leave it along with the apprentice so that the story can have a dramatic plan of evil.It's too obvious and forced.Then he suddenly returns, as if Hey we are going to celebrate with you and you are part of the team but he's been ignoring him for how long?

Not really an original idea as it has a load of influences. You can clearly see the main influence is the Greatest showman. Easy watch that require you to put little effort into watching to understand what's going on. Some kids will enjoy it but I think they'll get bored quite fast.Songs. loads and loads of songs A bit too much. Nearly every scene has one. Over acting over singing over everything.Critics will love it due to its diverse cast but I don't rate films that kind of way.I like forest Whitaker and Keegan-Michael Key performances. 4 stars."}, {"id": 51, "text": "I wanted to like this movie. So much of it it says you should like it: The Greatest Showman like soundtrack, the Tinkerbell like magic of belief, the inclusion of STEM in the magic, the Polar Express like roller coaster-esque ride, the robot that comes to life an unites everyone, etcAnd for me all of those ended up being the reasons I DIDN'T like this movie. So much of it felt like the writers were picking and choosing bits from other movies that made it big and adding it to this, only it never really meshed together in a cohesive way.SPOILERS ahead.......Forest Whittaker's character is a wonderful inventor who begins to lose his mojo when his apprentice steals the Mexican Matador doll that he brought to life. (And the doll somehow convinced him to do it....and let's not even worry about the magical elixer that he ordered that somehow brought the doll to life but he never managed to reorder or use again.....) And then his wife inexplicably dies and he gives up on everything-including his daughter. Really felt like a forced attempt to pull on our heartstrings.The grand daughter shows up because she can see math equations just like grandpa could and she wants to meet him despite her mom being estranged from him for years. While there she discovers a robot her mother built but never got to work that magically comes to life because she believed it could....and then for no known reason it makes her fly as well, until grandpa comes around and his disbelief makes it stop.The former apprentice steals it because he can't invent anything that works on his own. Grand-daughter attempts a rescue, grandpa comes and can only save her if he believes in himself again and then works out a magical equation that saves the day.This movie just tries to hard. There is also a love interest story line for both grandpa and granddaughter, the bad apprentice gets his in the end but grandpa melts his heart through a gift so even he gets a semblance of a happy ending. Oh, and it is all set around Christmas time so you get all those feel good emotions too. I wanted to like this movie. I love musicals, Christmas movies, and happy endings. But there was just too much going on in an attempt to make this BIG that I never really connected to anything."}, {"id": 52, "text": "It's a musical but doesn't know about it.child actors disaster. target; broadway result; disney channel. I would like to write at length, but you get tired just reading. Netflix Christmas/Noel/New Year productions are getting worse every year."}, {"id": 53, "text": "This film never really seems to know what it wants to be, and in trying to hit so many genres, fails badly at all of them. So we get huge musical numbers (which the songs aren't strong enough to carry), a family separation story, a financial crisis, an evil villain, the need to believe, schmaltzy cute kids (who are just plain annoying), weak comic turns....oh and for good measure, throw a Wall-E / Short Circuit-esque robot in there as a McGuffin with all the charm and personality of a vacuum cleaner.Plot points go unexplained, characters under written, and the acting is so hammy. Best thing about the whole film is the use of Crossness Pumping Station for the interiors of the factory."}, {"id": 54, "text": "A lot of fake 10/10 reviews on this movie.

Really? Compared to what?I would only recommend this if you have kids from 5-10. Don't watch it at night, they'll fall asleep (as I did the first time).This is the type of musical were songs interrupt and pause the plot, without adding any value.I can only say: see it yourself and you'll remember my comment."}, {"id": 58, "text": "The story was fantastic, it had everything within it to be great: good storyline, stellar cast, Broadway vibe.

WHO IS SHE AND WHERE DID SHE COME FROM? We'd like to see more of her.The music is electrifying and makes you mumble the lyrics even if you don't know the music pieces.

Wow what an absolutely amazing and delightful holiday movie Jingle Jangle Christmas was, there are so many good things to say about this so lets get started.First of all the cinematography was fantastic, the movie had a charming tone, great soundtrack and a unique narrative/ point of view. This movie looked absolutely fantastic, the movies visual creativity and world building was truly fantastic, it just felt like Christmas in one amazing visual explosion of colour amazing set locations and creativity for the story world. The movie also had a very charming tone, every single component of the movie was charming and made you feel all warm inside just like a good Christmas movie should do, this charm never went away and in fact just got better and better as the movie went along. The soundtrack was also fantastic, there was some very catchy and easy to listen to songs that just put a huge smile on my face, and the vocal talent involved was excellent. I Also loved the films unique narrative and viewpoint, telling the story from the perspective of 2 kids and their grandma was really interesting and tied together with the films themes, it also made the film feel like one massive story book which I absolutely loved as well, also adding to the movies visual creativity.I also loved the movies representation, likeable characters, performances and chemistry between characters. This movies racial representation was absolutely excellent, I loved that the majority of the cast was ethnically diverse, it made a refreshing change for a holiday movie and worked excellently. The movie also had incredibly likeable and loveable characters that were very easy to connect with, The granddaughter played by Madalen Mills had heaps of charm and the way she changed Jeronicuses (Forest Whitaker) life and bought the light and happiness back for him was just excellent. The chemistry between them both was also excellent, all the relationships within the movie felt very real and authentic and handled with great emotion and sensitivity. The performances themselves were also very good, and believable adding to the emotion of the movie which I will talk about soon.My only slight negative for the movie would be that it was slightly generic in places. The movie had slightly generic dialogue and characters that has been seen in previous holiday movies especially with the villain being someone supposedly cast aside and getting popularity for themselves.My next few positives would be the character background, set up with the villain and interesting toy creations. I loved the attention to detail and character background for Jeronicus, seeing him happy when he was younger and establishing and developing his relationship between his daughter was excellently done, it didn't feel rushed and established the desired tone and themes and established the characters well,. I also did like the set up with the villain, him being set aside from Jeronicus and his ideas and creations set the villains intentions out well and this transitioned well into the main plot of the movie with an excellent and campy performance from Keegan Michael Key who did a fantastic job. The toy creations were also really creative and were visually striking.My final few positives would be the deep themes, emotional weight and heart-warming ending. The movie actually had a lot of deep themes that was handled very well, how the movie tackled the process of grief and how that effects the relationships within family was very emotional and made the film have a surprising amount of depth, this added to the emotional weight of the movie a lot, the movie which was helped by its performances was genuinely emotional, in its handling of the relationship between Jeronicus and his daughter and will get to a lot of people. The ending was also extremely heart-warming, the movie had very satisfying endings for all of the character arcs and ended the movie perfectly.Overall, Jingle Jangle Christmas is a fantastic holiday movie, with fantastic performances, a great soundtrack, with heaps of charm and is a Christmas classic that I will be revisiting."}, {"id": 74, "text": "The Movie is a real disaster.

The point of the story is a broken family finding their way back to each other.The secondary characters in this film were great as well, I loved (Lisa Davina Phillip) who plays Ms. Johnston, she was hilarious. Keegan-Michael Kay as Gustafson was fantastic as well. He does great in multiple roles he plays. The outstanding role in this film is the young actress who plays Journey (Madalen Mills). She brought the whole film together.Besides the cast I have to give it up to the costume designers, I loved the outfits in this film it definitely had a more steampunk feel to it and I thought everyone looked great.

The most obvious was the Buddy 3000's resemblance to E.T., while forgetting about Wall-E, which other reviewers have reminded me of. What really dazzled me were the outstanding sets, so vibrant and colorful. In that respect, I was also reminded of the 2011 film Hugo. with all those gears and wheels working harmoniously together, much like that whirlygig toy in this movie that required a gyroscopic stabilizer. The shining light of this film was the young granddaughter Journey (Madalen Mills), just a sweet kid with a loving disposition. At first I thought to myself, 'who names a kid Journey', but then figured why not, it's symbolic of a youngster's journey from being a child to adulthood, so why not. For some reason, I felt disappointed that Forest Whitaker's Jeronicus character wasn't as outgoing and friendly to Journey at the outset, I felt he should have been thrilled to see her even though he was despondent over his failing toy shop and career. The whole deal with his assistant Gustafson (Keegan-Michael Key) was a downer, and threatened to turn the story into a maudlin affair. But you knew it couldn't last because after all, this is a Christmas movie and you can't let the kids down with an uninspiring message.

That was a lie, every time they change a scene there's people dancing around and singing with very little dialogue at all. Not my cup of tea. If you're a musical theater buff or someone who enjoys meaningless repetition, I'm sure you'll love it. 45 mins in and I had not a single interest in any of the characters.

It is a Christmas movie, naturally a little cheesy, and what Christmas movie isn't? The music and choreography were great. The casting, while not flawless, was incredibly enjoyable. The storybook animation was stunning to look at. It would be unfair to assume that this movie was made to win best drama at the oscars. It's made to be an uplifting Christmas movie with amazing representation not seen in most blockbuster Christmas movies. Before tearing it down, maybe watch it an open mind and take it for what it is.

The design of the town, England 1880's - 1900's maybe? Are good. Look like York and Lincoln. The music and songs are not represented of the time setting. The snow ball scene was so cringeworthy. With an Afro Caribbean rap but all the characters are all British. So not sure what heritage is being represented here. Not to mention the stereotype Spanish matador doll.

I am sort of neutral when it comes to live action musicals but the musical performances in this movie were fantastic and the music was beautiful. The background was a perfect fit.

However i couldn't stop seeing Magorium's magic store, Wall-E's voice and shape, and the trip to Neverland with PeterPan and Wendy. Mashing all those themes up in the movie removed the dazzle that we were supposed to have on Journey's inherited creativity and wit. Several short and loose ends that needed more focus. All in all its a great movie to watch...in the holiday season.."}, {"id": 189, "text": "First of all let me say that this movie was our family Friday Night Movie and my kids definitely enjoyed this movie. I found it entertaining and sufficiently immersive enough to enjoy my brief time in the world it created.My biggest complaint about the movie was the vast volume difference between the dialogue and the songs: when I had the volume turned up loud enough to hear the dialogue, the songs were way too loud and I was constantly switching volumes.

The costumes and hair design are so beautiful.

Anyways, I have watched a many dubbed over films and tv shows, but the lip syncing was so off it was painful to watch the musical numbers. Not that I am bothered by musical numbers, just by the quality I'd expect in a french film dubbed over in english that are in fact english films in english, where the lip sync should be spot on?.... On another note, I'm not sure if it was the movie or bogus volume setting on my tv, but the movie track was super loud, while the voices were hardly audible at times.

The musical numbers are reminiscent of the greatest showman with their energy, incredible vocals and modern twist. Unfortunately, someone forgot about the actual character development, specifically their actions and motivations. For example; we're to believe that after being given a job, a place to live, trust and education, that Gustafson would find it so easy to turn into a thief, after being ignored a couple times, when Gustafson could obviously see that Jangles was occupied. I also found Jangles annoying, he's always ignoring people. When confronted by a granddaughter he's never met, Jangles speaks to her in such away that any other person, would have gotten straight back on the bus back home without giving him another thought. Later again he ignores and dismisses her until she reveals her intelligence. I personally don't think a prerequisite of loving someone should be based on how smart they are. I think the movie could have been served better removing the book reading beginning so more time could've been given for character development, or a back story for Gustafson which would explain his decision to steal. I'm sure the young kids its aimed at will enjoy."}, {"id": 200, "text": "This magical diverse Xmas movie takes you on an adventure sprinkling affirmations of Joy, Determination and Belief throughout this wonderful Children's fantasy with exceptional musical indulgence!"}, {"id": 201, "text": "The feelings we used to have from Christmas films-love, laughter and warmth-are all wrapped in this masterful movie.

The gal who is hitting on the father didn't seem to be a necessary part of the story and honestly, the scene of her hitting on the father/toy creator was completely unnecessary and made my daughter uncomfortable as it was an unwanted advance to a guy who was completely unaware how she felt about him.It didn't need as many songs, as we agreed there was one song we were interested in listening to again.The setting was adorable with cute Christmas vibes!"}, {"id": 220, "text": "In this Netflix original, we have a Willy Wonka type toymaker who creates a sentient doll - Blue Fairies need not apply - that turns out to be evil and teams up with a disgruntled employee to ruin the inventors life. Now, this is a fantasy style storybook adventure so logic should not be applied - in this movie toys are powered by belief and scientific applications include such formulas as The circumference of sensational - but even so the film's over treacly nature can be a little trying at times.It should also be noted that this is a musical but for some strange reason they cast Forest Whitaker and Keegan-Michael Key in leading roles and neither of them can really sing, and this is not helped by surrounding them with a cast of very talented singers who just makes their inability even more apparent."}, {"id": 221, "text": "Cast was great, music seemed very a similar to other Disney movies.

Saying this, the music was really good and enjoyable non the less.Sets and costumes were really good. Sadly there are not many locations, but they do make the best out of it. The dancing choreography was better than expected. CGI was a lot better and more believable than most big block busters, so that is a huge plus.I really wish the entire movie was with animated puppets, because they looked really awesome. The actors were not bad, quite the opposite actually.It was a shame they used an older actor for the main character, instead of using the same just with some facial changes to make him appear older.Humor, while not really amusing, was not bad that it got distracting.I do not know if children will enjoy it, since there is a lot of talking.

Better than Grinch (which was a 9 from me) for reference. There was a really dumb scene where they completed a robot, and then for some reason they could all fly?

Rather than focusing on Christmas it focuses on the creative nature. It takes us through a journey of generational trauma, believing in yourself, and the magic of the imagination.This movie is a mix of Willy Wonka, Christmas Carol, Peter Pan, and Polar Express.

Pulling themes and familiar tropes from classics such as Edward Scissorhands, The Wizard of Oz, A Christmas Carol and The Grinch. From the music to the costumes, characters and scenary Jingle Jangle is something sensational, something spectacular, something revolutionary.We are invited to listen to the tale of the world's best inventor, Jeronicus Jangle's (Forest Whitaker) fall from grace due to the thieving acts of his apprentice Gustafson (Keegan-Michael Kay). Losing everything, we see a beaten and broken Jeronicus, in a shabby, bleak, Scrooge-esque state, fighting for survival and in need of a Christmas miracle, to help save his shop and his home. Will his family, friends and colleagues provide him with the support he needs to regain his identity, imagination and creativity?From the very beginning Jingle Jangle is a wonder to the eyes and ears. Jeronicuses environment looking like a mix between Diagon Alley and the city center of Whoville; you are sucked into the world effortlessly. With its streets populated with individuals wearing clothing resembling the familiar bright wrapping paper patterns we use every year. With a contrasting emerald colour scheme, for Gustafson and his henchmen; echoing that of another fraudulent inventor ... or wizard, that we tend to see this time of year. Matching the dazzling garments, we are treated to slightly cheesy, but totally expected, impromptu song and dance numbers throughout. Something that even Jeronicus questions during his love interest Ms Johnston's (Lisa Davina Phillip) solo number. Are you drunk? Background dancers?. A stand out performance by Journey (Madalen Mills), Jeronicuses Granddaughter is one to look out for.With the introduction of Journey and her meeting Edison, Jeronicuses assistant, we are filled with hope as we find they have what Jeronicus has lost. Creativity, wonder and belief in themselves to follow their dreams.Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is a heart-warming, colourful, thoughtful, underdog adventure for all ages. High budget production, slick performances and choreography, and a memorable tune here or there. Jingle Jangle reminds us of what it is to have a childlike curiousity when approaching all that we do and to never give up.

If you love musicals, you'll love this. If you don't, step away. It feels like a colorful Broadway stage play but it's even better because of the magic of technology and filmmaking. The movie was written and directed by David E. Talbert featuring a mostly African-American cast. It's not the typical Christmas show, but it will definitely get you in the mood for magic and wonder. Thank you to Netflix for saving 2020 with all of the awesome content this year and for inviting me to screen this movie early!TIPS FOR PARENTS: This is entirely family-friendly entertainment. Yay! Little girls, especially, are going to love this. When your kids have a hard time with math, just remind them about the square root of possible.THEMES: We wait for no tomorrows! - Don Juan Diego (Ricky Martin) The square root of impossible is the possible in me! - Journey ( Madalen Mills) Obstacles Possibilities Be who you're meant to be If you believe, it's all possible. - Grandmother (Phylicia Rashad)THINGS I LIKED: The musical score by John Debney is spirited with fun variety. I don't know if little girls around the world will stop singing songs from Frozen 2 but these songs are really sweet. Every singer in the cast blew my socks off. The songs perfectly fit the scenes and feel like they belong to the story. The lively singing and energetic dancing are delightful. It reminded me of the joyful movie The Greatest Showman , which is quite a compliment because I absolutely love that movie. The talented cast includes charismatic performances by Forest Whitaker, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Bonneville, Phylicia Rashad, Justin Cornwell, Anika Noni Rose, and even Ricky Martin! Madalen Mills is absolutely adorable and fantastic. Her voice is pure and she's definitely got some acting chops that will surely grant her a great future in films. Do I smell Disney in her future? Who else wants Phylicia Rashad to be their grandmother? Yes, please. I thought the toy matador was so fun and I wanted to see more of him. He's voiced by none other than Ricky Martin! I love how the live-action movie was intertwined with animation. There is a cute snowball fight scene that used local business owners and shops as Extras in Norwich, England where the scene was filmed. Charming set design and production. I didn't know Keegan-Michael Key or Forest Whitaker could sing! Wow! Nice! Forest Whitaker actually sings three times! John Legend recorded the song This song and stated, As a father, I jumped at the chance to be involved with a holiday film that's both inspirational and inclusive, a film with a great message where my kids can see themselves reflected on the screen. He wrote some of the other songs and produced the film as well. Some really great CGI. The costume design by Michael Wilkinson is extremely vibrant and detailed with fun touches. Keep watching during the closing credits for some more cute images that match the job titles of the crew.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: The lips don't always quite match the singing. All of the songs are good but they're not all memorable. Some cheesy, overacted, cliched moments. It's hard to tell where the story is supposed to take place...USA? Europe? England? The new toy toward the end of the movie looks an awful lot like Wall-E. There are a LOT of plots crammed into the story.FUNNY LINES: * You can throw roses at my feet later. - Don Juan Diego (Ricky Martin)Ok, back to me! - Don Juan Diego (Ricky Martin) Well, you hurry back as slowly as you can. - (Forest Whitaker)INTERESTING LINES: It's not stealing when you borrow indefinitely. - Don Juan Diego (Ricky Martin) What makes you think you can get it work? - Edison Latimer (Kieron Dyer) Because there's nothing that says I can't. - Journey (Madalen Mills) The magic isn't just in what you've lost. It's in what you still have. - Ms. Johnston (Lisa Davina Phillip) A child with an imagination always belongs. - Jeronicus (Forest Whitaker Never be afraid of what you can see. Only be afraid if you no longer see it. - Jeronicus (Forest Whitaker)You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel and website"}, {"id": 368, "text": "This likable Christmas movie combines feel-good cyberpunk tech, colorful riffs on 18th century dress, energetic dance numbers, and the gruff-man-redeemed-by-child trope into an energetic escapist concoction that hits all the right Christmas notes.The cast is a likable collection of talented actor/singers, most notably the radiant Madalen Mills as the little girl who eventually becomes the main protagonist.The dance numbers are wonderful; I particularly liked the antagonist's toy debut and the mail lady's frisky (and failed) seduction. The songs backing them are fine but most didn't strike as as memorable on first lesson, although I did find myself humming Madalen's big I'm going to do fabulous things number during the next scene.Jingle Jangle is fun but not by any means original. Instead it's a bit of a greatest hits collection of tropes from other films, including a cute toy that is pretty blatantly a Wall-E meets E.T. knock-off (to the point that when I saw it in posters I thought, wait, that's from something else).It also has an anti-gravity bit that makes no sense even within the world's rather fanciful physics. It's not explained and I just found that really annoying. It's like the movie couldn't decide whether the world was magic or not so it made most of it generally sci-fi-ish but then decided to toss in one thing that was just flat out sorcery. That really bugs me, especially in a movie that really emphasizes science and engineering.Jingle Jangle is also, like a lot of Christmas fiction, wonderfully calculated. Christmas Carol is a ghost story but also an attempt to change attitudes towards the poor and unchecked capitalism while Rudolph the Reindeer is an adventure that is also a plea for tolerance and acceptance of difference in oneself in others.In that tradition, Jingle Jangle is a clear attempt to reframe Christmas entertainment away from its overwhelming whiteness. The movie presents a charming pseudo English village where almost everyone is black and middle-class. It offers a little girl who is a hard-core math geek (can a movie like this change the balance of men to women in STEM? We'll find out in a couple of decades). It is a movie that wants to make the world better, which is an honorable goal.Perhaps that's why the film is so derivative; it doesn't want to rock the boat, it wants to repaint the boat with more colors.While the movie goes on a bit long and has some sluggish patches and janky elements, overall it's hugely likable. My girlfriend was in a terrible mood when she watched it and said it was one of those rare movies that could make her feel better.It's not perhaps the *best* Christmas film, but I do think it's effortlessly put itself into the Christmas Classics rotation. You should definitely check it out."}, {"id": 369, "text": "I had good hopes for this movie, as I tend to love musicals, and do believe that representation is very important, especially when the subject matter involves STEM topics like inventing.But after watching half of it last night, I really have no desire to watch the rest. I can't remember any melodies or lyrics that stuck in my head like they usually do after I watch a musical for the first time. The production values here were very high -- sets, costumes -- it's all so beautiful. But no amount of money can cover up a lackluster story in my mind.It started well enough, but after the first couple musical numbers, I was disappointed that they really didn't do much to further the plot or character development -- they seemed tacked on, like a string of barely connected music videos (complete with bad lip-synching).I can't help thinking about something I heard about one of the people who used to work on Disney musicals, and his philosophy was something along the lines of: when emotion becomes too much for acting, move to singing, and when it's too much for singing, move to dancing. Maybe that's why the music felt tacked on.Also, just thinking about opening musical numbers I've loved the most, it seems they should teach you something about the characters. In Beauty and the Beast, the initial song tells us a lot about Belle -- the things she likes, what people think of her, where she lives, and also the guy who's interested in her. In Fiddler on the Roof, the opening song is all about the traditions of the main characters -- where they live, what they do, what they value. When the big song opened up on Jingle Jangle, I thought there was so much potential -- we could have learned a lot about this Jeronicus Jangle character, we could have been given a tour of his workshop and learned about what kinds of things he's invented, and all the other things in his workshop. But there was none of that. It was just a bunch of people dancing around and singing about how excited they are about some vague wonderful thing that's supposed to happen. But I don't know any of these characters yet. I never felt like I connected with any of them, and so maybe that's why I don't care what happens in the movie.Note to moviemakers: you have to earn your audience's excitement. Don't just wave a bunch of expensive costumes and feel-good words in my face and expect it to mean something."}, {"id": 370, "text": "Great music. And wonderful voices.. Fun and well done dancing, if somewhat repetitive.Tons of fun seeing Keegan-Michael Key dancing and singing.Parts of the movie were contrived and made no sense. But, what Christmas movie doesn't have such parts.

Great movies don't necessarily mean you want to watch them over and over. But, I may change my mind.Great acting overall and great characters. Only exception is the Edison character. But, he got better.If the people criticize this movie, didn't do the same for Elf, The Santa Clause, or Christmas Vacation, they are being a smidge hypocritical.When it comes to a Christmas Magic, you have to suspend logic to an extent.Overall, it was a very good, if not great movie. Wardrobe and scenery was excellent. Singing out of this world, with the exception of Forrest Whittaker, who was still spot on for the part.I hate to say that nearly everyone being black bothered me at first, then I realized how white most such movies have been in the past.

The script was total nonsense. What happened to holiday movies everyone of all ages can enjoy. This movie has age suggestion 0-6 yrs old. Everyone else is going to cringe and struggle through the movie. The story made no sense. Jeronicus goes from depressed, defeated old hermit of a man who hates his granddaughter to getting in a snowball fight with random kids in the street and laughing literally just like that. Absolutely no character arch. Then you have a little girl who can do advanced calculus in her head at the age of like 8-WHAT??! And the calculations were literal nonsense which is just insulting to anyone above the age of 11 who actually knows anything math and science. They said things like 2 + 2= the cosmological factor of the galaxy's fantastical quotient to the power of hyperbole of the square root of unbelievable. I'm sorry to ruin your Christmas movie but this is not teaching kids anything and literally giving the exact opposite impression of how math and science works. Not the mention they suggest that the little girl was born with the skills to do math in her head which doesn't exactly teach kids to work hard in school because if you have to be born with the right genes. Or it teaches they have to do what their parents or grandparents did because the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Idk about you but I think a diamond in the rough is more inspiring than to teach your kids if your single parent mom is a waitress then that's prolly where you will end up too. Then Ms Johnson (the love interest) was like if Hello Dolly showed up to work all methed up. She clearly was on speed. She didn't seem to even know what her job was because she bumbled around like a chicken. Not to mention how she was demeaning to women for falling all over a guy who point blank told her he didn't like her and he treated her horribly and she still kept running back. What does this teach our young girls. It's that age old stupid notion that if the boy pulls your hair, it's because he likes you which is how girls become women in abusive relationships when they get older. The decisions made by the characters were literally for the sake to move the story along or expositions. It was one crazy stupid decision after another. It seemed forced and stupid to the point where you wasted a marvelous cast of incredible actors and stupendous costumes and vfx. The writers should all find new jobs. They should be ashamed of this."}, {"id": 372, "text": "If you're looking for super deep plot twists and layered story telling then no, you won't find it here. Jingle Jangle may try to cram as much festive cheer into the 2 hour run time as I do with pigs in blankets at Christmas dinner but that doesn't take anything away from the vibe of this film.Beautiful set design, costumes, cinematography, choreography accompanied by a high end soundtrack by some of the industries' highest award winning creatives gives us a real treat on the eyes and ears.I'm not into musicals at all but even I couldn't help but get swept up in this little gem of a Christmas musical, nodding my head and tapping my feet to the non-traditional songs we've become accustomed to with typically 'white Christmas' films.After all of the misery that 2020 has brought to so many, Jingle Jangle is the perfect remedy to put on and forget, even for 2 hours, everything else and feel all warm and fuzzy.Does it have flaws? Of course. Does it matter in a festive kids musical? No.Also, Forest Whitaker's performance should not go unnoticed as he proves he is still very much worthy of being the lead actor.

We are not haters, we just see past the glitz and force fed ideals. Think Cats movie - This is in the same wheelhouse for catastrophic failures.Netflix was stamped all over this. Netflix shows are just what the old made for TV movies were like. We need the BIG movie houses to get back into business! NOT the BIG TV companies like Netflix masquerading as one stop shop for all entertainment.I gave it a 2, instead of a 1 because the animation was okay."}, {"id": 374, "text": "In the filmmaker's want to create a universe, he neglected the plot (ie what happens in said universe). There's a lot going for the film: some amazing singing, toe-tapping lyrics, some good choreography, dazzling cinematography, set design, editing. You can tell they really tried to make something special and had no limits to get it. That, though is likely the problem. Limits make creatives cunning and conservative with their resources, it leads to re-writes &amp; redesigns &amp; trimming of the fat. Here, you can tell it has no limits and thus an inexperienced filmmaker is let loose, you can hardly blame him for not grounding the idea in originality or complexity. This is obviously a simple child's tale, there's no problem there. Nobody expected this to be The King and I or Sound of Music in subtext, but the characters too often stop everything to sing a full song, when that song has little to do with furthering their character or the plot. When it does, the plot inches forward in a very slow, predictable and tired way. There is more fun when the young cast is going on then when we flash forward. At least the young brooding toy maker has a Phantom of the Opera darkness that is fun and matches well against the bright Christmas backdrop. However, as soon as we go to the later times CGI characters, not unlike the plastic ones in the early days of cinema (90's Flubber or Small Soldiers comes to mind), take over the direction of the scene but aren't likable enough to care about nor dislikable enough to care about either. They are flat, the whole film falls flat, is hollow, too simple for a mega spectacle. It reminded me of the terrible La La Land, in which everybody in Hollywood thought was brilliant, but my family and I kept waiting for it get started, unable to engage with. I love that they have an all black cast, black filmmakers... totally about time to do so... but this film wasn't the right one to invest in creatively. The production was up to being the best Christmas movie of the season, but the story and delivery simply didn't deserve the attention.

If that's the first thing you noticed, you may need to reassess *why* you noticed that so much. Yes, the lead characters *happen* to look African by heritage (ethnic traits do tend to pass down from same-ethnicity parents!) but I detected no agenda beyond the rather tautological message that self-belief is the key to -erm- self-belief! Now for the actual review. Visually it's gorgeous, but so sweet I sometimes felt queasy. Here's my problem, it looked like an archetypal Christmas film, but did not feel like one. That story could have happened at any time of the year. It was a dull predictable story too - the plot actually had not one single 'I didn't see THAT coming' moment. That's probably still entertaining if your actual or emotional age is still in single figures, but, if you've been around a bit longer, you may come away jadedly disappointed at how little life-affirmation it gave you. It promised to be so much more from the trailer, but I just didn't really accept the characters as real. They were each introduced with formulaic clues as to their inner psyches... then those psyches were never explored. Given that it was over-long for a children's film, they could have found opportunities. Instead we were assaulted with 'uplifting' Disney-style power ballads, but few real emotional interactions. Even there, half the time they weren't even singing *with* or *to* anyone. The songs certainly showboated some powerful voices, but had lyrics that were inane and did not even properly rhyme. I had forgotten every one as soon as the film ended. Sadly the songs also highlighted that though Mr Witaker has many talents, in comparison to the other singers, singing is not his strongest. Without giving away the plot: I came away annoyed that character A clearly under-valued character B, which turned B bad, and then character A was never called to recognise they were actually responsible for creating their own antagonist. Including that one confrontation, admission and reconciliation in the story would have raised the dramatic effect and pathos enormously. My favourite bit, seriously, was recognising one of the location shoots as a place I know!

So, what do I think of the latest direct to stream film? Please read on to hear my thoughts as I review. Movie: Jingle Jangle: A Christmas JourneyDirector: David E. Talbert Writer: David E. Talbert Stars: Forest Whitaker, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Bonneville LIKES:The Cute/Charm of the movie The Costumes The Setting/Effects To make the Setting The Storytelling CGI at parts The Messages The MusicDISLIKESThe Rushed Opening The Lack of Christmas Energy The Lack of Suspense The Story is Weak AT a lot of parts Too In your Face/PreachySummary:I give Talbert and his crew props for crafting a tale that feels much like a children's novel meant to inspire and ignite the dreams of the young. Jingle Jangle is a movie with all the trimmings and charm that feels like it came out of Disney or Nick Jr. studios. Very little darkness, very little dismay, the diluted hard knock lives only act as a means to ignite the spark of hope that this movie carries with it. The inspiration of hope, creativity, and belief are strong messages in this film and you can be sure those who love their Hallmark and young adult films will get caught up in the aura this movie unleashes. In regards to the manner it tells this story, that is my favorite part at this stage of my life and where I think the movie does things quite well. Costumes bring you into the Christmas Story vibe as a much more ethnically mixed cast shows off the designs and brings you into world Talbert wants to build. Settings using stage pieces and CGI take that journey one step forward, but mixing in a bit of fantasy clockwork that the Nutcracker made a few years ago that is intriguing to see. Regardless the world building is rather impressive, and other movies can be seen as the inspiration for the direction they chose. Amidst the different acts, a nice telling using clockwork robots is used to fill in the interluding space, again capturing the charm of a Christmas specialty shop I visited when I was younger. It's a nice twist in style that I appreciate, though maybe it did get a tad overused.. However, the real wow factor for this movie's presentation is the songs that come with it. While not as diverse, Jingle Jangle's soundtrack reminded me much of The Greatest Showman. Wailing orchestral music combines with hip hop, funk, and classical to make a toe tapping ordeal with numbers that are both motivating to get up and dance and also emotionally layered as well. The opening number in particular was one of my favorites, and a middle number as well hit the spot, while others serve to be whacky and entertaining for all ages. Like many of the modern day musicals, lots of time and resources went into this element, and I believe some story sacrifices were seen to load the 2 hours with as much music as possible. If that's your angle, this movie should be number one on your spot this weekend, if not, well read on to hear my limitations with the film.A strong opening that promised magic and a true Christmas adventure, quickly become rushed, musical numbers overshadowing the story and character development at many parts of the movie. Never did I feel this more than the opening where so much set up was cast into an interlude in order to fast forward to where our younger cast could make a splash so to speak. It seems during this rushed opening where villains and supporting characters quickly got crammed in and swept aside that the Christmas components also got lost, dropped into the pre spirit visit of Scrooge's life and not really escaping this until the very end. The movie sort of diverges from even the Christmas error, instead becoming more towards rival toymakers, greed, and some inventing components similar to Hugo meeting Wall-E's designs so to speak. Was it cute? Yes, quite adorable, but I don't know if I would call this a Christmas Journey, more than journey for self-growth near the end of the year. In addition, the suspense and challenges we see in movies (Santa on trial in Miracle on 3rth street, Home Alone's Kevin defending his home from robbers, or even the Rugrats trying to trap Santa in the chimney) were missing in this film.. A few challenges and test of character, Jingle Jangle trades real development of threat and ingenuity to solve problems for more musical numbers, feel good monologues, and kid friendly slapstick for lack of a better word. It leads to sort of a haphazard story that is a bit weak for my tastes and loses the collective picture I think we all look for in the seasonal films. And perhaps the worst of all... it feels like a sappy, political, Facebook post when trying to deliver its messages. Again inspiration, but I agree too much that it misses the mark of a truly motivational movie for another filler meant to be added to the collection of the streaming movies, but again if that speaks to you, you should have no qualms with the film.The VERDICT:Given what passes for Christmas movies these days in a world of mass produced generic films, Jingle Jangle stands out in several departments. It's got the charm and magic of a kid's imagination that the season is about, with costumes, CGI, and setting that finally took me back to my childhood. Throw in some toe tapping numbers and some cool storytelling effects and you once again add points for raising the positive factor for the season. However, the movie is again about the superficial entertainment pieces and misses the full cohesiveness that several classics have maintained from over twenty years ago. The story is nonsensical and not much of the Christmas direction it promised, and the film's pass on adventure did not quite keep me as engaged as the opening number did. Still above all else, it's going to serve as an inspiration to a number of families and given it's accessibility is perfect for a direct release at home. Given the thoughts, the ideal is for those with young families, primarily ages 3-12 who like the song and dance gimmicks and not so much about complete stories.My scores for the film are:Family/Fantasy/Musical: 7.0 (Family/musical themes) Movie Overall: 6.0"}, {"id": 380, "text": "Very much a kids movie, but one which could be enjoyed by adults as well. This Christmas fantasy's strengths include impeccably detailed, sumptuous set design and set decoration; beautiful costume design, very colorful and imaginative - I'm not usually the kind of viewer that notices costume design but it's really spectacular here; good choreography and enjoyable songs - some of them are a bit too much of what you would expect from this kind of movie, but enjoyable nonetheless; excellent vocals and casting from top to bottom - I never knew Forest Whitaker could sing! Netflix clearly invested heavily in the project. The special effects are excellent and production values are high, and it certainly is good to see such a movie with a Black cast dominating all of the lead roles.The story does rely too much on the all you have to do is believe trope, which is repeated over and over again, and certainly the conflict and character development are utterly two-dimensional. But then again, that's not the point of this movie. It's a fantasy, very much along the lines of Peter Pan, and achieves what it sets out to achieve. It's an entertaining, escapist holiday fantasy."}, {"id": 381, "text": "I wanted to love this, I really did. I give many props for the representativeness of the cast, especially with the theme of empowering women and people of color in engineering, science and math. Visually, this is a really good looking film. A few (not all) of the original songs are catchy, and much of the dancing is off the hook. And then, that's it. Many of the negative reviews on here mention how the film is derivative of many other holiday films that have come before it. True, but not a deal breaker - after all, there are only so many ways to be original when compared to the 1000s of other holiday movies out there. My problems are plot, pacing, characterizations and motivations - the writing seems to be last on the list in Jingle Jangle. Forest Whitaker is a Academy Award winner and a national treasure. He has nothing to work with here. Mr. Jangle moves from resenting his granddaughter to screaming I love you in the course of minutes - I felt like I had fallen asleep and missed important plot points, but nope. The rest of the cast fares little better - what are their motivations? Why are the evil characters so evil?POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD (but c'mon, it's pretty formulaic...)We are told through the frame story that the Jangles didn't have any proof about the evil deeds of Gustafson and I guess we should just accept that? Lazy writing. There is no development of Lisa Davina Phillips' character other than her odd obsession with Jangle...the obsessed fluffy girl trope - lazy characterization. The conflict comes almost solely from the vague threat that the bank(?) is going to foreclose(?) on him, despite the fact that his friend (we know this because he calls him old friend a couple of times) will save him, if only he can complete his astonishing invention. Lazy plotting. I wonder if THAT will happen. Speaking of, the astonishing invention only interacts with the characters for like 5 minutes and suddenly he's their best friend and the most important thing in their world? Or, he's just there to sell toys (look out Baby Yoda!) Everything that happens is a huge MacGuffin - it's never explained how Jangle rediscovers his power to believe. The magical math that Journey can do extends to the square root of possible. Um. I'm not looking for A Beautiful Mind here, but this is so trite and meaningless that it almost undercuts the important work the film does to show that black girls and women can succeed in science and math. And the big ending reveal that our narrator, Phylicia Rashad is...gasp...well, rather than spoiling it, how would these kids NOT have known about Jangle's toy factory - the factory of the greatest toy inventor who ever was - that happens to be across town and visible from grandma's window? It feels like this is a big budget film that spent all its money on visuals, music, dancing, and then there was no money left to polish a script/story. It's not even particularly holiday-oriented other than the glurgy good feeling. Hey, I love glurge, and I'm all in favor of good feeling, especially around the holidays, but glurge has to be backed up with clear character development, or a real experience of something miraculous happening. Both of these are missing from Jingle Jangle. Someone once said that the only thing more disappointing than a bad movie is a movie that could have been good."}, {"id": 382, "text": "Jingle Jangle is Netflix's foray into the Christmas musical market.Forest Whitaker is the grumpy inventor Jeronicus Jangle. Many years ago he was the greatest toy inventor. Then his young apprentice Gustafson egged on by a villainous toy stole his his various designs and became famous and wealthy.Now Jeronicus is heavily in debt and has lacked a creative spark for many years. When his estranged granddaughter visits him he is coaxed back and inspired to work in his latest creation. A talking robot.This is an engaging film but let down by forgettable songs. It needed a big show stopping number. The kids might find the songs a tad dull and also the movie is overlong. The colourful production values are very good and almost Disneyesque.It does borrow heavily from other movies. The Princess Bride in the way it is framed as a grandmother tells a story. The Greatest Showman is the obvious inspiration and Wall-E by the look of the robot."}, {"id": 383, "text": "A Christmas musical that embraces its musicality to the fullest. Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is a very simple, yet heartwarming story that suits the holiday season perfectly.I'll start with the musical numbers since they are easily the best part of this film. These musical numbers are the likes that shouldn't be in a movie. They should be on stage. Everything from the dancing to the singing to all the other choreography is wonderfully over the top and look like something directly from Broadway. The musical numbers are just the right amount of ridiculous to make you smile. The songs are great as well. They are catchy enough to pull you in and touching enough to keep you there. I suppose my only complaint in regards to the music is that there isn't anything even remotely Christmasy. Since the movie is advertised as a holiday movie and takes place during Christmas, I was hoping that it would've been slightly more in line with that theme.As far as the story goes, there isn't much to say. It's a simple story with a predictable direction. However, I do think that kids will really like it. After all, the film is directed at them. But, the story is charming and heartwarming enough to make adults like it as well. The musical numbers certainly add their own flavour and charm, and I think that that's where most adults are going to find their enjoyment. The middle of the movie does feel a little slow, though. That's where the story is the most predictable, and that's also where the musical numbers are the furthest apart.To tell you the truth, I was positively surprised by Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey. A film like this could've easily been overly cheesy and so heavily oriented towards kids that adults would've really struggled with it. Fortunately, the film manages to walk that thin line where the orientation is clearly towards kids, but adults can, and will, enjoy it too. The ending certainly plays a big part in that. Although it's exactly what you would expect, it still manages to make you happy and leaves you with a smile. Precisely what films like this, are supposed to do.To enjoy this movie, you certainly have to like musicals. Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey takes full advantage of the musical genre and is everything but shy with its performances. If that's something that you like, then this movie will be a great addition to any holiday movie list."}, {"id": 384, "text": "It seems like it is a cute movie, but I don't feel like it contributes much, and gave me serious The Polar Express Vibes, and Annie Music vibes, but isn't nearly as good as the two movies. The music was poor, and it's only been half an hour after I watched the movie and I forgot all of the songs, except one, Make it Work which I did enjoy a lot. and it didn't give enough time to really let you bond with the early characters, and only seemed to be the cliche type villain, where they don't get what they want so they retaliate.The thing is, this movie gives me serious, and I mean SERIOUS The Polar Express vibes. Some scenes reminded me of it, and just the overall theme of this movie was exactly the same about BELIEVING, but the only difference in my eyes is that The Polar Express has very inspiring music that doesn't compare to anyone else's, and the plotting and entire movie did capture my eyes. (I'd recommend The Polar Express more, it has very unique music that cannot compare, and has it's entirely different thing going on that captures your full attention, while being a bit of a musical itself, it definitely flows better since it goes very well with the scenery and doesn't make them stop to capture more minutes in the movie, it's not lengthy and it will always make you curious for more.)Even if this movie didn't peak my interest, the actors were amazing, even if they were given a cliche script to read off of. I'd ENTIRELY recommend them to play in other movies."}, {"id": 385, "text": "I will admit I am a cynical man, but when I was watching this Netflix is clearly trying to paint a perspective of how they see the world and be at the forefront of racial change even if it means making this movie hyper stereotypical and go backwards in what they think they're achieving.Besides the aggressive racial ploy the movie for what it's worth is not terribly bad. It has a great production value and it's easy on the eyes. The acting is really good as well but the movie also falls into the trap where it tries to do too many things at once and at sometimes seemed like it was trying to do too much and lost itself.If you're into Christmas movies for the sake of it, this might be your thing, but it doesn't bring anything new or classic to the table. Essentially a rip of Greatest Showman with a netflix burning left agenda twist on it. It was lighthearted enough to make me smile in certain bits and this is why I wouldn't give it anything below a 5. But this movie is definitely passable."}, {"id": 386, "text": "Having just reviewed the darkly comic Christmas story Fatman, starring Mel Gibson, I anticipated being hauled into the light spirit of a classic-type holiday musical called Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey. I was right-it is like other Christmas stories specially crafted with high voices and high jinks for kids, and not so much for adults.The story is boilerplate holiday sentiment-family trying to bring everyone together amicably, greedy guys trying to tear family apart, and songs suiting meaning without much to remember except bouncy tunes and dazzling dancers. Oh, yes, one of the only white guys is the banker Delacroix (Hugh Bonneville), who is about to foreclose on the shop (been there and better done in It's a Wonderful Life).Jeronicus (Forest Whitaker as the older, Justin Cornwell as younger) has lost his gift for invention as well as his invention book, thanks to former assistant Gustafson (Keegan-Michael Key), a disaffected emerging inventor seemingly ignored by his boss. Jeronicus, now just a toymaker with a toy shop now pawnshop reminiscent of the kind of clutter Johnny Depp made magic with) will, of course, be saved by his irrepressible granddaughter, Jessica (Madalen Mills-no child could be that cute, but she is), who has his inventive genes in good order.Writer-director David Talbot knows how to create and sustain the imaginative world of effervescent kids to complement it with serviceable songs from Philip Lawrence, Davy Nathan, Michael Diskint, and John Legend (a producer of this film) like Square Root of Possible and Legend's R &amp; B Make It Work. Magic Man G may be the most memorable, and This Day could have been from any Broadway musical.Jingle Jangle has the potential to be a holiday staple despite grouchy critics like me for whom Bad Santa is the mark of excellence. If you gravitate to over-crowded Dickensian sets, clear villains, weepy moms and grandmas, and magical inventions like the High-flying Buddy 3000, a robot who talks and seems descended from E.T. or Wall-e, then relax by the fire with your kids and a modest cognac, and watch it on Netflix.You may doze, but then you can pick up the story because you've seen it all before. Merry Christmas."}, {"id": 387, "text": "So the good points:The costumes, set and special effects are pretty good.The bad points:The story, the songs, the acting, the length and just about everything else. It tries so hard it fails, it's unoriginal and it tries to be so many things it doesn't actually know what it is. Schizophrenic to say the least.Now the elephant in the room:First and foremost I don't make political points in reviews. I am also pro diversity and I believe mainstream films still have a long way to go but movie this is polar opposite. There is no diversity in this film, when the casted it that anyone who was white was rejected. There are a few token whites in this movie but that's all they are. This film is a step backwards for diversity and equality to the point of being offensive.P.S. it was so boring we gave up after 30 minutes.Give it a miss."}, {"id": 388, "text": "I made it halfway into the movie and gave up when Jangle started singing. Not just because he was singing... for all I know he can.It was because the movie was already showing signs of a weak, phoned in plot and then it just gave up and relied on the audience knowing all the usual kid/Christmas film tropes rather than develop the plot and characters themselves. I mean, if we do that, they said, we won't have room for all the songs.And it had so much potential! It's visually stunning, full stop. A feast for the eyes. I love Steampunk and I love a magical Christmas movie. The cast couldn't be called diverse but if anyone has a problem with a movie of mostly black actors with a few token white people, well, do I have to say it? I loved it. I see white people all day in my own home and in the mirror so it made a nice change to see other members of the human race get center stage. And Forest Whittaker was utterly delightful as the confused and grumpy inventor. I could have watched him all day. Just him.And while I don't care for these Broadway style musicals, the first song was promising. The rest (that I heard) reminded me of Frozen. That was not a compliment... Frozen is yet another film where plot and character were sacrificed on the altar of songs... not even very good ones, but very typical ones.The trouble is, there's a slice of society that looks at you like you're threatening to eat their hamster if you so much as mention that you don't like musicals. People who will forgive any sin of plot failure and character shortcut if there's song and dance numbers. People who think that to crowbar in songs is a reason to make a movie. They ruin a lot of good stories.Not that this was one. It just didn't take the time to do it. It started tolerably well and went on to interrupt an interesting story with a pint sized Mary Sue and predictable action as well as forced conflict. The toy that was gonna make him rich was a creepy sentient tin matador with a giant ego? Why in the world would anyone, much less everyone, want this irritating toy? But it took a toy like that to punt the plot forward so it must be a matador. Honestly, all the toys I saw were really unappealing.This film was a wasted opportunity."}, {"id": 389, "text": "Thoroughly enjoyable and very sweet.I had a great time watching 'Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey'. It's very well acted, has a story that's entertaining and features neat special effects.

Madalen Mills is impressive as Journey, while Keegan-Michael Key is terrific as Gustafson. Ricky Martin is a smart cast, also, as Don Juan Diego. It is a very competently cast film.The plot is very good, I felt entertained and touched by it. It has a fair bit of humour, but also sturdiness and heart.

Anika Noni Rose Dreamgirls who plays Jessica Jangle brings soul and power to the original songs that will be sung for many a year to come. Lisa Davina Phillip plays Ms. Johnston adds a touch of British humour to this brilliant film.I loved the colour, the costumes, the story, the songs, every single moment of Jingle Jangle.A very Merry Christmas indeed!"}, {"id": 392, "text": "This movie clearly had a high budget and was highly produced. That can help and does help in this case. The cinematography, choreography, costumes and special effects are great for this Christmas movie. The music is also fine. The steampunk sort of setting is also a feast for the eyes. The predominantly African American cast is also a nice change for a story that seems to take place at the turn of the 20th century in some artificial imaginary world.The actors are fine for the project. Perhaps the lone acting decision that bothered me was Forrest Whittaker's voice seemed a bit too soft and hard to understand at times.Why the movie overall didn't work to me was that the story was cheesy and not as palatable for adults as they were likely hoping it would be. I'm not suggesting that it needed to be R rated I'd anything. Just add some story elements that don't seem like they've been seen a million times before. The story and presentation weren't original in any significant narrative sense to me. And that means that the story didn't touch my heart in any deep sense.Believing isn't the causation of anything working. Believing or faith is a component for giving oneself a better chance to succeed by putting in the necessary work. I get annoyed by stories that seem to think that Christmas is the time to speak about how important it is to be like a gullible optimist. I prefer Christmas movies that are more about selflessness, love, acceptance and perseverance.I wanted to like the movie more, but in the end it just didn't rise to the same level as some of Netflix's other Christmas offerings from previous years. I would have been irritated if I had paid to see this movie in the theater, and felt fortunate that it only really cost me some time to watch it at home.To me the Klaus movie from last year is a much superior Christmas movie. One of the best I've ever seen. The first Christmas Chronicles movie I'd also argue is superior although not on the same level as Klaus. This movie is on par with Noel from Disney plus or some of the better hallmark movies. I'd put The Holdiay, Elf, Miracle.., It's a wonderful life, A Christmas Story, Nightmare, and a bunch of other holiday movies on a higher tier than Jingle Jangle. It unfortunately likely won't be a Christmas movie that people think about 5 plus years down the line."}, {"id": 393, "text": "I loved the colorful visuals. Everything in the movie felt very Christmas-y and cozy. The costumes were great as well. All the lively ensemble dance numbers were energetic and fun. While not all the songs were memorable, some were made better by having such kinetic accompanying scenes.On top of that, the vocal performances were great from most of the cast, especially Anika Noni Rose. And the acting was very good from even the younger cast members.That said, I wished there were more songs. After having several numbers in the first 30 minutes, there were long stretches without anything. While that's not necessarily an issue, outside of the dance numbers, the film lost some of its energy.I also wasn't particularly fond of the decision to make magic math-based. That kind of takes the magic out of the magic, at least for me.Overall though, Jingle Jangle is a fun, festive film that I think a lot of people can enjoy."}, {"id": 394, "text": "Netflix's recent attempt at a Christmas flick is probably their strongest original festive flick. Yet, for every box it ticks off, it misses some of the most important ones.Yes, it looks lovely and Christmassy. Sets are well designed, costumes are on point, and it oozes all the visual qualities you look for in these types of films. The musical numbers, and performances, do vary with the opening number probably being the best of the bunch. But I don't think they're any classics that will stick around.What it does miss the boat on is the story. Quite frankly, it's a bit of a mess - and for a two hour film, it turns into a bit of a slog making you ask questions such as: But why? and Is that it? You feel like it's going in one direction, only for a new character to be shoed-in halfway through, which takes us on a new extremely rushed direction. There's very little development with this new character or any reasoning as to why it can do the things it does. Then before you know it, the story has wrapped up, with very little impact and a feeling of a damp squid.In conclusion, if you're after a new Christmas flick for the holidays, you could probably do a lot worse than this - but I wouldn't expect this to replace your favourite Christmas Movie of all time."}, {"id": 395, "text": "It started off very good and promising. I loved the music and the actors were wonderful singers. I loved the charm and magical feel and atmosphere. However, I did start to lose interest towards the middle of the film. But by third act I was engaged again. So pacing could have been better.I did love the overall story. And as mentioned above it had this wonderful magical feel to it that felt perfect for Christmas. I really loved the young girl who played Journey and thought she really stole the show. She definitely is the heart of the film. I also felt the film needed more Anika Noni Rose. She has such a rather small part but she's absolutely great with what she does. However, I wish the story could have done without was the Don Juan toy (voiced by Ricky Martin). Every scene with that character felt too corny. Too childish. And therefore by association, I just didnt care for Keegan Michael Key's character Gustafon. He was less annoying, but still came across a little stereotypical villain. I do get that it is a family film and so obviously there has to be elements for kids. But I was totally fine with the Buddy 3000 scenes. I just dont think that character worked for me.I would say that the film was enjoyable enough. I do think its a worth a watch with the family this season. Do I think it will become a Christmas staple? Honestly, I dont know. I enjoyed it for it was but Im honestly not sure if I would re-visit it again next year. Especially when there are other faves and new content to consider.I listed the film as 7.

Its not so much a Christmas movie as much as it just happens to take place during Christmas time. With beautiful sets and costumes, the characters are enjoyable and the actors well chosen for their roles; I welled up more than once during the telling of the tale.BAD: This did not need to be a musical. While the actors all have beautiful voices, the musical numbers were distracting; half the time the music drowned out the singer's voices so you couldn't hear the lyrics. The choreography was uninspiring and the tunes were forgotten as soon as the musical numbers stopped. The direction of the movie was subpar; there were several scenes that did not flow well into the next which had me question the lack of character development or at least transformation. The absence of any positive Black male characters was also disturbing. The main character was a deadbeat dad, the granddaughter was apparently born via immaculate conception because no father/husband is ever mentioned, the villain is a thieving apprentice and the little boy Edison is afraid of his own shadow. For a movie that is supposed to have been written by a Black writer so his son could have a contemporary Christmas classic, I am scratching my head why there wasn't a greater emphasis on the Black family."}], "reviews_amount": 397}
