It's a great debut by director Clark Duke and Vince Vaughn, Liam Hemsworth and John Malkovich really shine in their roles."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Clark duke is on his way. I liked this one for sure."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Its not a perfect movie,but it dont deserve the ratings that people are giving to this title,a 6*It may be slow sometimes,but its a quite good and entertaining and it also has his funny moments,for me its a solid 8******** You wont regret it."}, {"id": 3, "text": "That's it. An intelligently written, well directed and well produced, greatly acted and tastefully photographed movie. Stylish and clear headed. Arkansas deserves at least a 7 on IMDB, like a lot of quite slow and clever little gems stuck around the 6. If you love cinema, do not miss this little jewel. Characters are graciously sketched in their lovely, human weirdness. You do not know a lot about them, but you can sense their past in their words, faces and actions. Liam Hemsworth is a little affected in a couple of scenes, but everyone else is credible even when exaggeratedly over the top, like Malkovich. Watch this movie if you want to watch a good, well-narrated and entertaining story. Cinema really needs this kind of productions, even if the ratings tell us that people need less quality."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Loved every minute of it.....intense, dark, witty, introspective,. Kudos to direction and screenplay."}, {"id": 5, "text": "This movie is based on the novel Arkansas by John Brandon and ids the directorial debut of Clark Duke. Kyle Ribb (played by Liam Hemsworth) is a small time drug dealer, working in a big time organisation ran by drug Kingpin Frog. We see Kyle about his business, then he is seen sat in a house, the house seemingly his, where he is seen watching TV. Then there is a knock at the door, to which Kyle ignores, other that a quick look. Then there is a noise of someone trying to pick the lock. These leads Kyle to get up from his chair and check out the perpetrator through the spy hole, then waiting. As the guy manages to open the door, Kyle is ready behind the door to take him to the floor and restrain him. Next scene is the burglar tied up and gagged in the cupboard, Kyle then gets a visitor, someone he knows from the gang. He is very impressed that Kyle has managed to do what he has done in restraining the guy, saving him a job. This leads to Kyle getting a promotion. The promotion involves moving to Arkansas to move wholesale. He then is seen meeting Swin Horn (played by Clark Duke himself), Swin is a very talkative and confident character, which seems to annoy the placid, quieter Kyle. Their first assignment is to drive a flat bed lorry with the wholesale product hidden by an assortment of boxes with pictures of sinks on them. While on their journey to Corpus Christi, the rope holding down the tarpaulin breaks, forcing them to stop off to try and get something to assist in keeping it down. This is where they run into park ranger Bright (played by John Malkovich). He inspects the truck and the two think that they are caught. As it happens, Bright also works for Frog, and has been trailing them all the way from their journey's start. This then sets up the story-line and shows the journey that they have. Vince Vaughn also stars in this movie, i will not go into detail about that as i do not what to give away any spoilers. Vivica Fox and Eden Brolin (the daughter of Josh Brolin and Alice Adair) also appear. The movie is split into chapters, some of present and some that go back to past times to give you the insight into the characters. I will say that the movie is very slow to build, i know you have to character build, but at times it seemed to drag. There are very good points that happen to, so please continue and don't give up on it. The black comedy elements are funny and will bring a smile to your face, if you like that, it also has some violent scenes too. Clark has elements in this movie that would not be out of place in a Quentin Tarantino movie. The guy has talent and i think will be one to watch for in the future as this will be no doubt a learning curve. I think that due to the pandemic, this movie has been wrongly chosen to be streamed, and released before a cinema audience saw it. I think that the big screen may have helped to launch the movie, rather than being a movie on TV that you can just turn off before it gets to the good bits."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I saw this movie without watching the trailer, without reading anything bah it. Sometimes I do this like a blind buy. The film is slow at times n tries hard to be a cool slick flick. Vince Vaughn saved this film from being a disaster. He once again played a drug dealer like the one from True Detectives, who wants to start afresh but..... The star cast is good, Eden Brolin's got a very different n attractive face. All in all, this one will not leave any impact."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Starts so bad but gets sooooo good You gotta stay in there and let the low budget beginning play out. Then, ZINGA!"}, {"id": 8, "text": "The film runs with two plots that have already come together. We are first introduced to Kyle (Liam Hemsworth) and Swin Horn (Clark Duke writer/director). They work running wholesale drugs out of a park ran by Bright (John Malkovich). They all work for Frog (Vince Vaughn) whose rise in the drug business is the second plot line.The plot is not spectacular. It is your basic drug crime without there ever being any cops. What makes the film such a joy to watch are the characters. Overall the film reveals a Tarantino influence. Good Job Mr. Duke.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I liked it. Not completely predictable. Easy to follow. Good ending."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Like some guy here in the comments I saw this movie without knowing that was Duke's debut and this was a good surprise when I saw it, He showed some maturity that I wasn't expecting from him. Of curse it's not a Tarantino's movie, but he showed talent. Sometimes the movie is slow, but it's tense. I think it's more like a No country for old man than Pulp Fiction (not getting close to any of these) But if you want to see a good movie, enjoyable and good acting (Vaungh and Malkovich) this is one of them."}, {"id": 11, "text": "The beginning of this film was abit slow but its really enjoyable after you brush past it, even the cast work well together surpised to even see liam Hemsworth &amp; Clark Duke in the same movie as the main protagonists two totally different actors but somehow the pair work well within the film and really enjoy the chapter cutslides some work with a film e.g Kill Bill and others but some dont work but this jelled well but I can understand some people don't really like these type of movies but if your open its worth a watch"}, {"id": 12, "text": "I can't figure why this movie's got a score under 6.... It's a good road-action movie with drama and comedy elements. It has good twists, good acting., good music and some funny moments. All in all it's at least a solid 7. Watch it!"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Loved this film for so many reasons I didn't expect. There was comedy that caught you off guard, important moments that you felt deeply, conversations between the eyes of the characters and tension that you could read. I did not realize how much could be said with the two words: I know. but these small details are what make up characters that you learn to love. John Malkovich plays a wonderfully, strangely unique character; alongside Clark Dukes quick-witted one liners you find yourself laughing during circumstances of a crime story you would not normally laugh at. I appreciate the colors and costumes used - bright unique pieces in a retro dreariness of a small town. I feel that this speaks to the overall feeling of the story - that this isn't just a normal crime story, that there's something more, bright, funny, odd that you wouldn't expect. This film made me want to buy track pants and I will wear them while I watch it again."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Some people over judge or get caught up in saying it it's obviously influenced by such and such, HEY LISTEN we all are!!! Yes it had a Tarantino feel to it but I think Tarantino is overrated, he uses violence instead of acting, hateful 8 was his best by far because of kurt Russell and the cast. His movies have way to much dialogue as well!!, back to Arkansas it has a decent pace just the right amount of action and violence and a great moral to the story. I've never seen or heard of a drug dealers life ending well it always ends in a extremely negative way. This movie seems real and its probably the 1st of its genre to not have the f bomb every 2 seconds or the c word . Which shows excellent writing. Swearing is a cop out, a short cut I'm no preacher I swear a LOT but it's not always needed but is always used and to much!! Drake 9 stars on your 1st movie, hats off keep with it you'll only get better. Oh and p.s. Vince Vaughn is an extremely underrated actor!!"}, {"id": 15, "text": "Wish the soundtrack was available. Watched it 3 times for the music alone"}, {"id": 16, "text": "While the subject matter wasn't always relatable, Duke managed to create a perfect depiction of life in Arkansas and beyond. The cinematography was excellent and the score was an absolute treat. I'm not sure why so many people have such negative things to say. The only way this movie resembled Tarantino was in good ways. A chapter format or focusing on the antagonist are just elements of an interesting movie. Y'all should chill."}, {"id": 17, "text": "This is a well-paced and entertaining thriller, but also has a great feel. The direction, acting, music and the whole look and atmosphere of the movie are superb. It might not be to everyone's taste as it is quite original, but I really enjoyed it."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Arkansas is a great drug dealers movie showing how easy drugs are moved across this country and from state to state. While watching, I felt as though I was watching a Tarantino movie. They even broke it down by chapters with numbers and names. John Malkovich lived up to his stellar acting roles in the past days. Vince Vaughn actually did a good job on acting in this movie and not just some comedic role. The director and actor Clark duke was a surprisingly refreshing role. All the actors did a good job. With a mix of action, comedy, and mystery I highly recommend this movie you will enjoy it. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\ude0e"}, {"id": 19, "text": "I'm going to keep this review short and simple.'Arkansas' is a great movie with an original story, and suprises in every scene.

The cast was great and pretty good movie!"}, {"id": 21, "text": "Arkansas is not an original, well developed or interesting movie. First, even the casting is good, acting is pretty weak. Second, movie's pace is extremely slow. So consequently it is difficult to be interested for almost 2 hours without getting bored. Lack of action does not help either. Last, it could have been far better with just a more risky script. Looks like the director just copied several cliches from other movies. So, overall I do not recommend this movie."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Lots of reviews spend time nit piking here and there and never really make a point that matters. Of course this isn't a big budget block buster. It isn't one with a bunch of big money folks behind it. But what it is is a mid level movie with a director who new the area he was making his movie about, actors who were enjoying their roles and were talented enough to show it and a script taken from a book that was written by a man who understood Elmore Leonard. This movie is well down on all levels, makes good use of its limited budget and produces a thoroughly enjoyable movie. That is all you can ask for."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Duke's full directorial debut took place.Obviously, the kid is a fan of Tarantino movies. The film is a replica of Pulp Fiction, and not very successful. The plot is unclear. Incomprehensible gluing of a plot (events change on each other it is not clear how).The acting is also not perfect, the image of Swin rages throughout the film.It should be added that the film is very long. It seems that the plot of 3 pages was simply stretched for no apparent reason for such timing.4/10. Boring."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Wow, how was this mess dragged out to 117 mins? This screenplay was all over the place, convoluted with major plot and technical issues. Actor turned-newb-writer-director Clark Duke was awesome in his role alongside the stellar cast of Hemsworth, Malkovich, Fox and Vaughn, but his failure to direct his actors was evident. His camera work was actually decent, but the long dragged out and some unnecessary scenes that were also all over the place, needed major editing/cuts to bring his screenplay - jointly written with amateur writer Andrew Boonkrong, down to at most an 80-90 min runtime - with faster pacing. The score, sets, location and cinematography were great, but I feel if this screenplay was reviewed and corrected by a seasoned writer, I would've enjoyed it much better. I feel that great talent was mostly wasted in its runtime. Sadly it's only a 6/10 from me."}, {"id": 25, "text": "An accurate depiction of what I'll loosely call organized crime in the part of the country immigrants avoid. A self proclaimed criminal mastermind is paired with Lenny to go eastbound and down. Their boss tries too hard to correct the mistakes of his mentor, whom he betrayed like Palpatine. While buffers are useful in the drug business it would be just as useful to know who your boss is. If Tarantino has taught us anything, it's that you can bail out and then dispose of subordinates (Jackie Brown). But that would be too much like right. The business is full of scumbags these days; scumbags who can never quit and who are too proud to ask for help.

One description I later saw was dark comedy, and to me it is not that - quirky - off beat, perhaps, but it's not a comedy. It is a very cleverly written story of the madness and unpredictability of the outlaw life of middle level drug dealing. Well cast - nice performances - really great period musical score - nicely paced - well filmed. An excellent effort by a first-time director. If you go for interesting gritty crime stories, I recommend giving this one a try."}, {"id": 40, "text": "Well written and a hoot to watch.

Hemsworth's character and his deliverance of lines was dry. Vince Vaughn was less than convincing in his role as a ranger..

It was my husband's idea to rent it on Prime Video &amp; I agreed to watch with him even though I thought $5.99 was too much. I was correct! He nodded off several times so that's what he thought of it. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I liked Liam Helmsworth &amp; thought he did a great job despite what he had to work with. I'm also from Arkansas so hey had to give it a star for that! Liam was the only character &amp; actor in the movie I liked. I usually love John Malkovich &amp; Vince Vaughn but not in this film. Vince Vaughn's accent was from where I don't know but definitely not Arkansas &amp; his acting was over the top in a bad way. Could be he was trying to make up for the boring content but nothing could help with that. If it's on cable or Netflix &amp; you have absolutely nothing else to watch then maybe.

There are two murders, Bright and Nick (Chandler Duke), and are buried by Kyle and Swin. The murders were not done by Kyle and Swin and they stay put so as to not be believed guilty by running away.There is basically no story here. Kyle and Swin stay put like nothing has happened telling all who want to know that Bright went to Oklahoma with an Indian girl.Footage of how Frog became a big drug lord is of no consequence and we didn't need to see this footage. Like I said there is no story here. Frog sends Barry (uncredited) to find out about Bright but he gets killed by Kyle. After a long time Frog sends a couple of his men to take Kyle and Swin out.And that's it. No story. Just a slice of life blown up into a nothing movie. We kept waiting for things to happen and, well, they didn't. This is bland, but some may consider it watchable, and , of course, I don't. I will say that Vince Vaughn was completely miscast here. He always looked like an open book .... like an ordinary person in loud Cowboy Western shirts. He never had the calculating look of a drug lord. He just looked like an innocent person at all times.Oh, Arkansas as the title also made no sense at all.Notables: Michael Kenneth Williams as Almond who Frog goes to work for and ends up betraying him; Vivica A.

It is based on a novel of the same name by John Brandon. The cast of Arkansas is like a bunch of recognizable actors going unrecognizable. Case in point: Co-star and Illinois native Vince Vaughn wears a St. Louis Cardinals hat while listening to their games on an old radio. Oh and director-slash-star Clark Duke sports an adult film mustache and kinda looks like a chick (oxymoron alert).Anyway, 2020's Arkansas is not a bad feature debut for the 35-year-old Duke. Filmed at a snail's pace with zoom shots, whip pans, and a time setting that feels mostly 80's and 90's, Arkansas appears like something Quentin Tarantino would have done pre-Reservoir Dogs.In regards to Arkansas, you get a country-fried rock soundtrack, acts of brutal violence minus the action, and stories with chapters attached a la Pulp Fiction. Clark Duke, who was obviously influenced by directors such as S. Craig Zahler, Steven Soderbergh, and Tarantino (mentioned earlier), is a visual and camera hot dog helmer. Unfortunately, his bitty storytelling sensibilities in Arkansas don't quite catch up to his keen eye behind the lens.The performances in Arkansas are underplayed yet solid with Vaughn, Duke, and Liam Hemsworth being the standouts. Their dialogue readings are slow, philosophical, and drawn-out. Yup, Arkansas may have a running time under two hours but hey, it kinda feels like three.With music mostly from The Flaming Lips, a distributor by the name of Lionsgate, and a knack for having Johnny Lee's Lookin' for Love never sounding the same way again, Arkansas is about two drug dealers who take orders from a callous kingpin who they have never seen or met. In 2018, the normally fast-talking Vince Vaughn starred in the glacially-paced Dragged Across Concrete. Expect the same results here. Call it Arkan-drawl.

Clark Duke on the other hand did a pretty good job with Arkansas. For his directing debut I thought it was more than convincing. Sure he must be a big fan of Tarantino, but then again who isn't? But also as an actor he gave a good performance, his character was a delight to watch, and so were the characters of Vince Vaughn and Liam Hemsworth. Each character adds something special to the plot, a story that is well written, a sometimes intriguing story but most of the time a very enjoyable story to watch. So yes I'm very surprised Arkansas doesn't get higher ratings. It's a mystery to me what those one star reviewers are trying to achieve, is that really the worst movie they ever watched? I guess they don't watch much movies then because I've seen thousands worse movies than this one.

And they may be right, insofar as this movie dialogue and action are quite the same as say Pulp Fiction. The question is: was it the director's intention to actually try to equate Tarantino's film? I'm not so sure.Yes, Tarantino's influence is quite obvious. It is gangster flick with quirky characters and where things slowly get out of hand. But are those elements Tarantino's exclusive domain? Don't other films make use of such tools in their narrative toolbox? Of course they do! My point is no film is made in a vacuum and the fact that one of the critics' main arguments is the similarities with Tarantino's work, is a testimony to the director's work.My opinion is Arkansas uses some of Tarantino's themes to tell an original story, all the while creating a mood of its own. Liam's character is an interesting portrait of a smart outcast who struggles to find meaning in life. His partner offers a funny, self-deprecating look at hipster culture while never completely muting its relevant criticism on our society. It's not overdone, and it's there to make dialogue interesting and thoughtful, sparing us constant comedic or cool-sounding dialogue. The overall restrain that permeates the movie, in the rhythm, the setting as well as the acting is a very welcome change from oftentimes overly dramatic crime movies I see trying to grab my attention.A solid 8/10 for me.

And if you miss this scene, you're gonna be lost the rest of the movie. That's the only reason I comment on this.This movie has a few nice schools of thought (the character's own words), which I found kind of refreshing but depressing, even though I already knew them myself. Good movies have unique elements, and I consider this one of them. If this movie was just about drug dealer revenge and double-crossing (*rolls eyes*), we've definitely got enough of those movies, but this one is different. I'm kind of interested to see how Rotten Tomatoes will rate this movie, actually.Overall, it's a good movie, especially for the summer (I wonder why I think this, though. Maybe because it takes place in the summer in the south? No idea). .Was actually gonna buy it before it went on sale for $1, since it was only $2 more to buy it than rent it.

Arkansas is his very own first full feature, a debut in both directing and writing plus performing one of the main characters, and I'm quite frankly wholesomely surprised. Based on Josh Brandon's novel of the same name, Arkansas is an engaging, grimy and subtly funny Coen-esque neo-noir tragedy in five chapters.By the time I even noticed there's a trailer out, the release of the movie was just a week away, so I went in quite blind. Not to repeat myself, but I truly am pleasantly surprised, I get a lot of kicks out of the modern neo-noirs, small town crime shenanigans, simple folks in way over their head - a vibey sub-genre that I believe Coen Brothers kickstarted, providing endless inspiration with their unique writing and characters who think they're smarter than they actually are.Kyle (Liam Hemsworth) and Swin (Clark Duke) are the footsoldiers of an Arkansas-based drug empire, trying to work their way up the ladder where on top sits a drug kingpin named Frog, whom Kyle and Swin have never seen. Naturally, one day a particular deal goes wrong for the two boys &amp; the consequences are increasingly deadly. Arkansas is split in five chapters, each tells either a portion of the story of Kyle and Swin, or introduces the other characters in the whole wide drug scheme and its history, ultimately weaving together a web which's entirety only the viewer can see. Drug smuggling, drug dealing, schemes, the crime world hierarchy, murder, love, so on... I think it's sure to say some will call it a pointless movie, perhaps a plotless one, or just a tedious experience. Yeah, it's a slow-burn, there's attention to detail, to plot-irrelevant conversations and a lot of it is as aimless as the lives of the two main characters, but it's often where the charm of Arkansas lies. Having said that, perhaps it could've done better with a more fueled climax.The cinematography was kind of a conflictive experience for me. It would seem that Arkansas is not a big budgeted movie, despite having such a stellar cast. Speaking of that, great performances all around, if a little too little of John Malkovich. Plot might not relate to that, but the overall atmosphere felt somewhat realistic, and so did the characters and the performances carrying them. For a long time I've hoped Vince Vaughn will stay in the crime genre, for True Detective, Cell Block 99 and Dragged Across the Concrete were an awesome fit for him, now accompanied by Arkansas. Fingers crossed for more. So, the cinematography, far from exceptional, but overall great camera work, but a little drab color grading... I craved for a crisper, more elegant aesthetical look. Ears, though, were pleased with an interesting original score and soundtrack, country-like and fitting the atmosphere like a glove.Arkansas is not a very original tale and outfit, but it's a great exercise in its genre, a pleasant experience for fans of such vibes &amp; a highly commendable directional debut. My rating: 8/10.

When I saw that Clark Duke was making a film version, I hoped for the best but expecting nothing. I remember Clark Duke from Clark and Michael back when that was being released weekly online. I know he's done a few other things since then, but it seemed like a good move to direct, and his choice of source material seemed cool.I think Clark could be a good director. Someday. Putting himself in the movie (in a role where his love interest is waaaaay out of his league and is so unbelievable) was a huge mistake. Watching the film, I realized that was part of the bigger problem- Everything, from the opening scene to the casting to the music to the pacing to the credits scene, this is the most pretentious hipster cringe p.o.s. I've seen in a while. This is the work of a young, immature, very self-satisfied person.Imagine: you're a 5 foot 2 fat balding hipster (do hipsters even exist anymore!? this character wears ugly clothes ironically...) annoying voice and you've just booked your first directing job. Who should I cast in the main roles? you ask yourself... Well, obviously ME for one of them!!! Which one? The one that gets the hot chick, of course!!! You're not Clooney. You're not Warren Beatty. This is your first film as a director. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!?and of course the music is obsure old country tunes that only the coolest vinyl collector would know about, and Duke uses them like a crutch. he didn't know how to transition between scenes so he just put songs and shots of driving all over the place. Which is exactly my point. This movie isn't saying anything. The decisions that Duke makes as a director seem to serve only his own ego. Even Vince Vaughn is flat and awkward. There's just enough of a story here to keep things moving, but it's like that's all Duke cared about- he wanted to have made a movie, rather than make a movie.I think Clark Duke could make a good film, maybe many. For that to happen however, he'd have to lose a lot of ego and take it back to basics. Learn to be a director before attempting writer/director/actor all on your first film. Avoid the (lame) stylistic choices and just tell an interesting story clearly. I'm not a filmmaker myself, so I'm speaking as a film lover. I went into the movie thinking oh wow Clark Duke is starting to direct, good for him. Strangely, I still kind of feel that way, and though I felt Arkansas was a waste of my time, I'll be rooting for his next film."}, {"id": 148, "text": "I could not stop watching this film. I judge films by the watch theory. Do I keep looking at my watch during the film.. In this film I never looked at my watch. It mystified me why people think this film reflects Tarentino, it never occurred to me at all. What did occur to me was that I was looking at another Fargo or that the film could have been done by the Cohen Brothers, that is what saw, the quirky characters, the droll dialogue, the casual violence that seemed almost nonviolent.... if that makes any sense. It had a mid-80's quality to it and they carried it off very well. I thought Vince Vaughn was tremendous as a bad guy too. And I will say that I had never even heard of Clark Duke before. Never seen anything he had done before at all. I was amazed he had written and directed it. Now, was the film perfect, no. Some rewriting and some editing might have helped the continuity of it but the overall package overcame those deficiencies. I posit that if you can get Noah Hawley and Clark Duke together you might have a real continuation of the Fargo quality screenplays many people find appealing. I enjoyed this film a lot."}, {"id": 149, "text": "Overall, the movie would have been a 5/10 if it didn't include Clark Duke. But with Clark Duke in this movie, it dropped down to a 1/10. Not sure who lied to Clark telling him that his mustache and outfits looked good along with his acting skills. It was sickening to watch a real actor like Liam Hemsworth have to act in the same scenes as Clark. Liam has natural talent, Clark doesn't even have enough natural talent to be an extra on this movie.Watched the first hour with the family, in the family room, and then we all voted to turn this movie off to watch something better. Later that evening in bed, the wife begged to just watch the last hour promising it would get better. An hour later, she apologized.Do yourself a favor and watch paint dry. That would be more entertaining and less cringe worthy (Clarks acting skills).Never again."}, {"id": 150, "text": "2 small time criminals accidentally get the chance of running a drugs dealing business. Will they succeed in running it successfully or die trying?I liked this movies' laidback, slowburning feel, but I guess the regular crime fans wont like this movie, because the focus of this movie is first most about the characters instead of cool poses and shootouts, although there are still a few pretty cruel murder scenes to be seen.Acting is terrific. Even Liam Hemsworth is good and Vince Vaughn plays one of his best serious acting performances ever. Supporting roles are good as well.Any bad? Not really, but this movie was based upon a novel and the director followed that novel structure with many jumps in time, which dont really work for the movie. The story structure is somewhat disjointed. What works in a book often does not work well in a movie. Other than that minor criticism, I would recommend this movie to any arthouse movie fan of subtle, slowburning crime dramas. It mesmerized me and I will start paying attention to other works of this great director called Clark Duke."}, {"id": 151, "text": "Oh boredom is a beautiful thing. No because a bored criminal is a good criminal. So if you boys ever catch yourself starting to complain about boredom.

Providing you with something to do during a time of boredom in a second lockdown. Truthfully this film found me (thanks Netflix) and I'm happy to say it was a fun ride!Arkansas tells us the tale of an unlikely pair of drug dealers, Kyle (Liam Hemsworth) and Swin (Clarke Duke) and follows them on their journey into the underbelly, whilst avoiding the wrath of Kingpin, Frog (Vince Vaughn), after a deal gone wrong.As is expected from the area of Arkansas, the story takes place in an Ozark-esque surrounding, showing a different form of drug dealing, with unusual players, customers and problems along the way. A far cry from what we usually expect to see in films and shows such as Narcos, Blow, Wolf of Wall Street or Scarface, where drugs are the epicenter. Here, in thousands of square miles of dense green forest, our drug dealing pair, conversing with each other with laugh out loud moments similar to that of RDJ and Galifinakis in Due Date, can even make themselves an extra buck.With standout performances from supporting characters such as Bright (John Malkowich), Frog (Vince Vaughn), Johnna (Eden Brolin) and the Twins (Brad William Henke and Jeff Chase); Arkansas provides us with rich, funny and intelligent dialogues similar to that of Pulp Fiction.Clarke Duke not only plays Swin, but directs this film too, setting the scene with Chapter Titles to break down the story, mirroring Kill Bill whilst also using shots and music similar to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Along with a shocking torture seen early on, resulting in unfortunate events for the pair, reminding us of the infamous Egg Plant torture seen in True Romance. If you can't tell already. My guess would be that Duke has taken a lot of inspiration from Quentin Tarantino. And a little from Taxi Driver with a motivational mirror speech in the end of the final act. But you'll have to see for yourself.A simple tale of a drug deal gone wrong and the misfortune that awaits two friends. A story that we have seen in one way or another man times, isnt perfect, but well worth the watch if it appears in your recommendations.I hear he has a pool shaped like a Lily Pad. Unfortunately not. But he does own a ton of terrible rodeo shirts!6/10.

All throughout the movie, lots of characters make very illogical choices, and whenever a character makes a choice which a normal intelligent human WOULDN'T, then that creates a plot-hole as far as I'm concerned. I mean, these are drug dealers, and that lots of money apart from being in a very dangerous profession, any sensible drug dealer of this size and scale would always do 2 things: They'd always wear body armor, and they'd always be armed. Yet that isn't the case in this movie, and it creates plot-holes.Anyway, the acting in the movie is very good all round. I did however find the presence of Liam Hemsworth in this movie distracting... I mean, he's a fine actor, but I just don't think he is 'drug dealer material' if you know what I mean... I just think they could have cast a different actor in his place that could have LOOKED more like a drug dealer, since all the other actors in the movie play the drug dealer parts well, but he just looks like a lost underwear model in a drug movie...Anyway, it's an 8/10 movie, that was brought down by the plot-holes to a 6/10. You can go ahead and watch it, but only if you don't mind a very slow paced film with very little action, almost like 'No Country for Old Men' or 'GoodFellas' but just slower and with worse acting."}, {"id": 153, "text": "Anyone who remembers Clark Duke as the brash, young intern on the popular tv series, The Office, knows his voice and will never forget it. I certainly didn't and it drove me crazy trying to figure out who was playing the short, dark-haired, bearded guy called Swin.Yes, Duke wrote the screenplay and directed the film but he should have stayed behind the camera and never cast himself in the lead role. His voice doesn't blend well with most movie characters and he lacks the kind of talent that allows other actors with similar, unforgettable voices like Morgan Freeman to act, narrate, and speak for cartoon characters.Liam Hemsworth gave a decent performance as Kyle, a young man capable of getting any dirty job done without leaving a mess behind but his acting needs improvement because the movie was carried by the great screenplay, not his character.The only important actor in Arkansas was Vince Vaughn (Frog) who looked so good in his expensive Western shirts and bolo ties that I'm going shopping for one myself, a bolo tie that is, not a two hundred dollar Western shirt.But Frog also had that unique ability to rub shoulders with the common man yet still conduct his business with financial prudence and executive leadership. This made him appear more successful as a crime boss and made his criminal organization seem larger than life. No one conveys these business traits any better than Vince Vaughn.I gave this movie a low rating because Clark Duke changed his appearance for the film but did nothing to change his acting voice. True, Swin was a young man fresh out of college and naturally needed a voice filled with optimism and fearlessly vigor but if Duke cast himself in this role because he played a similar character in The Office, he should have at least worn a white dress shirt and cheap tie so fans of the show who didn't recognize his name wouldn't have to search IMDb looking for his bio pic as soon as they heard him speak."}, {"id": 154, "text": "Arkansas is Clark Duke's first time directing a movie and he did an overall good job with the visual storytelling but I think he wasn't as good at giving direction, he also co-wrote the screenplay. The movie is about Kyle and Swin who lives by the orders of a drug kingpin named Frog, whom they've never met. But when a deal goes horribly wrong, the consequences are deadly.The writing was mostly bad but at times okey, I liked the dialogue a lot though as it was at times funny in a black comedic way. There's some plot points that I just wonder why they were there, it's like they wanted to have a more boring and longer movie than a good film. But after you finish the movie, you get why some of those bad scenes are there, character development but honestly it could have been better written. But the storytelling for Frog is the good parts of the movie, Vince Vaughn does a terrific job.The ensemble cast is full of well known actors, and most of them bring good performances to the movie, I found Vince Vaughn and Michael K Williams to be the best and Clark Duke brought some comedic moments. Liam Hemsworth wasn't the right choice but I think it was the direction he got that made it feel a bit wooden, he didn't really have any scenes that were good or great but only okey.One thing I didn't really like was the saturation and weird lightning, some visual effects were a bit off. I didn't like the I really liked the music, it was fitting right into the tone of the movie and also the setting. This movie is slow paced and that's something you need to know, the story is quite simple but it works.

It was trending on Netflix so gave it a go and it's actually pretty decent on the whole.As the title says, the first half an hour wasn't great. It was slow, choppy and just didn't fish me in as a viewer. I was sat there thinking this is going to be a stinker. But as it progresses it gets better and the story becomes so much more engaging. The use of chapters was done very well also.I have a soft spot for Vince Vaughn and this film showed me why, I thought he was stand out and did his character really well.Ending a little underwhelming in my opinion, expected a touch more but overall I enjoyed watching this movie and seeing this is Clark Duke's directorial debut I think he can be pleased with himself. 7/10."}, {"id": 156, "text": "I know nothing about this movie before I watched it, never even seen the trailer.I am a Vince Vaughn fan so I decided to watch it. The pace is slow, actually boring. But its that type of movie. No CGI, no special effects, this is all talk and some fighting with a lot of kicking when someones down (must be Dukes imagination of how a fight should be...or how he got bullied, in his actual past?)So these two guys get into a small circle of semi organized crime, drugs. There isnt much show of how powerful this group is but its a given, not cartel level. The two guys are forced into a friendship and they soon become promoted unexpectedly. Their sort of redneck-ish and not the brightest, so they make a lot of mistakes. Which leads to their downfall. History, character build up and flashbacks make up half the film. Director does himself a obvious favor by giving himself the hot girl (Eden Brolin) in the movie, good move for a dorky nerdy looking dude.Overall, decent to watch.

It has a common plotline but with some fun characters. I was entertained and interested enough to finish and want to see what happens with the story. As some have said there are some slow parts, which I was hoping would be culminated in the final chapter, but personally felt a little let down in that regard. I thought there was definitely room for more background on the characters and parts of the plot. Also, although I love a good dialogue film, which I would say this one is, I thought there was some room for a little more action in this story.Based on movie alone I'd give it a 6/10, but with the fact that this was written and directed by Clark Duke as his debut, it's pretty impressive and for that I bump it up a star.Final thought: I don't really see myself ever watching this again, but it was worth the watch."}, {"id": 158, "text": "I'm usually quite easy to please when it comes to movies. I'm easily entertained and rarely do I find a film that I genuinely dislike. Arkansas, however, was that rare film.It really is quite unfortunate. The film clearly had a very strong vision, but I just found the execution to be lacking in every way imaginable. It felt like the movie was trying way too hard to be something that it never could've been. It was filled with choices that might've been cool had they been in some other movie.One of the things that bothered me the most was the way the film looked. I don't know why, but almost every shot seemed to be horrendously overexposed, and it looked like someone had taken the saturation filter and cranked it all the way. Especially outside shots in the sun were horrible. I'd assume that it was an artistic choice, but I really don't see the appeal of it. I also don't understand why it was made in the first place. These kinds of things should be used to enhance the story and its impact. Here, this choice adds absolutely nothing to the film.Another thing that sort of bothered me was the dialogue. Especially early on, it felt completely unnatural. People were saying things that I feel like no human being would ever actually say. It really threw me off in the beginning. The dialogue did, however, improve towards the end, or maybe I just got used to it. Either way, the experience improved. Another thing sort of relating to the dialogue were these monologues that a couple of the characters had. It seemed like they were supposed to be deep and meaningful, but all they ended up doing was slowing the film down without giving much in return.I also found this movie to be quite boring. It felt like it was constantly trying to build up into some grand finale and the finale just never arrived. Indeed, the end was really anticlimactic and ended the film on a flat note. That ending could've been a redeeming factor had it been more impactful. In many ways, the film improved as it chugged along, but the way it ended, just left me feeling absolutely nothing.It really is quite unfortunate that I disliked this film as much as I did. Arkansas tried to be cool and different, and the story it was trying to tell seemed interesting. However, I feel like it was trying a little too hard. And as a result, the film ended up being full of ideas that never really connected into a meaningful experience."}, {"id": 159, "text": "'Arkansas' is a very strange movie. It's missing a lot of the polish and cohesion of your typical larger budget film, yet the story is so much fun that you find yourself not really caring. The film starts out with some very clunky and out of place narration before we meet our two lead characters. Then John Malkovich is thrown into the mix and you realise this film could go literally anywhere. I always remember Matt Damon's story about Malkovich telling him he was a terrible actor. I genuinely don't know whether the man can act or not (is this the performance he was trying to put forward? - perhaps), but what I do know is that he is never dull to watch.Writer, director and star Clark Duke is behind this film. It's his debut effort on the writing and directing front. It does admittedly show a little, but I would also suggest it isn't a bad first up effort. It is an ambitious project to begin your career with. The story is based on a novel, so he had a little help there. The directing side of things just needs some scenes to be polished a little more and maybe some characters reigned in a little. Otherwise though it is reasonably hard to fault.The biggest crime a film can commit is to be boring, and 'Arkansas' can be called a lot of things, but certainly not boring. It has a strong cast that help guide things along and pave over the cracks. There is a lot going on in the film too and so it never really lags or loses its pacing.

The success of series in a similar vein on TV - Ozark &amp; Fargo are one of the best examples - lurks in the back of your mind as you watch this one.

Fox) works well together, but all of them deserved a much better vehicle to showcase their talents than this. I can not help but worry that L. Hemsworth has already tried an awful lot of lanes and none of them seems to have elevated his work. Also, despite his admirable effort, co-writer/director/actor Clark Duke fails to capture the intensity of the pulp fiction novel, falling into the trap an over-eager first-time film-makers. At the end, Arkansas takes itself too seriously, undercutting its strengths of cast and does not feel complete yet. Film just keeps rambling on and on and ends up feeling slight by a half.

Yet the film Arkansas is a complex web of wannabe hoodlums, seasoned bosses, innocent ladies. and very few outsiders. It's a sealed world that moves drugs while its operatives figure out just who boss Frog is and who will survive.The odd couple, Kyle and Swin (Clark Duke, who also directs), is doing a job orchestrated by the absent and unknown Frog (Vince Vaughn). Because Dixie Mafia Kyle is cool and Swin dorky (miscast Clark, who's a better director than actor), their fates can be guessed as they maneuver the hoods inevitably attached to the dangerous business.The brainy segment of the audience will delight determining who knows what and where the cash is, and the plot will tickle their detective skills. The rest of the audience can be relaxed like Kyle, remote and fearless, letting fate take its course while he figures out his life's arc. Only once are we given a sassy smart character, Bright (John Malkovich), who takes over from Frog. Even Malkovich with his genetic sneer has dialogue unworthy of the master ironist.The dark humor of the script is what keeps it all lighter than you'd think but never Tarantino comedic with its homely menace. When Her (Vivica A. Fox) says she likes boys like Kyle and Swin, who don't get hung up on having a long life, the dark noir peeks through with an unfulfilled promise of bright banter to come.Arkansas characters are not that witty or casually bright. Yet, when Vaughn appears the story crackles, and when Hemsworth gets a chance to philosophize, the better story gleams, but only for moments.Clark is a talented director and writer. Whenever he again tells a dark tale of his home state, he should be ready to stand proudly by the Coens and Tarantino as his own voice, not just theirs in echo."}], "reviews_amount": 162}
