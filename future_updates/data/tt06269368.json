I enjoyed the suspense, thought the acting was decent, but one thing has left me really bamboozled....What happened to the grocery woman who was attacked? Three people playing out the final scenes in her bedroom whilst she sat on on the floor. Did she turn a blind eye to the whole incident? Why didn't she call the police? Did they drag his dad out of the house and wave her goodbye whilst she went back to the shopping channel? How has nobody mentioned this? So confused.

Just a glimpse inside the minds of ordinary people living extraordinary events.Really more of a psychological suspense than a killer-thriller.Excellent cast, some additional intensity would've been good here and there, but I respect the director's vision of this story.So many bad movies out there... this is not one of them."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I really enjoyed this movie.Something I haven't seen being discussed is the role of uncle Rudy.Could it be that he found out about his brother and suffered the consequences?"}, {"id": 4, "text": "I quite liked this film...the two young leads seem like good actors.good story.only real criticism is the ending.....could have been better"}, {"id": 5, "text": "We have all seen many 'is my neighbor a serial killer' films. This one brings the issue to the family forefront i.e. is my dad a serial killer. The cookie cutter, white bread, merit badge driven, church devoted father and son were way fun to watch. Does scout leader dad have a secret serial killer merit badge? The 'clue' fun starts very early on, its exact meaning unclear, and never lets up. Roles played to the 'T' by son Tyler/Charles Plummer a sweet innocent, church going scout, who meets perversion head. From there, things spiral in some beautiful non-predictable directions. Dad Don/ Dylan McDermott is a super savvy macho man, loving dad who might just a serial killer. Introduce the charming Madison Beaty playing Kassi who adds a needed level of mystery to the tale as she also spices up Tyler's life.I am not big on flashbacks but here they work incredibly well. Just when we think we've missed seeing things.... a flashback appears to fill in the gaps.One of the most interesting and satisfying end scenes I've seen in this type of film.

That's not what the makers were going for anyway. The movie is meant to be emotional, perhaps slightly brooding and dreamy, which makes for a different kind of attempt at telling a serial killer story. This will not suit everyone, and those viewers expecting something violent or frightening will be disappointed. I personally wasn't expecting anything at all and, because I immediately cared about the protagonists, enjoyed watching it almost from the outset. But why, oh why did they botch the ending like that???On the plus side, there are a few things to mention. First of all, the fact that the family in question is a Christian one makes all the more believable. Statistically, whenever serial killers do not come from a violent and traumatizing environment, they tend to grow up in loving homes where everything is just too perfect and (from their perspective) bland. They have desires and needs that those around them do not and could not understand. And they learn to keep their violent inner (and outer) life a secret from their loved ones. In time, this becomes an art and they lead a double life: a normal family life for the world to see, and a secret one that only they know about. In their innocence, their family members could never suspect anything. And neither does the son in this movie, and when he does become suspicious and begins to realize that his own dad might well be the clovehitch killer, it is something that he isn't prepared for, simply because neither his upbringing/environment nor his own identity (as a Christian, etc.) could ever enable him to digest such a realization. This brings me to the second positive, namely the performances. The dazed, almost spaced-out expression one sees on the son's face is entirely intentional, because that's the look one would expect to see when faced with an innocent Christian teenage boy. Definitely well-acted. And the chemistry between the two young leads is, in my view, quite palpable, which adds to the intended emotional experience and makes you care about the characters. Once the son finds all that evidence and his father blames someone else (won't spoil this bit), most of us will say: I would not have bought my father's story if he had told me such a thing. None of us, however, are as innocent-minded as the main protagonist, and seeing things from his perspective, it makes perfect sense that he was both gullible enough and so very eager to believe his dad, as such abhorrent behavior wasn't something he was willing to connect to his own family, and if so, not to his immediate one, including his father.As I have already written more than I originally planned, I'll be as precise and concise as I can about why I dislike the ending. Supposing that I were ready to accept the fact that the son was immensely selfish, only cared about his own kin and decided that closure for the victims' families did not matter at all. This would still not resolve the plot holes and illogicality. The first issue is that the girl, Kassi, would have dialed 911 BEFORE joining Tyler (the son), who already held his father in check and at gunpoint. In the event that she had chosen not to do so for some obscure reason, she would not have allowed Tyler to stop her once his dad was knocked out. After all, her own mother was among the victims and she would never have gone against her own character (in both meanings of the word) and accepted a lack of punishment and closure! Secondly, if I put myself in Tyler's shoes, how is the shame of having a serial killer dad behind bars or sentenced to death worse than killing him yourself and having your mother, sister etc. suffer as a result? Not to mention the fact that instead of being seen for what he really was, the father would be remembered as a good, kind and loving husband, parent, neighbor and member of the community. However, the thing that bothers me most about the ending is the intended final victim: I know that the movie states she had not seen the perpetrator's face, but seriously, she would have reported the events to the police! Or are we to believe that Tyler and Kassi left her tied up there so that she would have no idea who the people in her house were? Tyler even calls his father dad in front of her, so she would really have to be in the dark about all of them, wouldn't she. Last but not least, did Tyler's dad also strike himself in the head twice before shooting himself? I mean, he was bleeding from a wound to the head caused by those two blows. How could the police miss that? And don't even get me started on the forensics issue!In short, the movie could have been great for what it set out to be, but the ending is completely preposterous. This is no longer a matter of suspending your disbelief, but one of suspending any thinking and analysis."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I enjoyed this thriller movie. Pretty good acting and kept me interested until the end. What more can you ask for!"}, {"id": 12, "text": "What's sad is that there must be hundreds of such psychos living in America under the guise of normalcy. It turned out to be a brilliant movie, I was skeptical since I don't particularly prefer serial killer films as they often choose to glorify the nurcase as some unique specimen. The pacing doesn't look forced and acting is spot on, especially the young actors. The cinematography is phenomenal and one will have no trouble suspending disbelief."}, {"id": 13, "text": "At times extremely effective, deeply disturbing &amp; uncomfortable to watch, The Clovehitch Killer is a relatively satisfying &amp; well made film that's worth a watch - but it's also a classic example of a movie that doesn't know when to end - dragging out the resolution until you're willing the credits to start rolling; every scene feels like it's setting up the conclusion until it's followed by yet another &amp; you're left impatiently waiting for the crescendo, which is tedious, frustrating &amp; disappointing. However, the performances sell the entire film &amp; there's palpable tension between characters in emotionally charged scenes so the conflict is incredibly well done &amp; regardless of its faults, it's still a good film - despite being unnecessarily long &amp; drawn out."}, {"id": 14, "text": "This was a good movie, but not an easy watch. To avoid any spoiler I am just going to point out the fact that this movie puts you deeply in questioning, in a kind of disturbing way. And that's good. It's not your typical serial killer story here, really it's more like  how would you sort out this high level of sickness... because even as a watcher, well you witnessed it and have to live with it !. This is slow paced, just enough to build this uneasy tension. Thumbs up to the camera work, we get some real artistic framing and lightning here. And also, most importantly, let applause the fantastic acting of the father and son characters. You'll find yourself diving in this with them after just a few minutes. A solid 8 for me. Warning : You may need a drink after this."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Many positive reviews &amp; ratings convinced me that I have to see this. Here's my thoughts: First of all, I wouldn't call this a horror exactly, it does not justify the genre for it doesn't use enough genre-defining elements - there's no gore or scares (I don't mean only jump-scares, duh) &amp; the level of creepiness and suspense in the atmosphere falls short to be called horror. My point is, I was a little disappointed, because, reasonably so, I was expecting a horror movie. The story here brought up memories of the recent Summer of '84 which was similar regarding the plot, but was served in a drastically different style. The story is the most effective weapon that The Clovehitch killer possesses, 2nd most effective being the performances - Dylan really nailed the role of the most dad-ish dad who's secretly a perverted serial killer. As the story progresses, it... does not progress fast enough. There's a thin line between burning slow and dragging, this film went both over and under that line. The on-point cinematography very well accompanied the main story &amp; committed to the creepy small-town-full-of-weirdoes atmosphere. The visual style &amp; vibe really reminded me of the The Strangers - grounded and realistic, yet scary at the same time. The 2nd part of the movie picks up a bit, shows more of the weird stuff you've been expecting for the last 50 minutes, ultimately making it worth for you to hang around. If you like them eerie slow-burns, pick it up and have a blast, but if you are not familiar with them, be careful - you might be disappointed. My rating: 6/10."}, {"id": 16, "text": "I did watch this all the way through, so it merits at least a 4, possibly 5 rating. The concept was intriguing, but the execution was clumsy in that the main character, young Tyler, did not behave in a way that I felt was credible. For instance, he took unnecessary risks snooping around when he might be discovered instead of waiting until there was no possibility of being found out - who would do that? Also, for someone clever enough to figure out who the Clovehitch Killer was, he made some incredibly dumb decisions, but I'll refrain from saying more to avoid any spoilers. There were just too many instances of no people don't behave that way, for me to really recommend this film.On a final note - those of you rating films like this a 10 - think about what that means. A 10 suggests this could be a candidate for an Academy Award. IMDB needs to provide some rating guidance - the only award this movie deserves is a Razzie."}, {"id": 17, "text": "The movie was as good till the end. I honestly don't believe that that girl would not call the police lol ice and let him be tried, humiliated, and properly punsihed. Tjere is no way the lady at the end being tortured ddidnt report or make a serious stink. Forensic science is is too good to not show that angle and distance would not be practical for suicide or gun cleaning accident."}, {"id": 18, "text": "SPOILERS AHEAD!I gave this a go after being recommended it by a friend and after watching 'Extremely Wicked...' and 'My Friend Dahmer' the night before, it seemed fitting to round off the weekend with one more serial killer film.The premise of the monster in plain sight is hardly a new one but what The Clovehitch Killer gets right is the sheer normality of the monster in question here. Don is a normal, loving, God-fearing, Scout leader Dad who hides a despicable side to his psyche; one that manifests itself through his propensity for murder but one that has always remained hidden to the world. In this respect, the film gets it right; here is a man to be trusted by all who know him but who is anything but trustworthy.What it gets slightly wrong is that when Don finally reveals his true, horrendous colours (long suspected by his son) via his actions, the evil of his character isn't quite realised. Even in the very act of murder, the monster that the film promised isn't fully delivered. This guy is pure evil, sure, but I didn't celebrate his downfall the way I should have. Ultimately, I didn't care enough about him getting caught and I wasn't suitably moved by his son's act of redemption to feel like the film had done its job.The Clovehitch Killer is well scripted and written, thoughtfully portrayed and realistically acted. All the required pieces seem to be there to make a fine film but somehow, it falls short. This is a good movie and it's worth a watch but something is missing. Something needs to tie the film together and it isn't there. Maybe a clovehitch knot would do the trick."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I thought this film was well done.

Think mildly tense and entertaining and you'll have a great time."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Alfred Hitchcock once said I bring murder back in the living room, where it belongs. Yes, I'm 56 and I've have seen many may thrillers and horror movies in my life. Believe me when I say The Clovehitch Killer does justice to the great thrillers Hitchcock made long ago. This is not a cheap slasher but a slow burner, where we as the public, know something the killer doesn't know. This provides the movie a very tense and claustrophobic feeling from the very beginning on. This production is based on a well thought through script that works like a cat and mouse game. Some scenes have this wonderful dark violin music, very elegiac, lamenting over dark and unknown stories. Please see it, everything is just perfect in this clever made movie, its very worth while."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Dylan McDermott provides a phenomenal performance but that is the best part of the movie. The story moves slowly though the storyline feels original. The ending is unsatisfying too. Different editing could have made a more concise film and possibly heightened the only somewhat tense moments. The upside was the fact that, unfortunately, this may be a fairly accurate portrayal of the life of a killer."}, {"id": 24, "text": "This was a great movie that portrayed what a serial killer would be like living a life of normalcy. It reminded me a lot of the BTK killer (who lived not too far from me) in that the Clovehitch killer was a family man who ran the scout club and was loved by the entire community, seemingly making this an incredibly weird and creepy film for me. The kids were great at playing their parts, especially the boy and had me feeling all sorts of emotions with him. The whole film was tense and left me on the edge of my seat. The ending was great as well, and I loved the part when they showed the scenes again leading up to his son showing up to his dad's last kill, except showing it from the kids' view. It was a bit on the slow side and not entirely action packed as one would hope, but it was one that seemed to get into your head a bit. Overall it was a great one to watch."}, {"id": 25, "text": "This film is pretty straight forward. All the evidence is laid out for the viewer. Now my main issue with this film are the two teens. The believability of their actions is just downright ridiculous, more so for the girl. I could see the son being tricked by his father but when the girl goes along with him it's just pretty ridiculous not believable. You'll see what I mean during the climax.And the ending. Oh God the ending made me lose any connection or sympathy for the characters. It's selfish and disgusting. Yes they deal with the problem but to leave a huge crime like that unsolved, continue to portray the father as a pillar of the community, and leave literally a dozen families with zero closure? What were the filmmakers thinking here? Also, those actions go completely against what the girl in movie was all about. She completely abandons everything she's done in the film with contradictory actions. I found the film completely frustrating and lacking any sense of realism."}, {"id": 26, "text": "This might sound weird, but this was a refreshing take on the serial killer genre. The momentum throughout was calm, sometimes a little slow but always engaging.

Very good film with excellent acting, thoroughly enjoyable."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Half decent film, terrible ending. Massively based on the BTK strangler.

Some of the acting (not Plummer) was a bit suspect, and the build in tension was mediocre at best for a so called thriller.Nonetheless a different take on a serial killer story that is worthy of a watch if you have nothing better on your watch list. I can see now why there wasn't a whole lot of hype for this movie.6/10"}, {"id": 30, "text": "This movie has much going for it. Everything feels very calculated.

I found this to be an overall suspenseful movie, that is, at least for the first 50 minutes. The rest seemed a bit unnecessarily drawn out and I found myself fast forwarding several scenes. Dylan McDermott is as brilliant as ever and his co-stars, even the younger and less experienced ones, are surprisingly able to keep up. There's one sub plot that bothered me a bit in that it wasn't ever fully addressed or resolved: I wondered whether the wheelchair-bound, brain damaged uncle possibly found out about his brother's extracurricular activities and threatened to expose him? Did Don then decide to kill his brother just as he had no qualms to attempt killing his son in the final scenes of the movie? Personally I would have also liked to see a flashback. How did this start for Don? Why did he choose this particular MO? Why did he start killing again after such a long time although he's harming himself more than anything by it?

See! Christians are evil! It's to the point, where if any character identifies himself/herself as a Christian at the start of a movie, it is guaranteed that character will be evil.

Also they had no reason to be religious.........It's just there"}, {"id": 36, "text": "I'm surprised to see the relatively low rating (6.5 at the moment I write this review). In my opinion this is an interesting and strong movie, especially taken into account the slightly worn-out theme of discovering that someone in your near (family) circle is in reality a serial killer (it reminded me for instance very much of Stephen Kings short novel A good marriage that was made into a movie in 2014). The theme is handled here with much skill and intelligence, due to an inventive narrative approach, that helps to keep the suspense up, in spite of the fact that we early in the movie already learn who the killer is. The acting of all the major characters is top notch, especially Dylan McDermott and Charlie Plummer are very convincing: McDermott as the self-righteous and condescending father who intimidates but also in a sleek way beguiles his son, and Plummer as the naive, gullible son who has to cope with the conflicting loyalties to either the church and his father, or to the truth and justice.I do not agree with some of the reviewers who felt that in this movie religion was (yet again) made into the source of hypocrisy and mental disorders (up until psychopathic and murderous behavior). The acts of this father were in my opinion purely based on his individual character and had nothing to do with religion (or with opposition against it). The religious believes of the son and the mother were dealt with in a very respectful way and it was poignant to see how the young son in the last scene of the movie has apparently found a way to keep up being true to his faith and his fathers public and personal legacy, whatever we may think of the decisions that he has made.I also don't agree with the many reviewers who criticize the ending of the movie, i.e. the definitive way in which Tyler and Kassi choose to deal with the father, as if this was a too unrealistic or too easy solution by the director. I guess every other solution, for instance (probably the most correct one) handing him over to the police or letting him walk, would have seemed just as easy or unrealistic. The one that was used here at least gave us much to think about afterwards, which is not at all a bad thing in a movie."}, {"id": 37, "text": "This film is utterly atrocious. Bad writing, bad characters, bad pacing. I couldn't tell what era this film was set in, because of the oddly religious almost 1950s characters, the flip phones that characters have, and so much more.

The main characters of this film makes bad decision after bad decision. I was hoping he would die by the end of the film. There are so many positive reviews for this film and I am dumbfounded.

Again, I must add that it is very predictable, yet not dull nor slow, it moves accordingly to its genre and it goes out limping sadly.Room for more? You bet yeah!

No trailers, no synopsis, no cast members, no nothing. All I knew was the title of the film, so naturally I assumed there was going to be a killer (likely a serial) somewhere in the mix. Then the opening shot of the film was a man leading a Boy Scout class and I thought to myself that man has killer written all over him, but surely the opening shot isn't going to be of the killer? That's way too obvious. What it was though was the beginning of one of the best performances I have ever seen in a regulation thriller. Dylan McDermott made this movie everything that it is.His performance was gripping from the start and it never let you loose. We the audience don't know the answer to the mystery for most of the movie. We are as in the dark as the characters and so we get to make our own conclusions and assumptions. McDermott's performance gives a lot more clues than people will realise on first viewing. Just the little things like when he is trying to tell his son that his uncle is the killer, he is looking up and to the left (a telltale sign that someone is lying). The movie is riddled with little details and hints like this and that is what makes this such a great film.I also loved the non-linear story telling method. It added another layer to the film in the final thirty minutes that was just the icing on the cake for an already great film. The film takes a very sudden turn at around the 3/4 mark and I haven't been as stunned watching a movie in a long time as I was in that moment.

That's it, that's what happened to her. Clovehitch knocked her out and tried to suffocate her with a bag until Kassi removed the bag, making it completely plausible the woman was entirely knocked out while Tyler and Kassi were there and Clovehitch did conceal his face until she was already out. I found this movie to be entirely captivating and well done from start to finish, my only qualm with it is that they didn't turn him in and instead faked his suicide. While it may have helped the Burnside family to not be forever scorned because of the father, only Kassi ever got some sort of slight justification for her family and her loss.

Instead they are more about community service.The children have been brought up that way, and the father has a big influence on the children. That is why the son does not want to believe his dad could be a serial killer, but he consists in being curious and persistent in his search for the truth. You could feel the suspense between the father and son whenever they were together. Just try to imagine that you found out that your dad is a serial killer. What would you have done? Pick up a gun and shoot him in the face?Also the part where the movie switches focus on the dad when he is by himself, getting dressed up like one of his victims but eventually gets frustrated because it does not satisfy him. Clearly he is struggling with his urges.By the end when the dad breaks into this woman's house is very real and scary. This is how easy someone could break into somebody's house and manipulate that person into believing anything he say's.There are parts in the movie where there is no music, which adds to the realism. In real life there is no music when someone is torturing somebody.

Also are we supposed to believe a couple of minor really got away with all that without being seen or questioned or anything???

I thought she was dead but according to what the girl says at the end she's not. The girl say she didn't see the killers face so she can't ID him, but that doesn't stop her from coming forward with all the sh*t she heard and did see, she wasn't deaf!!! Plus if they were trying to cover up the situation how did they let the woman go or get her to help without her seeing them in the first place?This ending was just really sloppy and messed up a movie that I was actually really enjoying. I just don't buy that innocent teenagers decided to be cold blooded murders when they had other options. Plus they don't explain what happened to the victim at the end well at all.

And was raised by someone who wore a mask. And feels conflicted. And that's what sets this movie apart. You see him struggle with curiosity that soon gets the best of him.

And less is more as the end result successfully blends thriller, mystery and family drama into one. I loved this movie for all of these not-so-easily blended elements.For those who ask what happened to the final victim and how did she not reveal her assailant? Well, to you critics I say you weren't paying attention. While there are some minor leaps in logic required to make the final narrative work, in the end the story is tight enough not to fall apart under its own weight of pathology and consequences.The performances of all were consistently strong but the standouts were the sweet-creepy and odd boy scout dad, McDermott and the mysterious girl-next-door loner turned girlfriend, Madisen Beaty. But again, the entire cast was solid if not excellent. Honorable mention goes to Samantha Mathis, who in a minor role as Mr. Burnside's (McDermott) wife, allowed us to see spousal codependent behavior at its worst with almost no exposition.Overall this was a great ride in the slow-burn thriller genre.

Mid-movie it looks like the editor quit and the intern took over, hoping to pull of an original reverse storyline... but failed doing so.

The names of the characters in this film are all changed (The director said he wanted to avoid giving any attention to Rader, as he feeds off of it) but all the events are basically the same to their real life counter-parts. Dylan McDermott turns in a chilling performance, and is almost unrecognizable with a gut and glasses.

You need to start the movie by expecting a Psychological Thriller, not a Slasher flick. By doing that, you will be able to really appreciate the film. To describe the movie, I'd say it is an original idea in the aspect of showing the point of view from the son's eyes. But also has aspects of Disturbia, Rear Window, Bone Collector, Secrets In Their Eyes, and Criminal Minds tv show. It might be a little slow-paced, but that helps you develop sympathy for each character (which I appreciate). Each character has true depth and the actors are phenomenal. The only thing that makes me knock off a star is the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending is satisfying in regards to the outcome of the perpetrator, but I think it would have been better if they staged the death with a confession note (that way the case could be closed and the victims' families can have proper closure). That's the only thing that was off, but besides that, it was a great film! Would totally watch again. Oh... and I see a lot of people writing that they are confused about the grocery woman's outcome. They actually DID mention her later towards the end that she survived and wouldn't be able to identify the perpetrator. Someone must have discovered her after they dragged the perpetrator out of the house to stage the death.

They really took their time to build the killer based on real serial killer stories and their motivations, and I enjoyed that. It's all there, you just have to look. I also loved the setting of the film and the look of it, the soundtrack though was forgettable, I wish it was a little more distinguishable and memorable.It's a little slow, but I'd still recommend this film.

The unfortunate misunderstanding that nights gets him ridiculed and with no one close to turn to he turns to an outcast girl and slowly the story becomes more tense and disturbing.It's an interesting idea and handles its story very realistically. What if one of your closed ones had a secret you wish you didn't know about? Would you seek justice for the victims you know nothing about? Would you seek for an explanation or even believe the evidence someone is feeding you and trust them over the words of your close one?The story is about that confusion, the shattered reality of everything the protagonist knew about his close ones. We may not understand his viewpoint or his thoughts, which is precisely why the outcast girl is there for us. She isn't just in for the thrill or for bringing the killer in for justice. She's out there for revenge. It's a lot easier for us to step into her shoes. We want to see the killer being brought down. Her question at the end This is what you wanted right? we can see the doubt and regret on our protagonist's face.In the end, he could have done it differently and exposed the killer, but that would have harmed his family more than he wanted.

No, there is no justice in the end. He indeed should have payed for what he has done and it is dissapointing he didn't and never will.

The father and Tyler burned all the evidence and I am assuming Tyler thought this would just ruin his mom and sisters (and his) lives in such a small religious community. They did what they did for his familiys sakes. I don't know if I like the way they ended it... But I can at least see the screenwriter's thought point and I can appreciate it.Other than that, I found the slow burn of the movie very well done. It was tense and it really made me wonder what I would feel like in Tyler's position.

Not a monster a but monster with a human face."}, {"id": 176, "text": "Movies usually either ask us to fear or celebrate killers, but rarely see them as people who could be our friends and family members. the Clovehitch Killer is disquieting because it asks us to do exactly that - to visualize that the man across the pew from us at church, our scoutmaster and even our father could be a monster.Tyler Burnside (Charlie Plummer) lives with his devoutly Christian family in Kentucky, in a small town whose residents have been haunted for a decade by the murders of the Clovehitch Killer. Our protagonist claims that he never really thought all that much of those crimes, other than being part of the ceremonies to celebrate the victims. One night, while attempting to sneak out and kiss a girl in his father's truck, he discovers a torn up piece of bondage photography. This isn't a Playboy thrown into the woods. It's so upsetting that the girl cuts off their dalliance and starts rumors in school that the photo was his.This discovery leads him to explore the places that his father - all-around family man Don Burnside (an incredible Dylan McDermott) - has kept hidden. This isn't rooting around in your parent's room looking for their copy of The Joy of Sex or a copy of Behind the Green Door (I'm dating myself and also presupposing that your parents had great taste in adult film). What he finds are explicit bondage-heavy magazines that look like Richard Kern shot them. And worse, a Polaroid of a woman. Her name leads him to hunt through Google, a late night search that leads his mother (Samantha Mathis) to believe he's merely masturbating. If only things were that simple.Tyler's church and scout friends have kept him at arm's length since the rumors of him being into BDSM started. He finds a friend in Kassi (Madisen Beaty, who was in The Master and will show up in Tarantino's upcoming Once Upon a Time In Hollywood), who is absolutely obsessed with the Clovehitch murders - for a reason that pushes the film toward its harrowing conclusion. That said, if you're living in a boring small town, I absolutely endorse hanging out with redheads obsessed with murder. I married one, after all.On a camping trip, father confronts son about what he has found and claims that the real killer was Rudy, who up until now we've only known as a vegetative man in a wheelchair. The guilt of the murders caused him to try to kill himself by wrecking his car. Again - if it were only so simple.There's a narrative jump right after this scene that's completely jarring. In fact, it's so out there that we considered just turning the film off, as we've become used to the moments where modern thrillers inexplicably lose steam and go off the rails. This feels like that and I don't want to spoil it, other than to say you'll know it when you see it.I'm pleased to report that we stuck with it and this becomes a movie with no easy answers or resolution. That's pretty much how real life is, with no clean endings, just moving past things and hoping to survive until the next day.Obviously, this film is inspired by Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer, who also created collages of sexualized images, was a scout leader and seemed to be a normal family man. Writer Christopher Ford (Clown, Spider-Man: Homecoming) and director Duncan Skiles (who directed Ford's The Felt series, as well as the stand-up specials of Reggie Watts) have taken that real-life story and created something that feels just as real.This movie pretty much escaped notice when it was released last year, but I'd recommend it, particularly if you love true crime stories."}, {"id": 177, "text": "Definitely heart riveting.

Don't expect to be amazed but you I'd be shocked to find someone who would regret seeing this film.It is very rare that I don't find flaws in a film and this is one I couldn't come up with any. While this film doesn't break new ground in cinema, it is a perfect film on a technical level. The acting was perfect even down to the child actors which is so rare for me to not be completely annoyed by a child actors performance.Every actor made their characters believable and there wasn't any scene chewing. This was a methodical suspense mystery film and not a fast paced thriller, but it never becomes dull. The dialogue was all realistic with no stereotypical portrayals, and Madisen Beaty Kassi was one of the best female characters I have seen in a long time. She is a breath of fresh air to me.I appreciated that the film leaves certain things left to speculate on but ties up every major plot point nicely so not to feel like anything is unanswered. Also my girlfriend and I both were happy to see a film about a killer that targets women not do it distastefully or get rapey for shock value. So for those who want to know, there shouldn't really be any trigger scenes like in a lot of movies that touch on these subjects.The story is nothing original but it hits every note with perfect pitch. *********Possible Spoiler below here**********I really felt like this was a fictionalized telling of BTK and if so, they did a fantastic job portraying a serial killer that not many films really attempt."}, {"id": 186, "text": "I wanted to like The Clovehitch Killer more than I did. Many ingredients are there for an interesting movie. I think the direction is the key flaw here. It doesn't take its premise as far as it should have, to really make you feel something. It seems to approach some fairly uncomfortable viewing, but never make good on it.Dylan McDermott, the centre of the movie, is really its best part. His performance is chilling and confounding. The character of his son and his snooty gal pal don't really do enough. The investigate the titular killer, but you don't see enough of how they really think and feel. Nor is there enough of a look in from the mother character, who, doubtless, would have a lot of pain.Family, in most cases, is a web of secrets and lies. This movie could have been about more than a killer who's also a family man. It could have been painfully relatable. It just isn't."}, {"id": 187, "text": "I found this movie to be uneven and oddly paced, although it does feature some fine performances by the two male leads. Tyler (Charlie Plummer) is a Boy Scout and part of a fine, upstanding, church-going family. But he's slowly come to believe that his dad Don (Dylan McDermott) might be the infamous Clovehitch Killer, a man who terrorized the town ten years ago. Don is a Scout leader and a pillar of his community, so surely he's not a deviant and a murderer, right? The evidence might suggest otherwise. It's really a lot of fun to watch Dylan reconcile what he's discovered with his necessarily conservative, suppressed worldview. I mean, it'd be one thing if someone a little more wiser in the ways of the world were to find this stuff out, and it's a whole other thing for someone like Dylan, whose community is very straitlaced. Helping Dylan reconcile these two opposites is the town pariah, Kassi (Madisen Beaty), your standard girl from the wrong side of the tracks who's long followed and researched the Clovehitch Killer. But is the killer (named for his preferred type of knot) dormant, or is he planning to kill again? The answer won't surprise you. I did have some issues with the movie. First, it felt like the characters came off as mildly irritating, whether it was the joking, just kidding mentality of Kassi or the super-religious, overbearing stance of Tyler's mother (played very well by Samantha Mathis). Second, the final act of the movie just lost me, as the plot took a sharp turn into the land of unforeseeable but implausible - so although the ending wasn't very predictable, it also wasn't satisfying and left me cold. There was, I'll point out, a neat little narrative trick in the second act or so that is very well done (by director Duncan Skiles and writer Christopher Ford) and more than held my interest, only to jettison said interest a few scenes later as the denouement approached. Still, a high-quality performance from McDermott key role as Tyler's All-American Dad."}, {"id": 188, "text": "This was on my watchlist for a while; and I'm mad at myself I didn't take the opportunity to watch it sooner.Incredibly engaging, more so than expected. The little nuances and attention to detail in the character building, the cinematography, the script, and the score are outstanding. The little references towards Dennis Rader (the BTK killer) were perfect.The first and second act do an incredible job at building the tension, and slowly unveiling the plot. I was worried the third act would fall short - as is the case with most modern horror/thrillers - but the third act of this film is arguably one of the best of the decade. The way the story is wrapped up, and the film completed leaves no need for a sequel; a bold but very welcome move.I'd love to see more from this director in the future. In the meantime; I'm sure this film will see many re-watches from myself. One of the better movies I've seen this year."}, {"id": 189, "text": "The Clovehitch Killer is a new mystery thriller directed by Duncan Skiles, the director of The Last of the Great Romantics and Our Robocop Remake.Tyler (Charlie Plummer) and his father Don (Dylan McDermott) form a neat family, respected by the rest of the village of Kentucky. Both are, for example, members of the local boy scout association and they help and visit the local church every week. Their village only has a bad history, because ten years ago a serial killer brutally tortured ten women and eventually killed them. The identity of this serial killer has still not been traced in these ten years. When traces reappear that match the traces of the unknown serial killer, Tyler decides to investigate with his new girlfriend Kassi (Madisen Beaty). During this investigation, Tyler learns the truth about the identity of the serial killer. This discovery turns his whole world upside down, so Tyler no longer knows who he can trust.This film is very simple and cheap. This is because the director and most of the cast are more unknown or beginning people in the film world. The film looks like it was made by film students who first put together a film. In addition to being simple, the film also comes across as faint and long-winded, which means that the tension quickly diminishes.The scenes where the serial killer goes, for example, are very unclear in the picture or his actions take place behind any object such as a bed or cupboard so that the viewer cannot see what he is doing to his victims. This is probably only done to get rid of the scenes in a simple and cheap way or because people were unable to portray this in a more credible way. The promotion of the film actually also gives away the identity of the serial killer. This is fortunately not very disturbing, because it is actually easy to guess who this serial killer actually is. The film also contains many horror clich\u00e9s, which have appeared earlier and better in other horror films and especially slashers. Scenes where the serial killer, for example, sneaks through a room of his next victim, look a lot like scenes from the slasher film the Strangers.It also seems as if the film is set at the end of the 1980s or just at the beginning of the 1990s due to the clothing and lifestyle of the characters, but despite these things, the characters use smartphones a bit against the rest of them the film enters.Apart from Dylan McDermott and Samantha Mathis, the rest of the cast consists mainly of unknown and starting actors, which unfortunately can be traced back to the level at which they act in the film. Because of this lesser acting, the film is also difficult to take seriously."}, {"id": 190, "text": "Serial killers don't stop, that's what a small town in the united states believed when a notorious serial killer, known as the cloverhitch killer, stopped killing for a decade.

I really didn't know much about the movie going in, but the early reviews were strong. Overall is was a meticulously a well-crafted slow burn of a psychological murder mystery. I enjoyed it!The initial premise of the movie is fairly straightforward. A teenage boy begins to suspect his father is not all that he seems as the son begins to investigate the history of a string of murders that occurred in their small town. Along the way the film perfectly plays with the viewers expectations and provides ample elements of suspense and drama with a few twists thrown in for good measure. The film turned out to be quite smarty written and really had a number of very tense moments based completely character interactions.The film is very light on gore but makes up for this with a thick and atmospheric plot that relies heavily on suspense. Half way through film the movie becomes almost a character study into the mind of a serial killer. Similar to Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer the movie really pulls back the curtain and shows you the inner workings into the mind of a serial killer and the dual lives they must live. Despite a low body count the movie still managed to make a very unnerving and realistic depiction of a sociopath.I was very impressed with the director all around. While the plot may have seemed simple at first, the film really did a good job misdirecting its audience. There were a number of scenes where I was on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next while others were so thick with tension. Also the acting in the movie was all around very well done. The two main leads of the film really sold their performances.The movie relied heavily on atmosphere to craft a realistic and stark picture of a serial killer. The movie was certainly not action-packed and had a very slow burn pace that required quite a bit of patience and dedication. This is not the kind of horror film for someone expecting a slasher or a traditional serial killer film. This was very much a psychological horror film that may be a turn off in our modern hyper violent horror culture. A 8.25 out of 10."}, {"id": 194, "text": "In a refreshing take on the serial killer subgenre and in particular, a very loose interpretation of real life serial killer Dennis Lynn Rader, commonly known as the BTK Killer (Bind, Torture, Kill), director Duncan Skiles is at his best as he invites us to view a slice of Americana without exploiting the issues he depicts.When Tyler Burnside's (Charlie Plummer) life is rattled after finding evidence leading to the discovery that his father; the outgoing, community leader Don (Dylan McDermott), may be the notorious Clovehitch killer (named after the telltale knot which he leaves at the location of each victim), he and his outcast friend Kassi (Madisen Beaty) begin a search that may unravel young Tyler's life to its core.The plot glides over the small Kentucky town both eerily and quickly. As a drama and suspenseful mystery, The Clovehitch Killer remains consistent until its second act where the POV shifts and the movie becomes a true nightmare.Without the use of gratuitous blood, Skiles relies on the story's built-in-suspense to create the mood. In the same mode that Summer of '84, perpetuates a feeling of terror as adolescence and innocence is lost, The Clovehitch Killer, at its core is a story about Tyler more than it is about a killer. Strong acting by Plummer, McDermott and cast carries the film more than its actual script.In choosing to inform us rather than dwell on the facts, Skiles tactfully holds back on sharing his own opinion regarding the tight-knit, Baptist community his characters live in. The Burnside family is devout, somewhat trapped in the 50's and display a slight awkwardness toward each other, however they are also a loving and outgoing family that possesses a lighthearted side, which shines through.If you are a person who finds it hard to suspend your disbelief, the middle and end of The Clovehitch Killer may become a little more than you bargained for, especially after its strong first act. But if you can go with the flow, you will find a clever film that is satisfying to the most hardened horror fan. I'm quite frankly surprised this film didn't get a stronger release."}, {"id": 195, "text": "The Clovehitch Killer Directed by Duncan Skiles and written by Christopher FordThis was a recommendation from my friend Mike Smith and from the Red Letter Media guys of which I am a big fan. I'm a big fan of both Red Letter Media and my friend Smitty. This was a really solid movie. It takes turns that you're not really expecting. You think you have everything figured out from the beginning. But nope we switch point of views and then switch them back.This is a somber film that lives in the banality of the suburbs. It gives you time to get acquainted with this Christian family. They go to church and they play games on family fun night. They are Christian to an obnoxious level. The main character's supposed best friend is a d-bag of the highest order and when they finally have a fist fight over the outcast girl obsessed with murders in particular the Clovehitch Killer, I was so happy.The outcast girl and the main character are under the belief that the dad is a serial killer. But how can that be? It is a procedural where the outcast and the boy are looking for clues where they might find out the truth. Then it switches to the routine of the clovehitch killer. You're turned for a loop for a minute. You're still hooked into that damaged mind. You find the answer the girl and the boy were looking for. They answer the mystery rather early in the proceedings and then it puts you in the shoes of the killer. There's a saying about the banality of evil. How ordinary these depraved things can become. This movie revels in that. It also plays with reputation. How the neighbors perceive you is just as important as the truth in this particular community.I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It takes a premise that could have been tired and worn out and turned it into a compelling story. It has excellent performances all around from everyone and it really digs into your skin and the skin of the characters. I give this movie a B."}], "reviews_amount": 196}
