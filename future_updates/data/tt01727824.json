We all Loved it! I heard Queen music as I worked and raised my 4 children, but never really knew the band it came from. My children Lived with Queen music, and totally identified with them, especially in their band performances. My grandson heard Queen because his father played it all the time. We saw this movie as a family and the movie was about family, friends, and loyalty. The typical band movie is about rising-to-fame, falling-from-fame. This movie is about hanging together as family, as loyal friends ..something we Really need more of today!! The 2 :15 time frame flies by and you're left wanting more...more... more... Rami Malek is awesome as Freddie! He, his 3 co-stars, last director, music director, and entire crew deserve nominations! See this in a theatre that has great sound where you can appreciate the depth of the music! One of my most favorite movies in 75 years!"}, {"id": 2, "text": "My wife and I both enjoyed this immensely. We are Queen fans and attended the tribute concert a after Freddie died.This film is extraordinary, first and foremost, for Rami Malek's performance. The physical resemblance is only a small part of that. He had Freddie's body language down to a tee.But the crowning glory is the vocals. They are absolutely mind blowing. I don't know how they did it, I'm assuming it's Freddie's voice. The lip sync is flawless. If it's Malek singing, the Oscar is in the bag.I've heard there are some negative reviews floating around. I find that astonishing. I hope Malek gets at least a few nominations for this. He should get multiple awards."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I dont know how to elaborate more than this.

Whilst Freddie's life and death are quite well documented, his inner turmoil is not - this movie opens this up for all to see, and highlights actions and individuals who had a large influence on his fragile life, both good and horrendously bad. If only he could have been happy with the knowledge that he had one of the best singing voices, if not THE best, that ever fronted a rock band. Rami Malek does a wonderful job of portraying him, and in so many ways has captured his mannerisms to a tee. Loved it, and listening to the music in an IMAX auditorium was brilliant."}, {"id": 6, "text": "For those of us of a certain age Queen, and especially Freddie, defined us. Sitting through this movie I had goosebumps. The casting just works and watching the actors playing May and Deacon you'd be forgiven in thinking someone had access to a time machine. Even Kenny Everett was instantly recognisable. I left this movie a strange combination of elated and terribly sad. Elated to hear the music, watch the story and yet sad that Freddie was so desperately lonely. Ultimately, I think Freddie would have approved of the whole thing. His genius and flamboyance shone through. Truly brilliant."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Wow. What a truly inspiring film. Made me feel that being eccentric and different is ok as long as you are you! The film brought so many emotions - laughter, sadness, joy - very heart warming. At times I forgot I wasn't actually watching the guys from Queen - they all looked so like them - especially May and Mercury. I thought Rami rocked the role. Massive respect to this guy! Would happily pay to go back in and watch it again! My film of 2018!!!!"}, {"id": 8, "text": "Quite simply the critics are wrong!

Bohemian Rhapsody will be a film that goes down in history and so it should; it is a phenomenal cinematic experience"}, {"id": 12, "text": "I don't think I've ever been so excited to see a movie, EVER! As I'm sure many of you my age will say, I was brought up listening to Queen by my dad who was a huge fan. One of the only times I ever remember my dad crying was when Freddie died. That love for Queen has been passed on to my little boy, so off we went (a little disheartened, I might add, following the critic reviews) to watch the movie. Ten minutes in, my little boy turned to me and said , 'mum, I love this already' The film has you right from the get go! I honestly don't know what movie those critics saw, but it can't have been the same movie. At times I forgot I wasn't watching the real Queen. I laughed. I cried. I got goosebumps. I cried some more. I absolutely loved every minute of it. The cinema was packed out and as the credits drew, the audience clapped and cheered; something I have never experienced at a movie before. Do not be put off. Just go! If you have kids, take them too!"}, {"id": 13, "text": "I am clearly in the minority, and do not understand the love for this movie. The story jumped around entirely too much. It didn't build up the relationships or people. What could have been an amazing biopic fell short. It scratched the surface and never went deep in the storyline."}, {"id": 14, "text": "It's not Rami Malek's fault. Let's make that clear. He comes through with a fittingly outrageous performance and should be commended, especially considering all the mistakes taking place around him. His prosthetic teeth are cartoonish, but he pulls them off just fine. He also pulls off the voice, the posture and the curious wandering eyes that that make manifest his burgeoning sexuality that slowly becomes clear to him.'Bohemian Rhapsody' the movie's greatest problem is that there is no clear message or meaning. It's intentionally eclectic and mixed, but this concept works much better for the song than it does for the feature film. It never quite reveals what it's meant to say. If it only meant to pay cutesy fan service to the adoring Freddie Mercury and Queen fans of the world, then it's a job well done. If it meant to offer any other sort of statement about sexual expression or friendship or the creation of music, then it's mostly a miss.The movie's greatest failure is its insistence on submitting constant winking in-jokes about Queen. When Mike Myers' music executive character says that no one will ever sing along to Bohemian Rhapsody while riding in a car, we all chuckle. Or, at least, we're supposed to. The crowd around me certainly did, but I just rolled my eyes. Moments like are not as clever as the filmmakers believe them to be.The other greatest failures come from an inability to make moments believable. The lip syncing could be overlooked (even though it's awful) because no actor can reasonably be expected to make that perfect, but it's the director's issue for not choosing alternate angles to hide the mouths. Worse than the lip syncing is Freddie's relationship with his father. Dad is a classic conservative who disapproves of Freddie's lifestyle (the singing more so than the homosexuality, we're led to believe), and that's the entirety of their relationship until the cringeworthy resolution near the end. It's not even worthy of being considered manipulative because it's so weakly executed.Another thing: did Freddie really not know he was gay until Queen had been a smashing success for years? Everyone else seemed to know and accept it. That seemed to be a bizarre choice of the writers.If you love the music and absolutely adore Queen, you'll probably like this movie. But if you look to poke any holes at all in film itself, you'll spring a few dozen leaks. Freddie deserved better than this."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Just watched Bohemian Rhapsody with my wife, my 16-yo daughter and 14-yo son. It's quite simply one of the best movies we've ever seen. Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury is phenomenal and worthy of an Oscar. The other actors are great too. The music is naturally magnificent. We're talking of Queen after all... We rated Bohemian Rhapsody 10/10."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Wow. What a brilliantly made film. Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men) has walked a sublime tightrope of a wonderful engaging, funny and emotional film without turning it into a turgid Hollywood smarm fest. Rami Malek is of course the star and his performance as Freddie is uncanny. Most of the vocals were Freddies originals but he does attempt some of his own,with commendable success, and you quickly forget it's not actually Mr Mercury himself. Unlike some biopics the music itself does by no means fall by the wayside and there is a multitude of Queen classics crammed into the just over 2 hours running time. And with Roger Taylor and Brian May as the executive music producers for the film expect nothing less. I was pleasantly surprised as to how much of the movie was dedicated to the music and if I wasn't in a cinema I would have spent half the time air guitaring and singing at the top of my voice. Of course we have a lot of the film dedicated to Freddie and his declining social life, behavior and ultimately health, and this is handled with so much respect and emotion that at no point does it seem forced or uncomfortable. The film follows a classic rise, fall and rise again formula culminating in a final fist pumping, rousing half hour which sees the band bust out (what some say is) the greatest live performance of all time as they re-emerge for Wembleys Live-aid concert. Realistically the film won't go down as an all time classic and may not be up for any Oscars (except for Maleks performance maybe) but what we do get is a barnstorming, foot-tapping, heart pumping movie which for me is without a doubt one of the greatest Music biopics ever made. Go see it."}, {"id": 17, "text": "I heard the movie was bad but still wanted to give it a try. Besides a Queen fan, I am also a huge Beatles fan. I am the kind of dad that gives his 10 year old kids 'The Story of the Beatles' in comic version as a present (and must read for 'general education'). This movie felt like I had just read the story of Queen in comic version. The wikipedia page of Queen translated in Disney style pictures on the white screen with a tribute band and a dental prosthesis as lead actors. Awful!"}, {"id": 18, "text": "I'm not just a hater here to hate. I am a massive Queen fan and have been as long as I can remember. The problem with this film, is it simply isn't the story of Queen. Without going into details that would spoil the film for any of those who haven't seen it, almost nothing that happened in the movie actually happened to the band and Freddie. I love Queen and I love Freddie Mercury, but I am truly disgusted at the way this film branded itself on preserving Queen's legacy when all it does is stuff falsehoods into a fictional retelling of the band's history. If you liked this film as a film, that's one thing. But, it is in no way, shape, nor form, the story of Queen. Hopefully Sacha Baron Cohen will someday get the chance to make the historically accurate account of Freddie he hoped to make. In the meantime, I guess we'll just have to deal with this Disney-style nonsense."}, {"id": 19, "text": "Half the movie wasn't true or the time frame was out of sequence."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Yes it's mildly entertaining but what a missed opportunity. A one dimensional Wikipedia of Freddie. Could have been so much more. No exploration of the political climate, social and business pressures dictating 70's pop icons unable to be open about their sexuality and the impact it had on their mental state. George Michael, Elton John and Freddie to name but three."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Inaccurate exploitation of Freddie's talent. Movie was made with the other members of the band but they did not give much accuracy to the events. Which is really a shame and shows they are trying to squeeze everything they can out of Freddie's talent."}, {"id": 22, "text": "The film is probably OK from a music point of view, but is simply a disaster in filmmaking aspects. The editing is a mess. There are some scenes connected quite awkwardly, and the transition of the central figure Freddie is quite rigid. The character development is highly problematic as well. The supporting roles are flat and one-dimensional. The storytelling is too direct and takes a lot of shortcuts. Most of the dialogues are not well-written.In one word, the film could have been much improved if a professional director and screenwriter had been hired."}, {"id": 23, "text": "The movie itself is just OK, not spectacular in any way. The lead playing Freddie is too short, too toothy and acting too hard. But what bothers me the most is the history and facts.They have John Deacon as member of Smile. They have them performing Fat Bottom Girls 3 years before it was written. They have a Brazil concert on TV in 1977 that didn't happen until 1985. The band is shown recording We Will Rock You in a scene set in 1980 when the song came out in 1977.Did the members of Queen even screen this?"}, {"id": 24, "text": "What about the other band members? was a question I must have asked myself fifteen times throughout the film. The narrative follows Freddie Mercury, who is an irresistible badass, but completely flattened all the characters around him, including (but not limited to) all three band members, Mary, and all of the record label guys. Side note: RIP Mike Myers' career. He has fallen so far, playing a (fictional) douchey record exec with a questionable accent who passes on Bohemian Rhapsody because it's too out there. That abysmal performance is emblematic of the entire film, which disappoints in almost every way. Rami Malek portrays an emaciated, pitiable Mercury with a checkered past and some alluded-to sexual exploits. His primary qualm in life is that he's lonely and doesn't feel loved. Idk if this is actually true... The whole emotional scope of the film seems faked, and it upsets me that it's so hard to tell when this biopic is making facts up. What a waste of opportunity.Not having grown up in the eighties, but still quite a big Queen fan, I did NOT get a sense of the impact of Queen's meteoric rise to fame, their overall influence on rock music, nor Freddie Mercury's absolute genius. Instead, the lead singer came off as a flamboyant diva who whipped out hits at convenient times; and the rest of the band mates were so 1-D that, literally, any fights between the friends were solved by... Wait for it... The power of rock n roll. Wtf?The picture was, in reality, so much more complicated, with drug addiction, philandering and gobs of money influencing these musicians. Instead, people acted like a bunch of children reading an inflated do-gooder script. Why, Hollywood, WHY must you make a mockery of life as we know it? It seemed to try to avoid the trope of most musician biopics that play up the common problems for artists on the road, but in excluding those conflicts, the film became superficial and boring. It tried too hard, sadly. Tbh this movie could have used more explicit drug use, gay sex, and WAY MORE LIVE QUEEN!! But I do have to give four stars for the delightful anesthetic, the wardrobe, andddd the ample use of Freddie Mercury's actual voice instead of Rami Malek's. But still, you're better of watching Highlander for a fuller Queen soundtrack.I'll be checking out a proper documentary on queen next!"}, {"id": 25, "text": "If you're making a biopic, learn the chronology. 70 to 74 to 78 to 76 to 81 to 77 !!! If you know Queen PROPERLY this film is appalling. If you like the Adam Lambert version of Queen, you'll probably love this crap."}, {"id": 26, "text": "I grew up with Queen and am a huge fan. This movie was an insult to the entire band. Irritating and disappointing to watch. The story line concentrated on Freddy and the directing was really really bad. The acting wasn't anything to write home about either. I spent 2 hours waiting for the movie to hit the mark and it never did. Such a tragedy of what could have been a brilliant movie about a brilliant band. A complete waste of time and money."}, {"id": 27, "text": "For a movie that's supposed to be a biopic, there was far too much embellishments and alterations to the truth. Everything from the firing of the manager to the addition of Mercury to the band as well as his diagnosis was vastly different from the reality. The movie was less about facts and more about creating a more dramatic fiction. In this hot mess, some people's names have been dragged through the mud when they actually did no wrong.Greats sets and accurate costume designs are a small compensation for a corny movie that irrevelantly rewrites history under the guise of poor scripting and mediocre acting.Hopefully the positive reviews are merely hype at its peak, and that people will look back on this movie in the future and realise it was all hot air. The critics were dead on correct about this movie after all."}, {"id": 28, "text": "I swear if Rami doesn't get an Oscar for this role, I will be done with movies forever. This movie was so brilliant, nothing dragged, there were no boring parts, no looking at my watch wondering when it'll be over. This is a must see. Even if you're not a Queen fan."}, {"id": 29, "text": "More like stars in your eyes than a biopic. Incredibly kitsch and painfully wooden, this film is hugely underwhelming and does not do the memory of one of the greatest showmen ever to grace this earth, any justice whatsoever. The highlight of the, otherwise dull and painfully slow film, is the very well made Live Aid finale. Using the original audio recording of the Wembley performance provided a much needed lifeline to a flailing film adrift in a sea of mediocrity. Dreadful acting and an even more limp screenplay. And did Freddie really have teeth like Tim Nice-But-Dim?Save your money. Stay at home and watch the gig on YouTube. Very loud!"}, {"id": 30, "text": "What a movie!!! Wanted to get up and sing. But then I couldn't because I was crying...!! Congrats to the maker!!!"}, {"id": 31, "text": "It's an okay movie to watch if you have no idea who Queen, however, lower your expectations. This seems like another disrespectful Hollywood attempt just to make money andThe same way that last airbender movie could have been directed way way better, this one is the same: Good story with a big potential, badly written, badly directed.The movie tells very little about Freddy's personality, or anyone's, which leaves it on a very superficial level.The actor looks like Freddy, imitates his moves but missing his energy. Hearing Queen songs sung worst than the originals in a movie theater wasn't a joy neither."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Excuse my biased opinion (being a massive queen fan) but this cast portray the band and Mary Austin superbly. I understand the movie took ten years to make, something to do with disagreements between the director and Brian May/roger taylor!!!Well let me tell you this, it was well worth the wait. The amount of studying and research these young actors must have did is clearly testament to their performance in this phenomenal story of the greatest band ever to grace the earth.Without spoiling the film, all I can say is that a certain record producer must be gutted or certainly would have been. Definitely two and a quarter hours of your life you will never forget. By far the best film containing music about a life story I've ever seen.An absolute must watch folks"}, {"id": 33, "text": "Rami is an excellent actor, but casting him in this role lacked the physical prowess of Freddie. Also, the teeth prosthetic seemed to disturb Rami's speech, much mumbling. A lot of the rave reviews here seem to be based on sentimentality rather than objective criticism."}, {"id": 34, "text": "You may enjoy watching this movie, until You realize that most of the facts and chronology is distorted and both band and Freddy strongly whitewashed. What's left is just another sentimental blockbuster.Rami's performance is just outstanding though."}, {"id": 35, "text": "The music is great, Remi's performance was amazing, and the recreation of the Live Aid show was exhilarating to watch, but I have two issues with the movie. One, it was not really a biopic on the band, because we dont get any background on the other band members besides Freddie Mercury. They mention wives and kids, but we never see them or find out anything about them. We don't get any info on the other band member's lives when the band started, like we did with Freddie, other than the mention of dentist and neurophysicist.The second problem is that Freddie's issues seem to happen and then resolve so quickly they are glossed over. Freddie's father is clearly not ok with his lifestyle but suddenly seems proud of him and hugs him as he's headed out the door to perform at Live Aid, as if everything is ok now. His drug and alcohol problem doesn't seem to be such a problem other than he shows up late for rehearsal and the other guys are annoyed. There are a lot of things that should have been covered that likely just couldn't have fit in a typical movie length production, but there are so many good stories that weren't included.Anyway, it's completely worth seeing, the music is great, and Remi WAS Freddie Mercury. The performance and concert scenes were creatively well-shot and fun to watch. Just wish that more of the rock and roll lifestyle and history of the band could have been built into the story."}, {"id": 36, "text": "This MIGHT have made a great fantasy film...IF IT WASN'T BASED ON REALITY, A REALITY WHICH IT CLEARLY MOCKS!!! I can clearly see now why Sacha Baron Cohen separated himself from the making of this biopic and why it was turned down by other directors and writers. PURE FANCY. EVERYONE KNOWS the kind of life Freddy Mercury lived and the things he did, this is a fanciful attempt by the other members of Queen, all of whom are largely inconsequential in comparison to Freddy, to save face and present a pleasant PG13 fiction about them. GARBAGE. Avoid at all costs or accept as pure fantasy if you like."}, {"id": 37, "text": "Disappointment. That's the word floating through my head after watching this movie. As a casual Queen listener I wasn't very familiar with the band members or with Freddie in particular, except for the obvious - that Freddie was a flamboyant performer, was gay and died of Aids. And after watching this movie I can't say I now know a lot more about Freddie than just that. Yes, I do know now that Freddie actually had a girlfriend before coming out of the closet and that he was a very lonely man - something portrayed very good in this movie. But there is just not a lot of depth in the character. And don't even get me started on any of the other band members. I feel like I only got to know their names.This movie just jumps from one significant moment to the other. Oh, now Queen is recording this popular song. Oh now Queen is recording that popular song. Oh, now Freddie is suddenly gay because he looked a trucker straight in the eyes. There's just not a lot of story going on. It all feels like fan-service. And that's the conflicting thing about this movie. I did enjoy watching it, but looking back I realized that that's mainly because of the killer soundtrack. And to me, that's just not enough to make a good film. I also felt like the editing was a bit over the top at times. When showing just regular conversations there were cuts every second, which is just annoying.Fortunately, the soundtrack isn't the only good thing about this movie though. There's some cool camera movements, it has some humor and Rami Malek is great as Freddie. His costumes were as crazy as you would expect. My favorite part of the movie however is the final Live Aid performance. It's acted great, the music is fantastic and at times it's even emotional. The fake crowd was a bit distracting though. But even though it was my favorite part, I can't stop thinking about how it was also kind of unnecessary, which may sound strange. I mean, if I wanted to see the Live Aid performance I would just look it up on the internet and watch the real thing. The filmmakers could have used those extra 15 or so minutes to actually create characters and an engaging story. It's a shame, because now were left with an empty shell of a movie. A movie with potential, but a bad execution. Queen deserves better."}, {"id": 38, "text": "I wanted to love this movie I really did. I was blown away by the first scene of the film and Malik's likeness to Mercury. Sadly, after this I grew even more disappointed. The way they have written this is so formulaic and boring unlike Queen's ethos. The whole thing just seemed like a Hollywood adaptation to the story and a money making opportunity.Freddie Mercury was a fascinating character and to try to understand him we had to have an insight into the way he lived his life. Unfortunately with the age rating of the film there's no way they could do that. They've exchanged reality for a Family-friendly movie and it really misses the mark."}, {"id": 39, "text": "I like the music of Queen. I was hoping to see a biopic and learn something about them; especially seeing that Taylor and May are behind this. Unfortunately, like in art, truth has been sacrificed for image. What we have is the sanitised version I guess they would have us believe. Problem is, we were there. It did not happen they way they were telling us. This film, then, screws with your mind, and leaves you wondering if what you know is true actually was how you remember things. (And thanks to proper research, history vastly outweighs this version of truth.) But what is truth? Queen are awesome. Mercury is a legend. The music will live on. Perhaps for musical entertainment and experience, they should have made We Will Rock You, and stuck in a rockumentary as an extra on the Blu-Ray. I guess management are happy with the truth they are trying to sell us; but as an audience member who lived through those times, it's leaves you slightly dazed, slightly confused, and slightly unsatisfied. Get acting, costumes and production values though; cast and crew certainly gave 100%."}, {"id": 40, "text": "Loved the movie, but then looked up what was factual and what wasn't, and learned much of what was depicted in the movie never happened. I found this really surprising because two members of Queen were involved in making the movie, so I'm surmising perhaps they needed to agree to altering/making up events in order to get this movie made. I realize movies need to move along and there are also time constraints in telling a story, but (although not billed as a documentary) I'd have much preferred a more accurate (rather than made up) version of many events of Freddie's life.Love Rami's performance! Big, big fan. So enjoy him on Mr. Robot. He absolutely knocked it out of the park with this performance. Other cast members were all excellent as well. It really felt like one was actually watching Queen on the screen, rather than actors. That's how believable they were! Immensely entertaining script although, again, I just wish they had told true, factually accurate stories rather than making several up.Can't believe how they recreated both the Live Aid venue, as well as the performance to a T. That was really mind blowing, but really wish they had included all the songs Queen performed at Live Aid. Believe me, no one in the theatre would have complained about the length of the movie if they had.Audience clapped at the end to show their appreciation. It was pretty awesome, but then disappointing to then learn so many events depicted in the movie either never happened or happened in a completely different way...STOP READING HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW SOME EVENTS THAT NEVER HAPPENED OR HAPPENED IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY.Freddie was already living with the guys in the band before he became a member. He didn't meet them for the first time after a performance in a club.Freddie didn't meet Mary the night he met the band.The character of Mike Meyers never existed. Thus, the entire very amusing scene depicted in his office with the band never happened.Freddie never quit the band. The band mutually decided to take a break and then mutually decided shortly thereafter to resume recording and touring.Freddie did not reveal to the band his AIDS status shortly after getting back together, just prior to the LIVE AID concert. He disclosed it later on.The band actually toured for a few months prior to LIVE AID, while in the movie it was depicted as LIVE AID was to be their very first performance together again as a group and they were concerned about how their performance would be since they had supposedly JUST gotten back together and felt they might be rusty.Freddie didn't meet his eventual male companion the way it was depicted in the movie.Freddie was bi-sexual and had encounters with other women besides Mary, though the film dipicted Mary as the only female he had ever had a sexual relationship with.The film chose not to give a realistic portrayal as to the extent of drug/alcohol/sex fueled life Freddie led - though that part didn't really bother me at all.These are just a few instances of made up scenarios that never happened as dipicted in the movie as having occurred. It seems it would have been very easy to more accurately tell Freddie's story and still retain the entertainment element."}, {"id": 41, "text": "This movie has brought out so many feelings, all of them i think.

The guy playing deacy though not given lots of lines had him just right too. I was hoping for a bit more of the Freddie 80s NY gay clubs that he used to frequent regularly. But as I spotted Freddie's sister at the premiere then it's obviously got the family blessing and so I can see why that's not a major part of the film. It's very difficult to span the 15 years in a couple of hours and there where a few fast forwards. I would have liked to have seen some of the years up to Freddie's death as I know the band became very close indeed. But maybe that's something the band didn't want to explore. I did come out if the cinema with a lump in my throat. One of the clear things to take from the film and real life is Freddie's life long love for Mary Austin.

No, Brian May and Roger Taylor simply couldn't let go of the gift that keeps on giving, and they have since milked the passing (the so-called dead star factor) of their gay icon frontman (who never came out publicly) relentlessly. First with a tribute concert to raise AIDS awareness (while Mercury and his bandmates had constantly denied rumors about his illness until one day before his death), followed by a seemingly endless stream of previously unreleased albums and new variations of greatest hits collections plus live gigs with new lead vocalists. Too much love will kill you, but too much money apparently won't, right? At least bass guitarist John Deacon displayed some measure of decency when he officially retired after the tribute concert. A biopic was the logical next step in May and Taylor's cash cow approach, and the movie had to be streamlined to be as profitable as possible, which didn't sit well with Sacha Baron Cohen, who had originally been picked to portray Mercury, so he had to bite the dust.And for me it's not just the multitude of historical inaccuracies (which have been listed in many reviews all over the media, so I won't mention them here) that ruin the movie, it's also the casting of Rami Malek. Malek looks (or doesn't look) as much like Mercury as a black chihuahua dog would resemble the original Lassie, with Malek's bulging eyes a permanent distraction throughout the flick; and whereas Mercury even in his younger Queen years never looked like a boy and always had an almost malicious sparkle in his eyes, Malek comes across like a little kid with a bad wig (again, no resemblance to the pre-mustache Mercury's hair style) and a ridiculous set of false teeth who's trying to impersonate someone way older and more experienced. Just imagine Malek trying to play Mercury in the middle part of the infamous I want to break free video clip, in a tight bodysuit - impossible, right? (But that highly controversial sequence is not part of this movie.)And while I have to admit that I have really no idea about the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences's criteria when it comes to handing out Oscars, I think that the trophy for the best actor in a leading role should not go to someone who has only delivered some kind of impersonation. Okay, it most likely wasn't Malek's fault that his role didn't require anything deeper, and if he had raised his concerns about his character's sexuality, he would have probably been replaced, just like Sacha Baron Cohen before him.But May and Taylor never had any intentions to show the world the real Freddie, someone who, according to his biographers and a barrage of youtube documentaries, almost defiantly kept on partying, etc., in spite of the AIDS scare, until the terrible disease eventually caught up with him. So instead of something that could have ended up being art they produced a string of re-enacted music videos for the typical fanboy/-girl, with a long lipsync finale at the end, Queen at Live Aid. My advice: watch the original on youtube, and while you're there, check out some of the Mercury documentaries, they're much better than this shameless cash grab."}, {"id": 57, "text": "A thoroughly enjoyable two hours spent wallowing in nostalgia, I can understand why it has been such a commercial success, remi malek is great in the lead, still wouldn't be my choice for the Oscar though, been better performances this year in my opinion, Steve Cogan for stan and Ollie for one, but he was good, the film, while fun, felt like it sugar coated the obviously flawed genius and very strange real Freddie, I truly think it is the music that makes the film, the last 15 mins especially, in my opinion there have been better films in the last 12 months that are more original and interesting and far more Oscar worthy, blackklansman, stan and Ollie, and the badly overlooked leave no trace, but as an enjoyable evening at the cinema celebrating the life of a British icon and his music it is a good evening out"}, {"id": 58, "text": "Overall damn good movie.

The timelines don't mesh with what really happened or in the proper chronological order but that doesn't take away from what is a good if toned down storyline. The music is the central theme as much as Freddie and they do a great job with it.

I was dragged along with the family, and as someone who grew up singing every lyric to every Queen song as a child, I was blown away by how brilliantly the movie was conducted, and how cleverly the Director took our emotions up and down.

Freddie Mercury joins the band 15 minutes in and he's an instant celebrity. The rest of the movie is about his celebrity status with his band in the background.Where is the conflict?I'm sure that the longest argument in the movie lasts only 2 minutes before they give in to Freddie Mercury. He resolves a long issue with his parents with a quick introduction of his boyfriend. His antagonist gives him up with ease. Everyone, in the end, agrees with Freddie.The band never faces a real crisis and everyone gets back together without fighting. Exciting.Even the antagonist doesn't give a convincing performance.

I was totally captivated and in the moment for the whole journey and you will find you will be too - the acting is so engaged - I am sure these characters are still with each of them.

The way the story is told is excellent and I fully appreciated the focus on the Live Aid concert.

He simply lacks the physical presence of Mercury and doesn't dominate his interactions in the way that i would expect. I would have loved to see the original casting choice Sacha Baron Cohen in this role as I think he would be a much better physical match.The special effects, sound editing and interlacing of performances are incredible, with the Live Aid scene being comfortably the most memorable aspect of the film.

Maybe being a Queen fan set my expectations too high."}, {"id": 117, "text": "For those of you who were Queen fans and didn't like Bo Rhap because of the factual inaccuracies, you have to realize that this movie wasn't made just for you. This movie was made to bring the story of Freddie, but mostly Queen's outstanding music, to every single generation in the world, simultaneously. For some, it brought on nostalgia, while for others it was completely new territory or even brought on a new appreciation for the band. Other than We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions playing at sports games, the younger generations have likely never heard of Queen/their music, so they wouldn't even be aware of any factual inaccuracies, and I doubt they would care much if they found out. (This is the case for me. I'd heard and loved about 6 Queen songs throughout my childhood but didn't know anything about the band, let alone that all those songs came from the same band. I was born a month before Freddie died in 1991, and for my entire life I'd never even heard of his name...until I saw this movie.)Yes, some of Bo Rhap's content could've been handled differently, especially regarding Freddie's sexuality, but 1) this isn't a documentary, it is a Hollywood movie that was intended to be appropriate &amp; enjoyable for all audiences and 2) at the end of the day, the thing that will always keep legendary bands like Queen alive is the timeless, universal MUSIC. Music has a beautiful way of uniting people and bridging the gap between people from all walks of life, and this movie managed to do that perfectly. When Queen is banging out We Will Rock You at Madison Square Garden or We Are the Champions at Live Aid and you have chills and you feel like you're in the audience, it reinforces the feeling that we can all feel a part of something bigger than ourselves, and reminds you exactly why those men were geniuses.I understand why this movie was made to focus on Freddie more as a musician rather than a promiscuous guy who liked partying and cocaine. What good would that stuff have really done other than glorify that kind of lifestyle? Take Rocketman as a good comparison... that movie is saturated with an overzealous amount of both glam and pain/addiction, and it ultimately fails to figure out its tone. The darker side of it just feels so incredibly overdone and I came out of it knowing nothing more about Elton John other than him having a tough childhood and becoming an addict, which we've already come to the conclusion is a very tired biopic cliche, as many have said. It didn't move me or turn me into a fan of him. Bo Rhap gave us enough information about Freddie's struggles in order to sympathize with him, but it wasn't aggressively thrown in our faces in a way that distracted us from the fact that the reason we even know about all these famous people is because of their music. That is the thing that made us fans and will keep us fans. Also, let's not forget that Freddie was an extremely private person, and his bandmates even said that after 20 years with him, he was still such a mystery to them. Therefore, diving deep into his sleazy lifestyle without much background info on why he did the things he did (i.e wounds from childhood) would've been useless and gratuitous.As for Rami, he was incredible as Freddie and 100% deserving of his Oscar! Man..he REALLY did his homework! I really can't understand why the Rocketman lovers who enjoyed Taron Egerton's version of Elton John feel compelled to tear Rami down for what they say was Rami impersonating Freddie. Freddie was a very unique man with a very unique look, speaking style, mannerisms, and idiosyncrasies, especially regarding his teeth and lips, and one simply cannot play Freddie in a half-assed way. It just wouldn't have worked, especially because Rami already had a strike against him by not looking very similar to Freddie (until the mustache and short hair in the second half of the movie). Taron was able to pull off doing a version of Elton because of the fact that he already kind of looks like Elton, he had a good enough voice to sing, and because Rocketman is a musical fantasy with a very different approach to storytelling than Bo Rhap.It's about time that people calm down with the hate toward this movie. It's getting really old at this point. Rocketman is in no way perfect but people are letting the fact that its very gay (and proud of it) distract them from seeing its very obvious flaws.My final words here are that Bohemian Rhapsody was a absolute delight to watch! Besides the top notch acting and music, the costumes, production design, and editing were all so great! While watching it I felt like I was living in the 70s and 80s for those 2 hours and got to experience the excitement and joy that all the fans would've felt back in the day when they first heard the records or attended the concerts. I am now a very big fan of Queen and Rami Malek, and for that, I thank the filmmakers!"}, {"id": 118, "text": "Everything looks polished and, of course, the soundtrack is spectacular, but it's tough to get excited about passive storytelling and a supporting cast that's, frankly, quite boring. I kept wondering if Brian May and Roger Taylor, the two original band members participating in the production, were too involved in how it played out. It's Mercury's story, of course, but the rest of the group is handled with such kid gloves that it's almost laughable."}, {"id": 119, "text": "The story queen to their most famous song. Rain Malek did a fantastic job portaying Freddie Mercury and his life and he does deserve that Oscar.

There is not a single boring moment in this movie!!! Every scene, every shot, every bit of dialogue has been executed magnificently. I'm not sure about the accuracy of the biopic and I don't care. Some complained about the lack of Mercury's sexuality being discussed. Not everything has to be about LGBT just because the man was a gay icon. He was more than his personal life and I think that was also a side point of the film being made the way it was. This serves as a medley and snapshot into Freddie's progress into stardom and what Queen became from hardly anything. Best movie of 2018, it maintains a special place in my heart so much that I went twice to the cinema to watch it and it still didn't feel like enough viewings.

The voice and mannerisms are on point and I hope an Oscar nod is coming his way. He portrays the loneliness that many geniuses feel. And the need to belong even though you have millions of fans.It also shows how far we've come with society's views of homsexuality and how far we have to go still. Again though a lot is the press. Luck at how they rounded on Elton john, George Michael etc. Freddie may not of wanted to be a poster boy for aids but his dignity showed you can be a sufferer without being a victim.The rest of the cast were great. From the tragic relationship with Mary to the equally tragic one with Paul prenter. Queen themselves are solid performers without stealing the lime light.The music scenes as well are great.

I then find myself, perhaps a week later, stuck at the theatre with Bohemian Rhapsody as the only non-Grinch movie playing for the time I was there. So I walk in, and I'm like I bet I won't be able to take this seriously. Boy was I wrong. This movie had me up and down, surrounded by the utter glory I had never before recognised as Queen. It was a masterpiece. I mean perhaps it wasn't the intellectually stimulating sort of movie I so snobbishly only watch, but it was amazing. If my boyfriend weren't there, I definitely would have cried. This movie had immersed me in a perspective I never knew, and a band so magnificent and deserving of its glory that I could barely understand how I hadn't recognised them as the revolutionaries they were.

They respectfully show enough tidbits of his inner demons and pain to make one remember-AH, yes, he was out of control, but kept the emphasis on the music, the band, the relationships, the feeling. You don't need to see more, you get it. The LiveAid ending of this film will be remembered as one of the greatest movie endings of all time. No kidding, we were clapping, arms in the air, gasping in disbelief, crying. It was truly a moment. Of course it MAY help if you were of age back then in '85 and actually saw it happen.

As a die hard queen fan and of course of freddie himself i cant stand Maleks portrayal of him.. first of all he dont have half of the charisma that freddie did and to be fair he is to darn ugly in the role, not that freddie was all that pretty but he looked lightyears better than malek did in his portrayal and to be honest, freddy was a gay symbol and has been for centuries but malek is too gay, he is almost pathetic. He looks missplaced in almost every scene of the film.. i think macho is the word that describes freddie the best but for maleks portayal he falls flat and i cant understand why both paul and bryan said that it was almost like freddie was still alive, they of all should recognise the big differses between freddie and malek.

The story and script concerning all band members are highly accurate, but the acting of this script is what REALLY hits the nail on the head in portraying their personalities; extremely convincing.

Music was always important in my life when I was growing up. I loved the 1950's musicals and my sons played Queen records when they were young.

You have to go some in order to make a dull film about Freddie, but they have managed it. Remi does an amazing job, its just the same they couldn't create a film worthy of his talents. The clue is in the rating of the film...a 13 rating for a man who lived an X rated life. The film lacks tension or drama, of which there was plenty in Freddies life. But Brian and Roger should benefit from increased sales of Queen albums as a result, which I am sure is why they made the film.

Me, I'm not so sure but then again I wasn't there, and even if I did watch it, I was too young to remember, except that I was made to go to be by my parents because I had to get up and go to church in the morning, and while I did catch a glimpse of the Phillidelpia set the next morning, they seemed to have more pressing issues than me watching a rock and roll extravaganze. Hey, at least my parents let me watch some of it, so that is saying something. Well, the story is pretty interesting, though to be honest with you, it really isn't all that much different to what you would get from the story of most other rock bands. You know, sex, drugs, rock and roll and all that, or at least where Freddy Mercury is concerned. In fact it seemed as if the other members of the band were actually a lot more straight laced than Freddy, having families and all that. Yet Freddy is the face of the band, the guy who is basically an entertainer, and boy did he know how to pull off a stage performance. I guess that is why Adam Lambert fits in so well with what remains of the band these days (John Deacon has basically called it quits, though Roger Taylor and Brian May still travel about). So, while the movie is about the band, in many ways it is also about Freddy. A guy who probably didn't fit in all that well with the people around him, namely because everybody saw him as a Packie, yet from that first performance when he stunned the university crowd, to that day at Live Aid where he literally stunned the world, there was a guy who really seemed to be able to live it up. Yet it is also a story of how many of these rockers live fast and die young, and comparatively speaking, Freddie did die rather young, namely due to the aids virus, which is kept secret from the world until the day before he died. Mind you, that last album of theirs, Made in Heaven, is pretty depressing, as a friend, and a big Queen fan himself, admitted. I guess with me A Kind of Magic was probably their last great Album, though The Miracle did have a couple of good tracks on it, as did Innuendo. In fact, I believe the Kind of Magic tour was basically the last tour that they were able to perform, with Freddy really entering the final stages of the disease - back in those days it didn't matter how much money you had, Aids was a death sentence. Yet I'm sure that Freddy hadn't taken the moustache look when they had written We Will Rock You, and sure enough when I go to You Tube and play the original clip he hadn't. The other thing was that there was no mention of the video clip that they had produced to promote their song Bohemian Rapsody, and honestly, from what I have heard, that song actually propelled the whole idea of the video clip into the main stream - before that it was just bands playing on live studio sets. Look, I'm going to say that I did like the film, but in the end, despite me being a huge Queen fan (even though I only own two of their albumns, and one of them is a Greatest Hits Album - where did all the others go), this is still basically a biography of a band, and the only reason I went to see it was, well, because it was Queen."}, {"id": 257, "text": "I'm 45 and I am Queen's fan.

We both sang, laughed, cried, sang... all the way. Younger crowd arround us wasn't singing, but everything else was there in the air! Great film makers did really excellent job and I hope that most people decide to watch and appreciate it. Because they will enjoy it!

I left the theater and said to my wife, that is one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and that was maybe the most fun I have ever had in a movie theater. I was so entertained throughout and came out of the theater with a new found respect for Freddie Mercury and all of the members of Queen. They are all very likeable characters and the acting was phenomenal. Go see this movie."}, {"id": 264, "text": "As far as I'm concerned, this is not a biopic or a documentary. This is a CELEBRATION of Queen and Freddie Mercury, arguably the best rock band and singer of all time. This movie was made with the blessings of Brian May and Roger Taylor. Enough said.To some of you film school students and graduates, you're missing the point. And don't assume I don't know anything about the industry. Of course liberties had to be taken to reduce this story to 2+ hours. Of course it's not word-for-word perfect. WHO CARES?? This was a movie made for the fans! Were things skimmed over? YES. Was the dirt buried? YES. I don't believe we needed to go down the rabbit hole in order to understand what this film is about.I grew up with Queen. I was fascinated by all of the members of the band. I was mesmerized by Freddie. Queen's Live Aid performance left me breathless and emotional. I wept when Freddie passed.Soooooo, let's fast-forward, shall we? When I originally heard a film was being made, I thought, No way. It can't be done . Then all the hoopla about who's to portray Freddie, etc. Then the decision to cast Rami Malek.  REALLY?? , I thought. Boy, was I WRONG. About EVERYTHING.Off I go to the theatre with my son and his lady (they're not kids) on November 2nd. Then the film started...... And I went back in time....I got my own personal peek at the highlights that molded this great band. I saw Rami Malek channel Freddie Mercury. Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello become Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon. Lucy Boynton's touching portrayal of Mary Austin. And I felt as if I were THERE, if only for a moment. Liberties be damned!!By the time the Live Aid sequence was shown, I was SOBBING. No, not shedding a tear or two, but outright MOURNING. In the original Live Aid performance, there's a brief moment where Freddie walks to the side of the stage for something, and one of the camera crew caught the true essence of Freddie. The REAL Freddie, showing the most authentic smile and utter happiness on his face. I remembered this as the movie ended, with Don't Stop Me Now as the outro. My son and his lady left as the credits were rolling, and I stayed. I needed to pull myself together. I'm glad I stayed. Suggestion: Don't leave before the credits are over!!I believe Oscar nods should go to: Best Score; Best Costumes (some of which are authentic); and Best Actor (Rami Malek)This movie made me eat my words and warmed my heart. Thank you, Mr. May and Mr. Taylor, for sticking to your guns and making a beautiful film. I came home from the movie and immediately ordered the soundtrack (wonderful!), AND the BluRay. Who cares if there's no release date yet?I am forever grateful to Queen.

It is also not a Freddie Mercury movie, this is a Queen movie! And it was an absolute privilege to see how some of my absolute favorite songs were created. All in all, this is one movie to watch that will make you feel nostalgic, excited, sad and incredibly happy. If you're not a Queen fan, believe me, you will be!

They pushed boundaries and believed in each other and what they were meant to do, which was inspire and play music for the people. They engaged in a way no one did at the time and this movie is a perfect example of showmanship and living for the dream. Rami Malek did a great job of ghosting Freddy, because he really came alive through him in an almost eery way.. I loved the fact that they used Freddy Mercuries real vocals, Insteae if giving Rami the impossible fast, as no one can sing like him, full stop.

His performance as Freddie was absolutely incredible, and in the end where they re-enacted Queen's segment from the Live Aid concert, it did not feel as though I was watching an actor play the part of Freddie Mercury. It felt like I was watching Freddie himself, and for that I am truly grateful.I cannot in any way, shape or form fault this film.

It's actually probably the first movie that I finished in theatre - I sat to the very end, till the very end of the title roll (Even heard the cleaning lady say that after this movie they don't have much cleaning to do, audience is very well behaved) In terms of Oscars: best picture - nope. Best actor - definitely yes. Malek was a great choice, did a fantastic job. It seems like he is not doing much, he is not to forcing his own Freddy and that works wonderfully. He looks very realistic, he manages to be Malek/Freddy - both, not too much into the role to become a parody, but well enough to be very believable. I think it's great. He simply shines in this role. And yes, it's a movie about a character, but others doesn't shine that much. Even if this is a biography movie, I somehow missed some interesting camera work/director's decisions, something unexpected (not something as outrageous as Loving Vincent, but something unique, some twist, something that would make biography movie stand out in terms of making it - now they just let Malek shine (and bathe in his light)) - there was a moment of a split screen, but that's about it. And the whole story was more or less linear. Live Aid scene was aaaaaamazing. Will definitely see the records, videos, it seems it was hell of an event. Also there were loads of discussions that AIDS and his orientation weren't properly addressed in the movie - I liked it. F. Mercury wasn't his disease or his orientation - he was the music he made, his passion was to create, but that's still up for the discussion. So... What did you think?P.S That first scene, when he is working in the airport and is called Pakistani and explains he is not, and when later Paul, in some talk show says that he knows Freddy so much and that he always was a Paki boy was great"}, {"id": 293, "text": "BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY (2018) ***1/2 Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Allen Leech, Tom Hollander, Mike Myers, Aaron McMusker.

During the Live Aid performance when Freddie's former wife teared up during the song We are the Champions so did I, the passion that Freddie had for it simply undeniable and at the same time heartbreaking because we don't have singers like him today who feel the same about music.Not only did Rami deserve the Golden Globe award but he and the film itself deserve an oscar.

HOW ON EARTH could the producers ( Executive Producers May and Taylor i should note )get them performing songs on a tour that were written 7 years later??? It makes me think Messrs May and Taylor just added their names for the accolades.It also hinted at Bohemian Rhapsody was a coming out song ...IT WAS NOT!!Some people have mentioned Oscars...which is of course ridiculous...for me an opportunity missed.Listen to the Greatest Hits album instead.

Fortunately, my worries were wrong and I enjoyed it a lot.

Each part of his life is told and explained without being excessive, especially in those aspects regarding sex, drugs and illness.

Touching till the line I left cinema in tears and had cried through most of the movie. Insaw men sheading tears. Definitely must see in a lifetime movie, especially if you're fan of Queen. Regardless the storyline - highly criticised how Freddie's life, especially after coming out, was represented; personally I don't find it anywhere close to critic's opinion - film is worth just for the music. Remarkable performance of Rami Malek deserves Oscar and I am sure to see him on the list of nominations. He inhabited Freddie to the point where Ieven started to think of him as Freddie.

I didn't want it to end."}, {"id": 366, "text": "Being a fan of many genres of music, and my obsession with the life of musicians, makes every movie like this, which tells the stories of bands and artists, very exciting for me. Being young, I never saw Freddie Mercury live, and have only really seen him in footage from concerts and short snippets of interviews. Yet, from them alone, the clear confidence and the fiery, showman like nature of Freddie Mercury, made me believe, that being yourself, and thriving under that, can give you a huge chance of being successful.Going into this movie, I had heard a lot of things about how this movie failed to show the flair that Queen and Freddie Mercury possessed. And that the changes of director and cast members meant that this movie didn't have the identity that a movie about Queen needed.However, I felt that it was quite the opposite. This movie told the story of how Queen rose and peaked, with many set backs along the way. It also showed how important each member of the band was, in grounding and supporting fellow members when needed.A story that had the right tone was key for this movie. There were scenes that were were over the top in some moments, but it worked. The loud, glistening perfomances worked well against the sometimes quite life of these artists. So the odd eccentric moment gave the sense of duality that a movie needed. The success of this movie was mainly down to superb performances across the board. Rami Malek was incredible as Freddie Mercury. Incredible. His ability to portray the duality of Freddie, the fiery showman like nature that I mentioned before, on stage and in front of any type of crowd against the slightly subdued man, that hid when he was confronted emotionally. Rami Maleks emotional timing, and superb use of body language meant he dominated the screen every time he was in shot. This performance was supported fantastically by the other cast members, who all made this movie seem like a documentary.Being a musician, this movie constantly inspired me. Especially the sequence where the band made Bohemian Rhapsody, my favourite Queen song. The transition from the intimidating first world tour, to a quiet country home, with just the band made me made me feel part of it. Followed by a sequence that showed a band that feared nothing, and one that wanted to test the industry. Incredible film, once again driven by impeccable performances, making it feel even more real.A must see for everyone, especially those who need inspiration, and a confidence boost. All helped by the infectious vibrant aura, that came from Rami Maleks Oscar worth performance As Freddie Mercury.My only complaint is that there wasn't enough!!!"}, {"id": 367, "text": "This is the best movie I have seen in a while.

Rami Malek's research into Freddie and all his mannerisms paid off in an epic performance. There were parts that were missing to do with the bands struggles and the last 7 years of Freddies life, but that is to be expected within the time frame of a 2 hr movie that attempts capture the period of his life as lead singer of Queen.Overall a fantastic, captivating movie much like the protagonist himself."}, {"id": 373, "text": "With a great plot line, cast Choices, and a quality music, this is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.

The casting was astounding, the performances (especially from the four actors representing the members of Queen) was superlative - It is proof positive that you do not need explosions and car chases to have a truly memorable movie experience. I want to see it again, and again and again. The film brilliantly depicts the troubled life of Frederick (Farouk) Bulsara as he tried to understand who he really was, The time-line is not accurate, but so what!

The critics were wrong in 1975 when they first heard Bohemian Rhapsody, and they're wrong about it now. Admittedly, the movie offered little to no elaboration on the backstory of Mary Austin, Brian May and other significant characters, but BoRhap is the story of how a poor Pakistani boy went from working as a baggage handler to being the lead singer of one of the biggest rock bands in history. I suppose this may be due to the inherent disinterest of director Bryan Singer and how he continually disappeared from set on days end. There are defects in the movie.

The visual performances matched with the music are uncannily faithful, from all four actors. The resemblances are satisfactory rather than accurate - even Rami Malek, notwithstanding some fabulous prosthetic teeth, doesn't actually look that much like Freddie.But, by havens, he captures him. His speaking voice is particularly good: the accent and vocal inflections are spot on. And the performance, showing both the flamboyance and the human frailties, is very moving. He is channelling Freddie.The other performances are good, too, especially Freddie's family and Lucy Boynton as Freddie's ever faithful friend and one-time fianc\u00e9e Mary Austin, the Love Of His Life.I'm not in any way a massive Queen fan, but I liked their music and I watched Live Aid as it was transmitted.

The issue I had with the performance in the movie though is how outgoing he portrays Freddie Mercury. In real life he wasn't so outgoing as shown. For the performances on stage though, I thought he earned that Oscar.Another issue I had with this movie is the timeline. It was messed up slightly. An example would be Freddie telling the band he has aids before the live aid performance. This doesn't make any sense because in real life, live aid took place in 1985.

The film itself made me wish I was born a decade or two earlier to experience the hype and energy first hand, if I ever had the chance to time travel I would perch myself on top of Wembley.

Im not bothered about the films inaccuracies purists seem so hung up about, theres plenty of documentaries and literature about if you want to delve deeper in to the band and Freddie.

I guess Brian May and Roger Taylor (members of the band who started the project and produced the movie) opted for this because they know Queen fans are aware of what really happened. Anyway, regardless you are fan or not, Bohemian Rhapsody will give you an exciting and unforgettable musical immersion into Queen's world, topped up with the astounding recreation of the Live Aid concert, which is considered the best musical performance of all time.

Everybody must watch this film."}, {"id": 461, "text": "For whatever reason, I didn't follow Queen the way I did The Beatles or The Rolling Stones. I liked their music well enough, but Freddie Mercury never registered on my radar, most likely because my Golden Era of musical memories consisted of The Sixties groups representing the British Invasion, Motown, and the Sun and Surf Sound. Except for the fact that I knew and enjoyed all the Queen songs in the film, virtually everything else about the band was new information for this viewer, and as such, I can't attest to the accuracy of the story that was presented. So coming from that standpoint, this effort came across as one of the better music biopics I've encountered, with actor Rami Malek offering an inspired portrayal of the late Freddie Mercury. However I couldn't help thinking that he was channeling Mick Jagger both in appearance and stage presence, so if ever an actor is called upon to portray the iconic lead singer of the Stones in a film, Malek just might be the guy to do it. The rest of the band members, while taking a back seat to Mercury, still had moments of their own to make their presence felt in the story. With original band members Brian May and Roger Taylor signed on as executive music producers for the film, it didn't feel like their contributions sought to highlight their own presence in the band at the expense of the front man. The only quibble I might have with the picture was that the songs didn't quite mimic the sound of the original Queen, but by the time you get to the Live Aid finale, that goes out the window with the showmanship and sound of the closing numbers. Definitely a movie to watch for music fans, even if Freddie Mercury and Queen's era passed you by."}, {"id": 462, "text": "I guess It's an inspiration to a lot of people all the characters acting and the actors are great"}, {"id": 463, "text": "It's been a long time since I watched such a good movie.

Though the beginning was a bit slow but it makes up for all the making of songs and concert that follow. It is centered around Freddie Mercury but other characters are never left out. The makers didn't follow the exact order of events and left controversial stuff so that the band and their songs take the center stage. Also they made Freddie more relatable who is confused with his sexuality and showed how endearing his relationship with Mary was. I wasn't aware of their band as I wasn't born when they were popular but I am hooked on their greatest hits and performances.

Despite my doubts, I did go an watch this film at least for Rami Malek's sake.

Granted Mercury's Darkest side of his personality might not be here entirely, but the positive side, his music and the story of Queen is overpowering and done with great energy.Could this film have been done sooner? Not really, as during the 1990's there was the defense of marriage act mentality which would have doomed this movie to not doing the main plot line-bisexuality without actually doing it with meaning. In the 1980's, the HIV theme film portion would have been impossible.The film take some liberties with the HIV making the claim that Mecury told the band about the HIV prior to the Live Aid concert in July, 1985. I am not sure that happened that soon prior to his 1991 death. It does make the story more dramatic.When I watched this film, the music hooked me immediately, but the story took it's time developing. So I was sort of thinking of A Star Is Born, another powerhouse music film for this year. Then the story took hold after the early part about the forming of Queen. This film put that story together with Freddie joining the band in 1970, briefly.The film becomes powerful when it hooks the viewer on Mercury and his complex life from his relationship to Mary Austin to his admitting their relationship is more complex because he is a bisexual. The film stays above most of Mercuries Drug Use except for alcohol and focus is more on his relationships with everyone close to him. This is told more powerully and hooked me into the film.The breaking up of Mercury's life is more powerful than a fictional soap opera. It brings tears to many viewers and for good reason. The film builds up to the classic July, 1985 Live Aid performance and that is recreated powerfully in this movie. While the cast is not well known, there are plenty of good performances and Mercury role is acted very well. Mary Austin is acted well too. So are the support roles.While the great music would make this a good movie regardless, the acting making it better than a good movie.

I have read some of the professional reviews, and I cannot comprehend their search of documentary wisdom in this movie; this is not a documentary, but an entertaining story of one of the world's most iconic bands. And the film delivers on all aspects. (And the critics were so wrong about the song Bohemian Rhapsody upon its release).As Brian May pinpointed in the interview on the red carpet, he found that the casting was excellent (I don't remember the exact word he used). But he is so right. Every major role is perfectly casted, and all the band members are brilliant. But I must emphasize Rami Malek's role as Freddie. It has Oscar written all over it. What he does, is almost beyond comparison. Chapeau for even taking on this role, and then delivering what he does. Even better, although marginally, than Michael Douglas in Behind the Candelabra. And Gwilym Lee as Brian May is also a bull's eye, but Malek really carries the production on his tiny shoulders. It was like watching our beloved Freddie all over again.Many, many memorable moments, but the Live Aid performance recreated: it is one of the best scenes I have ever seen - and I have seen lots and lots of films.

But after I walk out of the theater, my heart is filled with joy, tears of happiness, brought so many emotions. That's how you know the movie is fantastic, darling. The casting was brilliant, bravo! I can't get enough with Rami Malek, he obviously worked so hard, Rami Malek pulls off an amazing performance, he just brings Freddie back to life and I don't think you will see any better film about Freddie Mercury again. It's an oppurtunity of a lifetime, every aspects of this movie was executed beautifully. Also the whole cast was so close to perfection!

I went to the world premiere in my local theatre with the purple carpet event on the big screen and all that jazz.When I saw the first trailer I didn't think much about Rami Malek as Freddie or the whole movie at all since the majority of biopics are generic and pretty much formulaic. Back then, I even considered dropping Sacha Baron Cohen a huge mistake. But boy was I wrong. Malek shined like he's never shone before. I think Susie Figgis outdid herself as a casting director here.Ever since I joined the casting industry, I really started seeing what it means to work here, how important this part of showbiz that is, and how just a single miscast can ruin a project. Susie Figgis is a veteran casting director, known for many big and widely loved projects and she did well here. She did extremely well. Up until the moment I joined this business, I paid little to no attention to the actor ensemble, with the exception of clear miscasts that just stood out and you couldn't unsee it. But yesterday I just sat there, mesmerized. Gwilym Lee did an outstanding job portraying Brian May, in fact, I forgot he wasn't him. Lucy Boynton was one of my absolute favorites, portraying Mary Austin and her love and devotion towards Freddie. And Rami Malek. Oh, boy, Rami *was* Freddie Mercury. While I was sitting there in the theatre and staring at the screen I didn't have a feeling I was watching actors play their parts. I felt like I was watching Queen.I don't have much to say about the plot, or the costumes, the setting, the cast. Everything was close to perfection. A perfect balance of drama and comedy. Exactly how life is.I was five when my dad came to me, kneeled, put his large and on my tiny shoulder and delivered the tragic news about Freddie passing. Queen was basically the soundtrack of my upbringing, so I didn't take the news too well. I wept like I've just lost a dear friend. Dad and I spent the remainder of that afternoon blasting the tracks we oh so loved.Queen has been the soundtrack of my life, therefore it's impossible to have an unbiased opinion about 'Rhapsody', but I must admit I had my reservations at first. But in the end, I loved it. The last twenty minutes of the film I spend sobbing and wiping the tears and mascara tracks from my cheeks. I can't remember the last time I cried this much in a movie. And I don't know if it was the music, Freddie's tragic fate or the relationships he had, both with lovers and his family, or maybe it was an amalgam of everything, but from the first minutes the movie started building up, it rose block by block until the huge skyscraper that the story was, finally concluded and all the lights turned on and it shined like a marvelous gem.Until this day, Live Aid remains the biggest, most epic music event in the history of civilization and it is remembered by millions. And _Bohemian Rhapsody_ did it justice. Malek did justice to Freddie. And I left my seat long after the credits had stopped rolling. The show must go on, and it does."}, {"id": 564, "text": "I'm fan of Queen&amp; Freddie himself, but the same time I graduated film school and I love cinema, that's why I also like to be as objective as possible in my reviews of movies. Here I will try to make my criticism honest.Yes, sometimes professional film critics are deliberately malicious, and their opinions are detached from reality, but sometimes they are also right, and in the case of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', they are right.First of all, the film distorts a lot of facts from Freddie and Queen's life, and if it were not significant events - I would not care at all, because I understand copywrite and legal issues, but these are important things and all of this should be done better. Fred's life was dramatic enough, if only the creators of the film really wanted to make an interesting movie, they would go even deeper into Mercury's childhood and the fact he&amp;his family, escaped their own homeland, because of brutal revolution. This could have been the starting point / foundation for a deeper, better portrait of the Queen singer.Unfortunately, there is no depth here, the worst part is that this film is schematic, completely flat, only glides over important topics, does not carry out any serious psychological analysis of such a fascinating, complicated character that Freddie was.I don't accept excuses of many Queen fanatics , that this is the story of the band and not Mercury himself. Because first, one does not exclude the other: it was possible to include deeper analysis / truth about Freddie and the band, and second: the band's history is not shown in some great way either. The best moment of a rather boring, long-lasting first half of the movie is the recording of '' Bohemian Rhapsody ''. The rest is a fast, also quite chaotic montage of musical scenes depicting, carelessly, Queen tours and writing of individual hits, and while I understand, that in a 2-hour movie it is not possible to show each creative process in the smallest detail, it was still possible to show it better from the pov of the characters - band members, thus also build better and deeper characters in this film.The second half is better, I admit, both in terms of pace and in terms of writing/story, and the icing on the cake is the Live Aid concert. The performance, photography, camera work, acting of the main actor is at the highest level in this scene, unfortunately it is not enough to save this movie from failure.Malek's acting, imo, certainly doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination. He tries his best with an empty and schematic screenplay, writers / director's mistakes are not his fault, true, but Oscar is an award for outstanding acting performances, which are not limited to robotic mannerism, it must be accompanied by the psychological, emotional depth of the portrayed character, and there is no such depth in this film, in this main character. The only really emotional scene that attempts to penetrate into Mercury's soul is the scene of conversation in the rain. It is here, that Malek's creation is the truest and the best.But again : when we look at this role through the prism of the whole film, majority of Malek's work is the mentioned mechanical mannerism - perfectly recreated- but it is not enough to rate this role positively, let alone reward it with an Oscar nomination. Imitative mannerism, gestures, faces alone - it is only a skeleton, an acting sketch and not a full, beautiful, complex image, which should be any biography. There is simply no soul in this act, and it's just a shame, if you play a figure as extraordinary, colorful and complicated as Freddie Mercury.In addition to the obvious mistakes of screenwriters and director, Malek himself (for me), didn't rise to the task. Sometimes he is just Mercury caricature and large, artificial teeth don't help to erase this impression, in fact, the opposite. The make-up department didn't do good job here, famous teeth of Queen frontman could have been done better, much more subtly, it would look less ridiculous. Returning to Rami Malek - he is still a young talent who - like any actor - needs more workshop and acting experience, plus really good material, to really shine. That is why I predict Rami Malek will not win an Oscar.I still think that the great mistake of the Bohemian Rhapsody creators, was to part ways with Sacha Baron Cohen. When I found out that he had left Mercury's biography project, I thought it was a big mistake from film producers, because I was sure Cohen wanted to tell an uncompromising, interesting story, not forcedly smoothed and it seems, my intuition did not disappoint me at the time. Cohen, a remarkable &amp; colorful character himself, would have fit in perfectly in this role. In addition, after watching the interview, in which Cohen explained why he finally left the movie and what vision of Mercury he had - I regret even more that it was not him, who played the Queen main singer. He wanted to portray Freddie as a complicated, controversial figure with a great appetite for life, but also a great artist, who mixed his big ego with great sensitivity and shyness - I have no doubt that it would be a great role. Now it's just a missed opportunity.As a result, we got schematic, polite movie, oh, what an irony - because Freddie Mercury, as well as the entire Queen, were as original, unapologetic and creative as you could be and they deserve much better. Sorry, but real Queen fan, who wanted raw, real, complex, deep, uncompromising truth and story - just cannot like this movie. Mercury and all the Queen story has so much potential (wasted in this movie). I guess I'll just wait for another film, bold and great this time, I hope."}, {"id": 565, "text": "It's not surprising to me that Bohemian Rhapsody was a hit. Queen have always been a popular and well-loved band, and even if some consider it overplayed, the song this film is named after is undoubtedly iconic and quite the musical achievement. What does surprise me is just how much of a hit this was, raking in something close to a billion US dollars worldwide and earning several Academy Awards. If I'd watched it before the hype, I'm sure I would have found it a solid yet potentially unmemorable music biopic and then moved on, only to be surprised when it got the kind of acclaim, box office results, and awards attention it did.It also puts me in a position where much of what can be said about Bohemian Rhapsody has already been said. The criticism when it comes to some aspects of this film have been extensive, so I will briefly say that I agree with many of them. A harder edged look at Freddie Mercury would have been much better, because the film can only scratch the surface when it comes to his lifestyle, partying, and the various partners he had throughout his career. The pacing is a little too frantic, and some scenes are put together in a rather gimmicky, blunt manner (the biggest offender for me was the press meeting scene, where Mercury becomes overwhelmed at all the repetitive questions being thrown at him; it was filmed and edited in a way that I thought would look tacky in a student film, let alone a large scale Hollywood production). Then there's the whole matter of the surviving band members' involvement, including speculation that they wanted to tone down any edgy aspects and also make themselves look good in the process (oh! And give the actors that depict them more screen time. I think a lot of the clunky filmmaking and editing choices come down to those surviving band members wanting to increase the amount of time their personas were in the movie. This creates an awkward sensation where Bohemian Rhapsody is something in-between a Freddie Mercury biopic and a Queen biopic, but failing to truly excel in either regard). And then there's the matter of historical accuracy, which is ignored in some areas, but is far from an unforgivable sin for the most part, as far as I'm concerned.Rami Malek was highly praised for his depiction of Mercury and to be honest, he was good? But not fantastic. I think the fake teeth did a lot of the acting for him, and giving a good impression of a well-known historical figure certainly takes skill, but I'm not as blown away by what he did as many seem to be. Everyone else in the cast ranged from just okay to decent- there weren't really many standouts.The soundtrack is fun but it's Queen, so what else would you expect? Additionally, Bohemian Rhapsody is thankfully not boring; I guess a positive aspect of the frenetic, exhausting pace is that the film is never given the opportunity to drag. It's really the Live Aid concert recreation that saves this movie, and in the end, I almost wished I was watching that for two hours instead of the rest of this movie... which I still can't say is terrible. That concert recreation is a decent pay-off, and the movie is somewhat engaging and with a good (still not great, in my opinion) lead performance at its centre. It just failed to move or entertain or shock or make me think much beyond that. It's a perfect lazy Sunday afternoon movie, but beyond that, include me among the people who otherwise don't really understand what all the fuss was about."}, {"id": 566, "text": "Ok it's the opening day, the cinema is packed, probably 90% Queen fans. The fans ranged from a young girl of about 10 to old gits like me.Demi Malek is awesome throughout. He obviously worked so hard to not just look but to sound and act like Freddie. Then again they all did.There have been some negative professional reviewer comments and I did read them and I really couldn't work out what they wanted - perhaps a mix of Philadelphia Story and Mama Mia.The complex relationship between Freddie and Mary Austin as well as Paul Prenterband finally Jim Hutton was explored and dealt with appropriate sensitivity.Personally I felt it was short and would have loved to peek more behind the curtain to understand where the music that shaped my adolescence came from.If you've never seen it go to YouTube and watch the Queen performance at Live Aid. The reaction of the crowd wasn't overplayed it was if anything understatedBy the way Bryan Singer is credited as Director but he left and Dexter Fletcher stood in and made a pretty good jobWant to see it again"}, {"id": 567, "text": "After listening to the reviews calling Bohemian Rhapsody a bog standard bio I think it's time for me to put my two cents in to the ring.Personally I must have been watching another movie. Or is that I just understood what the makers of Bohemian Rhapsody were trying to achieve.Actually let's start with just that.Bohemian Rhapsody is a tribute to the legacy of Freddie Mercury and also the band Queen. It was primarily made for the fans of the the band and to showcase the band and its history to a new audience.To do this the film primarily uses a straight forward story telling style. This also means that events and time lines have to be condensed and fictionalised to tell that story in just over 2 hours. This also means that many real characters have to amalgamate in to a couple of fictional personas. I personally had no problem with this. I also liked the fact that the film poked fun at future events using also comic casting. Those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. It seems to me that the critics wanted something that real Queen Fans have no real time for, namely a movie that explores Freddie's wild private life. We know what he did. We know a lot about his wild side. But Queen Fans want a film about the most important elements of Freddie's life. Namely the band and its music.Bohemian Rhapsody does something better.Instead of showing a debauched indulgent life, Bohemian Rhapsody instead shows us a man trying to come to terms with his extraordinary life. It shows how with the help of the truly talented other members of Queen he was able to do that. It also shows his Joy, his loneliness, plus some of his mistakes and missteps along the way, and of course his complex relationship with Mary Astor possibly the one person he truly loved.It tackles his sexuality and some of the aftermath of his partying. It also shows the beginning of his illness. This is all achieved with sensitivity and respect.Now for the music.Bohemian Rhapsody is possibly at its greatest when recreating queen on stage. Using a mixture of real singing from the actors, Queen and Freddie's over dubbing and sound alike artists to create a totally unique feel to Queens songs. Recreations of the bands greatest hits are mixed, to sound fresher than ever. Some even help the movie to move along showing headlines and critic's reviews as the songs play out. Then there's The Live Aid performance. Much like the real concert it almost dwarfs everything that has gone before on film. We the audience really get to experience what it was like to be at that event. Not just from the crowd but from the bands point of view. Almost every highlight from that performance is featured.The performances.Everyone agrees Rami Malek is a revelation as Freddie after about 20 minutes you totally forget that this is an actor. He is Freddie. This can also be said for Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello playing The rest of the band in fact in the case of Lee the transformation into Brian May is astounding. As the film primary focuses on Freddie you can feel a sorry that aspects of the other members of the band aren't fully explored. Rogers womanising is hinted at but Brian's private life and his relationship with his father are not. John Deacon remains the enigma of the band. Lucy Boynton gives a carefully measured and sensitive performance as Mary Astor coming to terms with the changes in Freddie's life. Unfortunately Allen Leech has the unenviable task of playing a composites of some of Freddie's lovers and can be seen as a bit of a cliche villain. But he gives a good account of himself. As for the rest of the cast. Everyone else is solid.The film begins with Live Ad and ends on that same day.If you're a fan of Queen I defy you to leave your seat as the credits role.. To Sum up. Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration, not an expose and it should be treated that way by those pay their money to see it.. The Critics obviously didn't get it."}, {"id": 568, "text": "Love of my life11/10 in short this film is SUPERBNow I've got that out of the way - the theme is loveLove of a friends , love of a man for a woman and man for man, love of a family ,love of work colleagues , love and adoration and the search of love for oneselfBe prepared it's an emotional roller coaster - it's a film of dreams hopes and aspirations and the ups and downs all of that encompasses .

The story of singer Freddie Mercury is rich and different from many who lived in show business and at the time of the emergence of stadium mega-bands in the twentieth century. By itself is exotic a guy who was born in Zanzibar, Africa, spent his childhood in India and then was forced to immigrate to England because of a revolution in his country, began to study design and suddenly joins with a quasi dentist, a quasi-physicist and an almost mechanical engineer to set up a band that would be a hit-maker in the '70s and' 80s.But Bohemian Rhapsody is a lazy film that does not deliver even the basics, which would be a facetious, linear biopic based on historical moments of the band and its vocalist. It is a superficial, erratic work that adds nothing new or relevant to the biography of Queen or Freddie himself, one of the great voices in rock history.The film, for example, touches on important issues that deserved to be further explored. Ready a few: why is Freddie's relationship with the family so cold and filled gaps? How was your childhood in Zanzibar and India, where, by the way, did he start playing piano? What kind of influence could he have suffered from this life in these two places? In what family, immigration influenced him or not to be what he became? Why deny the name and origins? These are questions that could have been asked and were not answered. In the film, his family is almost a tip in history.Freddie's own relationship with his homosexuality, as well as his internal conflicts, lack and solitude are not properly treated / harnessed to try to understand who Freddie was. In short, it's a very little-delivered movie.Of course, the production suffered several problems. Initially, Freddie would be played by Sacha Baron Cohen, but divergences with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, ended up dynamiting their participation. The place ended up being occupied by Rami Malek, known for his participation in the TV series Mr Robot, but delivering a Freddie just acceptable and nothing remarkable.After that, Bryan Singer himself was fired from production with two weeks to go. Direction this one that fell in the lap of Dexter Fletcher. But the film ended up having the same face of Singer's later work, with little depth in approaching characters and work short of expectations. X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) is an example.In fact, Bohemian Rhapsody only lends itself to Queen's good songs, especially those that represented turning points in the band's career - Bohemian Rhapsody, Love of My Life, We Will Rock You, I Want to break free , We are the Champions , Another one bites the dust - to bring comfort to the heart of the viewer. It would have been more fruitful and cheaper, though, to listen to Queen's greatest hits on Spotify.The screenplay by Anthony McCarten and Peter Morgan, who is responsible for such good films as The Last King of Scotland (2005), The Queen (2006), Frost / Nixon (2008) and Rush (2013) also sins by not providing basic information, putting Rock in Rio in a random time and space between 1975 and 1985 and creating bad dialogues. Nor does it seem that there was a band there creating great hits. And even these moments of creation of the musicians sound fake and soulless.If Malek is far from striking, but does not compromise a gear that is flawed from beginning to end, the actors who make the other members of the band - always seen through the narrative with extreme generosity - are weak. Gwilym Lee (Brian May), Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) is there to not compromise and be the sober pieces of Freddie Mercury's egotrip. Meanwhile, entrepreneur Paul Prenter (Allen Leech) is depicted as the villain in the film, responsible for the friction between Freddie and the rest of the band and even for his temporary separation.So, Bohemian Rhapsody goes through its 2h15min owing a lot. His most memorable moments turn out to be Malek's scene in the rain, when Freddie decides to leave the bottom of the pit to resume his career with Queen and the historical presentation in 1985 Live Aid, a key point for the band and Freddie, in a context where the singer had just learned that he had AIDS, a disease that would eventually contribute to his death six years later. But unfortunately all of Queen's timeline in the movie does not even hit 70% of what actually happened. Just as the viewer leaves the cinema without even knowing the name of a disc of the band.Singer, by the way, chose to put a fake Queen's pocket show inside the film to portray the performance at Live Aid. I do not know if that was the best option. It seemed like a lazy option to me. For it was not a movie or a real Queen show, bringing noises everywhere.So Bohemian Rhapsody ends with the false feeling of coming out on top, when in fact it left more holes and a bit of entertainment in an absolutely expendable movie."}, {"id": 570, "text": "Bohemian Rhapsody was one of my most anticipated movies of 2018. It'd be quite strenuous to oblige to you'll quite how crucial the band, Queen, means to me and how much they've inveigled myself as the person I am today.As a youngster, I had been raised upon the newest, hottest, artificially publicized pop and rap tracks that were continuously featured on the most vouged radio stations at the time, but in the corner of every auto-tuned, computerized feature I listened to, I would often get to occasionally tango to a Queen hit.Freddie Mercury and his band of bohemians are the quadruple-handed culprits who peeked my interest in soulfull, rock and roll music genres which conincidently, have shaped me into the Classic Rock-Head I am presently. Not only that, but the obscurities and lunacy of their lyrics-especially from hits like Bohemian Rhapsody-drove me into studying the arts of profoundly galvanized poetry/lyricism/literature.Their music additionally, has helped me power through numerous of my most emotionally conflicting encounters I had brawled with during my time here on planet Earth. This iconic band has been persisting alongside my life ever since I was born, and that's something I can't declare about towards any other musician/musical group.Now Here's My Consensus:I am very, very tied on this film. On one hand, I thought Bohemian Rhapsody tributed the story of Freddie Mercury-for the most part-judiciously, mainly due to Rami Malek's immersive performance. Trust me, if Malek wasn't in this movie, Bohemian Rhapsody would've crumbled to ashes apace with some of the biggest catastrophes of 2018. As a depiction and honory of a musical legend, I was earnestly contented to witness the results.On the other hand, I found this movie to be a pretty incoherent, potboiler mess of a product. The harshest way to submit this is, well, simply put, to say that Bohemian Rhapsody is fundamentally your average company manufactured, cop-out, strand of merchandise that was only fabricated for mainstream audiences who will unknowingly be able to eat up the same old Fast and the Furious: Family is Important blueprint that they've unconsciously seen billions of times.However, this movie is dang LUCKY that they got Malek on the project and that they AT LEAST managed to make a glaringly enthralling, two-hour, sound-explosion of a music video.The Main Core Killing This Movie: So, not gonna lie, Bohemian Rhapsody's script is somewhat atrocious in my humble opinion. This penmanship nearly lineaments everything I don't want in a based-on-a true-story feature. Whose bright idea was it to make a Marvel movie confided within a Queen movie, an arrangement which wasn't necessarily a construct that one should really consider for a freakin' Queen movie. Writers of the world, you don't have to throw in a satirical one-liner every twenty seconds in order to conquer your audiences attention!And MY MY. Like, if you didn't think a movie could get more by-the-books clich\u00e9-especially when diving in with all the family is valuable and family acceptance mortalities-than you sir or madam, were wrong. Screenwriters-I've been sounding so demanding recently, I apologize. I guess I'm just admittedly aggravated today-stop making your dilagoue feel as if it's sprouting out of the pages of a life coaching pamphlet! It's amateurish, honestly.They just had to bend the story into little bits and pieces because they just had to insert their little chestnut morals and preaches, and their superfluous, forced humor. Why Hollywood? Why? (Probably because of production issues and what not. Oh. And Bryan Singer. Supposedly. And marketing. And money. Definitely money.)The editing is a bit of a mess too. The sequence of events are muddled like crazy. You'll needa do some final cuts on this DARLING! And about 30% of the movie is just witnessing the band drag on from how they crafted one hit to how their next hit was created and so on so forth.Did I just rant? Woah, I totally did. Hmm...let's lighten matters up, I suppose. I don't want to give off too many negative vibes about this mediocre biopic feature. There is virtue to be found.But Rami Malek. This man carries this ENTIRE movie. Without him, Bohemian would like an ATOM BOMB. Or...not, like an Atom Bomb. Cause the song. Okay, I'll shut-up.Malek's performance is honestly Oscar-nominee worthy. He embodies head to toe, Freddie Mercury's EVERYTHING. Even in the sentimental, dramatic moments, he kills (sorry), DESTROYS it-despite the poor script and dialogue he's often given. Additionally, his chemistry and the story behind his love life was intriguing enough to keep me locked on. The positive outcome of the film originates from this portrayal and this plotpoint that majorily has to do with who Freddie was and what he had to accord with during his times of fame.I mildly relished Bohemian Rhapsody, and I was enthralled whenever we got to relive Mercury's tale, but...a Queen movie deserves light-years better than this. I'm possibly being a tad-bit generous offering Bohemian Rhapsody with this grade, but, I can't deny that I enjoyed and was cheery that I got to venture this film of messy yet, dapper flair...so: (Verdict: D+)"}, {"id": 571, "text": "Sometimes there's a movie that really divides critics and audience. Sure a movie about one of the most iconic person of Rock (and music in general) should make Bohemian Rhapsody one of them, and it does. Honestly, the movie it's not bad -not totally- but it is messy. The structure is messy, the timeline is wrong and the characters are more selfaware than they need to be, but more on that later. It felt like they wanted to make a love letter to Queen, but the structure wasn't even nearly satisfactory as it should be, resulting in a Russian Roulette of cheap emotions and an unclear message by the end.Rami Malek is good as Freddie Mercury, reproducing several peculiarities of the original artist, but for me his acting was more of a series of impressions (a caricature) then a true representation. Don't get me wrong, it's still very good and very unique, but I've seen another Biopic this year (First Man) and by comparing the protagonists, I feel that Gosling's Armstrong is more of a character then Malek's Freddie and I don't know whose fault it is. Anyway, great casting too, I honestly want to know how they rejuvenated Brian May and taught him to act so fast. But even with a cast almost identical to the original band, the movie restricted everyone so they could make Freddie the absolute main character.This and other things are totally the screenplay's (and the people who wrote it) fault. And there's some Bryan Singer there too. The movie paints Freddie as a legend, a god from the first to the last frame, never letting us empathize with his character, his struggles or his wins. We're humans, the movie needs to humanize its protagonist so we can sympathize with him. The film even has a bad influence character so we could put all of Freddie's faults on him, what a shame. It seems like every single person involved with the band (except that one producer) was aware of what Queen means today. They're always convicted that they would be successful, talking and acting this way, at least it's how the story shows us. The screenplay also manipulates time and events to fit the narrative created to the movie. Rock in Rio was in 1985 with a very well know Queen, not in '79. Freddie discovered he had AIDS in 1987 and definetely did not use it as plot point to empower the Live Aid performance, and he didn't was the first to go solo too, making an entire scene insincere. Propably one of the most poorly written scripts of the year.I honestly don't know where it's totally Bryan Singer's fault or some kind of Studio's censorship, but this movie is flat in emotions. Everytime the band argues about something there is a miraculous riff that saves the scene and in the next one everything is alright, they have a new song to perform. Unfortunately, not even an inspired Rami Malek and the Live Aid performance reproduction (which was cool) could save the picture. Makes me wonder how Sacha Baron Cohen wanted to make it. Probably he wanted to make a true Biopic of Freddie's life, not just a stack of exposition scenes.Probably he wanted to make it right."}, {"id": 572, "text": "This has got to be the most overrated film in recent history. Overrated by the audience. Critics got it right this time, even though they rarely do.Rami Malek offered a great impression of Freddie Mercury. But impression it was. He failed to capture the essence, the exoticness of the real Freddie, and his manliness. Rami's acting made Freddie looked like a generic gay man, which Freddie wasn't. Freddie's might have been a weirdo, but never acted like a sissy. At times, his acting simply looked ugly, such as his exaggerated emphasis on Freddie's incisors. You can easily verify what I am saying by searching for videos of the real Freddie Mercury, and you can see the real Freddie never acted the way as portrayed by Rami. Sacha Baron Cohen, the original actor slated to play Freddie, might have been a better choice.The worst part of the movie was the script. Far too much creative liberty was taken to alter historical events. Omitting details for clarity, adding details to fill in the blanks, compressing events to fit his career in a 2-hour movie, that's normal. But Queen never broke up! Freddie making a solo was never a betrayal! What the heck? As if the life of Freddie bloody Mercury wasn't legendary enough, the writers had to throw in fictional events to fill up the runtime. This is disrespectful to Freddie's legacy and his fans, and at the same time misleading to the youth, into thinking he's a self-centered a-hole (well, more of a self-centered a-hole).So much of the movie was revolved around Freddie's relationship with Mary Austin. Then all of a sudden, in one short scene Jim Hutton was introduced (with yet another unnecessary historical inaccuracy). And that was it. When Jim reappeared at the end of the movie, I almost forgot who he was. Jim was supposed to be the other love of Freddie's life, and the screenwriters made them fell in love in one short conversation, never to meet again until the end?Then finally it comes to the music. There are times the editors cram in the songs for the sake of playing Queen's songs, without adding to the narrative of the movie. Heck, they re-enacted 70% of the whole Wembley concert, and yet you can easily find the original performance even on YouTube. If they had to invest that much runtime in one event, they'd better not skim over other important events... oh, wait. For a proper music biographical film, try Ray (2004).The movie wasn't bad. Just not worth all the praise it's been getting."}, {"id": 573, "text": "Well, the moment we have all been waiting for has finally arrived with the release of the highly anticipated Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. So now just one question remains, was it worth the wait? Well, in my honest opinion, abso-freakin-lutely! This incredible story takes us on the journey of one of the most iconic rock bands of all time and gives us a look at not only the birth and life of the band but a peek behind the curtain into the life of one of music's biggest legends and Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury. From their humble beginnings playing college shows to their historic performance at 1985's Live Aid concert, Bohemian Rhapsody will take you on one hell of a rock n' roll ride.Rami Malek takes on the role of Freddie Mercury with all the charm and swagger that the real man gave off. Never one to be ignored or denied Malek's Mercury is cocky and charming and just captivating to watch. Even through Freddie's highest highs and lowest lows he gives a fantastic performance. Many were worried that with the departure of Sacha Baron Cohen who was originally slated to play a much wilder and dark Mercury, that the film would gloss over Freddie's personal life, but honestly what we get from Malek's version of the film just feels tasteful and right. You don't need to see the binge drinking, drug use, and copious amounts of random sex to know that Freddie used all those things to fill a void in his own soul and it is heavily implied throughout the film without the audience having to attend every party. Instead, we get much more substance and story which just feels way more important. He is the happy-go-lucky frontman, one second and the tortured artist the next and Bohemian Rhapsody does a great job of making you really feel for this man and not just him, but the people around him whom his actions effect. You get a bit of an inside look at his relationship with Mary Austin played by Lucy Boyton (Sing Street). Their romance/friendship is both sweet and heartbreaking to see. I know many were worried this film would downplay his sexuality and instead focus on his relationship with Mary, and while the film does focus on this relationship with her, it definitely does not leave out his sexual exploits with men and his eventual relationship with Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker).While many would like the sole focus of this film to be Freddie Mercury you can't leave out the rest of the band because, let's face it, with them there is no Queen. Freddie's bandmates bring a lot to this picture from the sarcastic and at times confrontational Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) to the band's voice of reason Brian May ( Gwilym Lee) to the quiet talent of John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello). These guys bring a lot to the table as Freddie's family, friends, and biggest support system. Despite all the over the top requests and ideas of their lead singer, these guys jump in with both feet to fuel the fire and bring us some of the greatest music rock has ever seen. It is pretty awesome to watch on the big screen.Overall, I scored Bohemian Rhapsody with a solid A. This is an entertaining, fun, funny, and at times the heartbreaking film that definitely deserves your attention. Fans of Queen should breathe a sigh of relief because this is a solid movie. So head to the box office and buckle up for one hell of a ride with this rock royalty and allow yourself to be taken away and inspired with Bohemian Rhapsody.Bohemian Rhapsody hits theaters everywhere November 2nd."}, {"id": 574, "text": "There are a few bands I look back and wished I had the opportunity to see perform live, and Queen is one of them. While I haven't yet journeyed into the deep cuts of their music, I did find myself impressed with what I head from Another One Bites the Dust and Under Pressure. So I was pretty excited to see a Queen biopic, but I found myself complaining about the same things I did about All Eyez on Me. It gets the performances and highlights, but severely lacks connective tissue.Where the film excels is Rami Malek giving a very solid performance is Freddie Mercury and giving an extremely thrilling finale at their iconic Live Aid performance (which is worth the price of admission alone). The problem the film doesn't develop the other band members at all or even the creative process. And while the film addresses Freddie Mercury's private relationships with men, I feel the movie plays it almost entirely sexually driven and hedonistic with no real thread of intimacy.Bohemian Rhapsody has some thrills, but ends up being a major disappointment for me as a whole. While it's great to hear Queen's songs on display, it gives little to no context and is quick to move on from the song before the chorus. I just wished the movie rocked as much as the movie did."}, {"id": 575, "text": "Bryan Singer's Bohemian Rhapsody is easily, one of, if not, thee most anticipated films of 2018. I'm sure that even the most skeptic Queen fan was curious to see how this was going to be pulled off. Well, let's talk about that...First of all, any and all praise should essentially go to Rami Malek. He's an excellent actor who obviously took the role of Freddie quite seriously. I won't lie, the casting director did a great job finding the rest of the band too, but it was more for their physical appearance rather than anything else; they were really just a static supporting cast. I mention the rest of the cast because this film was essentially supposed to be about Queen, and not exclusively about Freddie. Well, they missed the mark on that one, and it's an upsetting notion.I had basically been following this project ever since the idea stage. I remember when Ben Whishaw was tied to the lead, but better yet, when Sacha Cohen was going to give it a go as our ill-fated frontman. Initially, Cohen was quite serious about the role, and proposed that the film be an R-rated, hardcore rendering of the singer's life. Knowing Cohen's outlandish approach to cinema, it may have been brilliant. Sadly, the members of Queen were not on the same page, and demanded a change in direction. I remember reading, that the band wanted it to be about their collective journey, up to the point of Live Aid. At the end, the only thing that was true to this ambition, was the classic 1985, Live Aid performance which was recreated quite well.We all know how Freddie's journey ends, so there's no spoiler there, but for such a poignant figure in popular music of the 20th century, I expected so much more. Honestly, a breathtaking film about Freddie would take a hell of a lot, and very little of that lot was in this film. To loosely quote a review, Bohemian Rhapsody is like a Wikipedia bio of the band. The film references a collection of important moments in the band's career, but it feels all so superficial. Freddie is basically in every scene, and it becomes apparent that the film is about him, which again, was not supposed to be the original intent. The outcome is a basic overview, that just upsets the viewer, because you're left wanting more. It was the power of Queen's music and the notion of the tragedy that was bestowed upon Freddie Mercury, that brought tears to my eyes; however, if there's one reason alone to see this film, it's for Malek's professional dedication to the role, and for that reason alone I give it a 5. I will say, putting Malek aside, the missed opportunity of not green lighting the Cohen project was another major part of the tragedy.Bohemian Rhapsody is sadly superficial, and I can only hope that a respectful, yet honest depiction of Freddie's life hits the screen in some way, shape, or form in the future. If not, we always have their wonderful music, and that's truly the only thing that counts."}, {"id": 576, "text": "My friends and I had unexpected free time and decided to see a movie. We had seen previews for Bohemian Rhapsody several times at the theatres, and when debating what movie to see, I suggested BR. My friends were so/so but went along with the recommendation. They came away - blown away. No one expected to be so captivated by this movie. We all like Queen music, but not one of us had ever seen them live. We realized right away that the music of Queen is timeless. There is not a winning Sports Team that at some point doesn't play or have a slide show prepared to We Are The Champions. People ask if this is a documentary. It is more than a documentary. It is a brilliantly entertainimng story about the creation and rise to fame of one of the greatest bands of all time. I thought I knew the story, but I had so many missing parts that this story brilliantly unfolds. The reason why Freddie Mercury had such a big range was finally made clear to me. His coming out story is both tough, hard and poignant at the same time. The final scene is a magnificent walk down memory lane for many of us about a time when the world was united in the cause of charity and helping the downtrodden, a subtle reminder of how far we have strayed from being a Global, caring village. That scene is epic and should go down as one of the greatest movie moments of all time. The sign of a truly great movie is the one that you were so/so about seeing, and came away wanting to get right back into line and see it again."}, {"id": 577, "text": "Before I get into the negatives, I want to talk about the positives of the film. Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury was superb, and I was not disappointed about him winning best actor. The music was great, but that's because it's all by Queen.That's pretty much it for the positives. Everything else in this film wasn't that great. Throughout the film, the editing choices were horrible. Every scene has way too many cuts. There's some meme videos about Bohemian Rhapsody's editing on YouTube that I suggest you check out to see what I mean. A lot of Bohemian Rhapsody's editing was unnecessary, and I am still confused as to why the academy chose this film for best editing, when I believe it shouldn't even have been nominated at all. There are also many inconsistencies in this film with what actually happened in the life of Freddie Mercury. A lot of parts in the story just didn't feel realistic and it just seems too convenient at times. In addition, the movie has a PG-13 rating, which was kind of frustrating since the true story of Freddie Mercury was not told. The film Rocketman is similar to this film, except Rocketman is R-rated since it recognizes that Elton John's life is indeed R-rated. So is Freddie Mercury's life, but instead a lot of the movie was just trying to tell the story while pandering to a PG-13 rating.Overall, this film was very disappointing. It is not the worst movie ever made, but it is overrated and not good either. It just felt like an insult to the music Freddie Mercury and Queen made. I'm most likely not going to watch this film ever again."}, {"id": 578, "text": "Cool movie for sure, I enjoyed it a lot. However, I don't think it should be given 10/10s because it wasnt THAT good. I'll explain why, going through the main different things that made the film:Music (11/10) Queen rocks. Every song was great.Story/characters (7/10) At the beginning it was very clunky, not having a main goal or motivation. Also it hopped forwards in time a lot, which can sometimes work in movies, but not to the extent they did it in this one. It just felt rushed. Also a lot of the scenes werent really anything more than just showing us how some of the songs were made, which is interesting, just not relevant to the story. However, later the story gained a driving force as it settled into the time period just before Live Aid. Before, I would say the story was a 5/10 stars, but by the end it probably reached around 9/10, a really solid film by the end. Conflict, important character motivations, and interesting drama were only introduced about halfway into the film. I wish they just started the film then and cut out the beginning.Acting (9/10) Top notch, of course. The only thing I would say was negative for this was that Malek's acting at the start was a bit shaky, but improved greatly by the halfway point in the film. Perhaps this factor also led to me disliking the start of the movie. All the supporting characters were great as well as Malek. I especially liked the actor who played Brian May, I thought he was perfect for the role.Cinematography (6/10) Nothing special. Just your average cinematography.Editing (5/10) This really was the worst element of the film in my opinion. The editing at the beginning of the film was a bit clunky, distracting from the story. My least favorite part was the artificial blurring, especially in the interviewing scene. I assume this was done in editing, not in cinematography, because it looked so unnatural. It was extremely distracting. I think it was meant to make the scene disorienting, but all it did was make me less invested in the movie, because the effect was so annoying.Overall: 38/50 = 7.6/10"}, {"id": 579, "text": "First of all, I didn't really want to go. After all that happened with this movie and after everything that Queen members said, I expected it to be bad. Very, very bad. But then I saw all those positive reviews and thought Hey! Maybe it's actually good? I mean, miracles happen from time to time and I don't want to miss something good based on something as epic as Queen. So, I paid for a ticket. I was a fool...Bohemian Rhapsody is exactly as I expected it to be. Even worse, actually. And the biggest problem with the movie is the fact that the band didn't want it to be a movie about Freddie. I mean, sure, they're all very talented musicians and it's probably painful to live their lives in Freddie's shadow, even while pretending that the band still exists without him. No matter what they do, the people think Freddie. So, sure, I can see WHY they didn't want this movie to be all about him. The problem is... there was no other way. The story of Queen is the story of Freddie Mercury. Who, aside from many other things, was a very complicated person. And the only way to make a movie about Queen and Freddie is to focus on Freddie's inner world. The same way that the First Man focused on Neil Armstrong. Remember how people said a lot of bad things about that movie just because it didn't focus on the American flag? But that was exactly why the First Man was so good. It wasn't yet another movie about American heroes in space. It was a movie... about... Neil... Armstrong. Bohemian Rhapsody does exactly the opposite. It turns Freddie into another character of the show. One of the many. And it's one of the things that pretty much ruin the movie.Like I said, Freddie was a complicated person. A true artist with the unique soul. And without even trying to look deeper into his soul, this movie makes him... well... a freak. Personally, I consider it a crime. Not because I'm one of those crazy fans, but because he deserved more... WAY more than what they did to him in this movie. And it's not about Rami Malek, no. The man is quite good and I hope that this movie will be good for his career. The problem is - writing sucks. Hard. We see Freddie saying and doing things, but we don't have a slightest idea about why. WHY does he do all that? How does he feel? Remember Sully? The movie about Capt. Chesley Sullenberger? Remember what Tom Hanks did there? Sully didn't have any action scenes, the landing sequence was quite short too. The whole movie was about Tom Hanks showing Capt. Sullenberger's feelings in his eyes. Clint Eastwood directed it in a way that we didn't even need words there. Tom Hanks' eyes and the right directing were enough. Bohemian Rhapsody? Nothing like that.Thanks to an awful writing and the pressure from the actual band, it turned out to be a movie about a group of cool and friendly guys and a freak with a superiority complex who were unable to do the things in a normal way. Meaning, feelings, thoughts, emotions... this movie doesn't have anything of that. It aims for a single thing - a bright and exciting picture. Something that is FUN to watch. A bright picture that shows us funny scenes of how famous songs were made, Freddie saying funny and shocking things to people, etc. Even the gay part is surprisingly dull and shallow. One kiss here, one hug there... No feelings involved.To make things worse, even though the movie is pretty straightforward, it's full of lies. Very convincing lies that make the band look even more cool. There are characters that weren't even based on actual people, there are scenes that weren't even based on actual events, etc, etc, etc. As the result, the movie feels like a convincing something that was ordered by Brian May and Co to make them look better. And that's exactly why the one should never ever involve the actual people in biopics about them. They'll want things done in their way. And it'll destroy any attempt to make something real. Brian and Co wanted a colorful yet shallow movie full of fiction, in which the cool British guys make a fool out of the EMI executive, who never ever existed in real life, they've got it. Bohemian Rhapsody is sure bright, colorful, it looks amazing, actors are quite good, even though many of them are TV actors, the concerts look shockingly close to the real deal, and yet, it's an awful movie. And the final scene (which is Live Aid, by the way, don't expect any Innuendo depression in this movie) is a nice example why. They've literally re-created Queen's Live Aid performance. They had a lot of time for a long and very expensive Live Aid cosplay. And yet... they didn't have enough time to show us Freddie's complicated soul. I call it a failure. But again, I hope it makes Brian and Co feel better about their lives. Clearly, it's the true goal here."}, {"id": 580, "text": "Director Bryan Singer (X-Men series) brings the life of Queen's frontman Freddy Mercury (Rami Malek Mr. Robot TV) and the band to the big screen with a vengeance. With screenplay by Anthony McCarten (The Theory of Everything) and story by McCarten and Peter Morgan (Writer, Producer, Actor), the film chronicles the mates climb to music notoriety, highlighting Freddy's frontman antics, the now notorious 1985 Live Aide concert performance, and of course the death of Freddy to Aids in 1991. Malek, who is unpleasantly overly made up to mimic Freddy's unique jaw line, teeth and hair, is plausible as the driven young British Zanzibar vocalist Farrokh (his given name). As the mature Freddy, he's given all the outrageous costumes (by Julian Day) and Freddy's dances moves, and pulls them off with ease, even though his lip-syncing is over the top at times. What Director Singer does well here, is provide backstory to the raise and demise of Mercury, including a look into his personal family dynamics, his little know love affair to Mary (Lucy Boynton Murder on the Orient Express), who graciously sticks by him through his ups and downs, and a look at the effect Freddy's significant lovers Paul Prenter (Allen Leech Downton Abbey TV) and Jim Hutton (Aaron Mccosker The Astronaut Wives Club TV) had on his life, both who give moving subtle glimpses into Freddy's behind the glamour world. To McCarten and Morgan's credit, they provide an in-depth look at Queen's band members bassist John Deacan (Joseph Mazzello The Cure), drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy X-Men: Apocalypse) and guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee Jamestown TV), demonstrating that the band was truly comprised of all four guys. As with most music oriented bio-pics, the film is packed with all the music and excitement one expects from Queen, and it's loud and powerful. Mike Meyers (SNL) has a nice cameo as Queen's EMI chief Ray Forster - although I think I saw and heard Austin Powers in his performance. And, Aidan Gillen (Game of Thrones) does a nice job as the guys music manager John Reid. Only a fool would pan this film, so check it out for yourself, and relive the 70's and the rise of Queen!"}, {"id": 581, "text": "Possibly the most frustrating cinema experience I've had all year. Why? Squandered potential. It's Queen. Quite possibly the biggest rock band to ever exist. Influential to millions. Idolised by thousands. The risks they took with their musicality and stage appearances were aspirational. And yet here we have a biopic that, whilst undoubtedly entertaining, just doesn't know what it wants to be. Chronicling the formation of Queen, Freddie Mercury rises to fame as their lead singer and soon starts clashing with the other band members. Malek singlehandedly saved this film. His performance was both transformative and engrossing, occasionally fully embodying Mercury's eccentric personality. The exaggerated false teeth did initially distract me, but these are diminished once the story starts to unfold. The other members were also well acted and certainly looked the part, particularly with the 70s hair styles. The whole plot intelligently culminates to the infamous Live Aid performance that shot Queen's reputation to stratospheric heights, which evidently is the greatest segment of this biopic. It allowed the music to come through and force Mercury's emotions to be conveyed through auditory senses. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is deservedly one of the greatest songs of all time, and just the Live Aid performance alone showed its importance to Mercury and the band. It wants you to sing along, it wants you to tap your feet to the beat. It's infectious. It will leave you wanting to listen to their other fantastic songs. The development beforehand was well paced, nuanced and enjoyable to watch. However, there are two huge detriments to this biopic that lead to an underwhelming result. Bryan Singer's direction and McCarten's screenplay.Singer is unsure what angle to use to portray Mercury. He had a big career, with personal failures equalling his musical successes. Yet Singer attempts to balance the narrative with Mercury's life and what is essentially Queen's greatest hits. The two do not marinate seamlessly. Is it a Queen tribute? Or a Freddie Mercury biopic? Can it be both? Yes it can. But this is not substantial enough. The band has so much history and acute details that were glossed over in this film, ultimately feeling rushed. The time shifts range from a month to five years. Singer attempts to tackle too much, and it shows. In the first twenty minutes, they've already conceived their first album! That's ludicrous. Then we come to the screenplay. I'm sure Brian May and Roger Taylor's inclusion in this production somewhat hindered the telling of the band's history. It's completely sanitised. The often comedic dialogue juxtaposes the tonal shift of Mercury's eventual loneliness and battle with AIDS. There is literally a scene of Mercury contemplating the idea of conceptualising a solo career, only for the proceeding scene to joyfully create 'Another One Bites The Dust'. The script tries too hard at being a crowd pleaser, that the more important issues are diluted and consequently forms a tonal shift. Sure it allows Malek to show off his acting ability, but at what cost? There's no emotional resonance. Nothing feels memorable. It's a shame, as this could've been an excellent biopic. However the mediocre directing and script really hindered the emotional investment required to make this a successful trip down memory lane. It's a biopic that general audiences will enjoy, it's just not the biopic I wanted."}, {"id": 582, "text": "Have a lot of appreciation for Queen. Not a favourite band of mine by all means, but it is difficult to not understand their importance and appeal. They had some iconic songs (namely Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions and Don't Stop Me Now) and Freddie Mercury's immediately recognisable vocals and Brian May's virtuosic guitar playing were always out of this world.'Bohemian Rhapsody' fascinated me when hearing about it and became most of my most anticipated films for the year. When hearing some negativity for the film, my expectations lowered a little, but saw it anyway because it did look and sound good. It did turn out to be a good decision, it is good to see that others here loved it and don't agree with the mixed critical reception respectfully.Sure there are clich\u00e9s (such as what some of the rest of Queen say) , but very few films are not and many are much worse in this regard. Like a lot of biopics, there are inaccuracies that may drive die-hard Queen fans into a frenzy, and the odd factual distortion, but again 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is not the first or worst film to do this and am going to judge it as a film on its own and not on a documentary level.As a film on its own terms, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' has an awful lot to admire. Getting the issues out of the way, the ones that could have been handled much better was the with the revelation of Freddie Mercury's AIDs diagnosis to the rest of the band, could have been done with more tact and less crass (like saying what it was a consequence of) and revealed too early and at the wrong time, and the implications with the phone ringing off post-taking centre stage that the event was a flop when it actually was a triumph.Some of the early parts were a touch rushed as well, Mercury's ascent to stardom could have been less breakneck.However, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is stylishly film and evokes the period beautifully. As to be expected, the songs are incredible and will be embedded in your brain for a long time, then again it is Queen of course. They are affectionately staged and performed in a way that made me remember what made me appreciate Queen in the first place.Didn't find the script that simplistic or cliff-notes like, while there is a nice mix of moment of laughter, tension and tears and enough parts that entertained and informed, if not as in depth as it should. The story is never dull and the Live Aid depiction is both rousing and poignant. It's capably directed and while all the performances are fine if underused, it is Rami Malek's outstanding turn as Mercury that will live long in the memory, true to what made Mercury so interesting a person and performer without being an impersonation.Concluding, impressively done and better than anticipated. 8/10 Bethany Cox"}, {"id": 583, "text": "The critics were wrong about Bohemian Rhapsody the song and once again they're flat out wrong about the movie.If you want an in-depth look at Freddie Mercury's life you can head to a bookstore to pick-up one of the countless biographies written about the man. Alternatively you can head over to YouTube and watch one of the numerous documentaries solely dedicated to the life of the Queen frontman. However if you want to watch a movie that will make you feel good and remind you why Queen is one of the greatest bands of the 20th century and beyond then look no further, this is the perfect movie for you.Are there facts that have been presented out of context and embellished for dramatic purpose? Yes absolutely. For example: 1) Freddie Mercury wasn't diagnosed with HIV until 1987. It is widely believed that Mercury acquired the HIV virus in 1981 or 1982 but was not physically tested and subsequently diagnosed with the virus until early 1987. 2) Freddie Mercury met his partner Jim Hutton at a club, not while Hutton was working at one of Mercury's lavish house parties. 3) We Will Rock You was not written in the early 80's but rather in 1977. 4) Freddie Mercury did not come out to his parents on the day of Live Aid. 5) Live Aid was not the first time the band had performed together on stage in years. In fact Queen had been on tour for a large part of '84 and early '85. 6) Freddie Mercury was not the first member of Queen to break off and do his own solo project, that distinction belongs to Roger Taylor.There are many additional inaccuracies to be found but it feels like they're made to service the film's overall run-time which is already over 2hrs. The movie doesn't pretend to be a note for note recreation of the band member's lives but rather a celebration of Queen (Freddie Mercury in particular), their humble beginnings and their meteoric rise to success. Most of all, the movie is a celebration of their brilliant music.You want to be entertained and come out of the theatre feeling happy and humming Queen songs? Go see this movie. If you want deeper insight into the personal life of Freddie Mercury or an accurate time line of Queen's many accomplishments, watch a documentary.I can promise you this though, I've seen just about every available documentary that's been released on Queen, some of them several times and none of them will make you smile, laugh, cry and sing the way this movie does.

I Went to see them at Wembley Stadium for their 'Its a Kind Of Magic' tour and that blew me away and this movie did the same to me.I wont go over the entire synopsis like others seem to do but just give the review... The film is a Biopic of the Band Queen and its lead singer Freddie Mercury and it gets it right. The story looks after itself and the humour and drama lead on from that. I had tears several times as it reminded me of an era in my life where Aids was in the headlines a lot. The laughs are good and this is seen throughout. The people starring as the band are incredibly similar in looks and by the end of the film i had forgot that they were not the real band.overall the music was great, the acting was very good and the story well acted out to facts. i gave this title a 10 but it would deserve higher. if you can go see this film it has made a wowie of an impact for me."}, {"id": 585, "text": "Absolutely love this epic tale.

It can be a bit maudlin, and some of the characters are one dimensional but it matters not. Malek's performance is a tour de force of acting, and if you let yourself you simply get carried along with the energy.

I wish the researchers would have spent more time coming up with widely UNKNOWN information about Freddie Mercury instead of basing the movie on widely known information about his life. I did not see any credits for information going to Freddie's parents, sister, or Mary Austin. Maybe interviews with those critical people from Freddie's life would have added information that was not already widely known. Unless I missed something, the movie seem to have been based on Freddie's relatiofnship with Mary Austin with just a little bit of information about his career during the years of his relationship with her. I would've liked to have seen more content based on his musical genius as opposed to his personal relationships. To top it all off the end of the movie ended with the 1985 LiveAid concert, which was six years before his death. Why did they not continue the movie through to the end of his life? The original videos of live concert cuts during the ending credits for me was the most moving part of the film-I'm glad the producers chose to use flattering footage in the end.

I was dubious going into it as I feared it may be formulaic to other rock band films, I also feared it may tarnish my love of the band too. Fortunately and surprisingly I was not disappointed at all. There were some formulaic events but they were inevitable based on the subject matter, and even then they were done entertainingly. There were definite emotive moments through the film; I only had to look at my girlfriend's tears of sorrow and of joy to know that much. We both came out of the cinema having being entertained and probably like so many other people, instantly put Queen on the car stereo.The cast was absolutely fantastic; I've seen other reviews which suggest that Rami Malek carried this film. I agree that his performance was mammoth, but I wouldn't say he carried it alone. The actors playing other band members were all equally fantastic, adopting mannerisms I've seen in the real band since being a fan.I normally write very elaborate reviews about films but I found myself not looking for plot hole or CGI failures in this, I was just that gripped and blown away that I sat back and enjoyed the ride. This film managed to suspend my disbelief, which is something a lot of films have failed to do over the years. What the Hell have the critics that slated this film being watching?!

Rami Malek was amazing and easily deserves the Oscar for Best Actor this year! I honestly forgot that I was watching an actor play Freddie. The concert and music scenes were fantastically directed and I honestly felt like I was there at a real concert, particulary during the Live Aid scene at the end. Although the movie was a lot of fun, I really liked how it also wasn't afraid to cover the darker and more unpleasant parts of Freddie's life as well in the second half which made it a much more intriguing and emotional film than I could have been.This is easily my favorite movie of the year (although as a Queen fan I'm probably a bit biased).

Also the soundtrack marking the various time points keeps the pace steady and interesting. Remi Malik is brilliant as Freddie Mercury, although his performance is more of an impression rather than an in-depth character portrayal, however he nails it with aplomb.Technically there are some faults. With the emphasis very much on Malik as Mercury, the rest of the cast doesn't really have a great deal to do. Likewise, the glossy nature of the story skims over the darker parts of Freddie Mercury's lifestyle, excesses and later battle with Aids and so lacks a real dramatic punch. Plus there is a clumsy and tenuous cameo from Mike Meyers which gladly is over quiet quickly.The finale is quiet simply nothing short of spectacular and really brought back some very vivid memories and of course highlights what a sad loss Freddie Mercury was when he was taken so young.Over all though BoRhap's flaws are far outweighed by its entertainment factor and makes for a good watch!"}, {"id": 593, "text": "I had been wanting to see the movie for a while and I heard a lot of different opinions, both positive and negative.

Maybe that was also a reason I was easier entertained than my friend who couldn't help but notice some small inconsistencies in the movie. Of course, it is very difficult to put Freddie's whole life plus Queen's career in only a 2-hour movie but I think they did a great job. What I find most important in a movie is that I have to be able to become almost part of the story. I love to really get into a movie so much, that I almost forget it's a movie. In this movie, they did an amazing job in bringing Freddie's fears and struggles to live. Freddie's loneliness in the movie was portrayed really strongly. It also helps that Rami's acting was incredibly good. To me, it would be scary to play such a legend because you know you will never be able to completely imitate him and I would be afraid that I would not do justice to Freddie's legacy. So I think it is brave that he did it and although his motoristics are not perfect, I thought it was really good. Sometimes I forgot I was looking at an actor and not Freddie himself.

I kept wondering if Brian May and Roger Taylor, the two original band members participating in the production, were too involved in how it played out. It's Mercury's story, of course, but the rest of the group is handled with such kid gloves that it's almost laughable. The worst thing said about Taylor is that he wrote a silly song about his car for the first album. Not that I'm looking for gossip, really; the whole thing is just so vanilla that a little grime and conflict would've gone a long way.

Had I listened to them, I would've missed out on one of my new favourite movies. Walking out of the theatre, I already wanted to watch it again so now I'm planning on buying the Blu-ray as soon as it gets released. Technically, it might have some flaws, but I can wholeheartedly say I fully enjoyed the movie from the very beginning to the end. And that's quite a compliment for a movie this long! The acting is stunning and the casting is impressively done. Rami Malek is one of the best actors out there, in my opinion, and did Freddie Mercury justice. He did an excellent job at embodying the legend, and he's deserving of winning the Oscar that he is nominated for. There were plenty of moments during the film that I was in awe of him. All of the actors were great!What they wanted to do with this movie was to honour Freddie and Queen, not making a full-on documentary about Freddie's life, as the critics complained about. I'm actually glad they didn't go down a dark path and instead focus on the highlights. But I'm also confused by how some critics think they shied away from the darker aspects of Mercury's life? I didn't feel like they did that at all. In fact, I think they handled it appropriately.I'm happy with the soundtrack as well. I honestly wouldn't mind if it had been three hours long. Plus, the recreation of Live Aid is spot-on.All in all, wonderful movie that made me happy and emotional, and gave me a bigger love for Queen. Ever since I saw the movie I've been listening to Queen songs on repeat.Well-deserving of the awards and recognition it is getting, including Rami Malek who delivered a high-quality performance."}, {"id": 596, "text": "Let me say straight off that I was never a fan of Queen or of Freddie Mercury, (too anthemic for my tastes), and I have always thought 'Bohemian Rhapsody' the most overrated song of all time, (though apparently the music press didn't think too highly of it when it came out and it was left to the public to make it a hit), so I approached Bryan Singer's Mercury/Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody with a certain amount of trepidation. You might say I went to scoff and stayed to cheer.As biopics go, it's reasonably conventional. We begin with Freddie about to go on stage at Live Aid then we flash back to the beginnings, circa 1970. It makes his talent clear from the start and it ticks all the right boxes as it chronicles Queen's rise and as a dip into the business known as showbusiness it's almost perfect. It's at its best when it dissects the songs, and in particular the title song, to show their genesis and, speaking as someone who never really liked them in the first place, all of this came as something of a revelation. I am now hearing Queen's songs in an entirely new light.Of course, Mercury is the central figure throughout and is virtually never off the screen. At first Rami Malek looks strangely bizarre, more like a young Mick Jagger, and those extra teeth don't help but as the film progresses he grows into the part. His foibles are basically overlooked while his minder and his manager become the villains of the piece. Freddie is positively Christ-like when set beside Allen Leech's Paul Prenter. Leech, best known from Downton Abbey, is superb here, a truly hissable villain if ever there was one while other members of the band are convincingly played by Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello. As the real love of Freddie's (early) life Lucy Boynton is excellent in an underwritten role.The film ends as it began with Queen's appearance at Live Aid and director Singer gives us the entire set, a rock-and-roll tour-de-force lasting a good twenty minutes or so. When it was over there wasn't a dry eye in the house, (mine included), while the elderly couple beside me stood and lead the cheers."}, {"id": 597, "text": "This was one of the best, emotional, thrilling bio movies that has been made of this lifetime. The reason why I say this, is that this movie is not just based on one-person Freddie Mercury, but this movie is about Queen, meaning all four members, how they came together, showed their talents and how each contributed to their group success. While I was watching this film, it felt like a rollercoaster as I was full of emotions from the start of the movie to the end of the movie.This film focuses on the group Queen and not just about the main star of the movie. So, you get to see how good Brian May is when he writes some of the songs and John Deacon and Roger Taylor. I went to watch this film again for the second time as it was a dream come true for me. I have been waiting for years for a Queen movie to come out and this movie was top. This film focused on how the group came together and showed some of the best moments of their life and some of the sad, bad moments of Freddie life.The film did not focus that much on the drama that was in Freddie life but it focused more on Queen. Watching this film made me thinking about how much I love Queen songs and I have once again started to listen to their songs and watching their tours again. The beginning of the film really sets the tone of the ending of the movie. Rami Malek who actors in Mr. Robot does a brilliant job of bring Freddie Mercury alive and throughout the film I really was thinking, wait is that really Freddie Mercury.Personal, I don't understand why some people give this film a bad rating or review, this film was the best tribute to Queen the music group and Freddie Mercury. This film once again did not focus too much on the bad things in his life but only the important things that happened in his life. You also get to see the experience of how they came together and how each of them came up with some of their and our most favourite big hit songs such as Bohemian Rhapsody, we will rock you, another one bites the dust, love of my life and we are the champions.You also get to see the birth of one of the greatest performers of all time in music history who to me is up there with Michael Jackson.So, to my fellow music fans, movie fans, queen fans, rock fans, please do not listen to the movie reviewers as I do not understand the little criticism of this movie.We need to now see a Beatles, Michael Jackson movie, like this movie which focus more on the music artist instead of focusing on the bad parts of their life.This movie is about Queen, all four members not just about Freddie Mercury and how he lived his life. Go and watch this movie. 10/10 rating. 5/5 starts."}, {"id": 598, "text": "It's inevitable. Multiple biopics are now created on a yearly basis, and will continue to be made until the end of time. In my opinion, if not a single writer can come up with an original concept, then exploring the true story of someone or something is far more interesting than remaking a classic film. Bohemian Rhapsody is the latest in a long line of already released and upcoming biopics-and it's one of the most enjoyable theatre experiences I've had all year. Already thinking I knew a lot about this story before going in, I was pleasantly surprised by quite a few aspects of this story. Whether or not you're a fan of the band Queen or not, this movie has the makings of a film that can please many viewers. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and here's why.I knew Bohemian Rhapsody was a movie that was going to heavily focus on Freddie Mercury over the rest of the band, which I thought was going to feel imbalanced, but the way his story is presented here makes it seem like his life had the most story to tell. From working at an airport to performing one of the most memorable concerts in history, this film takes you on a decade-long journey that's well worth your time. I was never bored, because it either wows you with spectacle, engages you with its drama, or has you guessing about where the film is going to take you next. It's not a perfect movie, but I think I can go as far as to say it's a perfectly made film in terms of its presentation.I'm always looking for a movie to break out of the cliched way of telling a biopic, but I will admit this film slightly suffers from that at times. It does feel like it jumps from year to year, simply hitting the most important aspects of Mercury's life, which is fine, but we've seen that structure throughout numerous films in the past. With that said, that's truly the only complaint I can come up with here. If you don't like listening to the music of Queen, then I feel that will also be a detriment to the movie for you, but that would just be personal taste anyway. For the movie that it is, it works extremely well.What surprised me the most about Bohemian Rhapsody was the performance by Rami Malek as the leading man. I've seen him countless times in the past, appearing as comedic relief in films like Need for Speed or the Night at the Museum franchise, but I've never seen him shine in a leading dramatic role before. If this performance doesn't put him on the map, I'm not sure what will, because I was blown away by his portrayal here. Even if this movie suffered from lazy writing or a lack of energy, Malek's performance would've still held my attention, and that says a lot, especially for someone who I never expected to perform like this.In the end, Bohemian Rhapsody benefits from great editing (which hardly jumps out at me very often), some very solid direction (controversy aside), concert sequences that will impress many viewers, and an overall brisk pacing, even with the lengthy run time. I had a blast watching this movie and even with all of the depressing elements of this story, it's always well-balanced with happier or energetic moments. Aside from the lead performance, I can't see this movie receiving many nominations, but I will say that I can see it becoming a fan favourite movie of 2018. This is the definition of a crowd-pleaser. Bohemian Rhapsody is a great theatre experience from start to finish."}, {"id": 599, "text": "The only one missing in my family to see this was the true Queen fan but she had to work. Instead my other sister, nephew and my mom went to go see this and for the first time in what I think is ever we are unanimously loved this movie. I thought it was outstanding.The film starts out with Rami Malek (brilliant performance) as Freddie Mercury going from his mansion to the Live Aid concert until we go back to see just how the band got there. This was what I had been wanting to see from the film and how closely it recreates it because it was an amazing event and I never seen so many people until I saw that video.There is not a dull moment in this film. I can't say it accurately portrays the band, but I remembered a lot of stuff like Freddie playing the piano from his bed, the fact that he was gay. and that the band didn't always get along. The climax of the film, by the way, doesn't disappoint and it's amazing how accurate it was with the real event.Before I close this review, I must talk about the performances. Everyone did a wonderful job in the film but I think everyone will remember Rami Malek's portrayal as Freddie Mercury the most. I swear every single time he was on screen it was like seeing Freddie Mercury come to life. The way he is on stage is exactly how Freddie Mercury was. I'm not sure if he was really singing or not, but either way, he deserves to be nominated and I would lose faith in the Academy completely if he isn't.Queen fan or not, everyone should check out this movie. It is very inspirational, and a good representation of what it's like in the business. Mike Myers also does a cameo (an obvious thank you note for having his film Wayne's World putting them back on the map) and I didn't even recognize him until later in the film.

Trust me (and the thousands of other great reviews here) DON'T read the critics.This movie is a testament to the patience of Brian and Roger who took their sweet time to make this movie a tribute to the late, great Freddie.All the actors are incredible and Rami must be up for Oscar nomination.

Anyone that loves the band, Freddie, or just movie making at its finest, then this film is definitely for you. I'll admit I was sceptical, and am late going to see it, foolishly, because this was one of the best films I have seen in years, it's moving, it's funny, interesting, and as it showcases their best music, it's a musical feast also. People will be talking about this movie for years to come, and in particular the performance of Rami Malek, who is nothing short of sensational as the fabulous frontman, the supporting cast are sensational too, Gwilym Lee, who I know from Midsomer Murders was a revelation as Brian May. I loved how it told the story, but it never focused too long on one aspect, it moved at a cracking pace, and allowed the real life story of Queen to be told, phenomenally.This shows that despite the rise of Giant TV companies giving us all we can watch at home, the Cinema industry is thriving more then ever.Bravo. 10/10"}, {"id": 602, "text": "Queens music was, is &amp; always shall be fantastic.

The real Roger is nothing like that!John Deacon is given so little to work with &amp; depicted as a dumb buffoon. The real John Deacon is a highly skilled musician!I am shocked May &amp; Taylor allowed this movie to go ahead its not flattering to them &amp; just serves as a music company promo docudrama rather than a proper tell a story about the band cinematic movie event.Massive letdown for me as a lifelong Queen fan."}, {"id": 603, "text": "Bohemian Rhapsody was probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. As a big Queen fan, I can say that some facts aren't really accurate in the timeline, but the movie was AMAZING.First of all, let's talk about the acting. God, Rami Malek's acting was absolutely incredible. He may not look exactly like Freddie, but he has the same expressions he had. I've seen other stuff with Rami, and he always was amazing, and BoRhap was no exception. The acting in general was really, really good too.Then, telling Freddie's life, I personally think they sugarcoated it too much. But it makes sense, since many young children were seeing it. Apart from that, it was pretty good.In conclusion, this movie was simply fantastic. I saw three times! And the music -I'm a big Queen fan- was incredible (duh). I really recommend it!"}, {"id": 604, "text": "I could not wait to see this film and was completely rewarded at it's completion. i have been a fan of the band my whole life, the music was always there. No matter which members have left us and those that remain, they are in the fans hearts forever and this movie explains precisely why.Story telling was great, acting was great, music was great, and the live reenactment was thrilling. I left the theater with only one question. Why did audiences forget that this is what a real band should be? I truly feel that contemporary music is tragically devoid of what Queen created and treated to the fans. Few bands create an audience like Queen and few bands have a fanbase that is so adept at knowing the catalog of music and the rhythm of a live concert. Live Aid is a great example of a well trained audience who loves a band with all their heart. Freddie said it best, they sing the song because it's true, favorite line of the movie.Ready for multiple watches of this film, Thank you."}, {"id": 605, "text": "Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. Open your eyes. Look up to the skies and see. These are just a few lyrics of the famous Queen song, Bohemian Rhapsody that is still one of the greatest songs of all time. In fact, there are a lot of songs by Queen I can recite including We Will Rock You, Radio Ga Ga, Under Pressure, and of course, We Are the Champions. Along with very catchy melodies, the bands prominence could not been without the vocal range of Freddy Mercury.That combination of an amazing voice and the right players is so prominent, that it was like catching lightning in a bottle. I can hardly come up with one good song let alone an entire catalog that still holds up. I had a lot of their stuff growing up, and even now, I still find myself going to Queen's music whenever I wanted some uplifting rock. Again, I think a lot of it rides on Freddy Mercury, who was one of the few people in existence who was destined for greatness. If a genius like Mozart has a great movie like Amadeus, perhaps Freddy Mercury can be replicated with the biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody.In 1970, we open with an Indian-British man then known as Farrokh Bulsara, before he became Freddy Mercury (played by Rami Malek) who works as a baggage handler at an airport. He goes to a nightclub where he sees a band called Smile playing. When their lead singer leaves the group, Freddy meets guitarist Brian May (played by Gwilym Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (Played by Ben Hardy) and offers to be their new lead singer. They agree, get a new bassist John Deacon (played by Joseph Mazzello) and rename their band Queen.They play nightclubs, and Freddy's voice and onstage persona get the bands fame to quick success. At the same time, Freddy even gets engaged with Mary Austin (played by Lucy Boynton). Even when their original label refuses to release Bohemian Rhapsody as a single, they manage to make it a hit and their fourth album A Night at the Opera is their biggest. During this time however, Freddy questions his sexuality when he begins an affair with his manager Paul. This pushes Freddy away from the band in favor of him looking for Somebody to Love.You'd think that a movie about Freddy Mercury would be a grand, almost operatic like experience. For what it is, Bohemian Rhapsody is fine. Its not a great movie, but it was entertaining. It was said that the real life band members wanted the movie the focus on them all, but most people really want to know Freddy. We get some idea, thanks to the amazing performance of Rami Malek. Even if his makeup can look a little off, he still captures the excitement and flamboyance while making him human. I'm glad they dubbed him instead of trying to recreate his singing voice, as most people would have spotted it immediately.So if the actor had got it right, what's wrong with the movie? Its not that the movie is bad, but that it's like any other music biopic. We see the group form, try and write and record music, get it on the radio, perform tours, see people come and go, see them return and settle their differences. I know the movie wanted to show the story of Queen, but we've come far within telling those stories. I was happy and satisfied, but something still felt missing. The best I can describe was that while it does a good job imitating Queen and Freddy Mercury, it always feels like an imitation.Think back to other music movies like Love &amp; Mercy and the remake of A Star is Born. Both movies showed the trials of being an artist, what that means for the people around them, and the pressure of living up to that fame. Part of me still deosn't know much about Freddy Mercury other then he was bisexual and loved to throw parties. In fact, the furthest I got was that most of the members of Queen were college nerds who formed a group.I'll give this six A Night at the Opera albums out of ten. The movie has good moments (including an amazing recreation of Live Aid that was the highlight of the film) and even give you the story of Queen. While I think Queen fans are going to want more, most people will probably be happy. It does deliver what it promises and does so fine. So I do recommend this anyway if you like Queen. The show must go on, so see it and see if it's worthy of singing We are the Champions"}, {"id": 606, "text": "First of all, some people here - the most fanatical fans of Queen - have to stop writing two-sentence reviews, like genius movie, Oscar for Rami Malek &amp; give 10 stars, because this is what makes the review biased and dishonest. I'm also a fan of Queen and Freddy himself, but the same time I graduated film school and I love cinema, that's why I also like to be as objective as possible in my reviews of movies. Here I will try to make my criticism honest, substantive, and not too long (so that everyone wants to read it).Yes, sometimes professional film critics are deliberately malicious, and their opinions are detached from reality, but sometimes they are also right, and in the case of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', this is the second.The film distorts a lot of facts from Freddy and Queen's life, and if these were unimportant events - I would not care at all, but these are important things and especially in a biographical film this should not be done, just to make the movie more dramatic. Fred's life was dramatic enough, if only the creators of the film really wanted to make an interesting movie, they would go even deeper into Mercury's childhood and the fact he escaped with his family, against persecution, from his own homeland. And this in turn could be the starting point / foundation for a deeper, better portrait of the Queen singer.Unfortunately, there is no depth here, the worst part is that this film is schematic, completely flat, only glides over important topics, does not carry out any serious psychological analysis of such a fascinating, complicated character that Freddy was. I don't accept excuses of the most fanatical fans of Queen (who cannot come to terms with the fact that many critics / reviewers, very rightly criticize this movie), that this is the story of the band and not Mercury himself. Because firstly, one does not exclude the other: it was possible to include in the scenario a deeper analysis / truth about Freddy and the band, and secondly the band's history is also poorly told. The best moment of a rather boring, long-lasting, first half of the movie is the recording of '' Bohemian Rhapsody '', a humorous accent with a rooster and Galileo. The rest is a fast, also quite jumping and chaotic montage of musical scenes depicting, carelessly, subsequent tours and writing of individual hits, and while I understand that in a 2-hour movie it is not possible to show each creative process in the smallest detail, it was still possible to show it better from the pov of the characters - band members, thus also build better and deeper characters in this film.The second half is better, I admit, both in terms of pace and in terms of writing/story, and the icing on the cake is the Live Aid concert, so really the edn. The performance, photos, acting of the main actor is at the highest level in this scene, unfortunately it is not enough to save this movie from failure.Malek's acting, imo, certainly doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination. He tries his best with an empty and schematic scenario, and the writers / director's mistakes are not his fault, true, but Oscar is an award for outstanding acting performances, which are not limited to robotic mannerism, it must be accompanied by the psychological, emotional depth of the portrayed character, and there is no such depth in this film, in this main character. The only really emotional scene that attempts to penetrate into Freddy's soul is the scene of conversation between Fred&amp; Mary, first at Fred's house and then in the rain. It is here, that Malek's creation is the truest and the best.Unfortunately, when we look at this role through the prism of the whole film, majority of Malek's work is the mentioned mechanical mannerism - perfectly recreated- but it is not enough to rate this role positively, let alone reward it with an Oscar nomination. Imitative mannerism, gestures, faces alone - it is only a skeleton, an acting sketch, especially in a biographical film, and not a full, beautiful, complex image, which should be any biography. There is simply no soul in this act, and it's just a crime if you play a figure as extraordinary, colorful and complicated as Freddy Mercury. In addition to the obvious mistakes of screenwriters and director, Malek himself (for me), does not rise to the task. Sometimes he is just Mercury caricature, and large, artificial teeth don't help to erase this impression, in fact, the opposite. The make-up department didn't do good job here, famous teeth of Queen frontman could have been done better, much more subtly, it would look less ridiculous. Returning to Rami Malek - he is still a young talent who - like any actor - needs more workshop and acting experience, plus really good material, to really shine. That is why I predict Rami Malek will not win an Oscar.I still think that the great mistake of the Bohemian Rhapsody creators, was to part ways with Sacha Baron Cohen. When I found out that he had left Mercury's biography project, I felt it was a big mistake from film producers, because I was sure Cohen wanted to tell an uncompromising, interesting story, not forcedly smoothed , and it seems, my intuition did not disappoint me then. Cohen, a remarkable &amp; colorful character like Freddy, would have fit in perfectly in this role. In addition, after hearing the interview, in which Cohen told why he finally left the movie and what vision of Mercury he had - I regret even more that it was not him who played the Queen main singer. People, who can't stand Cohen (they don't understand him) say it's good that he was replaced by Malek, because Sacha supposedly only meant/wanted controversy and scandals, that he would show Freddy only as crazy sex addict, taking drugs and nothing else. However, all of this are just primitive attacks, not supported by logic.Whoever saw 'Borat' and really understood the message behind it, knows that Cohen is an extremely conscious and intelligent actor / artist, at the same time, I will repeat: extraordinary like Freddy. He is a master of imitation, a master of using various accents, a great actor and, additionally, he can sing very well - which he showed in his role in '' Les Mis\u00e9rables ''. Cohen's strengths don't end there, because physically, with stature, he is much closer to Freddy (who was a well-built man) than frail Malek, has naturally dark eyes and hair, and with a bit of characterization, I have no doubt that he could have been the most wonderful Freddy Mercury. What's more, if he was allowed to do what he wanted with this role - to portray Freddy as a complicated, controversial figure, with a great appetite for life, but also a great artist who mixed the big ego with great sensitivity and shyness - I have no doubt that it would be a great role. Now it's just a missed opportunity.As a result, we got schematic, polite movie, ironically - because Freddy Mercury, as well as the entire Queen, were as original, unapologetic and creative as you could be and deserve much better. Sorry, but real Queen fan, who wanted raw, real, complex, deep, uncompromising truth and story - just cannot like this movie. Mercury and all the Queen story has so much potential (wasted in this movie), which is weird to say and how it all turned out, considering living Queen members were involved in this movie. Sorry guys, you did awful job. I guess I'll just wait for another movie, bold and great this time, I hope."}, {"id": 607, "text": "I was already convinced after my first time watching it that any Queen fan would love this film. It left my friends and me emotional and enthused.My mum, a long-time Queen fan (she has even seen them live in 1982) and her best friend, talking about the movie non-stop even months before it came out and absolutely enthralled after seeing it two times already, had this idea to organize a private Bohemian Rhapsody screening at our local cinema. About 150 people can fit into this small venue and we were inviting people left and right, friends, family, telling them all to bring their friends and family.In the end, we actually had an entire room filled; around 115 of our own people showed up and the variety was remarkable: We had anyone between the age of 7 and 85; men, women, teenagers, parents, grandparents, long-time Queen-fans and people who only knew a song or two. By far not everyone considered themselves a Queen fan, some merely came along for a nice Sunday evening at the movies. In the end, the room was packed, the rest of the seats were given to some confused visitors.A movie screening with friends and familiy is definitely worth it, the atmosphere was brilliant and I still had goosebumps after my third time seeing it. What is so special about this film is that it really does bring the generations together. Many of my friend's parents (I am 22) came along for nostalgic reasons and because they actually remember this time. Others were music fans or hobby musicians and loved the movie as a musical spectacular. But like I mentioned already, some people saw the film with no expectations whatsoever and they were still ALL blown away. I have not recieved a single complaint or bad word about the film.In conclusion can be said that the people truly have spoken. A big group of various age and taste was enchanted and highly entertained by Bohemian Rhapsody and that's why I can wholehartedly say that this film is absolutely amazing and a blast for anyone who sees it, not only fans.It really does do justice to a bunch of true legends. Cheers x"}, {"id": 608, "text": "The only person who could play Freddie Mercury better than Rami Malek would be Freddie Mercury himself. I was blown away by the cast of Bohemian Rhapsody. The story was incredibly well written and there was never a lull. The cast meshed together so well and I think that made their ability to perform playing legends like Queen even better. This was the first time I've seen Rami Malek's acting but I know he's been on the radar for years. His ability to transform into Freddie Mercury goes beyond makeup &amp; wardrobe. His mannerisms and the confidence you know Freddie Mercury for having were so important for whatever Actor ended up with the part to nail. The efforts they made to recreate their iconic Live Aid performance was incredible. There were times when I actually became overwhelmed watching Rami Malek play Freddie. He was one of the most talented musicians in history and it's a huge task to try living up to that but it was like Rami Malek was born to play this role. He was just that incredible. It's especially apparent at the end of the film where old footage of Freddie Mercury performing with Queen is played as the credits roll. I got my intro to Queen after begging my mom to buy me Wayne's World when I was 12. Until last year when the announcement this biopic was in the works I didn't even realize I was a Queen fan. I clicked on a Queen greatest hits album that was trending on iTunes only to discover that songs I'd been listening to whenever they came on the radio were not by different bands as I had thought. Queen was just so exceptionally talented that their sound never stopped evolving and it was impossible to hear a song by them and know right away who the artist is. If you're debating seeing this movie, stop. Get in your car, and go to the theater. Zero regrets. If Rami Malek doesn't at least earn a Best Actor nomination for his role as Freddie Mercury this year I won't even bother watching the Academy Awards. Personally, I think they ought to just give it to him now. He's was simply the perfect man to play Freddie."}, {"id": 609, "text": "I knew very little about Queen before seeing this movie and wasn't familiar with their music aside from their top 10 hits. I mainly wanted to go because I was a big fan of Rami Malek's from watching Mr. Robot. I was also infatuated with how completely Malek seemed to embody Freddie Mercury in the side-by-side comparison photos I kept seeing for the film.While I was mostly riveted throughout the whole film, thanks to Malek's dedication to the character, I was disappointed repeatedly each time it would get to an interesting aspect of Freddie's life, such as his relationship with his parents, only to have the scene end a minute or two later and then it would cut back to the studio.Multiple times throughout the film I felt like I was watching a VH1 behind the scenes documentary of Queen rather than a biopic of Freddie Mercury. This feeling was cemented when the last 20 minutes of the movie was used to recreate an uncut Live Aid performance easily viewable on YouTube. I would have much rather they condensed the Live Aid performance into a 5-minute highlight montage and used the other 15 minutes to share more of Mercury's off-stage life. The cinematography was wonderful though for a lot of the performance scenes. A lot of swooping that made you feel like a bird watching the shows. A couple of the shots took my breath away.Despite these shortcomings, I absolutely loved this movie. It might have only touched on Freddie Mercury's life but it made me laugh, it made me cry and even better, it ignited a curiosity about Freddie and the band that has resulted in me listening to every Queen album repeatedly. I now completely understand why this band, and especially Mercury, were worth making a movie about. It's not often I come across a band who is so experimental musically, has such a charismatic, engaging, talented front man and encourages each other to pursue personal projects as well. This band got each other and embraced their differences rather than allow them to cause a divide.I guess in that way the movie succeeded because it led me to become a huge fan of their lesser known music and I have a whole new admiration and respect for Queen. Freddie Mercury was incredibly private and protective of his personal life. Since this film was helmed by his loyal surviving band mates, it only makes sense that the film feels like a tribute rather than an expos\u00e9."}, {"id": 610, "text": "I'm not a fan of Queen. I like a few songs but rarely listen to them. In addition, I do not like biographical films about bands. A few hours ago I left the theater completely dismembered. I would not go so far as to place Bohemian Rhapsody among the best films of all time, and I can not rate it a straight ten because it has its flaws, but I do not want to analyze it, because this time the technicalities are completely irrelevant. Although one part around the middle was quite boring, it could not spoil the overall impression. The great selection of actors and their even better performances, excellent music and some of the best songs ever written, and perfect balance of touching drama and good humor completely hypnotized me, so I spent most of the film either in tears or loudly laughing, and often both simultaneously. A little more than two hours flew by in a flash and left the impression that will hold me for days. Do not miss the opportunity to see this film at the cinema, unless you have a really superb sound system at home.9/10"}, {"id": 611, "text": "The 91st annual Oscar ceremony will be held soon, in the list of the main contenders for a number of awardsthere is Brian Singer film Bohemian Rhapsody. I deliberately endured a pause, waited until the first waves of delight and anger subside, carefully watched the movie in the original, all of more than two hours and now I would like to express my opinion on this biopic. Remember the 1991 Oliver Stone film called Doors - there was still thin Val Kilmer playing Jim Morrison? After so many years, all the flaws of that picture become apparent. In the foreground, Jim himself, the other participants are registered superficially and as if passing by. Then, in 1991, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore were somewhat offended by the fact that in the film about the group of the group itself there could have been more about themselves. And now the new biopic, now about the Queen group - one of my favorite and respected ones. I am 47 years old, and I found the period when the group still existed and released their later albums (1989 and 1991). Many of us watched the 1986 concert film Live in Budapest several times. We remember that real group, we saw Freddie on the screen and saw who he was. And those of us who started to study the team's biography thoughtfully understood that Queen is not only Freddie. This is Freddie, Brian, John and Roger. All four wrote songs and played on a variety of instruments. And when Mercury died, the group quickly turned into ... well, into a parody of itself. Arguably, one can argue, but all later releases with George Michael, Paul Rogers and now with Adam Lambert are, in essence, a quality hack. The Queen were from the same breed as the Beatles - remove at least one member, and everything will immediately collapse. Then Ione can argue, but what about the enthusiastic reaction of May and Taylor on the film with Ramey Malek? The answer is very simple - another chance to bask in the glow of past glory. Name at least one thing from the post-Mercury-post-Deacon Queen and so on the same scale as the records of 1973-1991. Do even try to recall. So. Singer film. What we got in the end? Enchanting nonsense for 120 minutes for the audience of the 21st century, having the most fragmented understanding of Freddie and the whole group. An objection can immediately be heard here - yes, but in 4 hours the whole history of the group cannot be shown. Well, and who prevented to focus on, say, two significant moments in the history of the group - the recording of the 1975 album A Night at the Opera and on the performance at the Live Aid concert in 1985? Instead, we saw a chaotic race through the long history of the team, with incredible jumps from 1973 to 75, from 1980 suddenly in 1977, and so on. I have not yet spoken about the grossly factual errors. Among the most egregious are, for example, John Deacon on bass as part of Smile, or selling a van to get money to record a debut disc, or a completely wild moment learning a We Will Rock You song in the year of 1980, although the thing itself was written and recorded in 1977 or John Deacon, suddenly singing in studio recordings. Well, okay, viewers in their mass don't give a damn about all these delights, probably. Well, maybe the actors were great then? Not so. Ramey Malek as Freddie is not even a joke, it is a pure farce brought to the point of absurdity. A slender young man with very noticeable artificial teeth mannerates and grimaces for two hours, trying to portray a singer who, even in the years of same-sex relationships, radiated masculinity and strength. Immediately, we see a certain vocalist, who had fallen into Smile from where (all Freddie's early musical projects were simply ignored) (and by the way, it was possible to spend more time on Tim Staffell,) just as quickly changing his relationship with a girl for romance with men, and then throwing up absurd parties ... and so on, swiftly and at the top, skipping important events and moments of biography. For some reason, it reminded me of the hackneyed clich\u00e9 of a number of books and films about the path of a genius - lack of understanding of relatives, the way up, excesses, painful searches for themselves, psychological drama. And yes, all this is present in the Rhapsody. Well, but what about the other members of the group? Actually, can they save the movie? No, they do not save. May is shown as such a good-natured brat with no special character traits, Taylor is d epicted as that kind of cutie, worn off with one of his songs and suddenly fiercely quarreling with Freddie, and Deacon just looks like occasionally talking furniture. Oh yeah, he's showing the song on the bass. Next thing on him - silence. The critics are absolutely right in one issue - Malek is trying very hard, but he overplays terribly, the beautiful picture does not carry any content with it. Instead of a truly interesting team history, we absorb a bright and mannered video clip with small pieces of facts. Clip feed for clip generation. And one more thing - Live Aid was undoubtedly important for the band in terms of reviving interest in their music. But in general, they could even asa solo event gather 130,000 spectators, as was the case in 1988 in Brazil, for example. What can be said in conclusion? Alas, the film was completely unsuccessful, in my opinion - a complete failure. I do not recommend watching at all, well, except for fun. My rating is 1 out of 10 (I give a point for the music of the group that sounds in the film)."}, {"id": 612, "text": "A truly moving story of one of the most loved musicians of all time. Story, casting, everything, was executed beautifully. Easily the best film to ever exist under this genre. The live aid performance was mimicked with outstanding accuracy, the acting of the entire band was utterly superb. And the constrast between happy Feddie and broken Freddie was immaculate.The only con of this movie is maybe the duration of the songs during the film, as I thought each one finished pretty quickly. They should have expanded the screen time of Live aid to make it more moving than it was (it was already quite moving but could have been better).Overall, a fantastic film, normal people would find it entertaining.

Key scenes in this are completely untrue and therefore the motivations behind the actions we seen aren't true. In the end its a largely fictional account of Queen.So many biopic movies fail on focusing on the behind-the-scene stuff, which is what we are all interested in. I don't need to see a Queen tribute band perform, I can see the real thing on YouTube.

Yet, what touches foremost is the love story of Freddie and his soul mate Mary, played by radiantly strong Lucy Boynton.While lying in bed together after Freddie dazzled in Queen's concert, he confesses to Mary that the only place where I'm not afraid is performing on stage. Mary loves Freddie. Still discovering his amazing voice through his music, he suffers in his inauthenticity, in his sexuality.After returning from a lengthy Queen tour, Freddie discloses his sexuality to Mary. He says, You are almost everything... Mary is heartbroken. 'Almost' is never enough. That visceral sense of sadness resonates in Director Bryan Singer's Bohemian Rhapsody.This very much is Bryan's film, although the studio fired him before the movie's completion. Another director completed the filming for theatrical release. Openly gay Bryan poignantly reminds: Finding and accepting your distinct voice is scary regardless of gay or straight. Announcing who you are to the world is terrifying for all of us. Bryan, Rami and Lucy compassionately say that we try to love ourselves and gift from what is within us. Freddie Mercury brilliantly did that.Freddie Mercury died of AIDS at 45 years old. I was a huge fan of Freddie back in high school. Freddie had flamboyant charisma and the voice of an angel. I found cathartic joy in Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You or We Are the Champions. Although, Queen's music represented freedom, it ironically cloaked Freddie's suffering: To be himself. In his journey Rami astounds as Freddie.Accepting his life's deception, Rami's Freddie tells Mary in the pouring rain, I'm happy for you. Lucy's tearful visage is her hope that Freddie discovers his own joy in life. Bryan Singer's narrative is about healing as Freddie sees what he has become and his fate. Rami is powerful vulnerability and humanity. You see his soulfulness in his eyes. You hear it in his voice. He beautifully regenerates the late Freddie's immortal sound. Rami expresses Freddie's vibrant spirit that captivated us all those years ago.Bohemian Rhapsody begins in London with young design student and Heathrow baggage laborer Freddie. He's the son of the Parsi family, followers of the Zoroastrian faith. Traditional Father Bromi, played by solid Ace Bhatti, disapproves of his son's choice not to follow in his professional footsteps. Freddie wants to be a rock star.His opportunity arises when guitar god Brian May, played by compassionately wise Gwilym Lee, needs a lead singer for his band. Brian and drummer Roger Taylor, played by spritely Ben Hardy, take a chance on Freddie. While joining the band, Freddie falls for beautiful kind Mary. Freddie eventually meets Paul, played by subversively charming Allen Leech, who reveals as the duplicitous seducer.At times Anthony McCarten's screenplay veers into the indulgent excess of the 'rock star' life, coming across as caricature. Yet, his narrative has the authentic feel for the creation of music as when Brian stamps out the beat for We Will Rock You.In the end Anthony and Bryan create profound compassion for Freddie Mercury: Whether he is free to express his voice in the world, regardless of what others think. We care whether Freddie finds true love, again. Bohemian Rhapsody is full of sound, sadness, and joy. It will rock you, too."}, {"id": 615, "text": "This film is absolutely brilliant and deserves all the credit it can get. I was born in 93, after the amazing Freddie passed away and Queen was no more, but as a kid growing up with my parents playing their Queen albums, I was a fan. I went to see this movie thinking it would be good and nice to hear the Queen songs within the film and to get an understanding of the history of the band and Freddie as I wasn't around to see this. What I didn't expect was to feel as if I had been catapulted back 30 years before I was born to the era of Queen and feel as if I was sat within a live Queen concert. All the cast are brilliant and it's actually, at times, a very funny film which really shows the loving family vibe which the band had for each other. Rami is amazing in this film. Every look at the camera and every strut mirrored freddie and many times I forgot I was watching a movie about Queen and that Rami wasn't the real Freddie on the screen in front of me. So proud of the cast. Give the film an Oscar and give Rami an Oscar. It will be well and truly deserved. I do recommend seeing this film in a cinema or with a good surround sound system as then you will receive the full magic of this film.

So far it is the only movie I went to see twice in the cinema. I will be getting a copy when DVD will be released. Also, I have been on Queen spree: all available YouTube Videos, non-stop music while driving. I have been humming and singing... What other band can do this to you? Personally I have been listening to Queen's music since i was about 10 or 11. I am so glad this tribute to Freddie and Queen was made. It is now one of my top 5 movies of all time! P.S. If you need another proof how amazing Queen's music is - go to YouTube to 2017 Green Day's concert. Before it started 65000 crowd was singing Bohemian Rhapsody. No band on the stage just music through the speakers! What other musician or band could move and unite people as Freddie and Queen did?"}, {"id": 617, "text": "After reading a lot of reviewers disagreeing with critics, I decided to read a couple myself. In short, the users are right. I'll try to explain why.When a person approaches a movie, expectations play a huge role in creating the final impression. It's obvious from the way the reviews are written that critics expected an overblown drama, a gay anthem, or a politically correct liberal revelation. The film is neither of these and more importantly, it was never meant to be.When you think of the movie, you need to remember who produced it--the band. They wanted a tribute to Fredie and Queen, a monument, a celebration. The drama is there, but the film does not try to think for the spectator, to make conclusions. Instead, it presents the events and lets you feel them from your own viewpoint. And that's a very brave thing to do from an artistic standpoint in today's world.Just like Queen's life work, the movie features drama, comedy, documentalism, pure humanly fun, whit, and so much more. Think of it as the cinematographic counterpart of a Queen album, made by Queen, for Queen, and about Queen and simply enjoy it."}, {"id": 618, "text": "This is a fabulous film from start to finish.

And the greatest live performance in the history of rock and pop. That was so the right decision. It begins and ends with Queen's crowning glory, not with the tragedy or the tortured soul within that brilliant body.Rami Malek is absolutely sensational. He is supported by other brilliant performances especially Lucy Boynton and Gwilym Lee as Freddie's wife Mary and Brian May respectively. But it's Malek who fittingly steals the show.

But we were able to listen to the West German radio stations and to watch West German TV. It was an open secret. Even the fckg Stasi couldn't do anything against that. So Bohemian Rapsody was released when I was seven years old. I think the first Queen song I was aware sung by a band called Queen was We will rock you. I was nine years old. But smashs like Another one bites the dust or Under Pressure didn't find many sellers in (West-) Germany. And then end of 1983 Radio Ga Ga  came into my life. Wow! What a song! Queen used fat synthesizers that I already loved because bands like OMD, Depeche Mode or Yaz(oo). So I was 16 at the time The Works-Album was released, with hits like Radio Ga Ga, my Queen favourite of all time I want to break free or Hammer to fall. Every playlist in every club, at every party contained Queen for sure. In the 80's you couldn't go anywhere without listening Queen songs, even in East Germany. In 1986 Highlander OST followed including classics as A Kind of Magic or Who wants to live forever. Then in 1989 Queen released The Miracle-Album and smash hits as I want it all, Breakthru and The Invisible Man. Less than a half year after its release the infamous, damned fckg Berlin wall fell. And a 22-year-old boy (who dreamed about and demonstrated for that in late '89) suddenly was free to travel and to do anything he wants. Me. One of the first CDs I bought after was Greatest Hits I, so I learned to know Under Pressure and others. So we come to my words about this brilliant movie. Rami Malek's performance is outstanding, awesome, breathless, whatever in this direction. I already loved him in the Mr. Robot series. On Sunday, two days ago, he won an Oscar for his Freddie Mercury acting in Bohemian Rhapsody. Enough said. Great! So often you think of the real Freddie automatically. Rami here IS Freddie! And all the band members were great in their acting and they looked like the originals! And all the support actors did a great job too! Perfect. PERFECT! My last three 10/10 ratings were How to train a Dragon? (2010), One Life (Animal documentary) (2011) and Ted (2012). Until this film. I have to give it 10 out of 10.

Everything from his mannerisms to his voice. There is such a vulnerability to his performance, the emotion pours out of him in every scene, whether he has thousands in the palm of his hand on stage, or the loneliness and heartbreak in search of acceptance and companionship. Remy elicits the utmost emotion from every scene.Freddie Mercury defied the critics when he wanted to be something other than a rock band. The greatest front man of all time, a national treasure. The same can now be said of Remy Malek. A Hugely talented actor with the world at his feet. Best Actor is a must for him. Fully deserved."}, {"id": 621, "text": "I saw the film, not knowing any critic or public reviews. I expected a good film - but what I got was a fantastic experience, that few films of any genre deliver these days.I am not even a Queen fan - I am 51 at time of writing so grew up knowing and liking many of their hits since I was a kid in the 70s. I have bought only a few of their greatest hits albums over the years. However, I always understood what fans saw in the band, appreciated the many catchy hits, and felt Freddie Mercury one of the best showman and singers of 'our' time.Now, I know the Queen Live Aid performance pretty well; have seen it many times and could never get over how in such a short time any band can command a crowd's attention so superbly and emotionally (and a crowd that is not even a Queen fanbase, at that). What the film did with this performance was absolutely astonishing, from the obvious stage coverage of the band, which was brilliantly done (right down the the Pepsi and beer on the piano, and Freddie playing with the camera man) to the swoops over the stadium, the whole stage layout, and the crowd close-ups singing along. This whole segment was pristine film-making.The film, at the beginning, gives a teaser of the Live Aid performance, and then hops back to the start of the band's formation and Freddie's story as the main thread. Everything feels well-paced; we get glimpses of various songs in the making, the recording, the concerts, the band arguments and of course the many surrounding characters that make up the story - the managers, girlfriends, record execs, hangers-on and so on. All are well played and I felt there is a good balance between the personal, the music and the show-biz elements of the story. I could have done with a bit more focus on more songs and studio time, but accept they can only pack in so much. Now, evidently things are not portrayed 100% as they really happened; perhaps he didn't sing in the car park; perhaps they didn't split up and reunite exactly in the way depicted - but does that really matter? There will be plenty of documentaries that fill that gap just fine. This is entertainment first and foremost.The casting was spot on in every respect except perhaps Bob Geldof (I felt they could have done a bit better with him, but he is a very particular type, so must have been tricky). All the band are excellently played - and without a doubt Rami as Freddie is a performance that you don't often see. He nails it in so many ways - and there are many facets to nail, it is hard to imagine any actor getting all of it right - the gestures, the voice, the looks, the concert showman-ship, the overall personality. I hope he gets what he deserves for all that hard work, and I'm sure we will see a lot more of him in future (quite how he will top this I don't know though).There is no doubt I will be getting some kind of DVD with Bonus Materials when it is available (hope they do a good 'making of'), and enjoying this film many times in future. As for now, I have added 'A Night at the Opera' on vinyl to my Christmas list for Santa.

The same goes for the other members of the band, especially Gwilym Lee. It's really hard to tell the difference between him and Brian May. Whether you are a Queen fan or not, you probably agree with me that there is no better live performance than Queen's performance at Live Aid and the way it all culminated in the end, it would really be difficult for you to not shed a tear, even if you are heartless. That performance right at the end, even your goosebumps would get goosebumps and the movie is filled with many a moment like that. This isn't just a movie. This is a celebration of the life of one of the greatest legends that ever walked the earth. You must watch the movie. I'm sorry. You must experience* the movie. Calling the experience surreal would be an understatement. When the song came out back then, it got panned by the critics. Guess what, they turned out to be wrong. Utterly. When the movie came out now, it got panned by the critics. And guess what, they turned out to be wrong again. They are all just a bunch of losers with loser opinions.

It never quite manages to do so, however, despite a blistering lead performance. It always seems to just scrape the surface of the man's psyche, only occasionally dipping a little deeper into his inner workings but still never really coming close to painting a clear picture of his out-of-spotlight self. Instead of focusing fully on this, the piece just glosses past important moments and relationships in order to get back to the 'fun' stuff, ultimately coming across as pretty shallow (especially when you stop to think about it). Thankfully, though, that 'fun stuff' consists of a series of admittedly check-list and narratively flimsy, yet undeniably entertaining, scenes in which we're treated to the origin of several key Queen tracks and then given a performance of each of them, or even a full twenty-minute live-aid concert, all presented in ear-pleasing surround-sound. The only downside to these sequences is that the actors are lip-syncing the songs, despite having performed them properly on the day. While this allows us to hear Queen in all their glory, it does take away from the believability of the picture in some key moments and gives off an ever-so-slightly disingenuous feel; the characters in the film aren't the same as their real-life counterparts, no matter how well they represent them, and they aren't really singing. Still, as I mentioned, hearing these songs blasted from a cinema-quality sound-system is a treat; it really is difficult not to smile when they're being played. It's not like the film is ever unenjoyable, either, even in its most 'check-list' or hollow of moments. It also doesn't scream troubled production, despite being the very definition of the term behind-the-scenes. The most you can tell it's a tale of two (or three) minds is in the sometimes strange post-production choices, which are clearly Fletcher's doing. Overall, while the movie isn't always deep, it definitely could've been deeper, and it strangely misses out a significant chunk of its star's life, it's ultimately an entertaining time that will certainly please fans of the band. 6/10"}, {"id": 624, "text": "Watching this movie was like drinking a flat, stale beer. it was too expensive to ditch, but I wasn't enjoying it, and I felt no buzz (despite any 'oscar buzz'). It's very poorly constructed, with most of the scenes being fabricated fiction rather than fact (so don't get excited; it never happened that way).I rarely felt like I was watching Freddie Mercury. Only in a few concert scenes shot from a distance. The buck teeth prosthetic was too extreme, and kept distracting me (freddie's weren't as pronounced), as did the grey/blue eyes of the actor (Freddie's were very dark brown). It was very hard for me to believe that this blue-eyed Caucasian was Indian. They really should have cast an Indian actor, because in scenes with his family, he looks like he was adopted. However, I did think that the actors who played the drummer and lead guitarist did exceptional jobs. They and the actress who plays Mary were the only thing worth watching. (Though Mike Myer's appearance was entertaining as well.)I was very disappointed in this movie. It could have been so much better. But it's basically a collection of mediocre Youtube videos from a mediocre tribute act.Three stars are for the star performances of Gwilim Lee, Ben Hardy, and Lucy Boynton, and a half-star for Mike Meyers (entertaining, but too similar to the Shrek voice). The rest all combined was only worth a half star.The biggest let down of all, is how they chose to fabricate series of events, rather than portray them accurately,which was way more interesting and entertaining than the fictional series of events they came up with."}, {"id": 625, "text": "With a lack of substance in tandem with a stale presentation, this film left me bored and pissed off. Simply put Bohemian Rhapsody is the worst film I have seen all year and left me not only wanting to see Sacha Baron Cohen's Queen film but literally any other director take the helm but the utterly incompetent Bryan Singer.Bohemian Rhapsody is a film that depicts the story of Queen and primarily Freddie Mercury, from the origins of the band all the way to their performance at Live Aid in 1985. It shows many of the band most iconic moments like their global tours and the creation of of the titular song Bohemian Rhapsody. It attempts to show the dynamic of the members, the rise and eventual fall of the band. I say attempt intentionally because in my opinion this film fundamentally fails at building any form of compelling narrative. Firstly I want to point out two things, I am not the final judge on whether this film does justice to Queen or justice to Freddie Mercury. I don't know the band personally and I'm not informed enough on the story to make that decision. I also wanted to say that I have heard various reports on how inaccurate the film is and whatnot . I am not in tune enough with the story to know how severe these inaccuracies are and personally I have no issue with a film creating creative liberties to improve itself.A biopic should be more interesting than the story it is trying to tell already is. Take for example First Man, this biopic of Neil Armstrong is true to life certainly but you also get a grasp of who Armstrong was, visually the film is stunning and the characters and script is well written and entertaining. This gives me a reason to watch the film rather than just read the Wikipedia page. The same cannot be said for Bohemian Rhapsody which I honestly just found boring. There are many reasons as to why it is boring but it mostly comes down to the pacing for me. The film is way too long and is tortuously boring. There is long segments where very little happens and as it trudged along at a snails pace I could only marvel at how little substance was stretched out to a two hour film. Not only is this film severely lacking in much quantity but also in any form of general artistic direction. It constantly feels pointless and as though it doesn't even know what it's building towards. This creates what I feel is the real issue of the film, the fact that it's just not entertaining. It is merely fun in the sense that you can look at bright colours and listen to Queen music for two hours.I really was hoping that Rami Malek would ,perhaps not save this film, but at least pull it up a bit and I don't think he necessarily did a bad job, I thought his mannerisms and voice inflections were masterfully performed. However I think Malek couldn't really give it his all with the script he had. I had a major issue with the script and I saw vividly how far it dragged the film down. I am not entirely sure if the film uses real dialogue from the band or not but it all sounded incredibly over dramatic and overtly simply written. For a film that had real people to base itself on, it really cannot create compelling or fun characters. Now I'm not the verdict on whether these characters are true to life or not however I do think they are vitally flawed and miss a lot of the steps in character based narrative. An amazing example of this is Brian May who in the film serves no other purpose other than he was actually there in real life, after two hours I still have no clearer image of who this character is or what significance he has in the story other than playing guitar. The most perplexing part about this is that this is a common theme for every single character. I was astounded to find absolutely no well written or interesting characters. This is particularly surprising when it comes to the larger than life Freddie who is written off as simply cartoonish. Firstly it does not help that all the character speak in simplistic dialogue that is only ever funny or openly only existent to move the plot along. Although the plot does focus around Freddie, I never really felt as though his character was being really developed or explored. The film always feels more like it's just moving along his life like a slideshow.Overall this film is just lazy and does whatever it can to ensure it draws in as much money as possible while still remaining fun and eccentric. For example, the film has no original score, it only plays Queen music. I understand why some people may be confused as to why I want to bring this up, why it is such a big deal. The reason why I think it's so distracting is because it means that throughout the film either the music hasn't been matched to the scene properly because they desperately want to play a Queen song or the scene is oddly quiet because they couldn't find a Queen song to match it. I'm not suggesting the film ditches the Queen soundtrack altogether but it still should use some form of backing track to fill in scenes and compliment the film on a smaller scale. I have various other nitpicks to this degree. All of the scenes with Freddie singing are really distracting because it is clear that Rami Malek is not singing. Now I have no issue with him not singing but the film shows close ups of his face during concert scenes and doesn't even attempt to mask that it's not Rami Malek singing. I've seen a lot of people talking about how the ending is fantastically shot and it feels like you're actually at the Live Aid concert and I absolutely disagree. I felt the CGI was terrible and made it feel incredibly plastic and false and the cinematography was barely mediocre and showed nothing new or special. I also feel that during this scene and other concerts, the songs are cut off at quite odd times that ruin the scenes pacing. Overall this makes the concert scenes an odd mash up of weirdly edited music and false looking CGI where it has no place being.I definitely think there is potential in the Queen story, I think there are incredibly eccentric and compelling characters to be shown and there is potential for an epic story of the rise and fall of these titans. However even though given all of this on a silver platter Bryan Singer fell flat on his face and made a boring drag of a film. I understand some people say the film is just trying to be fun. Firstly the heavy dramatization and characterization of Freddie (albeit an incredibly basic one) shows it is trying to be somewhat a serious drama. Even if I am just wrong and am reading too much into it and it is in fact just a fun Queen film, it failed as it is drawn out and boring. The film isn't exactly shockingly terrible in terms of cinematography it is mediocre, however due to the extreme lack of substance and poor pacing this standardized cinematography does nothing to make the film anything more than abismal. The flashy advertising and idea of this film may coerce you into seeing it but it is honestly the worst film I have seen all year and not worth your money. This absolutely incompetent film offers nothing more than only the information of the band matched with a Queen soundtrack and some flashy colours behind it."}, {"id": 626, "text": "Wow, just wow.

First i was not a queen fan,i had heard a few queen songs over the years and did not even know who made them, so i went in knowing virtually nothing about the group. I just thought it might a and interesting way to past some time. at the local discount theater. It was minding blowing. I went into the theatre hoping to see a movie, and what i had was an experience ! I won't get into the production quality and the great acting in the film other reviewers have discussed that at length. but i will say is that the music was so great and the story so inspiring it was amazing! I am now and actual queen fan. Now i not only understand why queen is considered by many to be the greatest band of of all time and why they gained the undying love of so many. This simply was one of the most inspiring huminist stories i had ever seen,and what has to be one of the most epic tales in entertainment history. The only other biopic a have ever seen that was this warm,human,epic,and inspiring was Dragon the bruce lee story.

I know the critics have been pretty lukewarm (to say the least) about the movie, because there wasn't enough time spent on the angst that Freddy must have had about being gay, the AIDS crisis and his eventual death from it. I don't know, maybe it's a generational thing, but, unlike most critics of movies today, I got the message about all of those angsty things just fine, and in the proper perspective. Of course his music was impacted by his life - how could it not? But I was happy to not have to watch him at the moment he actually contracted the disease...the music was the important thing here, and wow...out of the park! By the end of the Live Aid concert, which felt unbelievably REAL, my husband &amp; I, as well as other members of the audience, were weeping and singing and laughing, those all brought on by the power of the music, the stories &amp; people behind the music, the actors' portrayals of the band (I had to keep reminding myself that they were not the actual band members!) and the sort of naive dawning of the realization of just how much impact those guys have had on our society...not just on music, but in so many aspects besides.

John Deacon was nailed as well. The production also really focused on details, they even made Ben Hardy, the actor who played Roger Taylor, look older than he actually is during the Live Aid scene by getting him wrinkles underneath his eyes. Just because Taylor was around his 40's at that time while the actor is like 25 years old or something like that. Not to mention Rami Malek as Freddie was brilliant I just have no words for it.

You can tell everyone put all there passion in this movie and it was brilliant.Now some of the movie was historically incorrect ive heard from other Queens fans that how he got Aids and how he found out played out differently in real life than it did in the movie so for Queen purists that can be annoying but it does not ruin the movie.A great movie with great performances that i enjoyed from start to finish i also loved the Live Aid performance scene that was just perfect and really showed that Freddie was the best live performer and no one could play a crowed like he could.

Rami Malek portrays Freddy Mercury and he does a hell of a job bringing of the most beloved stage preformer back to life and he gets all of Freddy's mannerisms perfect and you can tell that they put a lot of love into making Freddy be shown as who he was and how he was with the other members of the band and it's brilliant and I really enjoyed the preformance.

They have a few songs that are my absolute favourites and just last summes I went to the Adam Lambert Queen concert and it was amazing.

Then I decided as a movie buff I can\u00b4t go on without seeing it myself. And well...the 2 hours and 10 minutes of this movie felt more like 30 minutes of a whirlwind of emotions. And I have seen a lot of great and not so great movies in my lifetime, still this one gets a solid 10 points from me. Ofcourse the major part of it is because of Rami Malek who I think gave an oscar-worthy performance, who studied so thoroughly every essence of Freddie Mercury and who managed to make every scene with him bright and interesting. Even the scenes with him just staring at something or someone conveyed such deep emotions that I really felt it all. I felt his pain, his sorrow, his ambition and literally everything there was to feel. Someone should make a video of people\u00b4s facial expressions who watch this movie for the first time.

I was around and kick myself for never making it to a concert. You know how it is, I'll see them next time around except in my case there was no next time. For me the movie was much more then just a movie. It was a time machine. It sort of makes up for the concert that I never seen.Everything that I thought about and liked about the band came through very well in this movie. The depiction of Freddy as a larger than life character front man to the band holds true to what I would expect. If anything, it showed me aspects of his life I did not know about but add a significant amount to his legacy in my mind.A great tribute to the best lead singers in rock history. An entertaining movie to boot."}, {"id": 634, "text": "Inimitable rock band Queen and their once-in-a-lifetime front-man Freddie Mercury have stood apart from the fray of classic rock artists by two royally distinct attributes: their bombast and their weirdness. Their bombast, as represented by the giant guitar crunches in Fat Bottomed Girls or the soaring choral harmonies in We Are the Champions, is on full display in Bohemian Rhapsody. Unfortunately, their weirdness, as represented by the opera influences in Bohemian Rhapsody or the uncharacteristic rockabilly in Crazy Little Thing Called Love, is sorely missing. The film focuses on Mercury specifically, from his early days with the band in college, through their unlikely assent into worldwide superstardom, to his final days fighting AIDS. Obviously, the casting of Mercury is crucial, and Rami Malek is flamboyant, magnetic and downright incredible. His movements and personality are Mercury through-and-through, and the pain underneath his larger-than-life aura is beautiful. It's a clich\u00e9, but I honestly got lost in his performance to the point of forgetting it wasn't Freddie himself I was watching. As for the film in whole, it's a typical, sing-by-numbers, greatest-hits version of a musical biopic. If you've seen any number of other similar films (Ray, Straight Outta Compton, Walk the Line), then you know the type: setup the sad family/home life, hit the career highlights, present a downfall, then finally crescendo into a final celebration. It's a formula as old as G chord - C chord - D chord - repeat. Still, Bohemian Rhapsody uses its formula well. And when it narrows in on the music of Queen itself, all complaints are thrown away in favor of sheer swaggering enjoyment."}, {"id": 635, "text": "Absolutely brilliant biopic of Queen.As a fan of Queen and musician, I was so happy and buzzing walking out of the cinema. The film honours the memory of Freddie and the rest of the band, Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor and puts the music front and centre.The music is as fresh as if you've just heard it for the first time. As you would hope, they did a brilliant job in the sound department (I know May and Taylor were heavily involved). It's bold, fresh and punchy and you feel like you've been to a Queen gig. I think this is a major part of why audiences are connecting with the film.Rami Malek is incredible as Freddie, at times you think it is him. I also loved Joe Mazzello's portrayal of John Deacon, again, he really is him! The actors really do a superb job and fully inhabit these roles - fantastic casting. The film really 'gets' Queen's band dynamics, has a deep understanding them, and also what it is to be a musician.As a Brit, it also just simply makes you proud!The critics have completely missed the point of this film. I didn't need a gritty, hard-hitting netflix style drama involving all the gruesome details. This film sets out to celebrate Queen's artistry - and does rather a good job of it too."}, {"id": 636, "text": "Well, who am I to say it. My only perception of Freddie is a someone knowing him only from watching him on TV. A bandmate like Brian May really has authority on that. A Brain was completely happy with Malik portrayal. Yet, watching Rhapsody with Malik, I could not shake the feeling that was not Freddie. Maybe, to Brian, who knew Mercury up close and personal, Malik marvelously channelled Mercury and hit the mark perfectly and captured Mercury's essence as a whole person. But for me, as only a tv fan, that was not even close enough. Malik did not capture theatrical over the top flamboyance. His portrayal was of a guy with mannerisms of 3rd world immigrant making it big in a show biz. Meh... I think May is being a bit disingenuous in his praise. I get it, Brain and Roger did get exactly the movie they wanted. And Queen fans will be moved just due to the fact how emotional everyone feels about story behind Queen and Mercury's untimely death. But movie missed huge opportunity to explore why contemporary critics hated Queen so much. What Queen represented to them - decadent, pointless theatrics, totally uninterested in politics, a music for bourgeois disguised as rock&amp;roll. What drove critics even more mad was Queen's unwillingness to pick a cause while they could have been such a great poster child for gay pride movement. Great music just for pleasure and good time is just plain wrong. Also, movie actually felt very neutered and borderline boring. The very thing Mercury would cast away. The storyline about bad influence and being manipulated was somewhat baffling and definitely given significant film time at expense of other more interesting and unknown aspects of Mercury life story."}, {"id": 637, "text": "I had reasonably high expectations.

Rami Malek at no point inspires power, he seems like a little kid with a good voice who struggles with his sexuality. Probably our current PC society had something to do with this.Sacha Baron Cohen would have been perfect in this role, unfortunately he's a tabloid style circus entertainer who only wanted to focus on the controversial and sexual stuff. I guess you can't have it all.I'm giving it a 7, but considering the budget it's probably a 4.I blame the band for settling for this. They have plenty of money, they should have done better to portray their legacy, and Freddie's."}, {"id": 638, "text": "I have seen a number of negative reviews of Bohemian Rhapsody that primarily take issue with its factual inaccuracies. These reviews are unlikely to aid the average viewer--who goes to the movies to be entertained--in deciding whether to see this film or in considering its merits after having watched it. The carelessness shown by Bohemian Rhapsody's disregard for facts may serve, however, to underscore the film's deep flaws, chief among which (ironically) is its superficiality. At the center of this film is Freddie Mercury, played by Rami Malek with a sheen of flamboyant glamor constantly being threatened by an aching loneliness that, one gets the feeling, the film often wishes would just go away. In this sense, the filmic Mercury is not human so much as he is a vessel of musical talent that happens to have, accumulated around it, details that for a fully-realized character would represent more than narrative inconveniences. Malek, to his credit, persists in conveying that loneliness, Mercury's starvation for real connection and understanding. The film's creators also appear to understand the character's desperate need for love (the film opens with Somebody to Love, after all). And the film recognizes, at least in theory, that love can occur in guises romantic, familial, and collegial, and that fanatical love, often depicted as hollow and unsatisfying, can sustain a person as lonely as Malek's Mercury. But rather than depict Mercury's journey through the push and pull of relationships with people pursuing their own needs, the filmmakers settle for surrounding him with emotional wallpaper (see, e.g., his bandmates, essentially playing the role of nagging but devoted spouse) incapable of challenging or fulfilling him. Moreover, any chance Malek has of developing a well-rounded character is thwarted by the film's haste to get through its quiet moments; one wonders if the messy production history required these scenes get short shrift in favor of the money-shot concert segments. Those concert segments, by the way, are (like the rest of the film) neutered by choppiness and an unnatural sleekness--in other words, they feel too much like the BBC TV performance early in the film that the band laments it will have to lip-sync and mime through. But that's show biz, right? I am willing to forgive the artificiality of the concert scenes (they are, after all, lip-synced and mimed) because the music is great, but I cannot help but wish they held some of the raw emotionality of the concert scenes, shot with a lingering, trembling camera, in this year's A Star Is Born. (I recognize that much of Queen's music consists of stadium-rock stompers that do not lend themselves to emotional revelation. But the film doesn't even attempt to convey anything more than, Look, it's Queen! with most of the musical performances. Surely, a more definite statement about Mercury's off-stage loneliness could have been made by contrast.) I could go on to complain of the dialogue, through which the film manifests its fear of emotional depth, or the clich\u00e9-ridden imagery (trucker-hat beard guy slo-mo walks into MEN room; Mercury, on payphone with wife, looks on, licks lips), but I'm starting to feel like a grouch. I will close with a final opinion, which requires no intellectualizing or arguing: Bohemian Rhapsody is boring. I went in optimistic, a lover of Queen's music. I should have been easy to please. But the film is a struggle to get through. It should feel like an ecstatic, powerful, sweaty, riotous, gay concert--the kind of place where a person could fall in love with a person, with a band--but instead is tour footage, sanitized and stitched together from only the most precious, perfect moments, where all of the mistakes, all of the personality, are erased."}, {"id": 639, "text": "Bohemian Rhapsody is for sure one of best musical biopic of the past 10 years.

His personal tragedy is shown, but while there are some scenes and many allusions converning his lifestyle and sexuality, the main focus is on the music, his grand opus and also, the band. Mercury needed Deacon, Taylor and May, and they needed him. And that is what fans want to see. There is a whole generation of Queen fans that grew up proud in the shadow of the mushroom cloud, and the movie manages to reach us on an emotional level, where we can for a moment forget that those are actors instead of the real band playing at Live Aid. And we can grieve again - one more time - for the musical genius Freddie Mercury, whose light burnt out so long before its time.

Yes, I cry for the reason that there is no music like that today anymore, let alone no one can perform like Freddie and sounds brilliant as Freddie. As an impressionable student during the 80s, I have vivid memories of the Live Aid broadcast and the shock I had as a very gaunt Freddie performed with Queen onstage. I also vividly recall the scandals, gossips from former lovers, partners. Most of all , I am one of those millions who cried when Freddie passed on. Fast forward to twenty plus years later, now a middle aged person, I saw the remaining Queen members two years ago with Adam Lambert. There is a genuine longing for Freddie as there is only a legendary Freddie. This film will remind die hard fans how fast time flies. Rami Malek is stellar in his performance considering for a young actor he also acquired the nuances and movements. Solid internalization for someone who might have vague recollections of the band.

Lately though, I truly haven't enjoyed most of the so called critically acclaimed movies out there. It seems that some producers want to pump out movies that they know will be popular with critics, leaving moviegoers however scratching their heads questioning if they missed something. One thing I know for sure though, when a movie makes you feel something, something that you know is true, I just could not give a damn what critics say, that movie is more than a movie, it's an experience.Bohemian Rhapsody is an experience, one that I will have again, very shortly. Queen fan or not, you owe it to yourself to experience this movie in the theatres, in all its audio glory, next to others who you know are experiencing the same event (one of the reasons I love going to concerts). I'm not going to get into the performances, i think it's quite clear Rami Malel blew it out of the water, so did the rest of the primary cast (as well as a particular surprise cast member). Aside from Rami Malek's portrayal of Freddy, its worth watching this movie for the music alone, with the final Live Aid performance capping this movie in unbelievable fashion (if you're not fighting back tears you don't have a heart). Seriously, the last 15 minutes of this movie are unforgettable, you just want to watch it over and over again (reminds me of the ending of Whiplash).Forget the critics, go watch this movie. You won't regret it!!"}, {"id": 648, "text": "Bohemian Rhapsody is a potential masterpiece. Most people will agree that the leading actors, director, writers, cinematographer, light, makeup artists, costumes, sound, music, set designers, - all of them should get special recognition during the award season. Authors of the film present an aesthetically and visually brilliant music biopic. Nobody has ever done anything like this before. They made Freddie alive again. This movie is a Queen resurrection.Freddie's love, Mary Austin, represents his creative soul. Still, he was almost always seeking new experiences and adventures. His promiscuity, how he contacted the virus, was only a small part of his health history depicted in the film. It's great that authors mostly focus on Freddie's genius in fashion, singing, business, and other facets of the fine arts. The movie is energized by his charisma and his incredible artistic gifts. Bohemian Rhapsody is shot without any nudity, violence or vulgarity, and this can be considered as an advantage among all music biopics.It's fantastic how a story about one person can radiate a panorama of public transformations, industry trends, shifts in fashion and more. As an historical figure, Freddie opened the door to the enormous problems of the HIV crisis of his time. The film director, Bryan Singer, dramatically chronicles Freddie's success, his unstoppable desire to create and his passionate love of music. Rami Malik shared and contributed his own artistic soul in the portrayal of Freddie's character. This is priceless.Friedrich Nietzsche's popular quote: what doesn't kill you makes you stronger is wrong. In the bio of Freddie Mercury we see, some things can kill people, but memory and representation in cinema bring the person back to life sometimes with a stronger, more vital persona. This movie is breathtaking from the beginning to end and offers a terrific example how people with HIV and AIDS can lead prolific and productive lives."}, {"id": 649, "text": "Went to see Bohemian Rhapsody last night and the best thing I can say about it is WOW, amazing!! The worst thing I can say about it is also WOW, it's amazing!! Now don't get me wrong this won't be to everyone's tastes and if you don't like Queen then you're not gonna enjoy it really because it is all about them and nothing else (obviously). But if, like me, you love Queen, you love Freddie Mercury and their music then you'll love it! It's not a documentary, there's been plenty of them done. It doesn't go in depth into the life of Freddie or the other band members and nor should it, those things have been done already. What this is is a celebration of the life and work of one of the greatest bands and greatest performer of all time. Rami Malek is sensational as Freddie, pulling off his mannerisms and movements so well (makes me glad that Sacha barren a Cohen turned it down, he wouldn't have been good enough imo) that you can tell this is a role he loved playing. It starts off with you wondering if he could play such an epic OTT character, but by the end he just is Freddie. The music is, well, amazing, as the songs of Queen are. The songs they chose were all well placed in the film and added to that sense of nostalgia and fun that embodied the band and that the film makers were obviously going for. It does showcase around Freddie for the most part and to me that's only right, he was the flamboyance of the band and what made them so incredibly appealing. Starting from his early days in England and finishing with their world class performance at live aid. This film for me had me engrossed, enraptured and above all entertained. I found myself singing quietly along to the songs, nodding my head to the music and caught up in the emotions of it all. It does give a rose tinted view of Queen and Freddie for the most part, but I don't mind that at all, as said previously, I don't want to see another fly on the wall documentary, I wanted to see a happier version of a figure and band that I love and this works so well. Also there's a really funny part with Mike Myers and what his character says about bohemian rhapsody, but you should watch it to see what I mean \ud83d\ude09. All in all a bloody good watch and one that I will be definitely going to see again!!"}], "reviews_amount": 650}
