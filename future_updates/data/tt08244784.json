It pokes fun at everyone and says don't worry you can laugh, even if it's at your own expense.I think the controversy around it makes it even funnier because I didn't find anything to be offended about in this movie because it's a satire, it's saying things with a wink and making fun of the characters saying these things. (I think anyway).Betty Gilpin is great in this and she really knew what movie she was in.It also has a way of keeping you on your toes especially at the start and was kind of refreshing."}, {"id": 1, "text": "It took me a while to watch this based on reviews and all the political nonsense, but I am so happy I changed my mind. One of the most entertaining movies I've seen in the last year. While there are political undertones and references, they're not over played and it adds to the entertainment. I highly recommend this movie. It's good for some laughs, and isn't light on the action."}, {"id": 2, "text": "..but a lot of fun long as you don't take the plot too seriouslyBetty Gilpin is terrific in it"}, {"id": 3, "text": "I went in thinking I'd hate this movie but turned out loving it. The lead character is well written and Betty Gilpin pulls her off amazingly. Never saw this actress in anything before but will try and find her other movies."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Major spoilers alert.This film is great escapist fun that also satirizes the our bizarrely extreme cultural divide. It is refreshing to be able to bring gonzo humor and over the top gore as a way to step back from the mindless anger and group think. On top of that, Betty Gilpin's brilliantly played Crystal Creasy is something unique to film. While ostensibly written as a familiar Mary Sue able to kick any ass and beat down any threat, Crystal is a sardonic participant in a mad mad world. Highly intelligent yet without affectations, she really does not give a damn why everyone is trying to kill her. She is also the one character in the movie who does not comfortably fit into the extreme left or right stereotypes in spite of all the superficial appearances to the contrary.I also credit the writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof for being willing to subversively skewer their own. Their sharpest barbs are reserved for their fellow Elites while the Deplorables are mostly just one dimensional cartoonish characters rarely provided with more depth than the aptly hilariously named Yoga Pants or Shut Up Gary.On the other hand, the elite hunters characters are fleshed out with many little details and conceits familiar to those who travel in similar circles. Athena babbles on tritely and unoriginally about the singular importance of cutting tomatoes with a bread knife and using Gruyere in her grilled cheese sandwich speech which takes place in the mansion she keeps insisting is NOT A MANOR! She and her compatriots toss off Animal Farm Snowball references as a sort of intellectual adornment, insult, and shibboleth while revealing that they understand next to nothing about a book they were probably once forced to read in some boring English class.The film's conflict originates with one of the Elite characters being found out sleeping with his wife's oncologist which leads to his dismissal from his charitable foundation. Another talks about his dubious devotion to a peasant lover he has inconveniently knocked up. They all look down on the hired hand Sargent Dale who is only allowed the smallest modicum of respect for having a small part in the Bruce Willis movie Tears of the Sun - why is the sun crying?. Even the choice of having the action set in Croatia in something of a inside joke as that has recently been a preferred destination for the fashionable set seeking to avoid the common company of the hoi polloi.The movie starts with a turtle and ends with a hare mirroring the awesomely twisted and violent bedtime story that Crystal says her mother used to tell her. That story serves as a sort of explanation of her uniquely detached outlook and her singular ability to spot deadly threats based on the smallest of tells.At the film's conclusion, Crystal echos the story arc of the Napoleon Animal Farm character. She transforms from her deplorable self by donning Athena's signature red bottomed stiletto pumps, slipping into her stylish black dress, commandeering her plane, while tossing back Athena's prized champagne and caviar.Why it's a Cinderella story!Highly recommended if you have a sense of humor and can enjoy a stupid fun movie."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Just a good well done movie.

One minute you think someone is the main star next minute gone(blown up,head blown off or blown away with a shot gun!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "I'm not sure all the people that gave bad reviews even seen this movie or they are just plain miserable. Some have just read too much into it. It's a fun dark humoured movie with a bit of gore that doesn't take itself seriously. You moaners need to get a life and not realise that not every movie has to be analised to see if its black/white or red/blue or rainbow. Enjoy it for what it is. FUN. If not then watch The Waltons on a loop."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Take a hint, my title is satirical, as was this film. Anyone finding the need to pick a political side from this film needs to give their heads a shake. This was pure mindless entertainment, and writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof nailed it! I want/ed more! Directing by Craig Zobel was excellent. Casting was perfect, and both Gilpin and Swank delivered. Despite the awesome violence and gore, in the end, it's just a feel-good movie, comedic in nature, as one bad guy after another gets what everyone in the audience thinks they deserved. The critics got this one wrong - they either took it too politically, or had their neck-ties on too tight. A definite recommend from me, and a well deserved 9/10!"}, {"id": 8, "text": "It had similar vibes of Ready Or Not, ideas and themes of The Purge and the unpredictability of The Cabin In The Woods. The first act is pretty strong and it really throws you off course as to who you think the main protagonist will be. That just set me up nicely for not having a clue of where it could go next. It moves at a good pace, the violence is brutal but cartoonish in its execution, the gags are solid and go down brave but potentially dangerous routes. I was fine with them. But it wouldn't surprise if some might offend the SJW cinema-goers. While the end was the most formulaic part of the film. The journey getting there made it a worthwhile watch."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Based on the 6.4/10, I wasn't expecting this to be better than Invisible Man, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The movie is very funny and Deep Blue Sea-esk in that a few well-knowns are the first to go. Betty Gilpin's expressions set this satire-gore-story apart from them all."}, {"id": 10, "text": "This leans much more towards satire and black comedy style of horror. Quite surprisingly good! A battle royale between the elites vs the deplorables. I really liked how the filmmakers played around with the concepts of our current political zeitgeist, and its a lot of fun to see how they play with it, and provide a satiric commentary in the movie, targeting both sides. Both sides take hits, and also learn they have misconceptions about the other, and gain a newfound respect for their enemy. A rare horror gem with wit, satire, smarts, and fun at the same time. The ending I absolutely loved, and thought it was exactly how it should have been."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I thought the movie was great. Original and humorous. And while political stances were used to set up the plot and some of the humor, I think that's all it was. I didn't see any political message or anything so I suggest just giving it a try even if you are sensitive to such things. The one argument I can understand against this movie is about it's classification. Those looking for a strict Action, Horror, Thriller might be disappointed to see it's unserious and humorous nature. I would describe the nature similar to The Cabin in the Woods if you've seen that."}, {"id": 12, "text": "The Hunt is a film that loses itself in its own cleverness.When a bunch of degenerates are thrown together by a group of rich people and hunted for sport, its up to the small group to try to escape and find who is doing it to them.The film isn't close enough to Hostel, from which it borrows plenty of its ideas, whilst also being way too far away from anything that works well enough to make this film truly enjoyable.The mysterious Athena who is behind all the events of the film is not revealed until way too far into the action, in a move which makes absolutely no sense. Why attempt to keep it a secret before showing her face? It was lined up to be a big reveal then just felt all a bit so what? when it happens.We then have the 12. The reason they are there is touched upon for a couple of them but never really explored. You have some of them who cinema goers may recognise who just get killed off way too quickly, although some of the deaths are executed pretty well.But everything just feels like it gets lost inside a good idea. When it gets to the end following one big confrontation and moves into a one to one confrontation, you kinda feel like it doesn't actually matter... Then there is one major gaping plot hole around the text message and then the setup of the events of the film which just doesn't make any sense at all.It's bang average and should have been either a full blown thriller, or a hilarious black comedy, but it falls way short of both and just never really delivers anything it should."}, {"id": 13, "text": "I watched a trailer for this movie on the IMDB website and I have to say it looked like my type of movie. The clip had hooked me, considering I hadn't really heard or read anything about it.I was completely hooked from within the first five minutes and that is rare these days. But I was watching, thinking I know him, I know her, didn't realise she was in it and then, they simply were not in it anymore. This movie had no problem killing off the actors and actresses that us as an audience did know. which for me is very scream like with the Drew Barrymore opening sequence. which I loved.The action is more or less all the way through the movie. The end fight scene as well was totally awesome. I mean c'mon what man doesn't want to watch two females fight, and boy was it a fight.There was an element of comedy all the way through, honestly it had a Tarantino Vibe about this movie. I'm not too sure if that is what they were going for but in my opinion it worked.The best movie of the year 2020 so far...CHECK IT OUT...."}, {"id": 14, "text": "This movie was great! I went in not expecting too much, and preparing myself for a political preaching to. I was soooooo pleasantly disappointed. This movie was non-stop shocks and fun from start to finish. Politically, it takes very clever and hilarious shots at both sides of the political spectrum. I really expected it to be slanted to one side, which I worried would annoy me; it didn't. It was tons of fun. No matter your political affiliation, if you can't take a joke aimed at being either a liberal or a conservative, this movie is not for you. However, if you don't mind EXTREMELY clever jokes made at the expense of both sides, then you'll love this movie."}, {"id": 15, "text": "This is bloody, and bloody funny, and whip smart.

I am fed up watching liberal propaganda.. dont get me wrong I am all for human rights, gender rights, women rights, environmental protection etc.. all human being have rights to exist with honor and dignity as long as their activities dont harm other human beings.. but for the last decade most blockbuster movies were force fed liberal propaganda.. This movie changed that.. enjoyed it.. Specially during these times of self isolation because of corona-virus outbreak.. Stay safe all.."}, {"id": 17, "text": "The witt with this movie comes from the fact that the smart ones play stupid and the stupid ones play smart. Imagine The Hunger Games with a bit of Hide and Seek. And that's what this movie is. The liberals play the bad guys, and the conservatives play the good guys. Which was anything BUT how the right wing media outlets portrayed it as. The acting from the protagonist Betty Gilpin is one of the best things about this movie! She took her role and absolutely ran with it. Where the film does fall flat is from it's extremely predictable plotline. Which copies from various thriller films made in the past. Overall I liked this movie! It was dark comedy with a strong politically charged twist."}, {"id": 18, "text": "I know that none of the bad reviewers even watched this movie. It's not really a left or right movie but it shows how bad both of those sides are and the hero actually seems to be like most of us, somewhere in the middle.

First off, so many movies have been drawn in comparison with this one, let me give it a try as well. Hostel in aspects for overseas death counts of Americans through sport killing. High Tension in aspects of a strong female lead who is smarter than her counterparts. Us and Get Out as far as political satire with an unlying message. And This is the End when it comes to five minute cameos from A listers. Emma Roberts, Ike Barinholtz, Justin Hartley, Ethan Suplee, the guy from It's always Sunny, and Hilary Swank...all great. Loved the movie and I wished it was longer at the end...the way you want a movie to have you feeling when it ends. Ethan Suplee looked incredible btw, keep it up on the health transformation! The lead did incredible as well, her acting was on point. The script was funny and witty and full of great lines. Direction was great too! Loved it and felt it was a breath of fresh air from the basic horror/thriller genre. Loved how the guide was a Hollywood coordinator who name drops and then only has worked in national guard...that part reminded me of tropic thunder. Great movie all the way!"}, {"id": 21, "text": "This is undoubtedly, one of the greatest movies I've ever watched. Didn't see the trailer,just read the announcement and saw the poster. I knew it would be great after just 5 minutes. The script, the jokes, the hidden messages and peculiar play. This is brilliant. The script writer is a genius. I will admit, this is not for everyone and I am not sure who this movie is for, probably for someone who can think, perhaps?? There's so much behind each dialog!!! I don't want to spoil it. This is definitely a comedy-horror(ish gore)-thriller-action type flick. If you are into that sort of stuff, there's a good chance you will enjoy it. I can see myself re watching it again in a couple of years. The last Star Wars, which I watched recently was horrible and boring and I wasn't sure if anything can redeem my fate of movies and this one really did.10/10.

It's a dark humor movie with a twist of gore, with the purpose of entertaining, which it does!. And with Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank, it doesnt get much hotter to watch. And it also comes with one hell of a girl fight. I highly recommend this movies."}, {"id": 26, "text": "I can't believe the hate, great action flick. The film swerved into Some interesting themes and pokes fun at all sides of the political spectrum. It's an edge of your seat wild ride. Not an amazing work of are but supremely entertaining."}, {"id": 27, "text": "How interesting that so much controversy would be generated by a film an inherently, and deliberately, silly as this one.A group seemingly unconnected Americans, of various ages and genders, awake to find themselves on a strange compound with the only clue to their situation being a large crate nearby. The crate contains a variety of weapons. Once armed, the people are then picked off by an unseen enemy.I don't know why I'm being so coy in my synopsis, as you'll know from any of the advertising that the film is about liberal elites hunting deplorables. What you won't get is the tone of the film, which is pretty much a comedy. A black comedy at times admittedly, but occasionally just an out and out comedy. The film I'd most compare it too is Cabin in The Woods - as it takes a similarly well worn premise and manages to do some different and new things with it. However, The Hunt doesn't have Cabin's rewatchability. Once you know the plot, I can't really see another reason to come back to it.I'd also say, the trailer for the film really does the movie a disservice, as it gives away a couple of the films secrets, including revealing who the lead Liberal is played by - which the movie goes to great lengths to keep concealed. The deaths are nicely done though, and often come out of nowhere, with a wonderful practical feel to the effects and it's a funny film, occasionally laugh out loud so. Betty Gilphin is great, as ever, in this.The controversy that'd dogged the film seems pretty silly once you've seen it. - although the advertising has played into it too - so they only have themselves to blame. I felt the film not only attacks both sides in equal measure but has an overall message of once you scratch the surface there being more that unites us than divides us.It's a solid, entertaining film - just not one with much replay value."}, {"id": 28, "text": "Contrary to what the trailer suggested; the movie is about Liberals chasing and killing RedNecks; not for sport but for vengeance. It is far from serious but extremely violent and play with many cliches just twisted them unexpectedly. For example; many of the best known actors are killed after a few minutes. Do not even attempt to take it seriously. It is a satire and a very darkly funny one. The movie joke about the moral stupidity and division on our society and while some jokes could have gone deeper the tone is still funny and cynical. If you like violence; well the movie has a lot. The last woman to woman fight is better than any one in Kill Bill and more realistic. Some killings seem quite gory but most of the time the camera shy away of the carnage. Other killings; like the bunker scene are quite funny and violent at the same time. In brief; it is a great satire; plenty of fun and a lot to think about"}, {"id": 29, "text": "I'm glad I was able to see The Hunt during this chaotic time! Betty Gilpin is marvelous as Crystal! Very well written for it's type being an action/horror, I hope the movie does well to those that get to see it.

Schoedsack, 1932) or 'Battle Royale' (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000) or 'The Hunger Games' (Gary Ross, 2012) - but director Craig Zobel and screenwriters Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof have put together an amusing satire with carefully measured storytelling, razor-sharp wit, and maniacal mayhem that skewers both conservatives and liberals of the American political spectrum. Violence is used gratuitously for laughs and shock value with Tarantino-esque moments of comedy and dialogue. The final standoff between Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank is a must-see spectacle. Fun as hell!"}, {"id": 32, "text": "In the first half hour it was one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, very dark comedy, absolutely hilarious, then the laughs stopped and it gets a bit more serious with a good ending, well worth a watch"}, {"id": 33, "text": "If you're gonna put your movie in Croatia, at least get ONE thing right. The licence plate was wrong, the writing on the crates on the train was wrong, the soldiers uniforms were wrong, the language they were speaking sounded like something from google translate.

I'm giving this 2 stars just because it made me laugh once and it was a genuine laugh."}, {"id": 34, "text": "This movie was fantastic! I don't understand why it only has a 6.5 rating. Maybe because of people's judgement of it being politically charged. It was actually very apolitical and should the messed up thinking of both very right winged humans and left winged humans. In my opinion it was a very in your face look at how we're pushing ourselves farther apart with being right. The main character didn't have a side of right winged or left winged, they just wanted to survive the hunt.Definitely 10 out of 10"}, {"id": 35, "text": "Greetings again from the darkness. Let's face it. It was a brilliant marketing strategy. In the wake of mass shootings, the release date of this film was delayed when its subject matter was deemed controversial, even scandalous The film's new marketing slogan became, The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one's actually seen. Of course, it wasn't really true, as very few were actually talking about it. But that's what made it genius marketing ... they created interest amidst controversy that has since proven unnecessary. Director Craig Zobel (Z FOR ZACHARIAH, 2015) has delivered the least controversial, non-polarizing film of the year. It basically laughs at extremes on the left and right, and reminds us how laughing at something can often take away its power. And regardless of your side, you'll find some laughs here.If you've seen the trailer, you know that the premise has a group of liberal elites hunting a hand-selected group of social media-active MAGA deplorables. It's a twist on Richard Connell's 1924 short story The Most Dangerous Game, although the modern day rich aren't hunting for sport, but rather for political affiliation - gun lovers and climate change deniers. That may sound politically charged, but in fact, it plays as more comedy than comeuppance. Sure, the violence is over-the-top and often quite graphic, but this is a skewering of both red and blue.Preventing the project from falling into B-movie muck is a standout performance from Betty Gilpin (Glow) as Crystal. She's a Rambo-type who speaks (with a southern drawl) only when necessary, and seems to have learned a lot while serving in Afghanistan. Most of the time she looks like she has a pinch between her cheek and gum (a tip of the Stetson to Walt Garrison), and she also hums to herself and tosses down some unusual facial expressions. This is a seriously oddball performance that is the film's highlight.One of the best sequences of the film comes quite early as the dozen or so 'deplorables' slowly wake-up and find themselves gagged in a field. A container of weapons leads to an early massacre that allows the filmmaker to tease us with numerous familiar faces taking turns as the heir-apparent lead. Some of the faces that pop up include Ike Barinholtz, Wayne Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Emma Roberts, Christopher Berry, Sturgill Simpson, Kate Nowlin, Amy Madigan, Reed Birney, Glenn Howerton, Hannah Alline (flight attendant), and Usman Ally.Of course we know this is headed to a showdown between Crystal and Athena (2-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank), the ringleader of the hunting party. A fight scene reminiscent of the KILL BILL movies (sans Samurai swords) takes place at Athena's manor, and it is stunningly staged and executed. Unfortunately this scene also highlights the mostly inadequate dialogue that exists throughout the film. Some of the quips click, but many fall flat - surprising since the co-writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof have previously collaborated on Watchmen and The Leftovers.Blumhouse Productions keeps cranking out these offbeat genre films, and this one likely benefits from a misplaced scandal, and it strives for self-importance by comparing itself to George Orwell's Animal House and with an obscure reference to TEARS OF THE SUN (2013). It's not at the level of last year's gem READY OR NOT, and it missed the opportunity to make some political points, but it's a hoot to watch and as an added bonus, Hilary Swank teaches us the proper way to make a grilled cheese sandwich!"}, {"id": 36, "text": "Poor attempt at recreating surviving the game.

Everyone else has limited time in their roles but they still shine at times.There isn't really any downtime. It is short, sweet and to the point.

A fun diversion."}, {"id": 58, "text": "...which is one of the things I enjoyed so much about this movie. Political satire is an understatement, this is THE political satire, from start to finish. When I was in high school we read The Most Dangerous Game and I've always loved it, so this was a really cool twist on the classic short story. The main protagonist is AMAZING and really nails her role.

However all I see when I see those stories is idiots running a country allowing guns, people cannot be trusted as proven constantly, it worries me this being delayed like it somehow is an accurate representation of a culture, if so USA are doomed, anyway enough politics.So the film, it was an absolute joy to watch, although I'd position it as a horror comedy myself, as if not intentional there were some good laughs, characters were great and famous people dying early was a welcome throw off. The script and mini twists were fun, it seemed extremely refreshing for a genre that's lacked creativity and focused on revenge or straight up cliche horror thrillers. Some messages go over my head with the right wing left wing stuff but I can't honestly get why people are looking deep at this film, it's daft fun, clever and flies by. I couldn't stand the lead in GLOW thought she was abysmal but she was outstanding here, mannerisms and cold emotionless delivery mixed with bits of genuine emotion were balanced perfectly, she was just awesome, I'd borderline this as an iconic performance if this got a cult status.The only downer is maybe the insistence yet again on woman goodie vs woman baddy, think all that's getting ridiculous in general however it worked well here, arguably the best female fight scene for years. For me a role is for who's best, man or woman, casting worked great, dynamic was good, two ladies stole the show and gilpin could be the ultimate final girl. Emma Roberts cameo was probably the most surprised I'd been for ages.

The narrative toys with audiences on who the main protagonist is until star Betty Gilpin makes her entrance in a hilarious and blood soaked sequence. From then on, it's all high octane excitement as the hunted becomes the hunter. Gilpin delivers a magnetic star making turn; her athleticism coupled with a wry acting style makes her what many of today's action movie heroines are called, but are not: Kickass. The introduction of Hilary Swank in a dramatic expository sequence late on in proceedings just kicks up the excitement another notch. The snappy dialogue is smart and knowing; mixed in with the action is loads of black humour. It's not always you get to see a full on fight to the death ending in a discourse on Animal Farm.

Wait, stop the presses, please, deplorable's as in the amous line uttered by then Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary cycle? Ah, apparently yes. (In full disclosure, the Clinton reference was neither said or implied) So here it is, Twelve strangers wake up in an empty field, not having the vagus idea of where they are or how they got there. Actually, In the murky shadows of dark urban lore or an internet conspiracy theory, ruthless elitists have gathered at a remote location to hunt ...... well, ah ..... those with with politically conservative agendas, shall we say, for sport. The hunters on the other hand, are portrayed as being polar opposites of their hunted game, liberally charged people, whose embrace of climate change, gendering and other pertinent issues of the day, actually have fueled their anger and hatred for those not like them. But their master plan to eliminate their right-wing prey gets a fly in the ointment, when one of the hunted, Crystal, played brilliantly by Betty Gilpin, turns the tables on the hunters. Gilpin provides some great action scenes, whose Chuck Norrisesque moves seemed to come in quite handy, as her character quickly emerges as the leader of the band of deplorable's. Hillary Swank plays the villain, Athena, an angry liberal who is hell bent on revenge against anything Conservative. But it was actually veteran actress Amy Madigan (Field of Dreams) who this author thought turned in a brilliant performance as Ma, the owner of a supposedly redneck country store, flat out in the middle of rural Arkansas (Wait, isn't all of Arkansas rural? \ud83d\ude0e) Madigan played the part brilliantly and surprisingly covertly, and we'll leave it at that. Sadly, the film used epitaphs and coined phrases, to aptly highlight our current socioeconomic and political differences, as we sit smack dab in the middle of an actual 2010 Presidential race. The use of the terms rednecks, snowballs, illegals, etc. put sort of a shameless spotlight on social issues of the day, and reminded me just how wide the divide is in our country. But the entire premise of the film I guess was exactly that, and what the film was supposed to portray. I give this a rating of 7, with heavy on the violence and gore, almost Tarantino like at times. As for the ending, it is prolific and leaves us all with a great message, regardless of what side of the aisle you sit on."}, {"id": 94, "text": "My main complaint about this movie is the wrong description followed by the wrong expectations. It said 'action horror thriller' when in reality it should have said 'dark political comedy slasher'. Now, if it was the second I would probably (definitely) have chosen not to watch it because I was not in the mood for that (if I was - it would have gotten a better rating). So because it is listed as an action horror thriller, I'm going to rate it as such.For starters, this 'thriller' has no thrill to it, because they've chosen to tell you what's going on from the beginning. Everything is obvious and predictable, there is absolutely no mystery regarding who is who in this movie. Snowball is the only somewhat exciting character in this , and only because she's cuckoo. They cover up the face of the main antagonist to reveal it in the finale to what end? In the actual horror movie it would be someone from the victim group who was killed / disappeared in the beginning. Here I'm like 'uh whatever, I still don't know who that chic is and I don't even care'. None of the characters have any backstory, only bits and pieces here and there which don't make up for a solid picture. The only unexpected plot twist is that I expected Emma Roberts to be the main protagonist (spoiler alert: she's not, if you're wanted to watch this movie because of her you will be vastly disappointed).The political part I kind of understand, but can't relate because I'm not from America. Still, it's the fault of no-backstory plot that makes it so faceless and unrelatable - there are ways to make a film more understandable for a wider audience, which were not used here, so people either get it or they don't.The overall impression of the movie is just... meh. Mediocre humor, dumb scenarios (people running towards the box no problem, then running towards the shooters, then running away from them and suddenly stepping on bombs and falling into traps that majestically weren't there before, etc.) and faceless characters.

You got it! Craig Zobel directs a satire also a thriller also a horror film. At this gloomy time of year for movies and politics, The Hunt is nectar for those with strong opinions about political horrors and film satires. It's so good President Trump condemned it without having seen it.Not only is this film sharp about Democrats and Republicans, it also aims its gun at Trump: Just name mock-worthy political and social subjects about which democrats, republicans, and Trump have weighed in on and writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof will deliver. Moreover, it's no small feat to balance biting satire with horrific horror tropes-They do it by offending everyone.This is a Blumhouse Production, after all, whose gamut of success runs from The Purge to Get Out and everything in between. Just look at its filmography: Cheap horror to quality thriller (Us) are its specialty.Crystal (Betty Gilpin), one of the conservative (?) survivors of a Richard-Connell-Most-Dangerous-Game-like incident, goes after the liberal elites who are hunting internet-trolling conservatives picked up unknowingly at various sites from Orlando to Staten Island. The victims have been big backers of the Second Amendment and deny climate change, among many sins of which they are accused. When Crystal and head elite Athena (Hilary Swank) mix it up martially, the audience will have a tough time choosing sides much less deciding whether or not it's actually bi-partisan lovemaking.When a kimono-clad liberal is accused of culturally appropriating, the laughs are from both sides of the aisle. When a conservative makes fun of a liberal by saying Go to hell, a progressive throws back, I don't believe in hell. Neither side wins but the writers. So many apparently main characters in this stylish delight are offed, that the audience might stop trying to guess who is main. The elites are unfortunate to lock horns with highly-trained Crystal, who can work both sides with guns and her hands. Her wry comments are a welcome antidote to contemporary factionalism. She seems to be a conservative but not loathe to bash either side when her gut tells her not to trust them.Now you know why the film was almost canceled: too partisan. Really!

Now if only we can have Betty in a new trilogy for us twisted fans and lovers of great popcorn movies that don't need CGI to make it work. I'm in for tickets to the next one!"}, {"id": 131, "text": "I have been to movies where I have wanted to walk out and get my money back, but never did. Until I saw this abomination.

They try and add some dark humor elements but none of that matters because it falls apart because it's so utterly unbelievable. I mean the premise of the idea is always unbelievable to begin with but this one isn't good.Here's why it doesn't work.-It's entirely unbelievable from top to bottom- Game, set, match.This is the single biggest killer. If you watch another movie that's done the premise better like Surviving the Game it at least remotely possible even as remote as it might be and it's better acted.The graphic violence here doesn't really add anything to this. Adding dark humor combined with the graphic violence leaves it seeming less political and more like a campy b grade horror comedy film. The plot works in a darker grittier film but here it just comes off as silly. If I want silly humor then I'll watch Shaun of the Dead.Now I have nothing against attempting to do a horror/comedy/satire. Rideshare is a movie that did a good job of it. It didn't try and be more than it was. The Most Dangerous Game works in theory if you look at the loose plot outline, but movies like The Thinning carry a political element to it better without rehashing as much of a rehashed story.It doesn't help that the end is also formulaic and predictable.If you want The Most Dangerous Game watch Surviving the Game, it's at least remotely believable and better acted. If you want some sort of humor with a hint of social commentary disguised as a horror watch Rideshare. 2003's version Texas Chainsaw Massacre combines humor, violence and horror better if you want more violence. If you want a darker take on political thought without all the b grade horror campiness watch The Thinning or The White King."}, {"id": 133, "text": "I rarely come online to review movies unless they are really good or, in this case, really bad.

Athena: Of course I do. The only difference is that I'm right.Athena represents the quintessential ideologues' attitude. They claim they care about the truth, but refuse to look at facts that refute their narrative, and steadfastly believe they are right.I am acquainted with people like that, and these people can be seeds of evil, if they have influence, by disseminating half-truths to incite outrage and hate.The entire dialogue near the end between the two women before they fight epitomize the struggle between rationality and ideology. Here, Athena is the ideologue/extremist while Crystal is the voice of reason. Ideology is deaf to reason. This exchange hit the mark.As I had accepted that the movie was 'fantasy' from almost the beginning, I found many of the unrealistic scenes amusing, as they were exaggerations of the tropes representing the attitudes of the Far Right and the Far Left.If the viewer is on the Far Right or Far left, s/he may not like this movie because it probably hits too close to home in showing the hypocrisy, hubris, inaneness, and self-righteousness of their side, be it Far Left or Far Right.My rating is somewhere between 6 and 7. I'll round up to 7."}, {"id": 144, "text": "I watched this film for the first time last night and loved almost every minute!The Hunt is action packed from the opening scene and provides viewers with a great doss of gore, hilarity and unpredictable outcomes. This film felt like a mashup of several violent and political movies before, reminding me of 'The Purge' (from the same director) meets 'The Hunger Games', with a side of Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' action.You never know what to expect, with the arguably most well known actress (Emma Roberts) being killed off within minutes and the typical 'alpha male' character which is set up to seem like a possible love interest dying quickly after.The political comedy is clever, taking shots at both sides of the spectrum at the appropriate time during the movie. I found myself agreeing with points on both teams, it certainly gives you a few minutes of reflection.The initially confusing middle of the film taking the action away to a refugee camp is both clever and dull. It provides the political backdrop of the movie with a chance to demonstrate the real hardships that actual refugees face, suggesting what the average American will never face, but it feels forced and could have been cut, keeping the film to pure action and gore!Some of the characters could have been explored further and this is lacking mainly due to the quick and rapid deaths of most of the 'hunted' within the first 15 minutes. However, more time could have been spent on the liberal elite chasing down their victims and toying with them. One scene shows an 'elite' trying to make a victim understand why they are being hunted, yet 8/12 deaths are simply quick and don't seem to serve the same purpose of understanding why you are being hunted? There are some great characters on the liberal elite side who could have been developed further.The ending reminded me of the classic fight at the end of 'Kill Bill' for its quirky and fast action, to its unrealistic yet amazing carnage.Overall, The Hunt is fast-paced, clever and deadly, offering the audience more than they bargained for.

We have a group of conservative people chosen to be hunted like animals but the majority of them are killed off very quickly.

Expected a standard horror flick. I created an IMDb account just to write this review as catharsis after watching - I don't know how to describe this.Starts off fine, if unspectacular. The captives all get armed and The Hunt begins, as captors start firing upon them. I didn't think it was that well directed or acted, but it was fine.The real car-crash starts when three of them escape the perimeter fence and find a roadhouse. The roadhouse is run by a ma &amp; pa couple, who it turns out were actually part of the hunters all along. The film fairly suddenly turns this into a liberal v conservative thing? The hunters are liberals and the hunted are conservatives and there's an avalanche of the standard taunts thrown out before the liberal ma &amp; pa kill the conservatives.Another escapee enters the roadhouse and is told by them that she's in Arkansas. Between a bloodied dollar note and something about the price of cigarettes by state, she figures out ma &amp; pa are hunters too so grabs the shotgun hiding below the counter (without hesitation) and kills them. She then goes outside and inspects their car. She finds out their Arkansas number plate was fake, she tears it off, to reveal that the ma &amp; pa were Croatian for some reason? Are Croatians all liberal?A few more minutes, she meets up with another escapee, and the film seems hellbent on doing this as a liberal v conservative thing. I lasted forty minutes before switching off. Two stars simply for the laughing disbelief I experienced in this time.I don't know where they were going with the political coda of this, I don't really care. I don't mind my horror films going a bit silly, but as a non-American, the idea of hunting down a mainstream political group is as absurd as having people go to war over pineapple on pizza. That some people seem to so readily accept this pigeonholing and the figment of plausibility says something disturbing about American society to me."}, {"id": 167, "text": "Entertaining movie. Keeps you jumping on your seats"}, {"id": 168, "text": "That a film like this managed to be made in the current political climate, is actually nothing short of amazing. That's not to say it's especially daring, but to even _attempt_ being in the middle, in Hollywood, is dangerous (I'd be surprised if some of the actors don't have difficulty being cast in other major productions going forward, just for daring to sign up to this).To quote Roddy Piper and Keith David in They Live... I'm walking a white line - I don't bother nobody, nobody bothers me. You better start doing the same. White lines in the middle of the road. That's the worst place to drive.At it's heart, this is a familiar story. Elites use working class people for the thrill of the hunt. Just think Jean-Claude Van Damme's 'Hard Target' from '93 (and even then it wasn't an original idea), with a dash of politics.It's not a perfect film, by any means. You have to turn your brain off at some of the logic. For example, if they weren't supposed to get on the train in the first place, why would one of the hunters already be in disguise onboard? There certainly wasn't time for the hunters to have guessed what the hunted individuals would do at that point, let alone be prepared to set themselves up for the ruse. Also, the 'gas station' ruse is flimsy. Even just a simple hint that the hunted were driven in that direction would have helped, but leaving the starting location and taking the correct path appears to be blind luck, despite being an integral part of the hunters' plan.These flaws can somewhat be excused, though, since this _is_ played as a dark comedy, rather than a serious action movie.Betty Gilpin is great as Crystal, the main 'hunted' character, who goes from doing her best to survive, to turning the tables on her hunters. She doesn't shy away from doing to them what they planned to do to her. She knows that if she walks away, chances are her fate will still be the same, just further down the line. That itself is another layer to the character. At one point she could have walked away, potentially escaped and blown the whistle. However, she refuses to be the victim.Hilary Swank is also superb, albeit with less screen time, as the villain of the piece. She plays her cold-hearted character with conviction and no hint of absurdity, which is why it works so well.I've read others complaining that Crystal is a 'Mary Sue', the term used to describe a character who requires no effort, no training, and is immediately good at anything they need to be (The most commonly touted example being Rey in the Star Wars sequel trilogy). On the surface this may seem a fair complaint, but it's all about context. The 'hunted' are meant to be strangers. We do not know _anything_ about their backgrounds, so they may be skilled or unskilled and we can only learn as events progress.Secondly, Crystal only ever appears skilled in combat and survival. There is no hint of abilities beyond that. She doesn't magically know how to fly a plane, or hack a computer. The 'Mary Sue' complaint is more appropriate when used against a character who can out-perform practised experts in _multiple_ areas, without any indication of how they may have gained those skills.However, we do learn a little about Crystal. Our first glimpse implies her survival abilities, as she quickly creates a makeshift compass to orient herself, whilst those around her wander, dazed and confused. Later, she also states to one character that she was in the military and saw active service, even though we never learn to what extent. Given the context of the story, it's more than enough.I've also read complaints about the ending, as though it's a cop-out, implying she was mistakenly brought there. However, the ending is actually quite ambiguous. She may reveal that she was there by mistake, but we are left to wonder if she is merely putting Hilary Swank's Athena off-guard. Later, she confirms the mistake, but it must be remembered that at this point Athena believes, as she lies dying, that she has succeeded in also taking Crystal with her. Crystal could well have maintained the lie, to avoid giving Athena the satisfaction of thinking she had succeeded in killing the last 'deplorable'. Instead, Athena dies believing she has failed in that respect.Either way, Crystal has stolen that satisfaction from the villain in her final moments. It's then up to us, the viewer, to decide if she was telling the truth or not, which is what makes it all the more fun.Overall, the film does feel a little short, as though the creators were a little wary of taking their character portrayals any further. Doing what they did was daring enough, but if the satire had gone any deeper they may have been left without any careers to continue.Essentially, they got away with it by making this more of an 'elites hunt working class, dark-comedy action movie', and leaving the satire as a relatively mild surface layer that all but the most partisan can laugh at. But, as stated, that balancing act is itself an achievement in 2020.All-in-all, if you don't mind some graphic over-the-top violence in a darkly comic context, along with some political and societal satire, then The Hunt is great fun."}, {"id": 169, "text": "This leans much more towards satire and black comedy style of horror.

It's more a bunch of redneck conspiracy theory supporters, who are referred to in the movie as 'deplorables', being rounded up and used as target practice for rich inept executives who lost their precious jobs following such social media viral tempest.The top CEO affected by the social media campaign, Athena, played by Oscar winner Hilary Swank, is not taking the ramblings of the 'deplorables' lying down. She gets even big time. During the year that followed calls for her resignation, she enlists her inept associates participation to carry out her plan of revenge. We observe Athena's 'bad-assery' early in the movie when she kills a Goliath type deplorable with all the coolness of a cold blooded assassin, using one of her Louboutin high heel shoe for the job; she was after all a killer CEO.Key social media 'deplorables' are, we presume, singled out and investigated so they can be better eliminated in a wild target practice shoot, a very deadly and gruesome one. The story revealed that the fake news about the executives was one having those executives carrying out a human hunt for their sick pleasure, which wasn't true, just like the Pizzagate story and other conspiracy theories from the far right aren't. However, it inspired Athena to serve her retribution by delivering exactly that with which she was alleged of doing. I really like that twist. Her bumbling associates were not lethal like Athena, so she hired a consultant mercenary to train and supervise her friends for 'The Hunt'. Athena supervised the whole thing remotely, via 'walkie-walkies' and drones. But something unexpected was happening.One of the 'deplorables' was mistakenly targeted. Crystal, played by Betty Gilpin, had the same name and lived in the same town as another, named Crystale; she was anything but a deplorable. Crystal was a well read, smart Afghan war veteran with better fighting skills than Athena's and tactical experience superior to the consultant she had hired. When Crystal woke up from her drug induced kidnapping, like all the other target victims she immediately started to assess and reassess the situation. One by one, she mercilessly defeated Aathena's pawns, including that mercenary consultant. Did I mention she was a bad-ass broad?All things considered, what you'll see is inept liberal elites going after far right deplorables with one kick-ass smart female vet not taking crap from anyone. Of course Athena and Crystal will have a final confrontation, violent and exhausting; you can't be sure who will emerge the winner but let me spoil it for you by saying Athena's last words are priceless.

Blue State and so upset President Trump that he referred to it as Liberal Hollywood being racist at the highest level and stating, The movie coming out is made in order to inflame and cause chaos, and They create their own violence, and then try to blame others.Nobody cared.I mean, this is a movie that has Sturgill Simpson play a character named Vanilla Nice. That's the extent of its humor. And the idea that perhaps there's no right side in this war is pretty much wasted so that Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank can have a fifteen-minute fistfight.The whole beginning of this movie feels less like a film and more like watching someone else play PUBG, with numerous deaths happening with no consequences or emotions.It's closer to a slasher, some would say, but most slashers are entertaining.Imagine if The Purge, but remove all the over-the-top ridiculousness and square up reel moralizing - as well as most of the fun - and you have this movie.Look, Hard Target, Turkey Shoot and Surviving the Game are already much better cover versions than this.

That's to say the set up isn't original but the take, &amp; the ultimate rationale, is. While the film does a fair job of caricaturing both liberal elites &amp; ignorant ordinary americans they may surprise, the message we get at the end of the film is that our fears - at least when they become incarnated in certain types of theory about the people at the top - may be to an extent self-fulfilling. Is that true? Maybe in part but with respect to the one of the main dynamics of the story, I don't recall elite conspiracy theories (true or otherwise) ever having got any one into actual trouble. What they actually tend to do is to serve to confirm people's existing biases. While the film partly acknowledges this, it's self-critique is ultimately limited for this reason, something reflected in the final assertion of innocence at the point of the final showdown with the villain of the piece: liberal elites are bad, but conspiracy theorists.....well, they kind of deserve their fate here, and that's one of the reasons, that there's little sympathy on show for most of the 'victims' on show here. Indeed, in purely causal terms, the denouement shows us that the elite are the victims, de-humanised in self-defence.The best part of this film though, apart from the lead actress, who is very good in her role, is the satirising of liberal elite attitudes, the capacity to simultaneously show unstinting compassion for minorities &amp; political correctness, at the same time as a considerable capacity for aggression towards anyone who offends against their values.Ultimately though, this is self-criticism. The makers of this film, are liberals themselves, critiquing themselves while extending limited compassion to those who offend against our new shared values. This is even reflected in the fact that protagonists are both female and feature in the film as hard as nails action stars while the males are all entirely dispensable &amp; generally pretty negligible quantities.Pretty unobjectionable good fun overall though"}, {"id": 200, "text": "This movie couldn't of released in a better year.

Would be good for audiences 15 and over."}, {"id": 203, "text": "\ud83d\ude31 First Impressions: It goes without saying that a film centred on strangers waking up and being hunted is like the new trope of the horror genre. The only difference lies in why they were brought there. So I actually went in with little to no expectations and just looking for some entertainment. Political controversy aside, it's a mighty heck of a good time. Pros: \ud83d\ude0b I love the comedy-horror; often times those thriller films do not really go together because one will typically outshine the other. But here it is pulled off with flying colors because of the choice in casting. Actresses playing Crystal and Athena were absolutely made for their respective parts. I laughed more times than I could count!! Their line delivery were on point too.\ud83d\ude0b The wacky change in hero/heroine in just the first 20 min alone subverted all expectations! I had a really fun time trying to guess what'd happen next though once I got what the film was doing. Even there is an element of blindsiding to the story- admit it when you first saw the group chat, you thought they planned it from the get go too~ That was a twist I wasn't anticipating either.\ud83d\ude0b There is a clever commentary somewhere about the political situation in the States. I don't really follow much but I can see the clear divide between Conservatives and Liberals, rich and poor, educated and illiterate... Also the whole premise of the film is a testament of the blatant effects of how things end up blown out of proportions on the Internet and how they have very devastating real life effects.Cons: \ud83d\ude2a This ain't really a con- but there is a lot to theorize. One, could the Hunt actually be real? I know they said that it's only as real as the manor conspiracy believers made it out to be.. Therefore, they willed it and were actually hoping for it to be true. But why would they joke about such a thing then. It really bothers me, hahahah! Then you have the Don being one of them (which is most likely just a psychological trick to get them both on edge) and the whole Crystal being one of two women similar in name only. It's a headscratcher alright but I need answers (I need things to laid out for me)...\ud83d\ude2a Now a real con. The plot of the film is actually quite petty- like the whole point of the film was to prove to people that unadulterated comments especially in the eyes of the public can have repercussions. How do they do that- by actually bringing to reality the one thing that they were trying to disprove to begin with... Near the end, it was even pointed out and ridiculed too by Crystal. Then, the whole clever political, racial and class statements the film was attempting to raise awareness can be said to be flawed or lose their punch as well because of the presentation in it being a comedy and all. Just pointing that out, but I'm just here to pass the time though, doesn't really bother me~\ud83d\ude07Verdict\ud83d\ude08 I was blown away by the sheer, devilish cleverness in the film's story and direction. The two leading ladies are phenomenal and of course the catfight at the end is the highlight!! The twist of the film was unthought of but for good reasons because of how it is basically a self-fulfilling prophecy that the writers conjured as they hit a dead end. Though, it's laced with actual political satire and undertones of the US- they simply become passing elements to the film's action and jokes that the latter easily overshadows."}, {"id": 204, "text": "This is a Battle Royale situation where the rich hunt the poor but with the added twist that it speaks about polarized America, liberal elites against Sean Hannity rednecks. Given the template, we know we are not going to have to really know any of these people except as fodder in a game we watch. Stereotypes are mined often. The tone is gleeful, poking fun in passing rather than overtly serious, and I would rather have it this way. It's a light-hearted jab at a really broken historical moment.But as with other concept movies, after the raft of initial surprises of world are peeled off, I'm left with the same ordinary scenes of action, shootouts and fistfights. It trails off near the end, having nowhere left to go.

As a centrist, I didn't feel offended one way or another. Crystal has no allegiance biases and is just trying to survive.The ending fight scene with Athena (Hillary Swank) is equal to those of Tarantino's Kill Bill and Carpenter's They Live. There was even about 10 seconds which reminded me of the Guy Pearce/Robert Carlisle Ravenous ending.Director Craig Zobel ran a tight ship, expertly melding screenwriters Nick Cuse/Damon Lindeloft's succinct script with cinematographer Darran Tiernan's expert cinematography.I generally don't like horror/gore movies but this extremely dark comedy send-up was entertaining.

I've seen this a few times now where movie makers are desperate to show that they aren't prejudice and of course women can be the Army vet, silent type, badass; but why oh why do they almost always do this whilst also scripting the male characters as generally stupid - and why do they always leave them in full, unblemished, makeup?! It's like someone's looked at all those movies where women didn't have a great time and said 'instead of trying to make things more equal, why don't we make another total imbalance the other way around'.Main actor played the role quite weird as well - sometimes pulling faces like she was trying to divide Pythagoras Theorem by a Conference Pear."}, {"id": 220, "text": "I don't usually like movies with blood and gore, but this movie moves along at such a brisk pace and has so much else going on that the gross bits didn't bother me too much.

The references to Orwell's Animal Farm are scattered throughout The Hunt, from the leftists including actual pigs in their game, to an extended conversation between the two main characters at the end where they debate which one of them is the actual Snowball.The underlying messages throughout the film are pretty obvious. The Hunt isn't only mocking the extremists on both sides of the political spectrum, it's also mocking those who take Twitter WAY too seriously. It's mocking cancel culture, to it's most extreme. The Hunt's organizer is cancelled by Twitter loons due to her joke, and she then decides to quite literally cancel (kill), those who cancelled her.The strongest message comes with the finale, where Snowball informs the organizer that she got it wrong. Apparently her research was flawed. She hadn't found the actual Twitter culprit, but someone who simply shares a similar name. The obvious deeper meaning being that cancel culture doesn't care about facts and is a game where nobody wins.The entire game started because of one individual getting fired over a stupid joke. People were murdered over completely ridiculous nonsense like saying mean words on Twitter. And Snowball, was a seemingly innocent person included in the hunt because the organizer got it wrong.The people in the film are caricatures rather than characters. The plot takes current cultural issues and amplifies them into their most extreme incarnation, smacking the viewer in the face with how ridiculous the underlying thought process/belief system is. The main character, Snowball, is the neutral. The viewer never finds out what her own beliefs are, just that people are trying to kill her so she's going to fight back. It's these reasons and several others (which I'll avoid mentioning so as not to give absolutely everything away), that this is probably the most well executed satire I've seen in recent years.The film itself I'd probably give about a 7/10 for being somewhat funny, silly and over the top. I upped my rating though because of how perceptive, well written and well executed it was when one considers the subtext.(This review is a little longer and I went into more detail because it seems like many reviews are missing all of this entirely)"}, {"id": 240, "text": "Just plain garbage.

After a bloody and brutal initial encounter; the remaining individuals head out into the surrounding area and soon becomes a situation with far more questions than answers.One of the Hunted is Crystal (Betty Gilpin) deduces that things are much more complex then they seem and things take a turn in a new direction. At this point in the film I was thinking that it was lacking any real tension or suspense as the characters were not overly developed and it made investing in their outcome difficult. The film then changes direction and looks at events of the past and also explains more about the Hunters and their motivations which is somewhat unexpected.The film is a very difficult one to review as people will expect it to be an Action/Suspense film based on the trailers. That is really just a small part of the story which is actually closer to a Dark Comedy with heavy political overtones.Those overtones are likely to be very controversial and may put people off from seeing the film. During my post-screening comments I said that I am going to need some time to wrap my head around this film as to if I liked it or not.

If anything, this movie is more of a dark comedy. I expected it to be edgy and filled with moments that would keep me on the edge of my seat. The trailer definitely makes it seem that way. Unfortunately, there's nothing remotely scary about this movie (unless, of course, you count pointless gore as scary). Seriously, can you tell me what's horrific about a man cracking an offensive joke while shoving a grenade down another man's pants? The only thing scary about this movie are the terrible attempts to be funny. The main battle is purposefully goofy. All the horror moments (like a woman literally being blown in half) is made comical. Said severed woman, with her organs strewn about, is totally coherent and calls another person a snowflake while laying in a pit of spikes. It's an over-the-top, bloody comedy. The only thing that remained true is that it's listed in the action category as well, and there are quite a few action-packed sequences in this movie. They're stupid and over the top, but action filled nonetheless.This movie is made to look like a mix of Animal Farm and The Hunger Games. Instead, it's bland and extremely obvious. After the first twist, you literally see everything else coming. Even that first twist is easy to guess. I kid you not when I say that every single person in the movie (with the exception of the head female role) is a hidden antagonist. Those nice elderly people in the gas station? Baddies. The nice guy who was taking you back to America? A bad guy. That guy you were working with in order to survive? A bad guy. It's the same shocker moment used multiple times, and it's just annoying after a while.The antagonists in this movie are cringe-worthy. There's a scene where they're literally sitting together discussing the likes they have on their social media accounts, talking like idiotic teenagers. The good guys have their moments, but most of them are frustratingly stupid as well. The only main protagonist is a jerk who is thrown into the cliched category of the indestructible survivalist. She sees every little thing coming. She knows the people in the gas station are working against her because of the price of the cigarettes she tries to buy. Let's be honest...how many people know the price of cigarettes in a state where they don't live? It's unbelievable. She also knows that the car she's about to approach has a bomb strapped underneath it within five seconds of approaching the vehicle. They try to give her an explanation as to why she's so good at these things, but it's still so cheesy that I couldn't bring myself to believe it.Don't waste your time on this movie. Don't believe the trailers you saw for it. None of it is true. It's just some political movie with over the top goofiness that tries too hard to be funny, but fails miserably.

I guess you've gotta be in the mood for this type of ridiculous flick and its not my thing."}, {"id": 300, "text": "Before I get into anything, I will say that the first 15 minutes was a little bit too much. The first 15 minutes matched with the controversy that the film is still receiving to this day.Let's start with the marketing: Before the first trailer for this film made its way online, it was being shown only in theaters alongside Crawl, an alligator horror film. I saw Crawl in theaters and the trailer was shown in the previews. There was really nothing wrong the trailer in my opinion, however, the trailer made the film seem like a full fledged horror film with serious acting dialogue. To be honest: I thought it was going to be a political horror film. That is what I truly thought it was. After the film, I did some research and realized it is a Satire. For those that do not know what that is, it's defined as something that should not be taken seriously. I saw that a slew of promotional materials were being shown throughout the United States right after the Trailer made its way online, I will get to that in a moment. The marketing for this film made it seem like there was a unknown conflict between the filmmakers and the distribution company, which is Universal Pictures. Before the trailer made its way online, horrible shootings have occurred that literally scared people, then the trailer made its way online. That wasn't necessarily the studio's fault, it was mainly bad timing. That is when the controversy started. Before I get into the controversy itself, I honestly thought it would have started when the trailer was only being shown in theaters. That wasn't the case because even though Crawl was a critical darling, it did not do well at the box office. Not a lot people went to theaters to see Crawl. There's that. Back to the controversy. It was receiving backlash on all fronts, and I mean all fronts, not just the Republicans. The Democrats, Liberals, Socialists, and virtually every political party and it's associations had essentially made this film look like it is promoting violence. The only reason why I didn't contribute to any of the backlash is because 1.) I cannot judge something without seeing it, something that the majority of people that still need to learn. Don't judge a book by its cover. And 2.) I actually went ahead and researched the film before all of this happened. Even though I didn't have the whole story, I had more insight than those that were putting hate on the film. I defended this film and I still am. Even the United States President targeted the film as promoting hate, and he hasn't seen the film, nor looked into the film. I almost sided with the backlash. I truly did, not because of its interpretation the marketing was making what the film might be, but because it shouldn't be released due to the horrible timing of the shootings and the online release of the trailer. I truly almost sided with the backlash, just because of the terrible timing and bad luck. Thankfully, the executives at Universal listened and (at the time) indefinitely delayed the film until further notice.Sometime into 2020, the marketing started back up and Universal Pictures learned their lesson on what they did wrong and were now marketing the film as a satire. Only a few changed sides and gave the film a chance. What I thought was accurate, which was taglined in the trailer is by quote The Most Talked About Film Of The Year.........That No One Has Seen Yet. Universal was going full throttle using the satire and the controversy for the marketing and promotion of the film. In my opinion, it honestly worked.By the time the film released in theaters, it didn't really have a chance at all, not because people were going to give the film a chance, again, some people actually did change sides, and I still think it might've done well at the box office, but because of the worsening conditions of the pandemic, known as Covid-19, or Coronavirus. The film was only in theaters for just the weekend before theaters started shutting down on Tuesday. Not great optimism for opening weekend results. By the time the film was released, people were not willing to go to movie theaters because of the Pandemic. I was actually able to see the film in theaters because everything worsened for the film industry. That just leaves............the film.Now here's my thoughts about the film. I thought the action was well done, the plot was decent, the acting was excellent, and the lead actresses, Protagonist Betty Gilpin and Antagonist Hilary Swank were just phenomenal. Obviously, even though the director and producers won't admit it, yet, the film went through multiple reshoots, probably as a response for all the controversy. I know this because the dialogue in the trailers were changed in the film and scenes were edited out of the film that were shown in the trailers. The only thing if I had the power to change anything, is the first 15 minutes of the film. The filmmakers could have made every opportunity to make the first minutes of the film not offensive in any way, but I was offended by that first opening scenes, and I'm not even a Republican. That's how offensive that was. My most hated line from the film is For the record a**hole, climate change is real. That line alone almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I am not joking when I say that. Thank God gears were switched and changed as soon as Betty Gilpin, whose character is named Crystal, appears on screen in the gas station. There was great action sequences throughout the film. I even thought it was cool that she was able to tell that something was off before something bad happened. I was rooting for her in theaters, mainly because I was the only one in the screening. I would have rooted for her regardless.Granted, the satire could've have used more work to have a remote impact for the film, I will admit that. I will admit that the on screen deaths were in a way, cartoonish styled as well, however, besides the first 15 minutes, the film was great. This film will probably be considered one of the most misunderstood films of all time. And for those that never give things a chance because of how public perception twists the situation without having the full context (little pun for a scene in the film), I hope that you do give this chance. I will understand that the first 15 minutes will be rough, I understand that completely, but those minutes are very vital for the plot the film is trying to convey.Spoiler Alert for those that don't want to see the film without giving it a chance but may after I say this: The Republicans win.

It unapologetically amplifies all the flaws on both sides to the point where no one is particularly likeable (apart from one character).Yes, it was absolutely created to stir the pot and that it did.

I didn't feel for the emotionally closed off Crystal. I do love the early kills. It's a back and forth affair. I was still on the fence coming around to the final act. There are a few times where I see better writing or a better twist opportunities available. The other Crystal is a gold mine for twists and comedy which is left on the table.

It's played out in stylistically gory fashion with the uniquely creative 'kills' masterminded by the screenwriters and director Craig Zobel. Some of them are so gruesome they're almost as funny as they are horrific. Like the unfortunate lady who falls into a pit full of spikes. Still alive after being impaled by two of the huge stakes through the center of her body, she survives long enough to be blown to kingdom come. Well, at least half of her. And so it goes, until the last woman standing from a group of twelve mysteriously dropped into the center of a hunting ground in a foreign country, begins the formidable task of being the hunter to take out Athena Stone (Hilary Swank), the owner and host of Manorgate. I think I would have appreciated it if Snowball/Crystal (Betty Gilpin) had cracked a smile or two every now and then. I mean, I know her situation was pretty dire before she got a handle on things, but it would have taken some of the gritty edge off her character. I have to say though, that amazingly long catfight between her and Athena Stone ranks right up there with the best of them in virtually any genre. It was kind of cool too, to see Swank's character call forth some of her 'Next Karate Kid' training to deliver some neat martial art moves. You know, when you think about it, we're probably not too far away from a reality show that raises the stakes and takes the concept of The Hunt to the next level in cable programming and internet streaming.

This film isn't about a 50-50 split. In fact, the vocal minorities on the extremes are the people who this film skewers, and makes no apologies for doing so. It is that 10-20% who are going to be triggered, not the rest of us in the middle who see their hypocrisy and hate-fueled rhetoric for what it TRULY is - anger, condescension, fear, ignorance and narcissism. This film has a much deeper meaning than many have noticed. Yes, it is an action film, with gory sequences and some snappy dialogue. But at it's core it IS a political statement, and for once not a preachy one. More of an expos\u00e9 of the idiocy of the extreme left AND right, and how those very few (but very outspoken and visible) people try to create hatred among so many of us in the middle. If this movie upsets you or you find yourself picking a side, it's likely because you are a part of that insidious radical group, on either side. This is your wake-up call before you become just as violent over your so-called cause as the people in this movie.

At no time I could say I was bored watching this. That's enough for me. Shouldn't it be for everyone tho?"}, {"id": 332, "text": "Going into this movie I surely didn't expect it to be a comedic and simple as I thought. I expected a lot more just gruesome and kind of disturbing things especially with the poster images. Also the slight uproar this movie had online aided in that preconception, but after finishing the movie the marketing department definitely did their job because this movie isn't pushing any ''boundaries''.So american politics aside this movie is overall an enjoyable one. But also left me wanting for more. One the biggest flaws in this movie is the late and lack of character background and development for pretty much every single character. Most annoyingly from the characters that are actually hunting. I'd argue none of the characters in this movie are believable at all.The writing in this movie is pretty basic, rich elitists don't like the poor with opinions, and they silence them by organizing a hunt because they also enjoy killing them in psychopathic ways(?).. this links back to there being so little character depth, why are these people so interested and nonchalant about murder? Very unbelievable. So this movie also decides to show us this backstory waaay too late in the movie. That scene where the family gathers and actually plans the whole thing needed to be there before they all got killed in the bunker.The dialog is alright. The acting though, I guess that's one of the main highlights of this movie, Betty Gilpin gives a very oddly directed but good performance. Most of the others are fine except for a few of the first throwaway characters we got. The main villain is good too, but once again, lack of screen time and backstory.The directing, now this is a thing, simply put its sloppy and all over the place. The movie doesn't look ugly, but it has such a shift in tone from the first couple of fake out main character deaths. Honestly, it was really looking like a comedy action movie the first 30 minutes. But once we get to the last two survivors it gets a lot more serious in its tone. It seemed intentional, but I would've preferred the serious tone from the start but I guess the movie never had the proper character depth for that anyways. The kills in this are sometimes good, many of them are last second cut aways, so not much to see but some are pretty gruesome and well done. Most of the action directing is good except for the final 1v1 fight. Although this fight is really fun to watch and entertaining while it happened, a lot of times its sloppy, hits that come from nowhere quick cut aways that aren't followed up well. There are some good moments, even comedic ones like the glass door, but a lot of the times I felt myself having to refocus on the fight because action wasn't followed logically.The soundtrack was good, I really enjoyed the final fight and its music. Tonally it fit and just really worked for the fight. Once again though some of the early parts of the movie had music that felt so much less serious in tone.The ending is really as simple as the whole movie, I did wait for one more surprise but not even that. It's quite a bland ending.Also I wouldn't ever categorize this is a horror, it just has a bit more blood than a typical action movie.All in all the movie definitely didn't bore me. It just missed quite some marks and felt sloppy in its direction.5.5/10 enjoyable"}, {"id": 333, "text": "Movie was really good and I will happily watch it again."}, {"id": 334, "text": "Really enjoyed this, i wasn't expecting much.

There are some fun twists along the way and it keeps you guessing as to who you can trust.

I don't want this review to be hidden due to spoilers, so I'm keeping details slim, but the movie makers actually did drop enough hints to fully confirm who is a leftist spy and who is not. Further, it's hard to imagine Crystal would so competently navigate Manorgate if she truly had no prior knowledge about it, as she claims. In one scene, Crystal's suspicions are aroused merely because she is questioned about her behavior before she arrived.

The foolish storyline ruined it for me."}, {"id": 419, "text": "Well,I wasn't let down by this movie, because the writers behind it studied up on the subject material. First, there's a bias that's true for any large country that mainly speaks one language, the set of ideas brought forth by its citizens will rarely get challenged on the inside by those who didn't grow up there. It's nice to call America a melting pot, but it's not exempt from processes that happened here in Europe, namely the innate need to create one language. Lincoln's logs aren't controversial, even though the style was imported by Finnish settlers, who descendants today carry Anglicized names and wouldn't understand a lick of Finnish.That's where Europe comes in. The downside to having one large country with one majority language is that both the majority and many people of color tend to imagine all white people like the way WASPs do, but we don't. Way before the Cold War necessitated a long physical barrier between the Western and Eastern half of Europe, while Western powers fought over colonies in the world wars, the later Eastern Bloc just fought to eradicate each other, not unlike the later Yugoslavian Civil War. I'm guessing choosing Slovenia which was largely spared of fighting, but FLOTUS is from there, would have been too much on the nose, Croatia is a better fit. Frankly, Gary's ruse to infiltrate himself among refugees would totally not work in real life. For one, Arabic dialects are different and some slang is region specific. Imagine it like using an Alaskan fishing slang in Louisiana, both are English speakers, but so far away that they'd likely be not familiar with it. Linguistics aside, being a refugee on the Western Balkans route is no cake walk, and the levels of xenophobia is high. For the record, xenophobia means anyone not from the region, so the depiction of being somewhat hostile to Americans is accurate, y'all the face of globalism.I think Crystal caught on the diplomat being fake, because having served in Afghanistan, she probably was assigned to humanitarian missions, therefore knew that it's the UNHCR's job to get people out of refugee camps if they have no papers. In fact, they were lucky, in real life they'd probably detained in a normal jail, and fingerprinted until their identity can be confirmed. I'm glad they dispelled the myth of I'm an American, I'm entitled to my phone call. It's also rare that a member of the diplomatic corps travels without a chauffeur or at bare minimum a translator.From a writing standpoint I loved how they presented a Texas Hold'em style of plot presentation where they could expect us being familiar with the visceral gut reactions online, and not need to elaborate further what connected the targets and hunters. However, there is one thing I didn't see in other reviews, and that's the mention, how not everyone who supports a great cause does so out of the goodness of their heart. The hunters were just sorry they got caught in a possibly Sony-level intrusion, deep down they had no connection to the people they allegedly felt offended for. To put it differently, this is the typical I'm willing to make a donation so your kids don't go hungry to school, but my property value would go down if I allowed you to live anywhere near me.That brings me to Athena. There might have been a general idea why she started to train, but in the hot second she saw Crystal, her hurt pride over losing her CEO position kicked in, and she didn't bother to check if they got the right person. She wanted a punchable face, a negative outlet. A flesh and blood person to own, to enact revenge for the slight she suffered.It's a touch of genius to bring up Animal Farm, not just because it's quoted less, than 1984, but because he wrote it after experiencing first hand how Stalin's paranoia, that manifested in the Great Purge reached Spain and plenty of innocents got caught in the crossfire.

And so from this idea we get the feeling that this film is one that won't be holding back on what it is trying to say about our current political landscape.From the start of the film the movie begins murdering off a slew of characters one by one as you try to figure out who are the main characters of the story. In this murder spree you get a sense that this is a comedy as many of the deaths are very over the top and comedic. A lot of time is spent making fun of the conservative mindset in this sequence as many character rally together to try and protect themselves. These scenes are also used to set up the world we are in and who are our antagonist going to be.Despite the scenes of making fun of the conservative party the film also does a lot to make fun of the liberal party and their innate hypocrisy. These are rich progressives who only act for these causes when they feel like it would benefit them in some way, but in reality they don't really care for the causes. There are many scenes within this film that defiantly feel like they are leaning right into the more pro-conservative camp than the liberal one. And by doing this the film forces the liberal party to look out their own innate problems that they have.However this is still a Damon Lindeloff who has just finished of the exceptional Watchmen show based on the amazing graphic novel. The Watchmen show was a very liberal leaning show, and you can still see a lot of those liberal ideas being formed in the female protagonist introduced played by Betty Gilpin. While this character does side with the conservative faction we do get many scenes showing that she has many more of the traits that are given to female heroes on the left. She doesn't show the hate to the muslim faction that her conservative friends do, and she seems to not take crap from her more oppressive male counterparts. She comes off as a Sarah Conner or a female John Wick type of character. She shows that she only has one passion and that is violence.The film does have a myriad of problems. There are many questions raised throughout the movie especially with Betty Gilpin's character and her sidekick. Betty's character doesn't really give us a lot of insight to what is going on in her head. She doesn't come with a lot answers about her past. And when her sidekick seemingly betrays her we don't really get a direct answer if he really did or not, but neither of these questions match the very strange and unorthodox ending we get that really only acts to confuse the viewer even more to what is going on here.In conclusion The Hunt isn't a perfect film, but it is a solid and fun movie with tons of violence, and a fun twisted look at the conservative and liberal parties that could act as a warning of a very real future that could happen if we don't change our way of thinking."}, {"id": 476, "text": "If you're willing to throw your stupidly extreme political biasis away you can enjoy this film for its innovative way of introducing the main character, terrific action sequences and spot on comedic timing.

The first fifteen minutes in and you'd go: what the hell is going on here? but after you read who co-wrote and produced this movie everything would fall into place - it's maestro Damon Lindelof who knows how to screw up your brains in guessing games he fancy writing. The Hunt is a fun movie but it spoiled the fun a lot with its overly political undertones you are by no means looking in a slasher movie. One thing's for sure is that it hits all the right buttons when it comes to gore and violence; at times you just can't help but see that the creators were just having fun with it too.

A mad Russian aristocrat stalks an unarmed big-game hunter for amusement on his privately-owned Caribbean island. Similarly, in The Hunt, ten men and women die gruesome deaths from bullets, boobytraps, and bows &amp; arrows during the first thirty minutes of this 90-minute massacre. Clearly, producer &amp; director Craig Zobel admires George Orwell's allegorical novel Animal Farm as much as The Most Dangerous Game. Not only do Zobel and co-scripters Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof insert frequent Animal Farm allusions in the dialogue, but they also let a cute little pig cavort amidst all the savagery until its trigger-happy, Liberal owners ambush it by accident. Parenthetically, Cuse co-scripted the HBO mini-series remake of Watchmen (2019), while Lindelof created Lost (2004-2010).Primarily, The Hunt features only two fully fleshed-out characters. The heroine is a Mississippi native, Crystal Mae Creasy (Betty Gilpin of Netflix's Glow) who served in Afghanistan and knows how to shoot, while her wealthy antagonist is Athena (Hilary Swank of Boys Don't Cry), one of the disgraced CEOs who planned this sadistic hunt for humans. Everybody else is typecast. One victim (Emma Roberts of Aquamarine) wears a yoga outfit. Literally, her character is listed in the end credits as 'Yoga Pants!' Indeed, the Liberal Left label these populists as a basket of deplorables. Mind you, Hilary Clinton coined this ugly term during her 2016 Presidential campaign. TheNew York Times wrote that she identified half of Trump's supporters as deplorables. Clinton reviled them as racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, and Islamophobic. Meantime, dastardly villains here constitute a faction of snobbish, affluent, but ostracized Whites in seclusion. They had been chastised for the texting thread shown in the opening scene. Naturally, they were shocked to learn that somebody had hacked their thread. Accordingly, these CEOs were either fired or resigned voluntarily. Later, in retaliation, these CEOs executed what they had contemplated initially as a farce. Meantime, Zobel and co-writers frustrate audiences because it is virtually impossible to choose a character with which you can align your sympathies before the first hour elapses. No sooner do you warm up to one character than that person suffers a sudden case of death. For example, a fleeing brunette stumbles into a pit studded with huge wooden spikes. Miraculously, another character hoists this fatally wounded brunette off those blood-soaked spikes. Staggering away with her arm around his shoulder, he realizes too late he has just stepped on a land mine. BLAM! The explosion atomizes him, while the poor brunette is blown back into the same pit. Landing in it again, she recovers only to find herself skewered on those same spikes. Sadly, the explosion has obliterated everything below her navel!Ultimately, the hopelessly random but CGI-enhanced carnage may divert action purists as much as it may prompt thoughtful audiences to grumble about its contrived third act. If you abhor movies that waste too much time setting up a premise, then you'll relish The Hunt. Zobel and company stall audiences until the 60-minute mark before they clear up the plot's mystery. Two flashbacks before the ultimate showdown between the two leading ladies signifying both the populist Right and Disgraced Liberal Left clarify everything. Had they presented these revelations in chronological order, the filmmakers would have spoiled their own grand finale. The initial critical response to The Hunt serves as a testament to the filmmakers' creativity. The white-knuckled suspense and the blood-splattered spectacle of The Hunt overshadow its complicated shenanigans. Basically, the message in The Hunt is don't believe anything you either read or hear on social media. The violence in the trailer for The Hunt plunged it into hot water when Universal Studios unveiled it. President Donald Trump condemned this cinematic sophistry on Twitter in the aftermath of the tragic shootings in both Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas. Trump's text argued: Liberal Hollywood is Racist at the highest level, and with great Anger and Hate! They like to call themselves Elite, but they are not Elite. In fact, it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the Elite. The movie coming out is made to inflame and cause chaos. They create their own violence and then try to blame others. They are the true Racists, and are very bad for our Country! Instead, since the President never saw The Hunt, he didn't know the film slammed the Liberals far more than the Right-wing populists. Similarly, other critics derided Zobel for glamourizing wholesale bloodshed. Mind you, neither the President nor the critics saw the movie before they leveled their criticism. Basically, Trump and the critics jumped the gun! Ironically, the movie's message about people who leap to conclusions about media content was played out in real life by its impetuous detractors. Consequently, Universal delayed The Hunt's release until the controversy waned. Unfortunately, the Coronavirus engulfed the nation just as the film opened on theater screens. When the theaters were shuttered, Universal released it on cable strictly as a rental until its recent availability on home video. Indeed, the violence is graphic but no more violent than any number of R-rated actioneers. Furthermore, the villains who orchestrated the murders in The Hunt turned out to be just as half-witted as both the Dayton and El Paso gunmen. You have to wait until the third act of The Hunt to understand its complicated plot.If you enjoyed subversive thrillers, such as The Purge franchise, you'll probably appreciate this outlandish opus that shows the shortcomings of both sides."}, {"id": 517, "text": "It's a surprisingly little thrill.

But I could tell it was a very fun movieInternetBy the end of the movie, it was open-ended for audience to think is Crystal a wrong target (maybe or maybe not), but it wasn't the point.This murder spree happened only because of one joke, and this joke told us that we're all facing a contradiction under a freedom of speech. Bringing back to the story, the Manorgate wasn't real at first. But after people made false assumptions and self-interpretations about the manor in the internet, it eventually turned out to be a real hunt."}, {"id": 525, "text": "The Hunt'The Hunt' gave me a dilemma when trying to figure out what score to give this rather entertaining and unique take on a tried and tested formula. Anyone who's seen 'Hard Target' or 'The Hunger games' will recognise this movies plot. It's been done many times before that is true but I don't think it's been done any better. 'The Hunt' stands tall due to some excellent script writing with excellent delivery from lead actress Betty Gilpin. She is wonderfully badass as Crystal, one of twelve strangers that awake in a field and then find themselves hunted for sport. What's so interesting and indeed unique about Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof's story is that the hero or heroine doesn't present themselves immediately. We the audience latch on to several characters only for them to meet their demise rather gruesomely within minutes of their establishment. This film starts off at a relentless pace and doesn't ever let up Director Craig Zobel gets a lot done within the films lean 1hr 30min runtime. Once Crystal is introduced the movie really picks up momentum and the audience are in for a comical, gruesome and action packed thrill ride. Action is staged expertly and Betty Gilpin could be the next female action heroine. She's brilliant and believable performing the fight scenes and her comedic timing is refreshing to behold. Despite having support from such seasoned pros as Hilary Swank and a brief appearance by Emma Roberts this is Gilpins movie. 'The Hunt' is a blood soaked satire sensation that delivers in all the key areas. It's funny, action packed and cringe inducing gruesomeness. A film that just manages to stay within the confines of entertaining. Towards the end you start to believe it may over step the mark and ruin all the groundwork it set down at the beginning. Thankfully an epic climatic fight between Gilpin and Swanks villainous character manages to keep this film on the good side of awesome.In terms of audio and visual quality 'The Hunt' doesn't look anything special in High Definition. There's no remarkable crispness to the image or eye popping colour. I don't believe it's a film worthy of a 4K HDR purchase. Save some cash and stick to the 1080p version. On the other hand, audio is sublime. This is one entertaining listen. I enjoyed this film with a Dolby Digital Plus mix. It's really punchy. Gunfire and explosions sound deep and impactful. Heads explode assertively with the splatter of blood stretching across the mid range. Shattering glass can cause you to wince as every blow of the climatic fight scene can be felt. Dialogue is always crisp and audible with surround sound effects put to subtle but good use.So why the dilemma in scoring this movie? At first 'The Hunt' was on course for a 9/10. Then I faltered. Despite thoroughly enjoying this movie it's probably not one I will rush to revisit any time soon. But when I eventually do I'm in for another treat."}, {"id": 526, "text": "Very fun movie.

At the beginning we see an attractive girl, you figure she is the hero- no she isn't, she gets killed etc etc. The hero protagonist is actually Crystal (Betty Gilpin) and she is absolutely wonderful in that role. Hilary Swank appears towards the end of the movie as Athena and doing a great job as well.Some people find the whole premise of the movie as funny. I personally prefer movies to be on the more serious side, with the occasional joke serving as an ice-breaker. The whole president vs the elite idea didn't really do it for me, but the movie was still enjoyable. I wish, however, that the ending was different. The character of Crystal is ex-military, smart and brutal, but I preferred she would be smart enough not to kill Don, the manipulation by Athena was obvious. I wouldn't mind him helping her in the last scene. Yes, he is white, kinda old, slow and not too smart but that doesn't mean he cannot help the protagonist (meaning he can still serve a positive part in society) the shot could easily be a fake to fool Athena (and the audience) but well... a missed opportunity.Overall this movie is better than average.

None of the characters are safe which helps to heighten the tension and stakes. 6. The last fight between Crystal and Athena (Hilary Swank) is well-choreographed, entrancing, and brutal.Cons: 1. The score is overbearing and overplayed. 2. The dialogue, in regards to political commentary, is often too clunky. 3. The CGI blood looks horrendous. 4.

Also, it gets completely unoriginal and then tries to win us over by throwing cliche plot twists that we saw coming, or dumb flashbacks that really weren't necessary with a rushed third act, the only reason why it lasts any longer than it already does is the fighting scene, which was pretty awesome and reminded me of a Kill Bill vs Black Mamba scene, it's really one of the ode films where Once you think you figure out the type of route it's going for, it goes the complete other way, it loses you, it's one of those films where you find a lot you like but there's just as much that you didn't like."}, {"id": 547, "text": "The movie was good and funny, best part was that I think the left wing actors thought it would shame the right wing and conservatives, but it actually showed how desperate and psychotic they are! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb"}, {"id": 548, "text": "Not that bad and not that good: The Hunt got some nice action scenes and even a few funny ones but for certain we already watched everything The Hunt provides in trillions of other horror movies.

Let me start by saying that I like when a movie tries to take a more realistic approach.Yeah there are a lot of good movies out there that are all action and explosions, with a chiseled protagonist that handles everything like a boss and looks good doing it, and some of those movies are pretty good. This movie doesn't follow this common cinematic formula, just for Ex when our protagonist In this film swings from a decorative ceiling fixture that doesn't hold her weight and she crashes on her back, breaking a couch high table. She then proceeds to literally GASP for air very authentically for someone who would likely have very well knocked the wind out of themselves.Our hero isn't a popular Hollywood A-list beauty, she doesn't act like any hero we've seen so much of in most movies. In fact she's kind of a weirdo, in a way that really connects with you and your friends chuckling on the couch at the humorous moments of the film. We can all be a bit goofy even if only sometimes, which to me makes her one of the most realistic protagonist I've ever seen.This film is action, good action, the kind you feel isn't being stunted. It's goofy at times but hardly unreasonably so, it has serious undertones (Which, if this film was controversial, this was probably why). These undertones, even if you don't believe in them can easily be made sense of. From beginning to end, this movie was entertaining, and while I'm sure I've missed a lot of gems as of late, this film is one of the best I've seen in many years.

Instead, I got... this.This movie, while desperately trying to appear intelligent and opinionated, is completely hollow and unfunny. The movie has a desperate need to preach but has nothing to say. It's like a spoiled child who just wants to be heard and to be noticed. It's not a thriller, it's not a comedy, this movie tries to define itself as it goes along and never manages to go further than being a mess.My initial disappointment turned into curiosity when it was revealed that the plot takes place in Croatia because that's where I'm from. The movie got pretty much everything wrong: the license plate, the sign this side up on boxes was translated as finish this, the military tags were bogus... all simple things that could've been done right if only they invested 2 minutes into a simple google research. Sadly, the same half-assed effort was put into developing an engaging story, dialogues and character development.The croatian military and other people do not speak anything comprehensible and it's awkward watching these actors trying to imitate sounds they've heard elsewhere. The way non-US countries get depicted in some movies is nothing new and it's always interesting to see how people without passports see the world outside USA.For me, the first third of the movie was spent crushing any hope for a good movie, second third I was hooked looking at mistakes they are making trying to portray Croatia and final third was reserved to satisfy my morbid curiosity of seeing where career of Hilary Swank has gone. She's first shown late in the movie but it doesn't feel like it's because of plot or exposure reasons, it felt like it was because she limited by contract how much time she has to appear in this mess to get paid.

The hunt got off to a great start but sadly for me turned into something it shouldn't of done and a absolute mess. Let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the concept was interesting, and I loved the dark humour. The whole concept of humans hunting humans despite being fairly dark, was highly creative and felt fairly fresh to watch which was nice, it wasn't generic which a lot of films fall into being, and the whole concept of it was executed fairly well. I also loved the films dark and dry humour. I really connected with the film's humour that it went for, the characters were just very sarcastic and dry towards each other which I loved, and they weren't afraid to push the boundaries with some jokes and for the most part they were funny and still worked.However, my first few negatives would be the lack of character background and development and killing off characters to quickly before any development. The film literally opened with no background to the plot, expecting you to know everything about the manor and the hunt just by what the characters were saying, it gave the plot a lack of depth, and was just poorly thought out, it could of easily been reconstructed so the audience is more aware of what is going on so can therefore sympathise with the characters and know what's going on. There was also no character development whatsoever, you just didn't really know anything about the characters, even the main character had nothing in terms of background or development to them. They also killed off far to many characters in the beginning before you could connect to any of them, you were introduced to a character who seemed likeable and a good character to connect with and the next minute they were killed off, I just found it very odd and frustrating to watch.My next couple of positives would be the gore, action sequences and the uncomfortable and tense tone. I thought the action sequences and gore involved were very effective in the first half and final act of the movie, this kept the film entertaining and kept you on edge, the added gore added to the impact as well, with fast paced action being the focus which I didn't mind, the gore almost had me looking away in parts but that's just how I like it in movies. The Hunt also managed to execute a very uncomfortable and tense tone throughout most of the movie, due to the dark concept of humans hunting themselves, you couldn't help but sympathise with the characters involved and how they were feeling, not knowing when any of them can be killed kept me consistently uncomfortable and on edge, so the Hunt executed it's required tone very well.My next couple of negatives would be the odd creative decisions and the messy and overly political script. I thought the creative decision to just have Betty Gilpin to be the main character and for their not to be any supporting characters around her was very odd and bad decision by the creative team, just having one main character with no back up was just odd and Crystal would of needed back up in the amount of situations she was put into, the fact that she had no development or background to her either also didn't help things. I also found in the second half of the movie, the script got consistently more messy and over the top with the situations the main character went through and with it's dialogue, one of my least favourite parts of the movie was also how overly political the script was, there was so many controversial and occasionally offensive topics bought up that it for me felt not well enough explored to justify it's existence, it was poorly thought out, insensitive and was not needed in the movie, fuelling conflict between different people who watch the film.My final positives would be the clever dialogue and parts of the script, as well as the likeable main performance from Betty Gilpin. I thought the script was occasionally clever in terms of the dialogue between characters and not knowing who was good and bad with the characters within the script was also fun. The best part of the movie however had to be Betty Gilpin, whether it was her accent, hilarious humour or kick ass attitude and action sequences, she was a great main character and it makes me excited to see Betty in more movie roles in the future.My final negatives would be the poor villains, bad plot twists and underwhelming ending. I thought the villains in the movie were absolutely poor, they were hardly used, they were made to be easily killed off and weak, and the reasoning behind the main villain doing the hunt was not clear and just not a justified reason making the film seem pointless, the plot twists to do with Crystal and all the characters having some form of bad past was poorly executed as well, the plot twist involving Crystal made the villain seen dumb, and just because some of the characters involved in the hunt did some bad things doesn't justify the villains actions so this was just poorly thought out. The ending was also very underwhelming, the fight scene between Betty and Hilary Swank was entertaining, but it then just ended very abruptly and it ended with Crystal just walking away it was just very bad and left me feeling more disappointed with the movie than impressed.Overall, despite a strong first half, great humour and fun performance from Betty Gilpin, The hunt is a poorly thought out, messy film that due to it's over the top political intentions turns into to much of a different movie to what made it good in the first place."}, {"id": 690, "text": "It is a good movie but the main actor is so boring personality"}, {"id": 691, "text": "Money can make any and every thing happen.

It points out how extreme some people can be with their ideologies. The commentary about the internet trolls and the conspiracy theories are on point. ~The stronger political comment of the film is about a specific group of liberals who are the supposed villains of the movie. There are many people (mainly wealthy) who constantly talk about the the poor and the minorities with such a passion but in reality they do nothing. They are the same people who are the most passionate supporters of the woke culture but at the same time they demonstrate their privileges whenever they have the chance. The flashback conversation is an indicative example of these behaviors (the comment about the black dude is perfect). Other examples of this pretentiousness is the dialogue between the old couple in the store or the scene where the elite hunters are all together. The dialogue in these scenes is on the nose and cheesy but that's the point of a satire. ~Betty Gilpin is awesome as the main protagonist. She is a badass , her comedic timing is on point and her facial expressions are perfect. ~Apart from the political messages, the movie works as a guilty pleasure and doesn't take itself very seriously. There is a lot of gore and brutality. The blowup of the characters of Roberts and Hartwell is creative and the disorientation about the protagonist is interesting. ~The film makes some bold decisions about the fate of some recognisable actors. The first act is so entertaining and you have no idea who is going to live or die. As a result Emma Roberts, Iken Barinholtz and Justin Hartley is among the most familiar names that have an unexpected end. ~The fight in the end is well choreographed and the wide shots make it more effective.CONS: ~There is obviously a hesitation from the filmmakers to cross the line in some parts. The film is too safe in its attempt not to offend anyone and makes general comments. The film should be edgier and sharper and not take the easy path. The film could have choosen the supposed liberal superiority or the conservative ignorance and sticked with one behavior until the end. It is strange why this film was postponed because there isn't actually a controversy. ~In the final act there is a revelation about the ideology of Gilpin's character. It's a wasted opportunity that the film never explores the reaction of Swank's character and her possible fault about the true beliefs of her opponent. ~It's questionable why the character of Hillary Swank isn't shown until the final act."}, {"id": 732, "text": "Movie tries to be politically relevant by gender swapping the Rambo-type stoic lead, making any and all men fat, stupid, bigot or a combination of the above.

The film details Crystal (Gilpin) as she finds herself one among many targeted by another group of people. It's all about survival, and she can trust nobody. It sounds interesting but also as something we've seen before, however, co-writer Damon Lindelof promised satire on the political conflicts between the left and the right in the United States. This basis could have elevated The Hunt from the crowded list of slasher thrillers to that of allegory-filled political action movies. Unfortunately the director and writing team fails with this, quite tremendously, and it isn't until the second half of the film that the political undertones emerges. Hillary Swank plays the calculating, enlightened liberal Athena who is the constructor of the entire hunt, and Swank and Gilpin are both excelling in their performances. The climatic fight between the two definitely sets the standard for girl fights in this decade sky high. Now, to the ideological motifs of the characters; it is obvious that those responsible for the hunting event are liberal, left-wing, and politically correct, but where the writers are heading with this is still some sort of enigma to me. At first glance, The Hunt wants to demonstrate how PC-cultural has the ability to be its own antithesis, with violence as results. But at the same time, could it be that easy? Lindelof is a genius writer if you ask me, and maybe the whole idea is to showcase what humans are capable of, and that violence can be committed by all people, no matter background, political beliefs, etcetera. If The Hunt was made to spark a discussion they made it, but the discussions will be based on a film that seemingly aimed for much more but ended up with too heavy focus on the slasher elements, rather than the satire and political insinuations."}, {"id": 760, "text": "Concept was unique but at the same time I felt like I've seen it all before.

The hunt foreshadowing \ud83d\udea8spoilers\ud83d\udea8 &gt;!The Hunt does a excellent job of foreshadowing. The movie uses terms like deplorables, and manorgate. This is because the 2016 presidential election Hillary Clinton's used the phrase Basket of deplorables to describe trump supporters. The entire idea behind the film is mirrored off the political spectrum in USA. The left side says the right side will believe anything the media releases. Left side being Democrats and the right side being Republicans. I agree with the idea however I feel as though any point that the hunt was trying to make as a view is over shadowed and obliterated by the amount of gore and violence it has throughout the entire movie. The movie makes a reference to animal farm by building this conspiracy involving manorgate (details to come) for those of you that have read animal farm are aware of Mr Jones of the Manor farm! Manorgate conspiracy theory involves a group of left wingers who had a conversation leaked involving a joke about rounding up deplorables and hunting them for sport. The jokesters involved lose they're jobs as the deplorables have taken this seriously and are scared for there safety.

That was a fresh experience.So in the gas station part I was still wondering if it's the first act and there could be a second game with serious characters, the serious character, Betty Gilpin, showed up. They killed off too many characters too soon, so from that point I knew it's gonna be Betty versus whoever hides behind, which is way less interesting.There were enough entertaining scenes though, such as the lady that fell into the trap twice, the poisoned soda, the one seconds truce between Gilpin and Swank.

And no, it has nothing to do with Red October, Lee Marvin, or an actress named Helen.Released at maybe the wrong month for these trying times (March of 2020) and featuring a pig character named Orwell (that's symbolism at its finest), Hunt is directed by one Craig Zobel. Zobel fashions The Hunt as part grindhouse, part camp, and something the late Charlton Heston would get a kick out of (NRA hint hint).Starring the likes of known actors Hillary Swank, Emma Roberts, and Ike Barinholtz (Emma and Ike basically make cameos), Hunt is splatter house tongue-in-cheek with a non-sequential narrative. It starts out as Surviving the Game meets 1981's Southern Comfort only to harbor more twists and turns than a street called Lombard.So yeah, I squirmed at Hunt's putrid violence which was remorseless (look for the best girl fight since Vivica A. Fox and Uma Thurman squared off in Kill Bill). And yes, The Hunt had enough political remnants to make me think it was actually making a broad statement. Still, the film is sort of ill-timed and I think the viewer might get a bad taste in their mouths after an on demand purchase.Clocking in at a running time of 90 minutes and distributed by Universal Pictures International (in 7 different countries), The Hunt has to do with 12 people who wake up in the middle of nowhere. With gags in their mouths, plenty of ammo, and not a darn clue, they are being hunted for sport in the country of Croatia (which initially masks as Arkansas).Bottom line: Hunt targets its audience as the cynical prey.

The direction which was made by Craig Zobel was good, with many action scenes and plenty of suspense. I have to admit that the interpretations of both Betty Gilpin who played as Crystal and Hilary Swank who played as Athena were below average and I expected more from them.

The story did lack depth as it hinged on the hunted going back to the very beginning to find the other hunters just sitting around waiting. Picking most of them off at the beginning of the hunt and arming them didn't make much sense to me. If it was just for target practice, why goto all the bother and if was a hunt, get out there and hunt them, don't just sit in your bunker.

The only criticism of the pacing I have is that they seem to burn through most of the hunting in the first sequence and then afterwards we're relegated to a cat and mouse largely featuring just the main character. Personally I'd have preferred it if they prey were whittled down more slowly, which might be reason for my main problem with it, which is... It's not got quite as much satirical bite as it thinks it has. The liberal team is largely satirised by having them utter the kind of things right wing pundits claim liberals say. There's a couple of lines that are pretty funny, but largely it's fairly uninspired. And whilst there's an attempt at doing the same thing to the conservative team, there's not really any of them left after the first half an hour for any of the characters to interact, and the only two that are aren't what people expect. So in that respect it seems a little biased towards making fun of the liberal camp. But again, it doesn't really go far enough into really ripping into any position, it just seems content with throwing out a few worn out tropes and hoping people find that satirical enough, when it really isn't. So in summary, it's a decent enough film, the action is well handled, the fight scenes nicely done.

Taking place in Manor House, the writers keep just on the right side of not leaning too hard into their links into Orwell's Animal Farm, until a final twist slickly uses it to twist a misconception of Crystal. The first movie he's made since 2015's Z for Zachariah,director Craig Zobel &amp; cinematographer Darran Tiernan place down snappy, gory traps that crackle with a darkly comedic mood,from Zobel zapping along to the aftermath of Deplorable's being caught in a trap.Whilst the writers miss the target, Zobel hits the satire by going over the top on the beer-swilling, cap-wearing Deplorable's fighting to survive against the pristine Liberal Elite on the hunt."}, {"id": 781, "text": "Much more enjoyable than expected.The beginning of it is funny enough, but it is the ensuing few scenes which are riotously HILARIOUS and make it worth watching- I literally laughed until I cried.Toward the middle of the film, there is a wide gap where the laugh-out-loud moments are slowed and further and further apart, but still bring a smile or giggle here and there.

It was really, really well done.The best part of the entire movie though, and what makes it stand out, is that if a person watching has more than two brain cells, the dialogue is spot-on close-to-perfect in mocking BOTH SIDES of the political divide. And here, is what I think people are missing: NEITHER side is depicted as being 'better' than the other. Or worse. It has fun at the expense of everyone and it doesn't do it in any overtly mean way, but in a way where we can nod and nod and nod and laugh ... at ourselves ... no matter who we are or where we stand.Lastly, a horror film - it is not. Somewhat gory, yes. A horror film? no.8.6/10"}, {"id": 782, "text": "Simply put, This movie is clearly made to allow rednecks to feel better about themselves by offering them an unrealistic fiction in which they give them a laughable version of a hero in what only can be described as a failed artistic attempt to substitute their lack of intellectual superiority over their long time nemesis...The educated and rich liberals. Not saying I'm with these or against those but I said it as it is! Also yes, there's (NO OTHER REASON) behind making this movie.Aside from the political dirt and speaking only from an artistic point of view, This film fails miserably to maintain its uniqueness after the first few minutes. The movie starts in a great manner with a lot of expectations, twelve strangers are kidnapped and then hunted by a group of rich people, simple plot, normal acting, fast paced, unpredictable, funny and fun. All in the first exciting 15 mins.Then all of a sudden nearly by the middle of the movie it slows down...gets redundant, annoying and very predictable by the over used dull yet unrealistic hero character type, the type that knows it all, never fails and will accomplish anything. Beside the fact that it was falsely classified as horror and it has nothing to do with this genre! The dramatic plot is ridiculously idiotic, the reason why behind the film is completely unbelievable and unrealistic, the fighting scenes were lame as they lack any logic or credibility due to the hero never fails concept. Not to mention, the extremely stupid and predictable ending which was spotted a mile ahead.Sadly this is a vivid example of a Great chance for a change and a feature that could've been unique which sadly turned into a wasted time and bad experience caused by all the wrong choices made by the filmmakers."}, {"id": 783, "text": "This movie was written to basically call everyone an idiot if they base their whole lives around politically based ideological garbage. It's saying that regardless of being far right or far left you're still basically the same breed of moron and that it's the people living in the middle, who are actually trudging away just living our lives, are the actual badasses. Well not me specifically, but the general we. The people who ignore the extremes of politics and just get things done. This movie portrays that in the least subtle way possible and I thought it was pretty hilarious.There is almost no plot to this movie, which I'm sure will turn people off, but that's honestly what I liked about it because as commentary it speaks to political discourse that we see every day. It's all crap on both sides. Just buzz words and stupid conspiracy theories with both sides trying to paint each other into a box with very specific ideologies. Then we have the protagonist, a woman we know nothing about, nothing is ever explained about her, and she just takes over everything. It's all a very hamfisted analogy for modern society but I thought it was hilarious.The plot is dumb, the characters are disposable, you never know what's going to happen next, everyone is insulted by the end, and Betty Gilpin does a hilarious job of just being bizarre. She also shows off some of her skills she's developed from starring on GLOW and her body is crazy tight in this. This is overall just a silly, ridiculous, popcorn flick with gratuitous violence...which is exactly what we need in an overly charged political era. It's a 6 because it's no masterpiece or anything, but it's plenty enjoyable."}, {"id": 784, "text": "Oh boy this is fun.The Hunt had preview screenings tonight, and I am SO glad I went to one. I have not been this entertained by a movie in a long time.Originally scheduled for release late last year, due to media spin about a movie most of the complainers hadn't seen, Blumhouse Productions delayed the release, while they waged a quiet counter-campaign.They were right, to do so. This movie IS NOT what the hue-and-cry suggested it is. To be sure, The Huntis about political leftists hunting political conservatives (aka: Deplorables) for sport, but this is satire; tightly scripted, brilliantly executed, and with every trace of polemics themselves lampooned for dark...very dark...laughs.The Hunt is above all funny. If you have the sense of humor for it. It is also grisly; filled with flying body parts and graphic violence worthy of the horror movies Blumhouse is rapidly becoming famous for. But all of that is in service to political satire from which no point on the spectrum escapes unsoiled.Best of all is the direction. Delightful twist follows carefully delivered surprise again and again. And just when I though I had the algorithm figured out, Director Craig Zobel gently pulls the rug, and I laugh at myself for thinking I could anticipate any of it.The Hunt is rated R, and it earns it. As I said, the violence is graphic and real. The language is as legitimate as angry people arguing for their lives, and their beliefs.I would not say that the movie gains any special benefit from being seen in a theater, but I have a feeling this film is going to be a HUGE hit, and if you wait for a home release, you may experience people spoiling it for you. At the very least, you will be an outsider, listening to people rave about The Hunt.I give it nine stars.Nine very shiny stars."}, {"id": 785, "text": "Good: Great idea on paper, yet never fully reaches its full potential and does not fully develop, lacking a full cohesive story. The acting is average all around with Betty Gilpin being the standout of a strong female lead. There is humor to be had, but not much with just a lot of quick quips here and there. The film starts off great, but then fizzles away with pacing issues...Bad: The writing is messy, and the middle drags. The story just does not add up to much and lacks depth and production.Overall: The movie tries to be political but never quite works out. The advertisements and political uproars are unnecessary. The film has a unique idea, but the low budget world does not come together.2.5/5"}, {"id": 786, "text": "The Hunt is a satirical action/ horror starring Oscar winner Hilary Swank and Betty Gilpin from Netflix's GLOW. When you think of Hilary Swank, you think of great performances like Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby. You can add this movie in her great career, because she is fierce, scary and probably give one of the funniest performances of her career in this movie.Betty Gilpin stole the show as Crystal, one of the 12 deplorables who definitely wasn't tolerating this madness when these hunters try to hunt her and the others because of their political beliefs. Gilpin performance was the funniest throughout the entire movie with her humming, quirks, laughs and facial expressions.The fight scene between Swank and Gilpin is intense reminiscent to Tarantino's Kill Bill and John Carpenter's They Live: Gritty and hilarious!This movie is considered to be controversial because you have the left hunting the right. The theme of the Hunt from what I observed is that both political sides in this country think they are superior by saying which one is the best, but in reality, both sides of spectrum are neither better. I also felt like that Gilpin character Crystal represent the middle between both sides because, she wants to live and enjoy her life despite the fact she have to kill these hunters.I really enjoyed this movie with the action, humor and political satire. This movie is like watching Hard Target mix with The Hunger Games. It's unfortunate that I had to watch this movie, but it's cool that I pay $20 to rent this movie!"}, {"id": 787, "text": "The makers of The Hunt most feel prophetic. The pre-release uproar over it could serve as a companion piece. Some of the conservatives who prejudged this one might have a hard time swallowing the message of this film as its theme mirrors such ignorance (truly a lack of knowledge; it isn't a jab) among conservatives and liberals alike. Which is a shame bc they probably would have enjoyed seeing the jabs themselves and liberals. The latter group gets the brunt of the caricatures and satire, but it's pretty evenhanded.As for the film itself, well, it's a mixed bag. The script and its star are the real highlights here. I won't mention the latter anymore bc part of the fun is not knowing who the protagonist is. The only major problem of the film is the directing. It almost feels like two different movies. The first half is clumsy and rarely hits any of the marks it is going for. Thankfully, the script and some of the actors can get us through this part. Then halfway through something magical happens. We get a scene that is just three actors sitting in chairs talking. And all of sudden the film seems to know what it is. A coherent tone and visual style shine through to the end. And to top it off we are treated to one of the best female on female fights since Kill Bill.All it all, it's good fun that takes swipes as where we are as a society. And it's much better than all the low scores from the conservative hit squad."}, {"id": 788, "text": "The Most Dangerous Game, Deadly Prey, Hard Target, The Condemned, Manhunt: hunting humans for sport has been done to death in the movies, but not since Turkey Shoot (AKA Escape 2000 or Blood Camp Thatcher) has it been so unashamedly gory and so much fun. In addition to providing the viewer with plenty of over-the-top violence, The Hunt delivers a healthy dose of scathing social satire, making it a hugely enjoyable way to spend 89 minutes (the perfect run-time for a film of this ilk).The film sees twelve strangers waking up in a wooded area with no idea how they got there. Making their way to a clearing, they discover a crate full of weapons, but no sooner have they armed themselves than they find themselves under fire from their abductors - a group of rich liberals who have selected their prey for their 'deplorable' conservative views. Unfortunately for the hunters, one of their unwilling targets, Crystal (Betty Gilpin), is a highly trained servicewoman who isn't too chuffed about her predicament.From the opening assault on the abductees, which is chock full of cartoonish gore, to the wonderfully executed, lengthy and very brutal final fight scene between Crystal and Athena (Hilary Swank), the leader of the liberals, The Hunt is pure fun. The playful script by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof delivers a few neat surprises regarding the nature of some of the characters (although we never do find out whether Don is 'in on it'), while director Craig Zobel displays a lot of flair for both action and comedy - I sure hope we'll be seeing more from him soon (fingers crossed that the Corona virus doesn't kill this film's chances at the box office).I know there hasn't been a lot of competition (Cats, Sonic, Fantasy Island, Brahms, Birds of Prey-hell, even The Invisible Man disappointed), but The Hunt is easily my favourite film of the year so far. 8/10."}, {"id": 789, "text": "I'm not sure a film has ever had to traverse a rockier road to get to audiences than The Hunt. Scheduled to hit the cinema in late-summer of 2019, it was pushed back due to its subject matter supposedly clashing with a number of political/social events at the time (almost a bit ironic considered the film's overall message). Then, after finally getting a March 2020 release date, a pandemic hits and shuts down all theaters, forcing the movie to be released digital-only. Throughout that winding road to viewers, The Hunt gained a negative reputation as subversive or dangerous in politically-charged ways, as well as featuring a satirical tone that is potentially off-putting to those either unwilling or unable to look beyond its surface level. While I would 100% agree that a film like The Hunt doesn't tackle political/social matters in a way movie viewers are used to, it does provide an interesting treatise on the current social landscape through the lens of political stereotypes and biases.For a very basic overview, The Hunt sees 12 strangers suddenly and inexplicably thrown together out in the middle of nowhere. The initial confusion quickly switches to terror, however, when they realize they are being hunted (presumably for sport) by others. Through a series of conversations and flashbacks, viewers learn that the hunters are your stereotypical liberal elites, while the hunted are the conservative, red state types. But are things really that simple?The thing I would stress most to anyone watching The Hunt is to always remember that it is satire at heart. There are groan-inducing wisecracks as people are blown to bits, and cringe-worthy lines of dialogue abound. But that doesn't make The Hunt a bad movie! I wonder if perhaps the satire genre is a bit of a lost art form in that people now expect movies about social/political themes to be life-or-death serious. I'm as big of a heavy drama fan as anyone, but that isn't the only way to tackle those subjects. Here, the model is to set up a basic Blumhouse Productions film strategy (i.e. slightly ridiculous but able to appeal to younger audiences). If made as a sweeping, serious epic, right away more than half the audience base would be cut out from under it.Of course, the above characterization is only this film's surface-level description. Embedded deep within the Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse-penned script is a surprisingly deft characterization of the current sociopolitical landscape. While at first The Hunt comically leans into stereotypes, it then deconstructs them and ultimately turns into a compelling treatise on how both sides of the aisle share the same common problems. One just has to look past the surface-level buffoonery to get there.Perhaps the biggest criticism levied against The Hunt has been that it simply panders to political stereotypes. In my viewing, that couldn't be further from the truth--again, as long as one realizes the tone is comic/satirical in nature. For all the world this film seems like an exercise in ridiculousness, but there's a reason the pig pictured prominently in the film's marketing is named Orwell.Overall, The Hunt is a brilliant social/political skewering camouflaged as a cheesy, over-the-top action/thriller. It isn't shallow, by any means, nor is it overly pompous. In these all or nothing political times, however, it may be odd or perplexing to some to see the issues chuckled at rather than the gnashing of teeth. If you can get past or embrace the satire, however, there are spot-on messages here that will/should make both conservatives and liberals stop and think a bit."}, {"id": 790, "text": "This film caught my eye last year when is stirred up controversy for being hyper-violent and full of dangerous social stances. At least, that's what the media outlets claimed. Controversy is usually something I am drawn to, so I vowed to see this when it came out.I went in, expecting something hyper-violent, with some controversial, thought-provoking commentary on the political state of the country, or the skewed idealism of being extreme anything, etc. I expected some sort of point, even if it was a bad one.Unfortunately, the film delivered only violence. If that's enough to entertain you, you'll enjoy the movie. If you expect any more that that, you'll walk away wondering how that could have been worth the ticket price.What bothered me is that there were no characters in the movie. Instead, we got caricatures of extreme liberals and extreme conservatives killing each other for an hour and a half with no actual reason or point for it. We follow Crystal, (our protagonist?), as a silent, untouchable super soldier, which is perhaps an attempt to mock the Mary-Sue trope? None of the characters ever represented real people. Every single person in this movie had as much nuance and depth as a political Reddit comment.The entire film feels like it was written and shot in about an hour. Would recommend renting if you want an hour and a half of violence.

I still held out hope that it would be released eventually and luckily they had the guts to do so. In fact their recent media spots have only exploited the controversy of the cancellation/delay and it may work in favor of Blumhouse. For all we know this was just a smart media ploy to bring attention to the climate we are living in.The film itself is an absolute intense wild ride full of action, brutality, and some undeniable Sociopolitical commentary that does a great job at showing just how radically extreme things can get with people's morals and beliefs on both sides of the spectrum . The violence is purely gratuitous and no holds barred. The planning is never what you expected to be an actually very well written. The conclusion is very smart and will have many people shocked and maybe even triggered but I think that's the whole point of a film like this.The cast is very well put together with some familiar faces They all do a decent job though many don't last as you will see.

The problem is that its observations are neither keen nor funny. Its ultimate point seems to be that everyone is as bad as each other. The characters are all, to one degree or another, bad people (or, at the very least, implied to be); the eventual lead is the only person who blurs the line between the two distinct categories of stereotype everyone else falls into. Divorced from its subtext, the affair is very much a generic, 'Battle Royale (2000)'-esque action flick. It's passively entertaining and moves at a decent pace, but it's never hugely engaging or, even, exciting. It does attempt to subvert genre expectations, though, by setting up a series of potential protagonists only to kill them off one by one in as surprising a way as possible. Sadly, the trailer ruins any potential shock these moments could have had and, even then, most of them don't have much value outside of their initial intent. Even though it isn't entirely successful, the action itself is sometimes rather enjoyable and a lot of it is fairly well conceived. The film does have a tonal problem, however, that even manages to seep its way into such sequences. Basically, a lot of the 'humour' disconcertingly seems to stem from the violence portrayed on screen. The other comedy, that which doesn't stem from the satire, is either far too broad or far too subtle, leading you to question whether any given moment is supposed to be treated seriously or not (and this never feels by design). The picture isn't bad, don't get me wrong. It's just incredibly uneven and ultimately unsatisfying. It's very much a cursory commentary on today's ever-polarising political climate and, as such, it's a bit of a missed opportunity. Plus, a lot of people seem to be missing its point - which shows that it isn't conveyed all that well - and taking offence to some of the stuff it says (or, perhaps, is interpreted to say). I guess that's what you get when you make a movie that simply sits on the fence and laughs at those on either side. In the end, the thing's not worth getting mad about; it doesn't agree or disagree with anyone. It almost feels like it was made purely to be superficially inflammatory. It isn't inflammatory, though. It's a run-of-the-mill action film with a satirical subtext. It's not great but, depending on what you want, it might be good enough. 5/10"}, {"id": 794, "text": "A Like-It or Hate-It movie.

I confess that I share the outlook it paints about today's Deplorables and Elites. I have already risked being banned by Facebook, unfriended by friends, family, and acquaintances alike, having profusely (and profanely without swearing) commented on its insipid divisiveness.I found this film's premise to be inspired, although I mean inspired by the contemporary dystopian, highly classed societies depicted in the Hunter Games and Divergent franchises, and movies such The Island, other influential mythologies from the past concern displayed through exaggeration can include Logan's Run and its age as class stratifier, Orwell's Animal Farm, and more parallel with the new (1995) Outer Limits' Season 4 (1998) Episode 2 called, perhaps coincidentally, The Hunt. The discrfiminating factor in this society to have their deplorables hunted by the elite is that they were androids who had become sentient, but since they were only machines they could be killed for sport. Even that resembles an older P. K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? which was of course immortalized for the deplorables amongst us who cannot or refuse to read, as Blade Runner, with young Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer as examples of the two sides of their statistical discriminating universe of right to live free or right to kill for having such a ridiculous desire.This movie is an indirect comment on this appalling situation, and given Hollywood's inherent stance within the movie's antagonist elite commuity, it is no wonder Universal delayed giving a voice to the deplorable protagonist population (some deplorables are math, philosophical, computer science, environmental, technology [... &amp;c.] visionaries having already made the elite's presumptious and unwarranted manifest hubris a great and natural and inherent source for its obvious and gratuitous , and makes an obvious source of ironic material for the screenwriters.Here one will find guns and violence as the exaggeration of something that should remain ideas and words. Stratifying and separating classes into the deplorable prey vs the hypocrite elites hunters exaggerate something that should be a mutual growth of shared ides.

There has actually been several politically motivated killings in America. The ADL reported in 2018 that at least 50 murders were committed by right-wing extremists, while 0 (= zero) where committed by left-wing extremists. Overall, the average has been that 75-80% of the extremist killings in US has been by right-wingers, 20-25% by muslims, and 0-1% by left-wingers.

Well now that it finally came out people are going to realize it goes after both political sides with razor sharp wit and intensity and the slaughtering doesn't discriminate. It's actually a very clever and accurate reflection of our Insane social/political climate these days full of extreme beliefs and opinions.The story itself may not be the most innovative as we've seen this human hunt concept sort of thing in other films before but it works well with its premise and mixture of satirical comedy. It's a fast paced film that really never lets up. The action and brutality comes in bunches and is actually way more than I thought form the trailer. You also get your twists and turns that keep you intrigued with the plot. As everything comes to a head we get a very visceral showdown with a fantastic ending that many will not see coming.The cast is all very expendable other than Betty Gilpin which is phenomenal in this and blew me away. Everyone else is fine in their specific roles and the dialogue is surprising and sharp as a tack.

Written by Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse The Hunt is a quite infamous movie. Perhaps you may have heard of it. It was originally supposed to be released in September but was delayed due to a pair of mass shootings and a huge misunderstanding about what the movie was actually about. Trust me this continues to this day. I saw a ton of people who had no idea what this movie was truly about and got a special kind of MAGA defensive about it. Let me let you in on a little secret.The movie is about a group of rich elite liberals kidnapping and hunting down typically conservative types. There is a bit more to it than that. This is the general basic outline of what transpires but it is not the entirety of the film. There are no real good guys. Betty Gilpin seems like a cypher. She doesn't lean to the degrees that the rest of the characters do. They are the worst of the worst when it comes to the kinds of extreme conservative you find online. You got your Alex Jones types, you got your Kent State gun girl types, you got your faux military types and you got your gun nuts. But don't let that deter you oh faithful Constitutionalists. They get at those pesky liberals too. They get those overly sensitive political correct junkies. They get those cause of the week types. It is like a New York Times comment section come to life.Once you realize that these people are cartoons, you realize that it's making fun of everybody who thinks in these extreme ideologies. But it's not just that. That is just window dressing to make us swallow another version of The Most Dangerous Game. The plot is nothing to write home about. Like I mentioned a mere sentence ago, this is just The Most Dangerous Game all over again.I will say on the positive side this is an incredibly well made movie. Craig Zobel is a very talented filmmaker. Compliance was chilling to the core. It made you question humanity and feel disgust. The worst part is it was based on a true story. The Hunt executes the bait and switch in the beginning very well. It makes you think this character is the lead when everyone is expendable. This is the sign of a good horror flick.Also that fight scene between Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank is top notch. The way it was choreographed was creative and fun. It will remind you of that kitchen fight in Kill Bill. It's not quite that good but it is certainly on par with that one. This is a lean, brisk flick. It moves with a purpose and there is no fat on this one. It is certainly worth a watch even though it is a bit of a mixed bag. The controversy though was entirely unwarranted but also not surprising. Outrage culture is certainly a thing. Check it out. I give this one a C."}, {"id": 808, "text": "Well acted, humorous, well directed, kept my attention.It's got some pretty deep themes- I have to watch this again after I read more, especially Orwell/Animal Farm.I love that the deplorable hero is a woman.

It does make fun of deplorables, but deplorables wear the stereotypes like badges of honor- I know I like being part of the no-nonsense, down to earth, peasant that lives by, Live and let live and Don't tread on me.Of course, there is much more in the movies than I am discussing. Also, questions raised that need answering from a sequel- but, I don't want to write any spoilers.If you are a proud deplorable, you should love this- as long as you own who you are. If you are a self acknowledged elite- white shaming, virtue signaling type, you will hate this movie, unless you can laugh at your ideologies (but, people like this are serious about what they feel, so I doubt they will like it).Too bad that theaters have been closed and thanks to Universal for doing the VOD!

It's as though the writers plopped themselves in front of the news for a day and made a check list. Their effort and brain-power ends there.This is the lazy simpleton mindset that America is becoming known for and proud of - so it's no shocker that American audiences are eating it up.

It was not the controversy that kept me excited for The Hunt as much as it was the fact that a bigger budgeted violently action-packed horror movie is coming. The good news is that they managed to deliver solid entertainment on not only that but also some other levels.The Hunt is a satire about.. a load of things, in short, about modern society as a whole. Political, social, racial, national and other issues, one the quest to be extremely relevant, which it is, when you take away all the excessive icing of this cake. But, as far as satire goes, it's high-riding and very entertaining. The writers try hard to bust everyone's balls and be unbiased in what's The Hunt trying to say &amp; goes over-the-top in all kinds of ways - inventive and absurdly fun, but also, in process, it kinda misses the mark. Naturally, there will likely be enough people to get offended by the spirit of The Hunt. The first half is the most entertaining, fast, with fun (sketches of) characters, gorified action, some comedy and a plot which's destination is intriguing. The second loses its momentum a bit, the same themes continue all through out and the pacing slows a down a tad. The Hunt features a cast of actors that put on an enjoyable show &amp; Betty Gilpin fills the role of the female badass hero nicely. As expected, The Hunt is well shot, good-looking and gorehounds like me will be satisfied, it delivers in the visual departments.The Hunt is a ride worth taking if any of the themes don't grind gear your gears, it's just that it doesn't have all that big of a value. My rating: 7/10."}, {"id": 812, "text": "I was expecting your typical B level 'people being hunted as a game' movie, of which we all have probably seen far too many times. This one manages to stay fresh, by staying different and unpredictable. Its not overly long, or overly complicated (it feels like more could have been done towards the middle to flesh it out a little), but it manages to inject some contemporary humour and a sense of fun that it never loses. It's a bit like Cabin in the Woods in feel, so if you like that movie you'll probably like this one as well.Those who have rated it down for political reasons have really missed the entire point. The movie's political side is more about how extremes on all political sides are harmful, which is hardly an inaccurate message, although of course unpalatable if you happen to be an extreme who expects all movies to conform to their personal beliefs.Plot wise there are lots of holes but it never breaks the suspension of disbelief.Good acting and pace, some actually funny black comedy scenes, and a kick ass main character make the whole thing some amusing fun that keeps you uncertain how its going to end right up till the last moment."}, {"id": 813, "text": "Why is the critical thought of The Hunt divided into two extremes, to the extent that it ignores - or simply does not see, or does not want to see - some of the universal messages that the film carries and successfully displays, compared to many other unsuccessful and ambiguous messages which are controversial or unclear? But are they? And also, why do some of critics superficially view this film as a incoplite political satire, a poor or loose representation of the ideas of films like The Most Dangerous Game, Ready or Not; or nothing more but the senseless bloodthirstiness of a man, disire to Hunt and kill; or the failed attempt to refer to Orwell's Animal Farm, etc?This movie setting ''liberals against conservatives'' was initially pulled from release after being attacked by the President. But the movie is smarter than its critics, writes Caryn James. So, watching this film one-sidedly is truly ungrateful, and many of the critiques I have read do not see or do not want to see the power of universal messages. Trump, who didn't specifically mention The Hunt by title, tweeted that the movie coming out is made in order ... to inflame and cause chaos.'' This could also be the reason for divided values, and it might be mostly politically motivated.In essence, frstly The Hunt has some great initial ideas, some of which are a bit misrepresented, secondly, some of which are somehow incomplete and unspoken, and thirdly, some of which are ambiguous to the point of complicating the analytical procedure and causing problems for the critical mind. Keeping all that in mind, these two ideas are clear - a call to constant critical thinking and questioning our reality, and even the truth of the information we are buried with in the modern world. That is, that we should never, and at no time, take for granted any of those informations out there. And the second: humanity's aspiration for power, totalitarian control of chosen or selected individuals, constant warfare and the destruction of others. Therefore, the idea of a fighter for survival - a primordial idea - in an endangered situation, is woven into the protagonist called Criystal (Snowball), but without a subjective tendency to think and ask questions about it. She is persecuted, but unquestioningly kills his persecutors. (The authors here leaves viewers in a quandary, who probably ask themselves the following: Why doesn't the hero seeks the reson of his persecution? Why doesn't she look for the answers? However, what the hero knows, seeks and represents, viewers can later find as a confirmation in Crystal's story about the rabbit.Namely, Crystal, as a protagonist, functions in the film as someone who does not belong to either side. She was mistakenly chosen to be the victim of persecution, and all because of one wrong letter in her last name. That mistake later leads the persecutors to their death, couse she is a skilled warrior that kills without questioning. The space in the film is neutral as well, the persecuted realizes latter that it is in Croatia. (the dislocation of time-space from the normal framework of the United States to Croatia, one of the Balkan countries affected by the war, states that not only is the reality called into question by this displacement of space, but also that everything is allowed in a war-torn area).Crystal, at one point, tells the story of a boastful rabbit who lost a race with a turtle because he accidentally fell asleep, only to later kill an entire family of turtles, and than sat down and ate their dinner. Don, at that point, asks Crystal: who is the rabbit then, is it Us, or Them? However, she gives him no answer, she looks at him quietly and than look's at the forest, couse something is coming out. (A that point, he asked a wrong question, couse he did not understood the point of the story. Nither did we, at that point) But, at the moment later, suprisingly, a dressed pig comes out of the forest. Dressed pig personifies humans, and it comes as the answer to Don's question: She is actually a pig who intends to destroy other pigs. The symbolic representation of the pig is ambiguous: abundance, power, relaxation, happiness... However, as the film refers to the Orwell's Animal Farm, that will lead us to a symbolic reduction to other meanings: the basis of the Communist Party, or pig--Napoleon as a representation of (Stalin), and on the other hand, Snowball (Crystal), as a rebellion pig. This means that she is neither, nor a rabbit nor a turtle, but a pig that intends to kill other pigs. The symbolic representation of the rabbit, in the universal sense, signifies rebirth, and it happens at the end of the film. Snowball (Crystal) becomes Rabbit at the end, her transformation into a rabbit symbolizes new life, freedom and procreation.Forest, acording to Jung: is a mystical, wild, frightening and numinous place, which in mythologies around the world is inhabited by archetypal figures of the unconscious, or mythological creatures such as gods, demons, giants, dwarves, nymphs, witches, fairies, gnomes, giants, various monsters and wild animals...The fear of the forest in analytical psychology is, in fact, the primordial fear of the frightening, dangerous and irrational forces that dwell in our unconscious. Universlay: forset represents the place of sin, lust, contempt, deception.To see a more complex, symbolic representation of this film and to know its universal messages - it is only possible if we simultaneously view the film as a form of artistic expression of ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings and messages that refer to some active topics in the film, such as: conspiracy theories, political situations, rasizam, missinformations, humans and its act of depresonalization into pigs, or descent at animal level etc.Artists, or movie makers, indeed have a complete freedom in organizig, exposing, or deconstructing our reality, then justifying and making senseless ideas at its own discretion. Even a no meaning is a meaning on it's own. That is a nihilistic tendency of Modernism, and later Postmodernism - incompleteness, confusion of readers or viewers, intertextuality or referity, meaninglessness of meaning, dekonstructions and depersonalization, devastations of other texts, books or scripts of other movies, ect.Zobel says that this movie isn't controversial, that wasnt the point, and it's more like satirical action-thriller, then it is a horror. It is not even an anti-Trump movie, but anti everybody movie. ''It is more like what we believe about one another. You say things in casual conversation or you use violent language talking about the other side. Let us show you what that looks like in practice.As Damon Lindelof says: The film they are talking about is not the film that we made. This film is not only about the elite hunting normal people for pleasure and sports, but at the same time, the film is about crazy conspiracy theories, it is about believing anything, it's about not understanding the other side, it's about the idea of the other side. I acknowlege that we live in divided times. But i also acknowlege that people don't like being devided. Ironicly, The Hunt was sort of designed to create a space where we could laugh at ourselvs, more ourselvs than one another.With all this in mind, the film is well designed in a technical sense: camera work, screenplay, acting, and it constantly keeps a smile on the face."}, {"id": 814, "text": "Not sure why, actually I do know why. It was canned and pushed under the rug. The problem is what this movie represents, is all true and I can prove it. Release a movie, doesn't pass Hollywood woke muster, gets canned and buried.

If it was, then the critics canned it and the movie theaters that pulled it are part of a massive marketing conspiracy, proof there is no independence among access establishment critics. If it wasn't then, it's because they are...access establishment critics that all think alike and this movie indirectly exposes that. Not just triggered but checkmated! Finally, watch the movie and you realize, it's all true. Woke corporate elites acting and behaving like insane fools over proper pronouns and identity politics, how far will they go? They look down on the rest and with broad stereotypes. That broad brush crossed over the middle ground of person that barely pays attention to it all; A not so average American, a bad ass one. With righteous vengeance brings justice and ultimately; A little bit of balance back into the world. Every American should watch this. It's a parody, but a parody works if it pulls directly out of what is observable in the woke corporate world today and specifically Hollywood and the power they yield. It's a simple concept, but there aren't many movies coming out of Hollywood inspired by real world immediately identifiable current events within our culture? In fact the complete opposite is occurring which is also parodied. Why? Because it just exposes the whole elite class and it's exactly how they think! You can just imagine Hollywood producers spending why too much of their time worried about proper representation and diversity and inclusion; The film be damned! Then this movie managed to be made, it's a shame and of such wasted opportunity there aren't more. No one likes these woke corporate people except their own woke corporate circles, actually not sure about that either.

I could imagine that you would have to be into just some of that to enjoy this, since that's about 85% of what you'll get. The rest is a cleverly written portrayal of a character (Betty Gilpin's) who is unbiased, straight-to-the-point and tired of excuses, both others' and her own - something very refreshing to see when it comes to politically based movies. As much as The Hunt uses extreme examples to showcase some of the ridiculousness on either political side in America, it boils it down to a character who can bring all of us down to earth and just have a pretty good time!As for why my rating may seem low considering I clearly enjoyed it a lot... Well, it's just that. It's very entertaining and has some of it cleverly written, and I'll probably watch it again with some friends, but it *is* sort of a popcorn movie. It's not a 10/10 blow-you-away or some extremely well-made, high quality production that will leave you with eye- and eargasms nor a deeply serious movie meant to provoke a lot of serious questions and make you think really hard politically speaking etc. That's what it seems a lot of people have misunderstood when it comes to it. The Hunt is a good time worth a bit of your money if you can't catch it somewhere on streaming in the future, and along with the entertainment, it may make you think wow okay, maybe we *should* just take a step back from the politics, and watch what we are doing right now. Bonus: The way they chose to film the main antagonist throughout the movie, without giving it away, is incredibly effective and serves very well in the end.

They're both fun movies with their own themes and issues, and if someone wants to be offended by that... well, it's a free country. Go ahead!The film follows a group of people who were captured by some rich elitists to be hunted down in a Hunger Games style deathmatch. Betty Gilpin plays the heroine and she fully commits to her character's reluctant hero type, restrained, rigid, and with the eyes of a trained survivalist who has been backed into a corner. The rest of the characters are basically stereotypes, but it works for the kind of satire the movie is trying to convey.In a society overrun with female heroes great at everything they do right off the bat without much learning, growth, training, or mentorship (ie. Captain Marvel, Rey Palpatine, Mulan), the approach The Hunt takes with its heroine is refreshingly down-to-earth. She's not the best and brightest. She starts off surrounded by seemingly stronger people and throughout the course of the story relies on her cunning to learn, develop, and survive. She reminds me of Samara Weaving from the decent Ready or Not and Kaya Scodelario from the even better Crawl. Gilpin comes off as someone content with who she is and the writers wisely don't turn her into a political flagpole for some feminist agenda. They just let her be, and what she be is badass!And, yes, it's apparent that the hunters are the violent liberals and the prey are the reactionary conservatives, but it's a cartoonish stereotype pushed to the extreme for entertainment value--and one that I would argue isn't entirely incorrect. But throughout the movie, both sides of the political line are thoroughly made fun of, so I don't think it can be said that this movie makes one side out to be the fool any more than the other.It's political satire at its most violent. And violent it is! There's plenty of boobytraps and explosions and gunfire that result in all kinds of human messiness. Arrows, knives, grenades... oh my!Ultimately, I don't think the movie is as clever as it thinks it is, but it's fun, gory, passable entertainment.

Even their consultant is lame. As for the foreign setting and the episode with the army - puzzlingly unnecessary, with a touch of Yankee paranoia. Yet the pace is good, and we enter a switcheroo about 2/3 of the way through.Humorous tone, but I didn't get many laughs out of it. In one scene, there's a great idea involving a stake-pit, but the direction and editing didn't drive the joke home. Later, during a set-piece fight, the tongue-in-cheek humour oversteps the bounds. But the biggest problem is that as a political satire it can't even identify its target. Ask anyone outside the US about the American Left, and they shrug their shoulders and say, What Left? It's right-wing all the way, with two brands arguing over the public relations strategy of capitalism. Maybe it's impossible for a mainstream movie to understand that the politics it seeks to satirise is a big, fat void and doesn't really exist.One reviewer made a good point, that this is like the embodiment of social media rage, where fallacies are preferred over genuine debate. That clicks with the Toasted Cheese speech, which then fails to make a point about the twisted nature of truth, and whimpers about before being gored with a wisecrack.Only thing to add is that the score is deliberate and insistent, so the audience isn't allowed much room for imagination.Overall: Well produced and energetic, but empty."}, {"id": 821, "text": "REVIEW - THE HUNTHonesty there aren't many films I don't understand either in some way or another but....This film starts very strongly and who you are led to believe are the main characters are actually......I personally loved this because so many times we see our hero of heroine straight from the off and all the way through doing what they must to survive and defeat but the start of this film was actually a very pleasant surprise but unfortunately it quickly went downhill from there very quickly.I said above that there aren't many films I just don't get and this is a prime example, a group of doo gooding liberals suddenly decided to create a hunt where they hunt people who don't believe in the same liberal policies that they do, hang on, liberals suddenly going around killing people, wouldn't they ask the victims permission first, apologise and then run to their psychologist for years upon years of councilling because they took away someone's liberty or hurt their feelings.Watching this silly nonsense story actually made me think of (dare I say it) people who don't supporters Trump, yes.Not a political satire but definitely I felt one group of people who don't follow Trump basically telling everyone else who does that you're not a liberal so you're not nice so should die.Sound familiar, Trump telling Clinton to go die during his initial campaign.Strange watch and just got boring after the shop scene where the film suddenly and unexpectedly took a nose dive.Rating 6 out of 10"}, {"id": 822, "text": "The left-wing movies often are wild cards that have a hard time getting the recognition and credit they deserve. Unlike so many other big chains, these movies dare to defy the normal with their approaches, taking radical chances to deliver an original film that manages to stick in your mind. Unfortunately, these artistic visions can often be too out there, ahead of their time or too boring that they get shuffled into the forgotten realm. However, reviewers like me are taking a dive into the ,movie to see if this film successfully defies the big chain tales that many love to hopefully do it justice. Let's get started I take a look at:Movie: The Hunt (2020)Director: Craig Zobel Writers: Nick Cuse, Damon Lindelof Stars: Betty Gilpin, Hilary Swank, Ike BarinholtzLikes:Run Time Original Campy Funny In Weird Ways Changing Tale Few Slow Parts The Ending Sequences The Awesome Artistic Satire Of The FilmDISLIKES:Broke a Cardinal Rule Language At Times The Opening Sequence Crappy Character Development Too Silly At Times The Sometimes Too Political Nature Of ItSummary:This tale already started off right with the promise of a shorter movie, not only for time saving components, but also for the potential of a good exciting tale. Well, The Hunt did this for me in the weirdest ways. First off, its ironically original, despite what the trailers suggest, deeper into the film though you get a much more original presentation that turns out to really fit in this crazy world they unleashed. Campy tropes and movie mannerisms come out in full effect, and much like the movies of the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s,, the cheesy approach really works. That corny nature not only works for the action and pacing, but the comedy that again works in weird ways. The Hunt is one of those movies that is overly aggressive for much of the film, but given the theme of the movie that quirky sense of humor starts to come out and wind up being funny when all is revealed. In addition, the brilliant change in the movie's presentation of the story opens up a sort of mystery as to what is the true bizarre source of the film. By putting out so many questions and keeping that air of mystery keeps you intrigued as to how deep the rabbit hole of hunting goes, leading to again a more engaging tale. An added bonus, the movie ends up having few slow parts to go with it too, with the pace, time span, and weird mystery leading to few drawn, out conversation heavy moments. When all of these moments start finally converging at the end, the climactic finish really feels climactic as the ending sequences unleash the torrent of action goodness you were looking for in this thriller. It pulls the pieces together, reveals much of the secrets, and just finishes in the manner you've come to both expect and not expect, just like this movie says it would and keeps that weird energy going all the way. When pulling all this together, the movie's artistic satire on political division, typical human responses to just about everything, and sort of the daydreaming fantasies of how some of this drama could be resolved.As I have said before though, these left field flicks are not afraid to cross the lines and sometimes it's a little too much for this reviewer. While not the worst breaking of one of my rules, the film did hit one of my no-nos that affected me a bit more than I care to admit. Fortunately, it was short lived, but still a slight rewrite could have fit with the scheme of the film and been a little better for me. However, past that, the movies focus on crude language and threats occasionally got into the lazy writing arena that again is more annoying than creative for me to see. Past these two though, the movie's flaws that really stood out started with the opening sequence. Upon the start, the movie throws some odd curveballs that made me start to hate it and walk out. A very rapid introduction, and some rather crappy character development left me feeling like I had been cheated by the trailers again, and was left with a shock culture film that did little more. Fortunately, the movie worked the story better, but the character development did not improve much past two characters... which stunk with the potential it had. I would have liked a little more sustenance behind the characters, but doing that would have shattered the illusion of comedy they were going for. This brings me to my next point, the silliness of the film. While clever, witty, original, and artistic, the over aggressive comedy of the film may have also been a slight downfall in terms of the story/character development. By taking this ridiculously campy focus, so much else was crammed to fit this scheme that I felt it got a little too forced at times. Yet I will have to admit I'll take the forced comedy over the forced politics that this movie does. While artistic and wholly satisfying to see at the end, the very dramatic, politically charged dialogue hit a nerve, primarily in how much I dislike social media ranting. The movie crossed the territory at times, and though pointed out how ridiculous things could be... the movie sometimes got a little too preaching of political agendas that were not fun.The VERDICT:The movie certainly surprised me in how fun it was as the first act opened up too much better components that were hidden by the trailers. It was campy and original, adding some nice surprise and to create an engaging and fast paced film with an ever-changing premise. Most things flowed naturally, and the underlying mystery of what pulled everything together and why kept me engaged in the film to get to that fitting end. An exciting climax and the brilliant poking at the ridiculousness of our extreme society tendencies further wraps this odd piece with a casing of fun ridiculousness that will be remembered. Yet, this is not going to be a hit for those too hooked on the limited violence and straight and narrow tale presentation. The Hunt has a lot of times stepping over the line and if you are sensitive to that stuff, you may be blinded from the smarter things this movie has. I implore you not to walk out of the opening sequence despite the chaotic, simplistic, nightmare it starts out as. Yet, be ready for some over silly moments, lackluster character development, and very in your face political components to raid your ears. If you can' handle these annoying trends that seem to continue to grow and infest entertainment, you need to stay away. However, if you can enjoy that wit and see the bigger pictures and components, you'll be in good shape to enjoy this film and can recommend hitting this one up in theaters.My scores are:Action/Horror/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0"}, {"id": 823, "text": "After being delayed due to the controversy it sparked off last year THE HUNT can finally see the light of day now, although it may not be the best timing after all.Let me start off by saying that the excessive satirical approach taken by Craig Zobel's film about people hunting people by reason of their political views is definitely interesting, its biggest positive being the intent to avoid one-sided political preaching. But it's also blatantly obvious that the movie is not as smart as it thinks it is.Just like everything that Damon Lindelof has ever written THE HUNT is heavy-handed and literally beats you over the head with its message. It constantly fires on all cylinders and some of it hits the mark, some doesn't. Despite being expectable, it's still unfortunate that the film is too superficial to have any subversive potential.With that being said, the movie definitely works as pure entertainment, not least because of its tight pacing. And it's most of all nice to see that something like this got made by Hollywood and actually snapped up a theatrical release - even though the film seems to be cursed by now with the current pandemic dooming it to financial failure."}, {"id": 824, "text": "It's hard not to think about the controversy of a movie when the media all over the world was covering the fact that this film was delayed, due to violence in the world. Going into this movie, I was worried about how similar it was going to feel to the real-world events of the last couple of years. Normally I can just brush off reality and enjoy a movie for what it is, but after watching this movie, even I found myself wondering why it was delayed. It's really just a more brutal version of a film like The Hunger Games. Regardless, this is a very violent film, but it's all meant to give audiences an enjoyable time. While it didn't always work for me, The Hunt is absolutely the definition of a violent film that's just trying to provide some adult fun.After a couple of needless scenes, this film opens with a group of twelve individuals, not knowing where they are or why they are there. Placed in a forest with nothing but weapons, they must flee for their lives, for reasons that will come to light later on. The first act of this movie is very enjoyable and my jaw was on the floor on a couple of occasions, but I found myself very uninterested in the events to follow after that. This is a very rushed movie that ultimately feels dull by the end. Once the third act of this film began, I just didn't seem to care anymore.Where this film shines is in its shock factor. While I don't commend movies for showcasing violence for the sake of violence and nothing else, the use of it here felt like it was a part of the world being presented. The first act of this movie, as I mentioned, is quite shocking and I was curious where the movie would go. Sadly, the first act of this film should've been how the majority of it all played out. The best part about this movie is over far too quickly. With that said, Betty Gilpin as Crystal (the main character of the film) was very likeable in this role. It was due to her committed performance that I bought into the events unfolding on-screen.This film suffers from a very weak third act, which was a shame. If this film started the way it should have and left everything ambiguous, it would've been so much cooler to see revelations later on. With that said, this movie chooses to just give you all the answers, before the climax even unfolds, so that's why I found myself not caring by the end. It was clear that director Craig Zobel was trying to make a fun, violent piece of cinema and the duo of Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof as the writers was promising as well, so why did this movie fall apart? It really didn't have to. It's really a mess when it comes to explaining what has really been going on.In the end, The Hunt is a fun movie at times and surprised me on multiple occasions, but those moments were too far and in between. I can recommend this movie to fans of this type of film, but it absolutely won't impress many others. I'm more positive about it than negative, but there were absolutely major details about the movie that I didn't like. Due to things going on in the world at the moment, The Hunt is now available to rent on all streaming services. If you're a fan of violent movies, you may get a kick out of this one, so take my very mild recommendation with a grain of salt."}, {"id": 825, "text": "Pushed back from its September 27 release date last year, without any real reason given by Universal Pictures and Blumhouse, 'The Hunt' finally finds an audience on VOD after a limited theatrical release - due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Promoting it as the most talked movie of the year that no one's actually seen is a bit of a stretch, as a lot of people actually have never seen an ad for it in the first place. Unfortunately, Craig Zobel's (Z For Zachariah) newest feature isn't worth all the fuss to begin with.What looks like as if it could've been an obvious sequel to continue 'The Purge'-franchise, turns out to be a bit more clever, tongue-in-cheek and almost satirical when it comes to its ambiguous political commentary, but is done in a kind of very cheap looking and plotwise messy way. Twelve strangers wake up in a clearing. They don't know where they are, or how they got there. They don't know they've been chosen - for a very specific purpose - The Hunt. Everyone's heard of it, but what was thought to be a myth, is actually something that's real. Normal people being hunted by the rich, but nothing is exactly what it seems, when the real reasoning behind it all rises to the surface with Southern femme fatale Crystal (GLOW's very own Betty Gilpin) headed towards the organiser's manor.Written by Nick Cuse (The Leftovers) and Damon Lindelof (HBO's 'Watchmen'), the film seems to have some sort of message but surprisingly never choses a side when it comes to political or social stands. It tries to please too many different POV's and thus kind of feels like a lost opportunity when just using gory kills for shock value. Why not go full out and really shock audiences? What the filmmakers really excel in, is their way of introducing and following certain characters in the first half hour to then just killing them off. Don't root too hard for your favourite actors, they probably won't even make it past the first 30 minutes. Wild is an understatement when victims get blown up because of their skin colour or just because they make a dumb decision. Or as caucasian gas station owners/couple Ma and Pop (played by Amy Madigan and Reed Birney) say, We really are the worst.Cinematically paralleled kitchen fight sequence between big chief Athena (Hilary Swank) and Crystal, looks like the extended opening of Kill Bill Vol. 1's fight between Uma Thurman and Vivica A. Fox, which is one of the highlights of the film. With only a 90 minute running time, the film flies by, but is as forgettable as last week's episode of 'Neighbours'. Great for streaming, but definitely not worth a visit to the cinema - perfect for an afternoon of self-isolation in these daring times and to escape to a world where people roam free, even if they're being hunted for expressing their racy opinions on social media."}, {"id": 826, "text": "'The Hunt' must feel like it is cursed. Right before the initial release date there was a mass-shooting in the USA and so they decided to delay the release. Not a decision I entirely agree with, but I at least understand it. Then a week after the new release date the coronavirus became so bad that all cinema chains had to close and the movie was forced to release online. What is lost behind all of that is the fact that this is an amazingly good horror film. It doesn't deserve the misfortune that has fallen upon it. What remains though is that what was going to be one of the best films of 2019 is now one of the best films of 2020.I'm a sucker for a horror movie with a strong female lead. Thinking back on it, the majority of my favourite films in that genre over the years have one. 'The Hunt' happens to have one of the better ones I've ever seen. Betty Gilpin, who I had barely heard of before this, is ridiculously good in this film. She is cool, funny, bad-ass and someone you definitely want on your side. I remember once seeing a list of the 100 greatest movie characters of all time and there only being 6 females on the list. I think if the list was done again today she would have to be given serious consideration.Within 3 minutes of this film getting underway you can tell just how good it is going to be. The dialogue is smart, witty, engaging and mysterious. The filmmakers are clearly in complete control. I genuinely believe that smart-horror is the way of the future. Films like 'Happy Death Day', 'Ready or Not' and 'The Hunt' all stand out above the pack because there is intelligence behind the plot. This movie takes the usual horror tropes and turns them on their head, deliberately going against the grain to keep the audience on their toes. Also, without spoiling anything, I'll just say that early in the film it uses a trick made famous in the opening scene of 'Scream' almost 25 years ago. It really caught me off-guard and was an early indicator to just how clever this film was capable of being.'The Hunt' isn't trying to set up a franchise or a sequel. It is just a stand-alone film that wants to be as good and entertaining as it can possibly be. That's incredibly refreshing in today's world. It's done so well that it very well may get a sequel one day, that wouldn't surprise me at all, but that doesn't change the fact that that was never its intention. This is one of the best horror films I have seen in recent times and I would call it an absolute must-watch. Don't sleep on this one."}, {"id": 827, "text": "A group of strangers wake up alone in the woods with gags over their mouths. Soon they all manage to find each other, along with a large crate in the centre of an open grass field. Inside the crate are knives, blades and guns- lots of guns. The group are now being brutally hunted down like animals. Why this is happening and who is behind this devilish act is all unknown to start with. The characters trying to survive this hunt are also given little to no back story at the start of the film.The opening to this film is fun and extremely crazy. As the group wake up to discover the situation the general setup is enjoyable. I was curious to see more and understand what was going on. But what's even more fun is how this film decides to play with the audience, particularly when you're trying to work out which character is really leading the film. The surprises are different to anything I've seen in cinema before and the change was rather welcomed.But most characters (possibly all!) give an over the top performance, talk way too much and are incredibly cheesy. It's obvious this film is aiming to bring in laughs as well as crazy violence. The violence is also over the top, bloody and at times used for comedic purposes. While I do see the humour in some aspects, I feel some movie goers will be shocked or perhaps put off by this type of film given the level of violence.The lead performance of this film was great, and I'm surprised as to how many times I found myself having a good chuckle due to their delivery of dialogue. This actor and the 1st act itself are easily some of the best elements in the film.Action sequences (particularly the last act) are also filmed well and I was able to see and follow everything as the film intended.Overall, I feel The Hunt will leave many audiences divided given the level of violence and social themes. Personally, I found enjoyment in this film. With a solid performance from the leading character and a rather surprising 1st act, The Hunt is simply a brainless, entertaining movie with twists and turns. 6.8/10 - Walkden Entertainment"}, {"id": 828, "text": "First off, this is not horror. It's some action/thriller/comedy deformity.The script is just so ridiculously lazy that it seems to have been drafted directly from the mind of a pubescent teenager with a superiority complex. The idea isn't fundamentally bad, but the plot is being made with cheap tricks and surface level observations. So black and white that the only provoking aspect is how unprovoking it is.The movie aims to take a humanitarian stance and is trying to say that 'were all the same'. It holds on to this belief by dumbing the characters down, rather than to face obstacles and tackle them in a clever way. I just wish they would've refined the intentions and standpoints of characters, instead of just letting them contradict their own believes without a known reason.Hot edgy chicks are hot and people are bad seems to be the premise.Overall it's one-dimensional and forgettable."}, {"id": 829, "text": "Why would they do something like that? Same reason elites do anything... 'cause they think they're better than us.Can someone please explain why there was so much fuss about the movie The Hunt. I understand that the release date has been postponed due to the El Paso, Dayton and Gilroy shootings last year. Let's just hope that not every violent film suffers the same fate, as the number of mass murders in the U.S., according to the database of the news agency AP, USA Today and Northeastern University, is shockingly high. In 2019, they counted 41 such massacres. Those are a huge number of incidents that can cause releases to be postponed. I suggest they restrict the release of violent video games, new material from well-known music bands that use a rougher music style and bloody comic strips. Because let's admit it. Every time such an incident happens in the U.S., doomsayers pop up like mushrooms to proclaim that heavy metal (in the past Marilyn Manson was a sitting target) and violent games (such as Counterstrike for example) are the cause of senseless violence with dozens of victims. No sensible person there relates free (and uncontrolled) sale of weapons with all that violence. Even now in this Corona crisis, US citizens are flocking to the arms stores to purchase firearms and ammunition en masse, because they fear that people may react rather strangely to this crisis. Well, here in Europe one can only make victims by throwing tons of toilet paper at someone since that's the most hoarded item here.In itself, The Hunt is just an average violent film with explicit, gory footage. But claiming this film is the superlative of other films in terms of violence, is certainly a bit simplistic and short-sighted. Let's look at films such as You're next or The Purge. These films have an almost similar concept. The concept of hunters and the hunted. Even The Hunger Games tends to go in that direction. But apparently, that was commercially permissible. The recent film Ready or not is better comparison material. Also, a film in which someone is being hunted like a wild animal and a series of gory, bloody scenes are shown. Though, the denouement in this movie effortlessly exceeds what is to be seen in The Hunt. On the other hand, the satirical character is more prominently present in The Hunt. And you still want to watch a movie where blood flows freely? Well, you should try Revenge (also a movie that ends with a fight to the death). In short, if you categorize all films that could possibly incite senseless violence, you'd end up with a richly filled list.What's explicitly emphasized in The Hunt, is the immense gap that exists between the wealthy and the average people living in the US. Of course, they turn it into a political statement once again (conservatives against liberals). A group of so-called conservatives is being kidnapped by a group of foully and berserkly rich liberals who have too much time on their hands or probably couldn't think of anything else to spend their hard-earned money on. I'm sure there are also rich conservatives and poor liberals living in the US. But that's a completely different discussion. The fact that there's a gap (as big as the Grand Canyon) between rich and poor becomes clear during these Corona times. The poorer inhabitants who cannot afford health insurance massively die a slow and horrible death at this very moment. I suppose many will now consider the fuss about The Hunt as being a trivial matter. Storywise it's really nothing and there's not much beating around the bush so the action-rich part kicks in quite quickly. It takes less than 10 minutes, I think, for the first victim to die with a well-aimed shot through the head. And from then on it's a series of massacres and exploding bodies. Not that the victims are unarmed because the hunters have left behind a huge chest packed with dangerous-looking weaponry. Unfortunately, the hunted ones are not exactly experts in warfare or close-combat techniques. However, the group of sadistic hunters haven't done their homework and checked the background of Crystal (Betty Gilpin). This female McClane has quite a bit of knowledge about combat techniques and weaponry. And that's something the group of rich people hasn't taken into account. Crystal plays the game harder and more fiercely than those vicious elitists and manages to turn the situation to her advantage.Betty Gilpin is perfectly cast for this role. She's fanatic and grim. A merciless tough lady whose sarcastic and blunt comments made me smile several times. To be honest, I sometimes wondered if she was mentally alright. And yes, she reminded me a bit of Phoebe Buffay. Not only because of the looks. But also by her behavior. A bit of an absent and childlike acting person. Unfortunately, the final confrontation was a bit exaggerated and unrealistic, which accented the slapstick character of the film even more. All in all, The Hunt isn't as impressive as I suspected it to be. It's watchable but not more than that. The commotion around this film only had the opposite effect (as usual). A new, short-term hype with an over-the-top reputation. But, as violent and gory as this movie may seem, it's certainly not as controversial as certain tweets from an alleged important person implied."}, {"id": 830, "text": "This movie does not give a damn what anyone thinks of it... and I love that. I had been looking forward to this one for some time and heard very good things from people I know, so my expectations were quite high.

But yeah, it's basically 'Hunger Games' on steroids.I'm not going to get political, but this movie sure does! Though, at the same time, I wouldn't say it necessarily takes sides. It puts the extremes of both the left and right on display. That being said, you'll probably enjoy it more if you inherently lean more to the right.I thought the ending was fantastic.

The story structure alone is worth the watch as it essentially runs 3 (-4) sequential stories to tell one overall story while telling you about the story structure. Some movies clearly put a lot of effort into keeping you on your toes, this movie just does it.Not only is the gunfighting immaculate, but the combat action sequences are amazing. Betty Gilpin steals the show every time she's on screen, and I would normally say she's the one that carries the movie, but the movie is good enough that even though she's over the top great, I can't say the movie needs her to carry it.There is an investigative aspect of the movie that is very intriguing, but that is given in the why are they doing this to us of it all, but unless the villains give an evil speech, then it should be expected.If you enjoy human vs human survival situations, then I think you will be pleasantly surprised by this one."}, {"id": 832, "text": "I came across this movie without any knowledge of it's apperant controversy before release. I just read the basic concept and it didn't sound original at all. But I gave it a chance and after a few minutes picked up a few shocks from the start. I didn't expect them and will reveal nothing here. Even before Betty Gilpin, one of the talented actors that gave me a feeling to give it a chance, you are dragged back and forth as to what to expect for a good quality level. It starts at a gripping pace for me which didn't let up. Some reviewers are not happy at the pace the film goes in the middle section. If it kept up to it's opening scenes the film would have been over after fifteen minutes. It had to present you with a well constructed plot line, which it does very well, or it would have collapsed. But even with the foot of the accelerator there are enough twists and uncertainty of to what was actually going on. It surprised me so many times I had a constant feeling of uneasiness which is very hard to do with the high levels of very dark humour. The film is obviously meant to not be taken too seriously but also maintains a gripping plot which the makers deserve a lot of credit for. Sometimes films like this blow it approaching and concluding it. This film doesn't.It does include stereotypical characters but they are essential for the storyline. It seems to have upset people with both left and right sides political views simultaneously which was obviously the intention of the makers. If they are really upset and can't see the silliness it pokes at both side as I say simultaneously then the intentions of the makers are spot on. If you are offended take a few steps back and think about the whole movie not just what offends you. If you still don't get it well there is no hope for you! Go and watch something bland or what makes your opinions feel right and people on the other side of the spectrum must be horrible. I can't think of movies on both sides that will do that for you which are of any good substance similar to this off the top of my head to help you sorry.Betty Gilpin is excellent in this and you feel a lot of determination, apparent indifference at times and dark humour in her character. The mystery character is obvious and not a surprise so I am not spoiling the plot but she is essential for the film to progress and conclude. Warning! The gore levels are incredibly high. But the dark humour did not make them nauseating and were essential for the feeling of the plot. They are very brutal though so if you can't stomach that kind of content probably best if you didn't watch. Or give it a few minutes and you may accept it with the humour which is done very well and actually made me laught a lot.It is a pity this didn't get a cinematic release. Whether that was because the awful times we are going through or the controversy attached to it I don't know but for me the quality is so high I think it may have done well. But even on television I found it very dark humouress, decent plot holding it together and some great acting quality so a 8/10 for me. It is one of those movies I WILL watch again in the future.Brilliant. 8/10."}, {"id": 833, "text": "The Hunt had an unfortunate and controversial release history. Advertising and its release were delayed after the mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso in early August 2019. Not until March 2020 did Universal decide to finally release it, and then the pandemic hit--resulting in theatres closing throughout the United States and the world. The trailer badmouthed by conservative media and, thus, the president of the United States, only for entertainment critics to largely pan the picture before it was finally released as a video-on-demand, it's hard to think of a movie that has been so mistreated as a political football and a victim of events outside of its control. Granted, I think I got the wrong impression, too, that this would be an earnest horror thriller underlined by confused political commentary, and so I wasn't eager to see it at first when it finally became available. What a pleasant surprise, then, especially as an American presidential election is already under way, that The Hunt isn't a serious satire at all, but more of trashy B-picture, campy exploitation--parodying to extremes the left/right, as well as rich/poor, divide in American politics.The entire reworking of The Most Dangerous Game scenario is self-evidently absurd that it's forehead-smacking ridiculous that anyone would've ever thought it would incite violence or that it's even a liberal fantasy, or a conservative one, or whatever. Wealthy, mostly white, elites turning away caviar because they had caviar last night, arguing with each other over who is the most politically correct, in between bragging about their acquaintance to Ava DuVernay (director of Selma (2014) and A Wrinkle in Time (2018)), is an unflattering caricature for something that's allegedly left-wing wish fulfillment. And that's as if the telltale indication of villainy of delaying showing Hilary Swank's face, as the rich hunters' leader, weren't obvious enough. As for the political right, at least for most of the picture the protagonist, played by Betty Gilpin, is fighting for survival on their side, and the so-called deplorables and rednecks depicted are more economically relatable if one doesn't fly by private jet. The hunt is largely one of class warfare, too. Sure, they're still cartoons; they all are on both caricatured sides here.To take The Hunt seriously is to fall into the same conspiracy-theory trap of the so-called Manor-gate--gate because every supposed political scandal in American must be framed by Watergate, apparently--within the movie: a bad joke taken too seriously and a sense of grievance and victimhood becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, each side dehumanizing the other until careers and lives are ruined. In reality, such self-righteous politicking is exasperating. The Hunt exploiting that for some laughs and well-staged action scenes, including a particularly entertaining performance from Gilpin, however, may have the opposite effect of deescalating political tensions, or rather the stress inflicted therefrom. It worked for me, at least."}, {"id": 834, "text": "Pros: Gore is fun, not gonna lie.Betty Gilpin is funny, charming, cool, and ridiculously attractive all at once, and is probably the main reason this movie is watchable.I'm a sucker for movies where lots of people die with little to no warning, I can't help it.Cons: This sort of premise has been done better in the past.Ideas/premise are good, but sometimes the execution is off.The satire/commentary can be so on the nose at times it's eye-rolling and groan-inducing.Overall: I needed something light to watch while drinking some wine, after a busy/less than ideal week, so this more or less did the job \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"}, {"id": 835, "text": "If there's one horror/thriller premise that already got turned into plenty of movies, it's the hunting humans for fun/sports idea. There are far too many titles to list, but some of my personal favorites include the 1932 original The Most Dangerous Game, but also Blood Camp Thatcher, Deadly Prey, The Woman Hunt and Surviving the Game. There's always room for anther favorite, though. In fact, there's even room for another twenty favorites, as long as they deliver suspense, gore, fresh &amp; inventive killings and insane characters. Craig Zobel's The Hunt is definitely a new favorite!This film's strongest assets are the eccentric but strong female lead, versus the overall worthlessness of the rest of the characters. By this I mean that literally everyone can die at any given moment - and many of them will - regardless of how significant or insignificant their roles have been up until then. I love that. The strong female lead speaks for itself. The woman is quite petrifying, unpredictable, not very eloquent, nihilistic, and deadlier than a whole army of vengeful liberal democrats with guns. She's also quite weird, since she shamelessly pees in front of people and narrates disturbing variants of classic children's stories.Admittedly, I found the political satire very exaggerated and far over the top. Many taboo subjects, like refugees and the free possession of firearms, are inevitably included and the views of both obnoxious democrats and imbecilic republicans are shoved down our throats, only to conclude that all extremist opinions are deplorable. Yeah, fine, please blow away some more people Mrs. Gilpin! The obvious thing to enjoy here is the extreme violence, the gore and Betty's stoic face."}, {"id": 836, "text": "I didn't know much about The Hunt going in to watch it, but I was hoping it would be something along the lines of The Hunger Games. I didn't get that, and it was ultimately a very disappointing film, but there was some enjoyment to be had throughout.Betty Gilpin was good in the lead, but she didn't exactly stand out. There wasn't a single performance that I considered to be very memorable, but no one was bad either. All of the actors were serviceable, and I suppose that was good enough for this type of film.My main issue with The Hunt was the screenplay. The narrative wasn't very compelling, the ending was anti-climactic, and some of the dialogue was painful. I also found that the pacing was all over the place. The film clocks in at less than 90 minutes, and I actually thought it could have done with a little more padding in certain areas.That being said, I was entertained. Some of the kills were brutal, and I have to admit that I enjoyed watching everything that was happening, even though the critical side of my brain didn't like it.The cinematography was bland for the most part, and the editing was nothing to shout about either. From a filmmaking point-of-view, everything that goes into making a picture was either mediocre or bad, but I can't get my score too low because I had a good time watching it and I wouldn't hate seeing it again.It's unfortunate that the film spent more time being political and preachy instead of making a compelling narrative, but there was at least some fun to be had. I don't recommend The Hunt, but I can see why some people might like it.SCORE: 48%"}, {"id": 837, "text": "First, this is not a horror movie! For the life of me I can't figure out why this was classified as such. Honestly, if you can watch The Walking Dead on cable, you'll be fine with this! I've seen a lot more suspense and horror on TV shows. I have a feeling the mis-classification had effect on the overall score of the movie.So this movie attempts to capture the vibe of The Purge and Hunger Games series, riding that wave to a box-office hit. Sadly it wasn't nearly as original, coping many idea's directly from those movies. However this movie was decently entertaining. While not a terrible movie, it was predictable and by the end of the first 20 min you could easily see the direction the story was going. (and predict how it would end)The acting overall wasn't awful but the script it's self is lacking. The heroine seems to know too much and be able to survive everything thrown at her which makes the movie further unrealistic.The special effects were overall enjoyably decent (for this genre) with lots of explosions and body parts flying. The special features help illustrate the efforts of the production staff in selling the story, but overall don't make up for the poorly written script.This was entertaining but I am glad it was only a rental movie and I didn't pay real 'movie theater' prices to see it. The political overtones (which were announced 7 or 8 months before I saw the movie) are probably the biggest reason anyone would watch the film and that 'drama' is really the reason the movie will have any future."}, {"id": 838, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)In case you don't know, I'm from Portugal. Why does this matter? Well, The Hunt was delayed after a massive shooting in the USA, and since the movies' themes are extremely sensitive, the producers decided to postpone the film. At the time, I felt frustrated that, once again, movies have to suffer from real-life situations. Going to the theater is supposed to be an out of this world experience. The audience is transported into a fictional place where real-world problems can be forgotten for a couple of hours. So, I never handled these constant controversies surrounding films very well...With that said, I believe The Hunt not only benefited from that delay, but its satirical story has even more impact now. There's no way around this. Craig Zobel's movie is meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years. I know it's a pretty basic analogy, but it's just like a dark humor standup show. If you don't have any issues with jokes about topics like racism, stereotypes, immigration, refugees, religion, politics, and every sensitive theme that your mind can imagine, then you'll find The Hunt a brilliant allegory of society's most extreme people. If you do have problems with this type of comedy, then stay away from this movie because Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out!When I write that every remotely sensitive taboo subject or activity is unrestrainedly addressed, I mean EVERY SINGLE theme. This is a narrative completely packed with extreme, over-the-top cliches and stereotypes of both right and left political sides. At first glance, The Hunters feel like the bad guys, in the sense that they're hunting innocent people for pure pleasure. Once the audience understands the reasons behind the selection of the people being hunted, one small but tremendously effective thought enters everyone's mind: you know what... the world would actually be a better place without this kind of people.Suddenly, not a single character is worth caring about. To clarify, I don't mean caring about in the common, emotional way. No character is written with the purpose of making the audience worry about it. In fact, almost every character (maybe except Betty Gilpin's) is a despicable human being. Their view of the world is clouded by ideologically outdated mentalities. I love how the screenwriters use each character to represent a particular type of ... extreme personality, let's call it that. One of the best compliments I can give the film is that it didn't pick a side. Everyone gets blasted with jokes.It's a dark yet hilarious satire of today's society with a special focus on the close-minded people that go online to try and spread their conspiracy theories and immoral beliefs. Everything that I just wrote so far resembles the movie's impact on the viewer: either you're okay with this type of screenplay and you'll be incredibly entertained; or you'll get extremely triggered by all this. It's one of those films that will end up on a bunch of Worst Movies of 2020 lists simply due to its narrative's nature.However, the story isn't the only aspect that can make people give up on watching this movie. The actual hunt is as over-the-top as everything else. There's blood everywhere, ridiculously disgusting deaths, and absolutely no limits whatsoever in killing people in the most insanely entertaining way possible. Action-wise, The Hunt is better filmed than a lot of blockbusters. Beautiful wide shots when something (or someone) explodes, exceptional (and hilariously long) choreography for the final fight, and excellent editing overall. It's genuinely a well-made, well-produced, and well-filmed movie. The score is also pretty cool.Obviously, it's one of those films that's easy to pinpoint flaws. Every single paragraph that I wrote above can be interpreted as some of the worst aspects of the entire movie, depending on each person's perspective. In my opinion, I think the ending would have benefited from a more serious tone, but at the same time, it would probably clash with the widespread satirical one, so it's an inevitably difficult ending to completely get right. The cast is a bit hit-and-miss when it comes to each actor's performance (some are very bland), but Betty Gilpin delivers an outstanding display and seamlessly carries the whole film. Finally, there's a small part of the movie that involves military characters who don't belong to either side of The Hunt, and that portion didn't really work for me.All in all, The Hunt is a brilliantly dark satire on today's political views of the world. It's meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years, and it undoubtedly succeeds in its mission. Just like dark humor, either you're okay with it, or you're not. If you can't take a joke about the most extremely sensitive taboo themes (and I mean ALL of them), then stay away from this movie or you'll be triggered for a whole week. However, if you can see the fun side of this type of comedy, The Hunt is the most entertaining, witty, hilarious, bloody, over-the-top action thriller you'll see for a long time. Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out, and they don't forget to approach a single topic. It's a well-made film all-around: well-written, well-produced, and well-filmed. A few minor issues regarding its ending and a small subplot don't diminish Craig Zobel's exceptionally captivating concept and Betty Gilpin's compelling performance. I definitely recommend it depending on how much you enjoy dark humor.PS: everyone knows the tale about the rabbit and the turtle, right? How the rabbit races the turtle, and all that? Well, The Hunt's version of that story just became my all-time favorite.Rating: A-"}, {"id": 839, "text": "Ok where to start with this the dialogue sounds like something from both a right wing YouTube video making fun of liberals and the opposite not movie quality at all it's terrible and not even in an ironically funny way or anything especially in that gas station but good Lord and the train bit Jesus it's awfully cringey and bad and not in an the office way, also why is everyone some alt right conspiracy guy with a podcast? And why do all the bad guys immediately expose themselves as bad guys when trying to blend in. But ignoring that badly written stuff there is a movie in here somewhere a poorly directed and paced movie with really random stuff happening that kills characters a bit too fast for my taste but still has kills and decently made action so I'll give it 4 for that because I suppose it's guilty pleasure generic horror stuff. The reason I'm giving it the exact score id give any b rate sci fi movie like sharktopus for example when this movies production is very much superior in every single way is because the comedy is just not funny apart from the odd line by the main character and it feels like they wrote it to be funny and put a lot of effort thinking about it unlike sharktopus which is just funny and effective with barely any effort it's not good by any means. This review has gone off the rails a bit sorry about that I was trying to be informative but whatever I'll summarize. This movie is not funny, not good has a few fun scenes but what makes a horror comedy movie and especially a thriller is the writing which is so poor I couldn't even laugh at how bad it was it's that next level bad.

Dozen random people getting murdered in the middle of nowhere by some rich family... I was wrong for the most part.In fact, the characters (Emma Roberts &amp; others) who I expected to play main roles throughout the film were actually killed off pretty early. It also felt like the hunters thought they were doing right by killing the innocent. Maybe even to say that they had very far left political opinions that needed to get rid of the people that didn't agree with them through a twisted game of violence.Overall pretty solid movie! Deaths from start to finish with small twists throughout. Not so much a horror but I'd definitely recommend it if you are looking for a thriller / action movie.P.S.

Never mind that Hollywood elites are the worst personal offenders of the socioeconomic and environmental causes they constantly lecture us on. They're also woke, so it's cool.So I watched The Hunt out of curiosity. Exactly what about this movie is so much more offensive than so many of the other movies born out of the Hollywood Hypocrisy genre we've seen of late?Twenty minutes in, however, I realized this wasn't your typical movie to come out of Hollywood in which the filmmakers' personal political views are on full display in sledgehammer-to-the-face obviousness.Halfway through, I couldn't even tell which side the movie was on.For starters, it seemed chock-full of caricatures from both sides. Specifically, what both sides like to believe everyone on the other side is. Lots of stupid, bible-thumping gun enthusiasts with beer bellies and racist attitudes; and just as many pretentious, judgmental hypocrites who are obsessed with their own self-righteousness to the point of violating the very principles they claim to champion a thousand times over.It wasn't until the last fifteen minutes that I finally got which side this movie is on - and exactly why some who have actually seen it find it so offensive.The answer - to both the question of what side the movie is on, and to why this movie is so 'offensive' - is that IT'S NOT ON ANY SIDE, OTHER THAN BOTH SIDES HAVE BECOME JUST PLAIN NUTS!!!!I mean, at least 'offensive' movies like Fahrenheit 9/11 had the courtesy to allow both sides to feel vindicated. If you're on Michael Moore's side, you can simply believe every word, and revel in your own sense of self-righteousness. If you're on George W. Bush's side, you can view it as a hack job typical of the other side, and revel in your own sense of moral superiority.The Hunt, on the other hand, has the audacity not to take a spoon-fed approach to who is right and who is wrong, and tell it in a way neither side wants to hear - you're all a bunch of nut jobs who need to get a life, and you're only going to get worse if things keep going the way they are going.First time I've ever given a movie a 10 out of 10."}, {"id": 842, "text": "Forever set to be the film that infamously canned it's initial theatrical release after it was surrounded in controversy due to it's darkly satirical examination of America's gun violence and political climate, The Hunt as a film is far less memorable, even if it at times subverts expectations in some neatly designed ways.Director Craig Zobel, whose shown form before with the indie hit Compliance and the the overlooked Z for Zachariah, must have somewhere somehow run across a particularly vicious black cat as after month's of his film sitting in limbo it found itself released in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, meaning many were never even properly aware his Damon Lindelof written and produced feature was even available for their viewing needs.Regardless of what stopped the film from jumping into the mainstream conversation bar it's headline making postponement, The Hunt never does enough with it's loaded idea to ensure that it was going to become a film people started talking about around the water cooler.Things start out in a promising fashion, as we are thrown head first into a ridiculously violent and frantic plot-line that sees a collection of 12 strangers awaking in a forest and on the run from a group of gun wielding hunters, this group includes recognizable faces such as Emma Robert's, Ethan Suplee and Ike Barinholtz, but once the focus turns to Betty Giplin's feisty Crystal, The Hunt gets bogged down in a more generic procession of events that don't grip you like they should.What first feels like some type of politically charged Hunger Games done the way of Crank mixed with Happy Death Day like horror comedy, quickly begins to feel like a collection of big ideas that Zobel doesn't have the time to explore across 90 minutes, with only so much over the top violence and snarky social commentary able to cover that up.The cast certainly have a fun time, with many of the core players getting roles and situations you wouldn't normally associate them with, with Hilary Swank a standout as the mysterious Athena, but The Hunt'sunwieldy tone and inconsistent execution undoes much of the effort of the actors, who begin to get lost in the midst of a film that never gets to make the most of it's big ideas and imagination.Final Say -Not living up the hype that surrounded it thanks to ample media controversies, The Hunt has some nice early moments and some unexpected turn of events but it never comes to terms with exactly what it is as it runs out of steam well before the final showdown.2 on the loose pigs out of 5"}, {"id": 843, "text": "Beside mindless fun, there is one thing I simply could not get over...This film is an oxymoron par excellence...

Given that every single one of them was a stereotype, a cardboard cutout that served only to be killed in a gory manner, or gave cheap funny 1 liners you didn't care at all when they died. This goes for both the conservative and liberal characters. Plus, you hardly saw most characters as most were only in 1-2 scenes before being offed in a gory manner. The problem with this film is that there was nobody to relate to, as the girl in yoga pants we are following gets her head blown off, then the nice guy who was next to her and the film follows for a few minutes helps someone before being blown up, then another guy's character gets shot in a trap, and finally there's the main character / survivor who is unlikable and nasty to everybody whom she encounters, and none of the character motivations for the evil characters or good characters made sense.Now, I can excuse a dumb film with thin characters and a weak plot if it is at least fun, but it wasn't even a fun film. Sure, it moved fast but you had zero connection to anybody and it was pretty much just a gore fest. It is nothing but a thinly veiled hack and slash. It barely even had coherent dialogue.It's pretty nihilistic and had no point to it, mainly senseless violence, and only in that sense was it offensive.

And a very exhausting and tragic thing.Logic aside- hatred prevents love. And loving each other is supposed to be what it's all about.Call me preachy but this just reminded me how much hate is in the world and how little genuine compassion and love is left in it.As a commentary on politics I realize it's supposed to be poking fun at all sides and giving an outlet for the animosity both ideologies feel for each other- but that doesn't make the animosity right.Here's an idea everyone- instead of killing each other how about we forgive and actually make an effort to get to know that person we hate so much?Why not actually try to be the neighbors and friends we're supposed to be for one another?And not argue, quarrel, and try to kill each other.Instead keep the focus on helping one another, producing, and genuinely loving each other.That's the world I want to live in.

I am from the U.K so I don't understand the relevance of Arkansas or what NPR is but I get a general gist of what is going on by all the clips of red-caps fighting with people dressed like ninjas on YouTube.This film isn't that political in that it makes fun of anyone and everyone who has an extreme view: meaning there is a little bit of something for everybody.The action is great and gory and funny and gritty and slapstick - this really should be a mess of a film but it feels very tight.Betty Gilpin is absolutely amazing here. Her part is very well written and she plays it with a real determination. Amongst the violent mayhem I found myself hanging off her every word.

I loved it."}, {"id": 847, "text": "This was a film that I remember when I first heard about it and then was pretty shocked that it got pulled. There was some buzz about it and I had an idea of where they were going to take it. To be honest, it seemed like a marketing ploy though to have it pulled and then to reissue it later. It didn't work out as well since COVID happened and it really only had two weeks in the theater. The buzz then was it had a price tag to rent of $20. I missed it in theaters unfortunately. I couldn't justify the high price and waited for it drop to normal prices so Jaime and I could finally see it. The synopsis is twelve strangers wake up in a clearing. They don't know where they are, or how they got there. They don't know they've been chose - for a very specific purpose - The Hunt.We start this movie off with looking over someone's shoulder as they're part of a text message thread. What is interesting is that I knew a bit about this movie and how it was twisting something I've seen recently on social media. What is important here is that the phone belongs to Athena. She's irate about something and states that she can't wait to go hunt at the manor. The others state they shouldn't be talking about it over text.It then shifts over to an airplane where Richard (Glenn Howerton) is giving the stewardess a hard time. We see he has particular tastes and they aren't necessarily getting met. It all takes a turn though when a guy barges in and we can tell he's been drugged. There is a doctor on board, portrayed by Steve Coulter, and they try to get him to calm down. It ends with who we assume is Athena, stabbing him in the eye with her high heel shoe.We then get into really what is happening here. Yoga Pants (Emma Roberts) wakes up in the woods. She looks across from her over a creek is Crystal (Betty Gilpin). Yoga Pants goes off and comes to a large field where there is Staten Island (Ike Barinholtz) and Don (Wayne Duvall) amongst others. There is a giant crate that is opened to reveal a bunch of weapons. Also inside is a pig wearing clothes, which escapes into the woods.This is where it gets wild. People start to shoot at the ones I've named in the clearing and it is a blood bath. We follow Staten Island, Big Red (Kate Nowlin) and Vanilla Nice (Sturgill Simpson) as they make it to a small gas station. Things aren't as it seems though with the owners, Ma (Amy Madigan) and Pop (Reed Birney).There is a much deeper plot going on here and Crystal really just wants to get home. We really get to meet her for the first time when she arrives at this same gas station. Later we learn that she has military training and she is quite observant. It becomes a fight for survival from these elites that are hunting them, but as I said, not everything is as it seems.To shift this over to my thoughts on the film, that is where I wanted to leave the recap. It really has an interesting way to present the story. I've been hearing for months of how great Gilpin was in this movie as Crystal, so I knew from the beginning that she was going to be our lead. What is interesting is that I watched this with Jaime and she had no idea. When certain characters we were following died, I had to let on for the movie to settle in as we really hadn't met the star yet. That is kind of an interesting way to kick this off for sure.What I do like about this movie is that I feel the satirical nature of it is intriguing. My initial thought was that they were going to have rich right-wing people hunting liberals. I picked up on from the opening text message thread that isn't the case, they actually flip it on its head. The movie is playing with the idea of these '-gate' conspiracies. They refer to #ManorGate. People online are running with it and this is the crux of this story. What is even more interesting with this is how things play out in the end and the idea of self-fulfilling prophecies. This movie is mocking 'social justice warriors', 'cancel culture', 'toxic fandom' and how things on the internet can get out of hand very quickly. It is funny though that the villains in this movie are those that think they're helping the country and the 'crazy' people are actually the sane ones.Taking this even farther, it is wild that I just re-read the novel Animal Farm. While Jaime and I were watching this I realized that Athena, who is Hilary Swank, states that someone can be their Snowball. That was when the references I heard earlier clicked. The pig's name is Orwell after the author. Some of the nicknames given to people are from the novel and of course, Snowball. What is funny is that reference is used wrong which makes it a bit ironic. We also get a different telling of the classic children's story of the Tortoise and the Hare as well.I want to take this next to the acting. I heard a lot of people bragging up Gilpin and I have to agree. Her character is from Mississippi, which I think actually works well. There's a couple reveals about her character, one of which I've referenced before that she has military training. Swank is interesting as someone I would despise. Her performance is good though and it is a shame that she doesn't act much anymore. I'd say aside from that, we have some really good side characters that serve their purpose around these two stars of Barinholtz, Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Roberts, Madigan and Howerton. It is even more interesting that we don't really see our stars for some time and it is a technique that wouldn't always work, but does here.Next I'll shift this over to the effects of the movie, which for the most part are good. This movie is more brutal than I was expecting which was pleasant. There is some CGI that doesn't necessarily work for me. This is most with blood splatter so it doesn't ruin anything. The movie has practical effects in conjunction with this so that makes me happy there. Aside from that, I'd say the cinematography is also good in my opinion.Now with that said, I'm glad that I finally got around to seeing this movie. This was the last major in theater film that I didn't get a chance to see before this quarantine came down. It was bothering me as I know a lot of people were speaking pretty highly about it. I think that this movie does some really good stuff with social commentary and playing with it in a way that I can respect. Some of it is over the top, but I can forgive that being a satire. The acting from the two leads was strong with the rest in support of them. The effects are good for the most part as was the cinematography. The soundtrack didn't stand out to me and I never got bored watching this movie. Not everything worked with it and I do find some of material a bit problematic though as well. My rating here would be that this is a good movie, but not sure I can go higher than that. Also can't recommend this to everyone as some people are going to despise what this movie is doing. If you have thick enough skin, I think this is a fun movie in general."}, {"id": 848, "text": "The myriad references to George Orwell's Animal Farm sprinkled visually and throughout the dialogue in The Hunt are no mere reach for intellectual chutzpah in Craig Zobel's latest Feature Guaranteed to Offend *Someone*.Not that he cares, and you shouldn't either. His 2012 outing Compliance was one of those films that was extremely difficult to like, slightly sadistic, but containing such a compelling set-up, it was tough to turn off. Very similar to The Hunt in many respects.There are two immediate reasons to see this movie: first, the fact that it gamely parodies both Red and Blue (idiotic labels in themselves) sensibilities and ideas, not really the people associated with those ideas. Very few people hold party-line views on everything.That's crucial (and quite ingenious, really). This is why you have scant to almost no background on most of the characters in The Hunt... they're not really set up as blood and guts people (they explode like clay pigeons), and therein lies the vehicle for it's message. Oh yeah, it's got one of *those* --- all-caps, bolded and blazing --- so if you're thinking of an elegant satire in the vein of The Shooting Party, it's not happening here. The Hunt is closer to a mix of Die Hard and Hostel.The second reason to see this film is Betty Gilpin's break-out performance as the lead beast-of-prey, whose droll-delivery and manic facial expressions (she sometimes plays her role like an over-amped cartoon character, which given the content and context of The Hunt, is appropriate). Gilpin is the closest we get in The Hunt to a 3D human... the film would be nothing but an wooden totem without her energy and muted effusiveness. It's really a great example of how to create a smart character. She plays it so close to the vest that you get the illusion she's on the same faceless, moral-less par as the rest of the cast. And many of the lines writers Cuse and Lindelof give her are hilarious to say the least.When you step back from The Hunt and think about it, hopefully you'll realize that there really are no liberals or conservatives.... there are only people with and without power and money. And the steps the Haves will take (and have taken) are not overstated here, even though the barrage of violence is (with little to no physical consequences except when convenient). The pettiness and recklessness of upper crust vindictiveness is sadly accurate, and that goes back to Compliance, which had no clear winner or loser.That stalemate doesn't hold in The Hunt which provides a much more satisfying ending, but that overwrought message is, like most cliches, true.

I loved watching her in action, and her character and her story was definitely the best part of this movie for me.It is indeed violent. The action is awesome. The acting is pretty decent. The writing is a bit cheesy (I did not expect anything else). It is at times funny. I really enjoyed the last 15 to 20 minutes.Stereotypes abound. One could indeed be offended by this movie when it comes to the very, very basic why of how it starts off.

This only helped; due to my exceptionally low expectations for this film it far exceeded any and all of them.The acting was phenomenal (particularly Betty Gilpin). She truly brings her A-game to this film, similar to the way Samara Weaving did in Ready or Not. The supporting cast - for the most part - serves their purpose quite diligently. When I watched the trailer, I was drawn in to the film by names such as Emma Roberts, Ike Barinholtz, Justin Harltey, etc. but when the film started I was hooked by Betty Gilpin.This is an excellently made action/horror/thriller film that effectively adds in a bit of comedy every now and again. There's even a point in the film where one of the characters literally says No More Glass mid-fight scene because so much glass had been broken prior to that.The film has you hooked from start to finish and - for the most part - keeps you guessing until the credits start rolling, potentially even after.All in all, I give this excellent work of art a solid 9/10"}, {"id": 852, "text": "The Hunt follows two groups of people in a story not too dissimilar to The Most Dangerous Game, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games, and Ready or Not; one group are working-class who wake up in a strange place with no idea how they got there, while the others are the wealthy elite who hunt the peasants for sport. For the most part it plays out like any other movie of its ilk. Except The Hunt injects some clunky political satire into it, and dials up the caricatures for comedic effect. What really surprised me about this movie was how the typical roles were reversed. When these kinds of movies emerge, the wealthy are often depicted as outright evil with distasteful worldviews, while the peasants are likeable, easy to root for, and fighting for freedom for themselves and everyone else. The Hunt flips that on its head, giving us a series of right-wing, conspiracy theorist huntees as the protagonists, and having the wealthy elite as outright liberals making sure they don't offend anyone while killing humans for sport. Hollywood as an entity tends to lean quite hard to the left, so to see an American movie show left-wing liberals as the bad guys was refreshing in itself.While a big point is made of the two groups' political affiliations throughout the film's entire ninety minute running time, it actually doesn't matter all that much as the film soon devolves into the typical protagonist vs antagonist story. Nonetheless the movie takes this approach to make a point, no matter how hamfisted and lacking in subtlety it may be. The film acts as a cartoon representation of the political discourse that often emerges between those two groups. I don't believe politics can or should be easily separated into left or right, and that's sort of the point The Hunt is trying to make. There are terrible people on both sides who put too much stock into their political ideologies. The huntees may largely be racist, selfish, and full to the brim with conspiracy theories, but that doesn't mean they deserve to be hunted, and some of them definitely have redeeming qualities. Likewise just because you preach acceptance of other cultures and lead an ethical life does not suddenly turn you into a god above men, free to look down upon those who disagree with you. The biting criticism of left-leaning Hollywood sidelining filmmakers for the things they post online in order to appear ethical didn't miss the mark either.Of course to get this point across to both sides, each side is portrayed with borderline offensive caricatures. This is the left and right pulled right to their extremes. This results in the movie's most clear cut comedy. I wasn't even sure this was meant to be a funny movie going in, but it had me howling on a number of occasions. And it's not like this film pokes fun at one side and not the other. This is an equal opportunity kind of satire. The ridiculousness or piling bodies up while arguing over the correct vernacular of what to call black people co-exists alongside the daftness of waltzing up to foreign military arrogantly brandishing your American identity as if it gives you a free pass.And in the middle of all of this is Betty Gilpin as Crystal, who shows wisdom beyond her education. She's the unexpected variable who breaks the plan and shakes it all up in everyone's faces. Gilpin is absolutely fantastic in this role. While I cannot stand Debbie Eagan on GLOW, that's more down to how her insufferable character is written, and not how Gilpin decides to portray her. Gilpin has proven to be undoubtedly talented on that show, and she brings that same skill here as a completely different kind of character. She plays Crystal with a subtlety that leaves you unsure of where she stands in this mess, and while the question is asked, a concrete answer is never given. She's an obvious badass with some considerable training, but also quite clearly a bit screwy in the head. Crazy yet level-headed with military training is probably not who you want to be pissing off. And Gilpin seems to be having the time of her life with it all.While the political undercurrents remain throughout, the film does fall into predictability once Crystal takes her place centre stage. And that doesn't take long. The rotating protagonist angle is fantastic, shifting from Emma Roberts to Ike Barinholtz, but then less than half an hour in it's thrown out entirely. Similarly the final fifteen minutes are electric, almost entirely comprised of a mano a mano fight between Gilpin and Hilary Swank, without ever getting too stylish or lofty, grounding both characters in exhaustion and brutal efficiency. The mad grab for an exclusive bottle of champagne is a particular highlight. But the middle? It all just becomes kind of dull a by-the-numbers.The Hunt is cack-handedly politically charged lacking any sense of subtlety or subtext. It has a message worth listening to, but at the same time doesn't take itself too seriously and is filled with dark humour, poking fun at both sides in equal measure. My advice? Take it for what it is. A silly, over-the-top romp pointing out how ridiculous political arguments on the internet can be. I give it an enjoyable 7/10.P.S. Ethan Suplee really is as hench as those viral photos show.

The story and script is just bad and not funny and even if you take the story and the script as a comedy it's not funny. From a message and the general meaning of the movie is MAGA Deplorables are actually decent people it's just different opinions ok! and if you really focus on the Deplorables you will see the characters for how they really are but you have to focus real hard because the characterization in the script is so weak on the MAGA people but strong on the Liberals side, strong in a way that all of them are stereotypical woke very sensitive paper thin people wich make this in the end a MAGA Movie that is filled by dog whistling to other Deplorables.

Annoying, infuriating &amp; on the nose, this picture tries to parody the extreme sides of the American political spectrum yet fails at everything.Directed by Craig Zobel, the film starts in a hurried fashion with too much happening too quickly but then fails to keep that momentum going. Further ruining the ride is its slew of terribly written characters uttering eye-rollingly lame dialogues. There's good amount of violence but without any base, it doesn't amount to anything.Even if one takes this story as a self-aware parody, it still doesn't make things any better. All its attempts at humour fall flat, all the satirical elements are lacking their piercing edges, and the laughable performances from the entire cast only makes it worse. The concept is an interesting one but the execution is way off the mark.Overall, making sure everyone has an awful time no matter where they lean on the political scale, The Hunt is an early contender for one of the worst films of the year. Poorly directed, shoddily scripted &amp; further ruined by abominable acts from its cast, there is hardly anything salvageable in this absurd mess.

The movie started off at a decent pace, counting off gore packed kills right off the bat. The earliest death sequences are also the most original in my opinion with respectable visual and audio quality creating one of the few pulling factors in The Hunt. Well designed eyeball popping, satisfying action sequences through (most) of the movie. Sound effects were also dramatic and did grab attention. However a tool that kept me intrigued was the swift shifts between main characters a few times early on, leaving viewers guessing who the plot was going to follow. Although with a budget of 14 million USD there was a lot of wasted potential. It was good to be reminded occasionally that it is a movie that does not shy away from graphically blowing people up which also sadly was a death sequence which was repeated one too many times. The plot had a very promising premise which could have been utilized far better, shoddy writing left multiple plot holes throughout the entirety of the film, obvious, notable holes which would at-least irritate the audience. Personally with the stupidity and over whelming desperation to be funny combined with flimsy writing and character building i felt as if my intelligence was insulted. It felt like the film makers had a dire need to force cheap, weak humor down the audiences throat, sure a couple times there were genuinely funny scenes, but not enough to save the rest of this movie which after the first quarter decided that it would now waste as much screen time as possible with aimless, hollow shots, adding very little to the movie. The cast was actually well picked, including Emma Roberts, Hilary Swank and Betty Gilpin. Betty Gilpin was a good choice and did make a large amount of unbearable scenes slightly better. What would the worst offense of this movie be, you may ask. The anti climactic, dry ending. The movie began with some glimmer of hope, some sense, which slowly deteriorated throughout and ended without a bang, just an unremarkable fizzle. Despite a great budget, a great cast, a great premise, this unfortunate workmanship may not be worth watching. Apart from its few reasonable jokes and even fewer reasonable plot points, decent but widely spread action based sequences and main character switching, only 8 million USD at the Box Office, The Hunt was sadly a forgettable swing and a miss."}, {"id": 856, "text": "If you've ever spent time on social media reading through political discussions where there are people firmly encamped on opposite sides of the issue, then you'll understand what it's like to watch The Hunt. This film is stupid and obnoxious, but thinks it's so clever. Also, it goes on for way too long when the actual point it is trying (and failing) to make could have been accomplished in a 10-minute short. We have to watch a parade of annoying stereotypes killing one another, and we're meant to care for some reason. Even worse is the fact that the entire thing is meant to be a comedy, but it's clear that no one in the creative process knows how to deliver a joke. I was rolling my eyes most of the time, and only found a couple of scenes that managed to make me chuckle. Perhaps it was less humorous to me because I don't see the comedy in mimicking the radical right or left, because these are things that real people espouse, and they are making the world a worse place.If you stripped away all the political rambling of this film it would amount to a glorified Battle Royale or Hunger Games, and since those movies have already taken on that genre effectively, this just feels like a cheap imitation. I was on the fence whether I disliked or completely loathed The Hunt until the climax. The final confrontation is utter nonsense. They don't give a proper explanation for anything that is happening, even though they try hard to come up with one. Plus the fight itself is ludicrous and downright boring. I suppose if I cared more about the hero character then I would find a way to get invested in this battle, but she's so unpleasant, I struggle to get on her side. I've certainly seen worse movies than The Hunt, but this was pretty obnoxious. It's clear that the director and writers overestimated their ability to create something that was smart, topical, and witty.

I had never seen Betty Gilpin in a movie before this, but I became a quick fan. I loved her character and she acted it out to the full. And, at 46, Hilary Swank has still got it goin' on. This movie did NOT hold back at all. It is unapologetic and unabashed to its core.I highly recommend The Hunt. All elements of this film were very well done. The acting was spot on, the EFX and make-up was perfect, the dark humor was truly funny, the story and characters (such as they were) were strong, the cinematography was perfect, and the re-watchability is very high.

This movie has become controversial ever since the hold back of its release date due to some of edgy and relevant material. After watching it, however, I see no reason why this movie should have been held back since all of the government stuff and the deplorable stuff only scuffs the surface. This movie does have a decent story line but it just doesn't go deep enough into it. Its like walking into a lake up to your knees because you're afraid to go waist deep let alone all the way under. Or like digging up a treasure chest with loud and aggressive tools but giving up when there are only a few digs left to uncover it. The casting was really good and it was quite smart of Zobel to kill off the big names at very unexpected times and very early, leaving us with only one or two good guys or deplorables left to fend for themselves against a full hand of crooked government officials. A few things here: Hilary Swank is usually GARBAGE but in this movie she is very good and actually very sexy. She has nice curves in those comfy pants she wears towards the end and during the final showdown. Another thing is, I loved Macon Blair and he was excellent here even if only for briefly. Betty Gilpin is a shitty actress and should have never been considered for this role. However, the most important thing to look at here, is that this is such a major change up from Craig Zobel's usual style of filmmaking and its a wild follow up after Z for Zechariah ... What came over this man, I will never know, and it may or may not be a good thing. The Hunt is super violent and super stylish but surprisingly not so entertaining. The locations used were boring and the movie was just too self aware. The story is okay but too thin and the character development just isn't there for the deplorables which to me is a bit inappropriate since the govt officials were given so much back story. Overall, a decent piece of filmmaking but not great"}, {"id": 859, "text": "As a survival thriller, The Hunt is good fun. There are decent amounts of cinematic 'gore &amp; viscera' if you're looking for it. Above all, there's a no-nonsense lead played by Betty Gilpin who owns every scene she's in. As a matter of fact, googling The Hunt (2020) would open up links that talk about Trump's tweets and/or its controversial delay. The Hunt, while political to a certain extent, is more about fallacies on the internet and its make-believe standpoint.The internet gives rise to faster reactions between people, sometimes even leading to unnecessarily bloody showdowns. The Hunt is one of those instances taken too far, with an added dose of satire that's not as effective as you might expect it to be (comparisons to a film like 'Get Out' is inevitable). Director Craig Zobel makes it clear early on that you're in for a gory B-movie that takes its blood and guts (read: cheap thrills) more seriously than its writing.It is also easy to see through the writers' not-so-subtle efforts to humanise some of the gun-toting conservatives (who are pictured as 'victims' here). Yet, leaving the lead character played by Betty Gilpin largely undefined beyond the few straightforward lines she utters and letting her blaze through the elite neoliberals like true-Rambo-like fashion (she's an ex-veteran, and that explains it) was a neat decision on their part.The antagonists in The Hunt are the least convincing. Powered by the internet and social media mix-ups, their characterizations are weak, to say the least. I particularly enjoyed the shootout set in the field - lots of ambiguity, and a good number of well-known faces pop up (Ike Barinholtz, Emma Roberts, Wayne Duvall) but whatever follows couldn't match its intensity - whether in thrills or in storytelling.

This is no exception. The concept for this film is great, on paper it sounded really interesting but all of that is let down by the addition of political views that really didn't need to be there in the first place. If The Hunt left the politics to one side and stuck to the raw idea and structure of the film's premise then this could have been pretty wonderful. I'll give credit where it's due, the political skews on this made for some great publications and advertising.The movie poster shared quotes cut from different reviewers, dangerous and shows hollywood for what it really is, demented and evil were among these quotes. From what I read, I expected to view something truly disturbing and sick. All I got was a fairly light hearted take on a battle royale with little substance in-between. The horror and violence here is not offensive, it's the politics that has so many triggered.The Hunt doesn't take itself too seriously, which I think is a shame. Betty Gilpin is the star here, she delivers a really great performance that'll get you rooting for her throughout. Her Don't give a damn attitude is really refreshing in this production. It attempts to make fun of internet culture but comes up short and is even cringeworthy at times.The introduction to The Hunt is probably the best part of the movie, for the first 15-30 minutes it's gory, has a heavy body count and will keep you guessing who is the main protagonist is. After that it, it gets a little repetitive and lacklustre. The movie relies on politics and comedy instead of the plot. There's quite a few plot holes in this film. The majority of the characters lack personality and are boring.It seems to me that people rate this one so highly because of how it takes shots at left and right wing politics. Adding real life conflict doesn't automatically make a film great, just because it's relatable.

The movie just does not take itself too seriously. It is not a horror movie, but a cartoonish satire aimed at political divisions in USA and internet culture. One side is painted as unsophisticated, while the other receives even harsher, if well deserved treatment.

Very little was shown regarding why they picked who and they never really answered it. The whoops at the end seemed like a rushed lazy way to end it.

The film also has quite a few stereotypes, and incredibly thin characters, which at times seems rather ironic considering the films subject matter. I did enjoy this film quite a bit however, despite these fallacies, and found it to have quite a few great moments. I love Betty Gilpin in this role, as she is not only very different in her sense of portrayal, but excellent in her portrayal of the main character. There were a few other decent actors throughout, but no one too memorable. I liked the idea of the film, and found it to be suspenseful, entertaining, and oddly fun at times. It doesn't try to dazzle you with lots of special effects or lots of crazy angles throughout, it just feels like a simply made film that is anything but simple, and I can't help but say I enjoyed the direction the film took. In the end, The Hunt was not what I expected. It's not the most perfect film this year, nor is it great, but it has quite a few strong moments that make the film worth the watch. My Rating: 8.5/10"}, {"id": 870, "text": "Seltzer?! They are all d-bags!She is gonna get shot.Just take the crowbar.Put the lid nails down!Don't leave any weapons behind.At least they're staying together.Obviously bogus phone cop.Everyone in this movie is buff from dragging bodies around.That is a fantastic tipping of the hand.What about the driver?Should have taken your pants off.You can't trust him.She would know better than to walk in fro t of the gate. Suddenly she forgets all the sense and training now! Nonsense."}, {"id": 871, "text": "Yes this is an analogy as someone already has written (or probably more than one) and for my money it is a pretty clever one. Not the message overall, not the simple structured story, but the layers within. This mirrors in a very bloody and violent way (it's a movie and it's heightened, but was still able to agitate some so this had to be postponed several times) what is happening in America specifically but in a way all over the world overall.While the two party system is kind of unique to America - and yes I know that independents can be on the ballot and technically have a chance to become president without belonging to the Democrats or Republicans, everyone knows this is not something that will likely happen in the near future. Maybe someday - maybe there will be more parties to choose from too.Just me sighting Democrats first in the paragraph above though will have some people agitated and some excited and drawing conclusions from it. I went alphabetically. And the movie itself does not take prisoners or makes one side look so much superior than the other. You could make the case and the hunted and hunter roles could have been reversed - but as it is, it is way funnier and more apt to the situation America is in.So take this with a grain of salt, accept that no one is right all the time - and be entertained. You don't have to even think about it, to just have fun with it. But if you do, it might elevate it. And the powerhouse performances, especially from the two female leads and enemies ... beyond amazing.And if that wasn't enough: the movie let's you decide what the answer to some questions are! Who is she? Did you notice anything in her behavior that would help answer that question or do you just think you did? Does it matter? Fast drawing conclussions can be the death of us(a) ... very literally here"}, {"id": 872, "text": "Once upon a time, there was a little movie called The Hunt. Billed as a horror thriller, it was originally set to release way back in September of 2019, but because we as people can't figure out how to just get along with each other, it got pushed back. The heavy handed political vows probably didn't help either though. But not all was lost for the little movie that could and it was soon rescheduled for a fresh release in March of 2020. It had no idea it would be vying for our attention with a little diddy off a thing, COVID-19. It lost that contest handily and, in a final effort to get this thing out there, Universal threw it to home video.So, what have we learned?When the world, not studios or fan hate or whatever but the WORLD tells you no twice? Wash your hands and walk away. There was no conceivable way this thing would be praised by the collective viewership with all this baggage attached.This movie is a mess. It's remarkably heavy handed yet trying to be subtle so it feels very in your face but then when you stop to think about it the whole thing feels muddled and indecisive. The main character is given no backstory at all, no explanation satisfactory enough for why she's able to do what she does or why she seems to switch from mood to mood like someone's hitting a switch. It's also listed as horror thriller and I guess I can kinda see thriller but there's no horror here at all. Comedy thriller might be a better fit, cause it does try to be funny. It was also hated on originally for its political statement and I get that. It's not actually targeting anyone important, it's just making pot shots at rednecks and social justice warriors. Thank heaven, right? Cause they don't ever get made fun of. So glad The Hunt is breaking that barrier down.The biggest problem to me is the way this movie reeks of desperation. They desperately wanted to make some cheap commentary and stuffed it into this half baked story. They wanted to desperately take cracks at both sides but didn't have the backbone to actually hit anything real. They desperately want you to buy into plot misdirects when they spell out EVERYTHING pretty consistently regarding what's happening. And they desperately don't want you to stop and think about the actual movie for a second because it is so dumb.That said, there is some wonderfully superficial stuff here to enjoy and I thought Betty Gilpin, who I'd never heard of before, was a delight, even if she was poorly written.End of the day, I'm torn on whether I recommend this or not. From a story, plot, intellectual standpoint? Absolutely not. But there are some fun aspects here... All of which are done better elsewhere in other action movies... I think I'd recommend it for a rent or stream. Don't pay full price on this thing but it's worth it to watch for the action because while I can see similar and better things elsewhere, it's rare to see a not overly sexualized woman kick this much butt. That's what pushes it over the edge."}, {"id": 873, "text": "The appeal of this movie is in its premise. Modern politics being the epitome of divisiveness there are not a lot of works that dare 1) touch it and 2) do it in such a manner that is satisfying and justified.Larry David used the MAGA hats as a punchline, but did not really address it. Space Force is built on showing the chaos of the current administration but is rather toothless. The Hunt is built on Qanon meets the Hunger Games. What if the liberal elite did actually hunt down deplorable Trump supporters? This lead the film to become an action movie, with the characters, except for both Hilary Swank and Betty Gilpin, turning slowly but surely into caricatures of Republicans and Democrats.The execution of this movie, the translation of the premise into something meaningful fails. The political commentary is too jumbled and lazy to have any weight. The action/horror journey of the hero is not that unique or interesting. If you take away the politics, she is just trying to survive this convoluted situation, and her approach is mainly to remain calm, focused and not to engage with the political arguments. The movie sets up this premise but it does not let its main protagonist be involved with it. Ultimately, the choice of having an apolitical protagonist, which the writers thought would absolve them from being biased or partisan, leads to a character who is outside the story.The movie is not devoid of technical competency. As a thriller, it is captivating and the various set pieces are somewhat clever. Visually it is more mature and engaging that the Hunger Games. On the same note, the acting is great and there are many good comedic actors, and you get a sense that the movie started more as an outright comedy. The Hunt is ironic rather than fun. But mostly the film goes for a dramatic tone.Modern political discourse is very passionate, and sometimes brutal/violent. It invites a response or commentary. It invites an equally strong response to the violence of its message. The problem is not so much what do you say, which side you are on, but rather how do you say it. The Hunt for all its irony and humour does not really emit an opinion/message. Instead, its confusion might go against its assumed pro-liberal stance. The liberals are all judgmental and sadistic. They have all the characteristics of villains. They are vapid, hypocrites, and on top of that they are incompetent. The right-wingers are merely victims, who appear to be right about their wild hate-filled conspiracy theories: the Hunt is real, the migrants are crisis actor, the text chain at the beginning is never explained. Not only that but the Deplorables appear as compassionate because they help each other, they are the characters the audience roots for. At the end, the movie had this interesting premise but did not know what to do with it. It missed the opportunity to depict the two sides in a real way and not as caricatures."}, {"id": 874, "text": "What I don't understand is the low rating for this amazing flick. Or maybe I do understand because the two females in it aren't wellknown for acting in gory flicks and here they do.It's funny in some moments, it's over the top gory and some situations you think, okay byt the result isn't what you expect, in other words, I can't go really deep into this because I would spoil a lot.Nevertheless, if you are a gorehound do pick this up. If you thnk you are going to see a romantic flick forget it. It's a pure no-brainer, one you see with your friends. Entertainment on a horror/comedy level. Sometimes Tucker And Dale (2010) comes to my mind for the gore attached not for the comedy. You get it, not a normal flick but did I love it.Gore 3,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 2/5"}, {"id": 875, "text": "I was really looking forward to Emma Roberts being in this movie, so wasn't happy at all with the plot. She may not be a massively huge Actress, but she's a favorite for a lot of us. She was great in American Horror Story.The Hunt wasn't quite what I expected, but it was entertaining. Some people are complete nutcases and there's a surprising comedy in many parts. They work quite well.But don't bother betting on who is gong to survive. It's literally a free-for-all and anyone you thought was going to be a hero dies in the first 15 minutes. Some people are really badass and awesome in it. There's a lot of violence and gore too, so delicate people should have their vomit bands handle.And yet...not much plot. It could have been way better without the first 2 twists and not killing off some people who could have made it all so much better. If you look at the trailer carefully, you can actually see who lives and dies first.Me at the beginning of the movie:Yay, Emma Roberts!Oh, damn it. Seriously?!Yay, Justin Hartley!Whyyyyyy?!Huh. Hilary Swank!Wow, surprisingly kick ass.Rest of the movie:That must have hurt!Where's the plot??Watch it for some entertainment and maybe take a shot of Vodka every time someone died. No, when someone loses a body part. I'd give it a higher rating if they hadn't killed off my favorite actress right at the beginning."}], "reviews_amount": 876}
