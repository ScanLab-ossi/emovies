However, the scene after the credits is illogical and affected the plot. The present antagonist would have no way of making the call. And would have no way of knowing that her version of the past has died. After all, if she from the past died ... She from the present would not exist to do anything. I wouldn't mind having a sad ending, but that ending doesn't make sense. If it had ended up in the cemetery, it would have been consistent and still sad because of the people who died and the traumatic situation of the mother and daughter."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Should have stopped at the cemetery scene. But they added a few more scenes in the credits that changed the timeline again. Didn't even make sense since throughout the film, past was calling the present. The present never called the past. Then all of a sudden she warned her past self about dying? If she died, she wouldn't have been able to warn herself. If she didn't die, she shouldn't have disappeared in the present when attacking the other girl. It's as if the writers forgot their own time travel rule. I wish Netflix will edit the credit scenes out. Even as an alternate ending, it wouldn't be plausible."}, {"id": 2, "text": "WTF was that ending??? I guess some people don't know when to stop... It made absolutely no sense whatsoever."}, {"id": 3, "text": "I'm not sure how to fully comprehend the ending timeline here. There are more questions than answers of course to the entirety of the call to begin with. But I guess the main two are:1. How does the phone call connect from 1999 to present day? The viewers are suppose to take it as is I guess, no actual scientific nor paranormal explanation here, just happens as is.2. So the timeline of the two characters continue to progress as is, there's no indication of the present Young-sook alerting herself in the past until the very end and that in itself is a whole conundrum because we see the mom throwing Young-sook over the balcony and then surviving so that Seo-yeon is able to find her mom alive at the cemetery, but then as they both leave the cemetery her mom flickers and disappears because Young-sook survives the fall also. Now if the mom survives with Seo-yeon, wouldn't they call the police or at least find out at some point that Young-sook didn't die so that she would remain a threat? We only have the past calling the present until the very end, where the one instance is Young-sook is calling herself in the past which is a reversal of this mysterious phone communication. How does this happen? Lets say she figured it out and can call herself in the past, how does she find the exact moment to call herself before the mom and the police arrives at the house? Because if both timeline are continually progressing in the past and the present, won't that moment in the past also have passed? And my conundrum here is how this ending is a miss because it doesn't validate the space time continuum sequence of events here. Either leave the ending as is with the mom being alive and Young-sook dead or mom dead because Young-sook never died.Things need to add up even if we're left with a cliff hanger but unfortunately this cliff hanger ended up making no sense."}, {"id": 4, "text": "There's a few added scenes during the credits which SHOULD NOT be there, please trust me and switch off when they roll.If you do, you will have a cracking movie that will have you glued to the set til the end."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Good scenario with twisted story.

With a story like this one, original and very difficult to properly develop, you can have a great movie or and entertaining one but you need a really capable writer in both the cases. Unfortunately Chung-Hyun Lee is a decent director that knows how to entertain the audience but it's not a writer that knows how to handle a story this particular, even if he was the one that came up with it. This idea, because this is what we really see here: a great idea, needed more effort into the script to be transposed into something that made sense, instead the screenplay appears shallow, messy and ignorant, with logic too often sacrificed for entertainment purposes leading to plot holes and inconsistent plot twists that make you enjoy the movie less and less until it becomes more disappointing than engaging and more nonsensical than smart."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Diabolical.

It was really good at making the viewer feel anxious, and it did a really good job with its triller. Also, the acting was amazing.The ending, however, ruined it. Aside from leaving a bad taste in the mouth, it didn't make sense. The future called the past? That's going against the rules the movie set up from the beginning...Furthermore, the cemetery scene left a huge impression, and it gave the movie a meaning: Sometimes you take for granted the people around you and how much they love you. It was perfect. It would've been a great movie if it had stopped there. But then there had to be a credits scene just ignoring the rules the movie set up for the sake of being edgy.I was extremely frustrated and mad at myself for sticking up to see the credits. Leaves a real bad taste in the mouth."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Even the cemitery ending was not good enough. The movie lost sense in the middle of too many plot twists. An ending with a paradox would be better: After Seo-yeon 'forgiving' her mother during the call with Young-sook, she would let Sook kill her younger version and go to jail forever. This would create a paradox. She doesn't exist in the future, so she never pick up the phone. Sook never saves her dad and is not saved by Seo-yeon as well. The movie starts all over again. The phone rings and Seo-yeon knows exactly what to do: Never pick up the phone (and then let the audience create a theory that she repeated all process until her dad is saved and then she let Sook die LOL)"}, {"id": 12, "text": "One of the best thrillers I've watched as of late.

I'm sure the writers knew how to keep people on the edge of their seats; even those with the shortest span of attention. Almost every plot twist made sense and were well-thought of. However, note that I said 'almost'. The 'real' ending of this movie is simply not counted for me. The plot twist is not even understandable. The writers should have left the initial ending as it is, since it was very emotional and I definitely shed some tears, but the ending just left almost everyone with a giant question mark.

The storyline was gripping and engaging which made me watch the movie without boredom. The movie theme is pretty similar to the Korean drama series 'Signal' where communication through different time dimension is done. This movie has used the same theme to justify the different plot.

If your your past self is killed then there is no way of re-writing history to change that.... Unless there is another time line in which another person involved alters it...

Yes, I understood exactly what was going on but as it pertains to the story line, it didn't add up. If her past was constantly being changed, her future self should already have experienced everything from her passed meaning she would already have those memories. I also don't like how she's the only one who gets to experience the many alternative futures but no one else. You'd think everyone who's experienced them would experience it but they don't. And her having to figure out how the future changed I think was dumb. Like I get it but that's not how time works, she's already know what was happening.If you knew someone was a serial killer and you knew they were gonna get a life sentence, post already killing two people, would you tell them? No. That not only risks your future life, which was exactly what happened, but you're letting a killer get away with murders.I kept seeing very high reviews but I didn't like this movie at all. The story line was cool but poorly executed. I don't think this movie even could be properly executed because then it wouldn't have that suspenseful thriller you're going for.

I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the rest of the trailer. Little did I know that I was in for a surprise.Sharing information through time, changing the past/present/future, all that sounded familiar to me from movies like Back To The Future, expected very similar things to happen here. But this movie, no-no-no, this turned out to be VERY DIFFERENT. Slightly mind-bending, even.AMAZING acting, GREAT background music that keeps your attention, builds the intensity. Some really good visuals that make you go okay, I wasn't expecting that! Some really good suspense and thrill as well. Stick around for the credits!Park Shin Hye is a brilliant actress. She, needless to say, did an amazing job conveying all sorts of emotions - happy, sad, angry, scared, etc. But so did Jeon Jong-seo. Tough to say who was better in the movie. In movies like these, the villains seldom get the range of emotions to work with, and given that limitation, I'd say Jong-seo takes the cake, 51-49.I am also glad that the negative role in the movie was played by a female lead, not sure if it was a conscious decision. It would have been nothing new to have a male play that role, not sure if much would have changed in the movie either. But I'm glad that Jong-seo was picked to do this, it was refreshing to see a female killer for a change.Getting back to the movie, I have never wanted find answers as badly as I did after this movie in a long time. I watched the movie as soon as it released on Netflix so the wait for people online to watch it and share their thoughts was painstaking. 2 days of discussion later, I found some answers. Countless Youtube videos later, I still need some answers. Most videos online only discuss the obvious. And I think that adds to the effect that movie has on the audience. 10 years since Inception released, people still discuss the ending. Not that I am comparing The Call to Inception, but for those who watch Korean movies, and watch global thrillers, the ending of this movie will be talked about and discussed for a looong time.Totally worth your time!"}, {"id": 43, "text": "This movie didn't make sense at all.

However, something quite similar has already been done, in movie The Caller, from year 2011. Creators of Call either accidentally had similar idea for movie plot or it they were inspired by The Caller, very similar very dark movie that has exact the same plot. However it was, the message is always don't mess with trying to change the past, don't give away your identity to someone who is in your past as that person obviously has hold on your life and future.

It is a non stopping thrill from the beginning to the very end, in good korean movies style. There are some really disturbing developments along the movie, a lot of gruesome scenes, and at some point it gets worse every time there is a new phone call from the past. But the present character made a very dumb decision that basically ruins everything when she decided to tell the past character that she would be arrested for life for her crimes. Why would she do that? It was a leverage that she had and she just gives that away. It made no sense.

The time travel plot movies with butterfly effect have been used for hundred times, but it is an amalgam of many elements including motherhood, trust, betray, detective logics which you cannot really predict in the end. The director makes a good effort to develop both girls' unfortunate life and the plot becomes something of its own and full of twists, that making us 100% believe in YoungSook's innocence. However, things develop out of control and heart-breathing in the middle part. All is so gripping and compelling and filled with tension.The performances, too, both actresses are extremely great. Park Shin Hye does an excellent job about perfectly demonstrating how a desperate and regrettable person looks alike. JeonJong Seo as a new actress whose performance is amazing that really make my skin crawl her insane character.The ending comes with lots of critics as people think it's non-sensible that the future Young Soon can mange to escape the fate of death via saving the past Young Sook. I am agree it is quite complicated to digest all details within the last few minutes.

BUT - the writers didn't violate against their own time travel rule.The past-Young Sook was the one who called the present-Young Sook. She actually wanted to call the present-Seo Yeon to ask her if she had found the evidences. Instead, present-Young Sook was on the phone and answered that a police officer and the mom are going to kill her (she warned her past-self). So the writers didn't break their own rule.BUT - the ending still doesn't makes sense. Like many described before: if past-Young Sook had died in the fight, the present-Young Sook couldn't warn her past-self. If she had survived, she couldn't have disappeared in the present where Seo-Yeon found herself suddenly alone in the empty house, present-Young Sook vanished and everything turned out well into a happy end. She (present) would have caught Seo Yeon, took her down into the cellar and tied her up (as we see it in the alternative ending). In the alternative ending, we also see that the mother has already left (and probably took the child-Seo Yeon with her) as Young Sook woke up - which should show the viewers that she also survived the fall and legitimate a present-Young Sook who got (accidentally) the call by the past-Young Sook. This isn't logical because the mother would have called the police or even special forces to get that b**ch arrested.One option for me was, that the ending we saw, at the moment where Seo Yeons mom came out of the room to push Young Sook and herself over railing, she survived, Young Sook vanished and everything turned out well - never happened. That the ending we see in the credits is what only could have happened, because the mother actually died in that room, where we got to see the blood on the walls and the shattered window. After only Young Sook leaves the room it's clear that the mother must be the one who's dead. Instead the fictional happy end starts and we got the plot twist in the credits. The surviving of Young Sook still doesn't makes sense and that's the point where my only conclusion is:The writers wanted it to be confusing like that. They want the viewers to ask themselves what the heck just happened in the end and how all of this could be explained. To recap all the little details. This is what you will talk about. With your family, friends and so on. This will hook others up to also watch the movie - and that's good!I really enjoyed the acting, the score and all the little details.

Something happens to her - we don't know what, as it's never shown - but it's implied she stays away from the protagonist and her family after that night for some reason (prison, run away, etc., we don't know), but it's obviously still thirsty for revenge. So the antagonist grows old in the new rewritten timeline that the protagonist created, in which the protagonist's past self doesn't do all the stuff we see her do throughout the movie (even though the protagonist's present self retains all those memories but not the new rewritten ones). This gives the villain the upper hand, as she has plenty of time to find the phone and find which days of the past will match which present days. So she waits until the day when the phone will be connected to that eventful night and makes the call. At this point there is no protagonist in her way because the protagonist is living her rewritten life without any knowledge of what's going on until she catches up with her present self timeline.

Although it starts off very creepy and eventually finds that same creepiness towards the end, the rest of the movie is quite a basic mystery thriller. The thriller elements work great and make this film surprisingly tense.I, like I'm sure many others, went in expecting this to be a horror film. And the film certainly made me think that it's going to be exactly that. The first 20 or so minutes are very creepy and capture the essence of the haunted house genre quite well. However, as soon as the main character figures out what's happening around her, the movie quickly transitions into a fast-paced cat &amp; mouse thriller. I didn't mind this change, but it did catch me a little off guard. The horror elements in the beginning very so convincing that I was sure that the rest of the movie would follow in suit. But it didn't. And truth be told, I'm glad it didn't. I'm not a huge fan of the haunted house genre, and as such, the change of style probably ended up making me like this movie more.The Call tries to stand apart from the rest of the genre through its concept. And fortunately, it succeeds. We find ourselves thrown into the life of Seo-yeon, who receives a mysterious call from an old phone. What we, and her, quickly realize, is that these calls are coming from the same house, but 20 years earlier. Both women, the one living in the past and the one in the present, quickly realize that they are dependent on one another. Both pursue personal interests, and a game of cat and mouse promptly begins. This premise, and idea, add their own twist. Trying to outsmart the other person isn't quite as simple anymore, as they are living two decades apart. Accordingly, both come up with some rather creative ways to try and beat the other. While this concept is great for the most part, it, unfortunately, became quite predictable, which certainly lessened the intensity of the film.One of the best parts about The Call was how it represented loss and gain. There are certain time-line and life-altering moments that have a drastic impact on Seo-yeon's life. Rather than just rely on practical changes, the film goes to great lengths to depict them visually as well. One example might be how her hair changes depending on the state that her life is in. Or how the colours of the film adjust with her. While these types of visual displays wouldn't have been necessary, they added more weight to what was happening. And while there are a lot of great things in this movie, the aforementioned visuals included, the ending nearly ruins the whole thing. Right before the credits start rolling, I thought that the movie had ended, and I quite liked that ending. However, right after the first credit, another scene happens. And more quickly follow. In total there are four or five scenes that take place in between the actor credits. While they add a certain sense of horror and dread, they were completely unnecessary, and took away what was a very satisfying and appropriate conclusion. So, if you do watch this movie, I would recommend that you stop watching as soon as you feel like you have arrived at the end and as soon as you see the first actor's name credited. The alternative ending simply isn't worth it, and in my opinion, made the movie worse.As a whole, though, there is a lot to like in The Call. It's a very well made film with an interesting and quite engaging concept. While it might not be as much of a horror film as it promises, I, for one, enjoyed the thriller style and thought that it worked very well. If it weren't for the ending and the sometimes too easily predicted story, this could've definitely been one of the better films of the year."}, {"id": 179, "text": "BEWARE SPOILERS AHEAD It has such a very good concept, the style and the flow is very nice and the actors and actresses were extremely good BUT and a big one, they blew it by making the main character act dumb and weird. I wanted to shout at her when she litterally didnt care about how she could save her from all that torture and how she didnt read her diary till the end. She litterally acted like everything was normal and ignored her calls when she had already read that her mother was trying to set her on fire. A normal person would definitly not act like she did and it felt like an obvious dumbness added to make the movie go smoother.Btw that ending makes no sense at all, throughout the whole movie they had paralel timelines and time flowed the same for them both and then you take the time back on the other girls timeline? Wtf if she was going to be able to talk to herself from the past it had to be her from after the fall not before the cop came CONCLUSION NO SPOILS If you dont mind those few scenes of dumbness that blew the whole movie its a 9/10, would definitly recommend for a person that doesnt watch films too frequently. If you do mind, dont even watch it you will want to punch the walls for all that lost potential."}, {"id": 180, "text": "Fiction / Thriller movie from Korea. Another great example from Korean cinema. One of the best thrillers of the year. Combines fantasy with horror. A particularly unusual call from the past. A contact with the past, which has the power to change the present by changing the past. Can one girl help the other? What will happen in the end? What personality is hidden behind the girl of the past? How long will the friendship last before it turns into a nightmare for the girl of the present? An asymmetric threat awakens in the past and can define the events of the present at will. Can knowledge of present protect her from the threat of the past? A thriller with a fairly uncommon idea, very good performances, each in its own role, a fairly well-developed script, with enough emotion, suspense and multiple twists in the plot of the film. The end consists of multiple twists and the last big one is after the end titles. Although I personally would prefer not to have the last twist and close the movie with the already nice and emotional ending (if you want, skip the last twist after the end titles, to close the movie in a better way). The thriller of the year. Recommended to everyone."}, {"id": 181, "text": "I thought I had this one in the bag (i.e. I thought I knew what this film would be about), but half way in I realised what I thought I knew would be the other way round.The good and the bad: The acting is excellent and the setting is idealTo my knowledge, the story hasn't been done beforeThe film pulls no punches. There is no easing up on any of the characters (no matter how cute or sweet they are)The film will keep you guessing. Just as you think you know what will happen, it all changesIt's not a horror but it gets increasingly creepyI wasn't a fan of the final twist at the end. With so many scare films having a twist at the end, it seems reasonable to assume the writers added the final twist as a way to keep it fresh, but it didn't work for me, and the film would have been better without it.Unpredictable, unsettling and a reasonable story, this film is for people who want a new type of scare film.Highly recommended."}, {"id": 182, "text": "I'm a big fan of the concept behind 'The Call'. It is similar to the 2000 film 'Frequency', only with a much darker plot. And don't underestimate me calling it dark, this film is seriously dark. Every Korean film I watch seems to have no fear whatsoever of taking risks. While so many American films, even horror ones, play it by the book and keep it safe, the Koreans seem to have no book - and I love it.When you involve any sort of time travel or intersecting time periods in a movie things are going to get complicated. For the most part things play out pretty simply in 'The Call'. It is easy to follow and everything seems to follow similar logic. Then the end comes around and everything blows up in that regard. I've done some thinking about it and watched an explanation video and my conclusion is that it doesn't all quite add up. I absolutely love the ending they went for, but it doesn't make 100% sense when you go back and think about the steps it took to get there. Be your own judge though when you watch it I suggest.We don't see a lot of female villains or serial killers in film. I absolutely love that 'The Call' chooses to go that route, and it does it so well. The villainous character in this film is extremely menacing and captivating to watch. There is no reason more films couldn't take on this challenge. I had a really good time with 'The Call' and would absolutely recommend it as one to check out."}, {"id": 183, "text": "Call is a South Korean thriller which revolves around Yeon Seo (portrayed by Park Shin-hye) who stumbles upon a doorway into the past through receiving a telephone call from Young Sook (portrayed by Jeong Jong-seo) whom is the sole reason why I believe audiences should view this film due to providing an astounding performance as a troubled individual. Forced to endure verbal and physical abuse from her mother. The two characters are separated twenty years apart from each other. Living in different timelines, they eventually form a relationship based on their similarities and Young Sook reluctantly agrees to help weave a brighter future for her companion. Unfortunately, genuine intentions lead to sinister consequences as the decision to alter events will affect past and present forever.The plot is reminiscent to films such as The Butterfly Effect (2005) and Looper (2012). The main theme deals with the concept of free will and how the choices of the leading characters can affect the lives of those around them. Although, Call (2020) is slightly less engaging than those films. Initially intrigued with the premise. I personally do not believe this film was executed well. It begins as a slow burn that becomes tedious to a degree and it gradually evolves into a film that is by-the-numbers. I found this to be predictable, the run-time was longer than it should have been and I stopped caring during the second act due to the lack of emotional attachment I had for the characters. I was exhausted by the time the end credits started rolling. This film even leaves an unsatisfactory open-ending for a sequel that I have no desire toward viewing.I would recommend this film if you have an available schedule this weekend. The cinematography from Jo Young-jik is absolutely gorgeous and the narrative is easy to follow and cohesive but I would certainly not go into this film expecting originality.Follow me on instagram: @joshuarenealvarez"}, {"id": 184, "text": "Just a few seconds into the film, I was slowly captivated by the colours. Yes, it is sad and dull. But there is beauty even though it is a sombre colour palette. Besides that, the transitions are fitting as well. From locating the missing smartphone of our lead character, a Galaxy Note 9 (not sponsored) to be exact, the scene slowly and beautifully transitioned to a brain scan.Okay, that might be ridiculous to some. But I do love a good transition. And with The Call (2020), it does not end with simple film transitions. There are several as the story shows us various process or periods of changing from one state to another, which are often heartbreaking. The narrative keeps moving and transforming as both our leads do what they need to survive and live the life they deserve.And we all know this does not always work out. Sure, we can repeatedly change our life or rather what is up ahead as we have the power to plan or retract every decision we make. However, we cannot control external factors nor mould our life according to what we only want. And most importantly, we can not change the past. A truth that is hard for everyone to accept.Speaking of which this film is not about time travel. No one travels from past to present or vice versa. The Call (2020) focuses more on connecting with the past and then bending reality when one realises she had the upper hand.This horror mystery thriller is one of those films that work your brain. If you love that kind of genre, I highly recommend The Call (2020). It is one thought-provoking film that will not waste your time."}, {"id": 185, "text": "To avoid spoilers I won't tell anything about the plot.This is the type of horror mystery which deserves a special reward. The script is executed perfectly as the actors perform insanely well that it gets under your skin. These great South Korean actors make you feel all the emotions which they face in this movie. And it's allot of em!! The story is slightly compareble to Frequency, starring Dennis Quaid only with a deep dark twist. It involves time travel and it will mess with your mind!The director puts your right on spot where you should be, weather it's from a first person perspective or a tirth person perspective. You won't miss out on details. Only for a few detals are left out which probably would be to cruel or harsh to perform on that character. ( You will understand once you see it! ) The special effects are extraordinary. Something which i haven't seen so well executed in where linear timelines cross paths.The sound is crisp and on point with a great music track which will haunt you, even while the credits are playing.....keep watching it!! You won't regret it!!Prepare to be taken on a trip into extreme darkness which you can't run or hide from........Are you watching yet?! ^.^"}, {"id": 186, "text": "Great film!! If you understand film's where time crosses over (basically time travel film's) then you will understand and enjoy this film. Ignore the people that say it makes no sense because it does!! It comes quite fast pace in the last half only because so much is happening but if you keep up with everything it's very entertaining, definitely keeps you watching. I hoped this film would be good because some Netflix films can be really cheesy and bad but this is one of the good ones. The trailer doesn't tell you much apart from the main point of the phone I guess, so I didn't know what to expect with this film which is why I enjoyed is so much. The most important thing with film's like this one is that you should watch it without any expectations, you'll enjoy it more if you don't know what's exactly coming. I love twists and I didn't see anything coming with this film so I definitely enjoyed it. Very clever storyline and concept. The effect's used at some points are very extra but make the film more fantasy like. This film definitely made me think things through over and over. Good acting too, Jeon Jong-seo is a brilliant actress!!!The only thing I will say is that they could have kept to one ending. You think it's ended but after some credits it's actually not. It's like they had two endings and didn't know which one to choose so they put both in which I think is what's confusing people. The ending they put in during the credits doesn't exactly fit in the storyline but if you just ignore the alternate ending they've put in for some reason the film makes sense.Would definitely watch again!! Very good film :)"}, {"id": 187, "text": "Okay full review here. I won't give away any spoilers. This is a taught and marvelously inventive little horror film. In what seems to me to be an lift from from the Dennis Quaid/ Jim Cavievel film of 2000, Frequency, we have a young woman who finds an old wireless landline phone in her parents old house. She receives a call one night from a young girl who is about to be murdered by her mother. The hitch here is that the young girl calling had died 10 years earlier.That's all your going to get from me as far as plot. But let me say that this film was a good surprise! It kept breaking my second guesses and what I thought was going to transpire at every turn.Writer/ Director Chung-Hyun Lee has built a marvelous thriller and has gotten two absolutely rock solid performances by actresses Jong-seo Jun and Park Shin-Hye. The film is a must see for all horror fans, but anyone who enjoys a good thriller will be riveted.As with most (if not all) time travel plot lines, there are parallels that shouldn't be possible, but the script is so well written that these conundrums are almost always addressed, and creatively so.It is a roller coaster ride, and as tight as a new catcher's mitt. Sit back, turn on Netflix. and watch this little beauty. And stay through the end credits as a bit more terror awaits."}, {"id": 188, "text": "As with most 'time-travel' movies, 'Call (2020)' asks you to take quite a few leaps of logic as it progresses towards its increasingly complex finale. However, if you accept the fact that its two timelines are, essentially, occurring concurrently, most of its narrative (sans one or two mostly harmless inconsistencies) makes perfect sense - or, at the very least, its issues are so small that they can safely be hand-waved away with no detrimental effect. The picture's most, I suppose, iffy moments come during a final, mid-credits interlude that seeks (successfully, I'll add) to insert one last sting into the thing's tail. Although this segment arguably isn't necessary and runs the risk of souring one's final impression, it does what it sets out to - for better or worse - without ruining anything it proceeds. That's all I'll say about the plot, let alone the ending, as I don't want to spoil any aspects of the generally unpredictable affair. It's fantastically subversive, side-stepping expectation in natural and genuinely interesting ways. As a result, it often has you on the edge of your seat. It's a brilliant thriller that builds upon its initial premise almost perfectly. It does eventually threaten to cross the line of credibility and become too much for its own good. It never does, though, and remains a thoroughly engaging, almost captivating experience throughout. It really is great. 8/10"}, {"id": 189, "text": "It's the suspense that keeps the movie going. And for a first feature length outing ... kudos to the director of this. Now I've recently seen a spanish movie on netflix that was sort of similar (with parallel timelines or whatever you want to call them). It struggled too with making sense or being able to explain how things would be able to change and affect any future while the main character seemed to remember everything that didn't actually happen.But that is why I started with never mind logic. Because there is no explanation for that and the movie can not deliver one. While the spanish movie was more romantic though in its approach, this is evil and gets down and dirty. We can feel early on, that something is off ... but how would you react and what would you do? There are so many things character wise that make this exciting and the suspense level is as high as it can get ... again, if you let it do what it does ... Twists and all that included ... even the one within the credits ..."}], "reviews_amount": 190}
