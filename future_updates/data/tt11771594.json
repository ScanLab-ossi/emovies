You are going to waste 2 hours of your life."}, {"id": 41, "text": "I feel like I must take some stuff out of the way, before starting to talk about specifics here. I honestly didn't understand the heat this movie got, when the first trailer dropped. For real, I've seen all 8 movies of the series, and... well, the spin offs suck. They do. There is no way around it. There are some feel qualities here and there, but at the end of the day none of the spin offs is even close to the level of the 4 main movies (even tho The Book of Love is the one spin off I think is fine).Still, my point was why the hell should we worry about them making a female focused one? I truly thought it was a fine idea, it made sense, that almost a decade after the last movie (even more after the last spin off) they would do one, we girls as the focus. Sounded fresh, and like the natural path for the franchise to go. So again, I truly went with no expectations (cause you know, they spin offs suck), but that had nothing to do with the concept of the film itself.However, man, this might be the worst one yet. I will try to explain a bit more. I think this might be the best acted of the spin offs, the girls are truly doing a fine job, with the bad story they have. But it just doesn't feel like an American Pie film (we don't even had nudity! - not that it would make the movie better, but like... isn't it like one of the trademarks of the series?). It feels so clean, idk how to explain, it just doesn't feel like an American Pie movie, and that's probably my main complained, it feels like just another mediocre rom-com, with a bit more of sex in it, that's it.I have one other big complained tho. If you are gonna try break traditions in this one, and renovate the franchise, why keep the most stupid one? I thought Lizze Broadway was good in the movie, but did she really needed to be a Stifler? I've been saying that for a while now, she's not the worst Stifler, the one in The Book of Love is by far the worst one, performance wise, and character wise, but man, if you had to keep one tradition, just give me some Eugene Levy, for real, he's the best thing this franchise has, he is 80% of the good stuff there is in the spin off... that was the tradition you should have kept, I couldn't care less if the girl is named Stifler or not. It does not matter.And it's weird, because she been named Stifler is probably the only consistent stuff on screen that keeps reminding you, that you are in an American Pie film, there is literally nothing else.Into more specifics, the story is so predictable... 30 minutes into the movie is crystal clear which girls is gonna stay with which guy, there are no surprise here, nothing that keeps you wanting to see what happens next. And that's it, the jokes aren't funny, I didn't care for the romance, and, besides one or other sex jokes, and actual sex (with clothes) this feels more like a Disney Channel made high school rom-com, than an American Pie movie. The soundtrack probably is a huge part here too, it's just not good, and it helps the feeling of I'm not in an American Pie movie.Again, I think the acting is fine, the girls are good, they have chemistry together, but they don't stay all together for most of the film, and the story just doesn't hold up. But, as I said, I wasn't expecting much from a spin-off, it just, you know, even tho it isn't a completely incompetent film in all elements, it manages to feel like the least American Pie film, of all the spin-off, and, of course, the main movies.So, yeah, to sum up, the acting is fine, but the story falls flat, just like the jokes, and this just doesn't fit with the rest of the franchise. I'm all for trying to revive the series, and I'll probably watch if there is another one in the future, this just doesn't feel like the right way tho, if that's the formula we are gonna go with now, the franchise is just better staying dead. Let it rest.Some bullet points I couldn't fit in the text:The lacrosse callback is cool (this might be the first one since American Weeding to have that)I know the series has some screwed up scenes... but the dude casually starting jerking off, while his roommate is right behind him is SO WEIRD. It might be the most unsettling scene of all the movies for me. Who does that?!!The dream scene with all the drawings is weird, it just doesn't fit.Who still takes pictures with flashlight?What the hell was that scene with their parents and the hoses...?"}, {"id": 42, "text": "The movie is pretty terrible .. not sure how this fits In with the other American Pie movies, very disappointing although watched it through."}, {"id": 43, "text": "10 minutes into it and I turnt it off.

However it most certainly did not feel like an American Pie film. Nothing compared to the previous 8 films. They basically tried to clean everything up. And try to deliver the sex scenes in the most non revieling way. And the worst part is that you cant say that its an American Pie movie without Mr. Levenstien.

That entire AP spirit is out the Window. Yes it contains sex, booze, parties, awkward situations but without that AP spirit added to them. Not Even Stifler featured in the movie who is a Female, is like Stifler, Even Eric Stifler was more of a Stifler than her. Its ruined.

Has connections with almost every one. A Daredevil , doesn't need a wingman unlike the movie lol. Her energy as stifler seem very dull and boring. What's actually funny is Michelle and Kayla has more stifler Tendencies than the actual character Stephanie.

Almost every aspect of the movie (music, animations, theme) steer away from the franchise. Even if it didn't share the American Pie name, it was still a terrible movie. Very predictable. It attempted to be a female empowering film that ended up depicting women as sex crazed zombies with only one goal and are willing to be petty, jealous, and backstabbing to get what they want.

It's a really cute and funny teen rom-com. So, while I don't agree with the current low rating here, I understand why. This cute story would have served itself better by not trying to tie itself into the American Pie franchise. It could have, and should have, stood on its own. It is a really cute movie, but not a classic like American Pie! So putting America Pie Presents at the front of the title, and making one of the main character's last name Stifler (the only one with a stressed up-front last name) was reaching as well as unnecessary and self-deafeating! If you like teen rom-coms, I do recommend watching the movie for its good story and acting, but divorce it in your mind from American Pie. It's not a fair comparison."}, {"id": 75, "text": "It's nice to see a American pie movie where it's the girls turn to rule.

Each time a character makes a critical decision of something its completely stupid as it doesn't work in the context provided in the film, for example when kayla gets back together with her 'boyfriend' it doesn't make any sense at all, she's emotionally manipulative, invasive and obnoxious throughout the whole film and just because she cries after they hookup in the library she gets the guy cause...he feels bad? Or for some reason he still likes her despite violating his trust by taking his phone and messaging a random girl that he has an STD which ends up being told to his mother?Each character is extremely entitled in believing they deserve love but its never deserved AT ALL. But for me the worse scene was the ending, it was something out of a low-budget 2012 romance film. All of the students in the morp all hold up their phone with a candle on it as they part ways for the main love interest to enter, they kiss and eventually end up in a made-up mini love shack where they eventually have sex. It slowly pans to each character doing the same as the film ends...just like that, it just ends right there. The credits scroll by as it shows people dancing. What kinda ending is that? Very abrupt and stupid.

If you didn't, don't watch this but don't let the fake reviews stop you. This, in my opinion, is the second best Presents film, right behind Beta House. Lizze Broadway as Stephanie Stifler ties with Dwight as my favourite Stifler from the presents films (no one beats Steve). The film takes a lot of the things we love from past American Pie's &amp; adds the modern twist. The chemistry between the 4 girls is the best since Kevin, Oz, Jim, Steve &amp; Finch. The story itself is a little poor at parts but there are some incredible scenes like the opening sequence with Annie (Madison Pettis) which takes some ideas from the opening sequences in American Pie 2 &amp; Naked Mile. The JFK scene with Michelle (Natasha Behnam) The scene after the sex shop again with Annie &amp; Grant (Darren Barnet) walking in/stepping on the control. The library 'what are the odds' with Kayla (Piper Curda) was the heart I love to see. Going back to the roots with a pact before prom &amp; some lacrosse scenes was a nice touch. There was a similar feeling to Finch &amp; Jessica at prom in this but with Stephanie &amp; Emmett, which in some ways feels weird as a Stifler but I have to take each character differently. I just wish there was a surprise cameo from Eugene Levy to keep tradition, that was one let down but overall this film holds its own with the rest of the presents films &amp; I highly recommend it if you love the series!

So what it wasn't about a group of guys, didn't have the naked women. But it was hilarious, had the same stuff the original just a different way of putting it. I mean come on get over it; it was a solid addition to the American Pie franchise."}, {"id": 119, "text": "So I will be the first to say it. This movie is not as bad as it's been made out to be. I will clear up a few points before I start though: 1. The execution of the story wasn't great 2. The casting was mixed. Good and bad choices all round. 3. It has the American Pie name, but apart from about 5% of it, it's not really American Pie at all. So the story starts off pretty shaky. You don't really get a feel for any of the characters, there's not really any character building other than basically naming some people, which is useless until you get to the Stifler girl. The characters feel pretty empty and you don't feel like you know or care about them at all. There are a couple of boring/annoying characters too and for me that didn't change throughout. For example, Kayla and Tim were probably the most uninteresting and useless characters of the whole film. They didn't feel believable, they weren't likeable and their acting was awful. We move on to Annie, the 'main' character if you will. At first I didn't feel like much was going on with her, but I do think that's partly the execution of story/script. Annie for me became the most likeable character, and actually the most believable in the end. The next girl, Michelle, was pretty boring, and the character's interests were pretty ridiculous ( she masturbates to speeches from John F Kennedy) although there were a few funny(ish) moments from her. Stephanie Stifler is the next girl. She's got high expectations to live up to as she's obviously a Stifler, but I found her to be lacking in the deliverance of the character. I will say though, she was probably the most likeable Stifler of the series after Sean William Scott. Grant was the main guy that all the girls were after, and to be honest, they could have cast him better. I didn't feel like actor really had much going, maybe its the script/story, but I didn't care for him at all. The story was all over the place at first. Like I said with the characters, you didn't feel like anything was going on in the first place, no connection with them, not much to feel etc. However I feel like it redeemed itself like half way through, where they started to develop the characters a bit more. All in all I didn't find myself laughing as much as I thought I would. I feel that the moments that they tried to use to make you laugh were just sex related, or swearing, but it just didn't work for the most part. Overall I think the premise behind the movie was good, but the execution was just not as it could have been. The casting was good for the most part but awful in some areas. They stuck the American Pie label on it, but other than the School, and Stephanie Stifler character (and the mention of band camp) there wasnt anything else really American Pie-esque. There was no nudity, the humour was either a bit forced or not very believable, although better than some of the other american pie spin offs. I think if you go into this with low expectations and don't think of it as an American Pie film, its not an awful film at all. Would have I felt ripped off going to the cinema to see it? probably yes, but as a free viewing on Netflix when I can't be arsed to watch anything else, its a quick watch that isn't awful, so I've given it a generous 6/10"}, {"id": 120, "text": "All the other American Pie (and American Pie presents) are teen movies in what I consider the good way, they explore sexuality in teens with, yes, a bit of teen drama, but I feel like this opus is only teen drama, I mean the obvious Stiffer ending up with the nerd guy who help her getting info on Grant is so obvious and such a clich\u00e9.

This movie was a cross between 'Shes All That' with 'Blockers' (a bet was made to have sex). The other three main female leads I did not recognize the fourth I did being Madison Pettis and for a couple of minutes it was a bit weird to see the little girl from 'The Gameplan' (with Dwyane Johnson) in a movie franchise that is known for sexual innuendos among nudity.

For one to enjoy this movie, they must enjoy the other American Pie Presents movies (I'd say this is closest to Band Camp), while also not minding the movies straying from their roots, but also enjoy girl centered romantic comedies.

But i honestly found all spin offs after that to be quite good, even the lastest book of love was fine. It WAS the weakest one among them i believe, but still viable, and i was okay with that calling itself an american pie spin off, because it sort of had something from it.This movie had a big fat NOTHING... It must be someone else entirely that created this movie. Someone who just doesn't have ANY IDEA what american pie is all about..And i would like to add.. I know many things are hot topics right now with equality and such, but damn how ALL of that equality ruins movies.. just because a girl CAN play any roles just as good as guys, doesn't mean they always should.. Nor should guys play the famous female roles.. It just doesn't FIT..This seems like a clear attempt to show that girls are just as good as guys and blaa blaa, and while they ARE just as good as guys, this just makes them seem worse, because it STEPS on a famous movie name and just ruins it completly.For all the people that respect woman just the same as they respect men, this is having the opposite effect of what it's supposed to.. And i highly doubt the people that think girls are less than men, change their minds over this crap either.

(Man, how i miss the good old days where i saw the original ones for the first time, what glory days that was, to experience something like that :3)"}, {"id": 147, "text": "First off, let me start off by agreeing with the majority of folks here. This is not an American Pie movie as you would understand it.For generations now, American teens have had the awkward sex comedy film, complete with relatable tropes. Seems that every decade we need something to help young men laugh at the awkwardness of puberty and for people who've been through it to cringe retroactively. A young man is cursed with raging hormones and a gangly awkwardness and lack of social skills that makes approaching someone and saying please allow me to insert part of myself into you extremely difficult.This movie for various reasons follows a Four Horsewomen team of brash Joan Jett-like tough girl Stef Stiffler, Sexually Active In A Relationship Kayla, Debate Team Future President Lovable Chubby Michelle, and Still A Virgin Holding Out For Mr. Right For Her First Time Annie. They end their latest break bemoaning their problems and make a pact. By Homecoming they will meet their sexual goals. If this was a typical sex comedy the goal would be get laid but that's really easy for most women so it's make your first time special with the man you love, find a guy who treats you right and so forth. Right away we're not lookingat a sex comedy, it's a rom com.It's hard to genderflip the sex comedy, because the vast majority of women have the opposite problem, namely that they're constantly bombarded with sexual interest but not necessarily by the top guy they want.Which is why, by definition, this turns into a girl power movie where the girls are not happy with the sexual attention of adults, creeped out by being ogled by the majority of the school's male population, which they deem to be rats, I think part of the invective against it by most reviewers here is that male-oriented ones speak to the problem of starvation and by that metaphor this one is all four of us want the last slice of cake, whatever shall we do?Because eventually all four realize that to satisfy their pact in the way they imagine, it's to get with the just-transferred-in-the-last-semester-of-school-ever Adonis named Grant.The biggest problem with the movie is that movies really thrive on the concept of a character overcoming a problem, and the other three just simply decide to settle. Disturbingly, for all the movie crows about getting rid of patriarchal interference in what's messaged to girls, see if you can guess which player - the rowdy sexually aggressive girl, the relationship-sex-three-times-a-day girl, the chubby awkward one with a literal foot locker full of sex toys, or the sweet, virginal intact good girl is the one who gets the prize of the best guy at the end. This isn't a spoiler, they practically ship the couple from the jump.What would be a better movie is one that speaks to the genuine awkwardness girls face. Except that it would probably involve menstrual gags, period-induced diarrhea, physical mishap and so forth that no censor would allow onto the screen. The suggestion of Judge Reingold's character in Fast Times engaging in self-abuse at the sight of a girl is one thing. A visual gag involving a very real world problem of... how can I put this delicately... will it fit? was scrapped.I am waiting for a film that my female friends scream at the screen going YES YES OH MY GOD YES UGH CRINGE but so far that hasn't happened. Though the director sought out female writers, female assistant directors and so forth and built a soundtrack out of you-go-girl all girl acts, if you're going to do a sex comedy, it needs to be less Bananarama and more Wendy O. Williams. (Not the talk show host, the lead singer of the Plasmatics).I want that film to be made, for the next generation of girls. So far all they've had is someone trying to pound their square peg into a male-troped round hole."}, {"id": 148, "text": "Given the title of American Pie there was some anticipation but after seeing the cast and reading the plot description, we would know that this film would not be on the level of the original American Pie films but more so closer to the spinoffs.Even so as a film there are many cringe and forced comedy moments. While nothing is funny and things are over the top. Everything is utterly predictable, from the beginning to the middle and ending. Also unlike the other American Pie films (originals and spinoffs) there isn't any nudity so there's that.The lead actress was quite solid but apart from her, the other women were at times hard to watch and tried too hard in being funny, where it came off as cringey (especially the character of Stifler- which was a mistake in making her a Sitfler- it felt completely forced). Aside from that and the school having the same name (and some occasional shots of actual dessert pies) nothing was a connection to the American Pie franchise.

Sure if you want to be realistic all of those women including the chubby one could get laid anytime they want, but the movie is not about it, its clear its about them getting what they WANT, only one of them is a virgin and its because she want to do it with the guy she love.I really had a good time and i do think the movie worked well for what it wanted to do. Its crazy it took that long to have another present, i really enjoyed the 2010s when those movies will comes every 2-3 years. I really wish they do another quick.

They also need to stop this DRY HUMPING CLOTHES ON sex scene BS also, just skip it or have it implied. Someone mentioned sexual conversations, there literally were NONE, they literally just made a sex pack, they didn't talk about anything. LBH these girls have no issue getting laid, the issue for women is giving the right guy the chance, but it's all about physical attraction and in here other people tell each one who was the right one for them cause they ignored them, typical. 2 Stars cause it could have been remotely good, a diverse group of young ladies, but you just totally killed every aspect of what made American Pie good. Honestly the American Pie movies have not been the same after the 3rd movie. These are literally CW and FREEFORM movies now. Hollywood is literally stealing money, if you renting these types of movies."}, {"id": 153, "text": "Taking into account that it brought a little bit of the plot of the first American Pie from 99, with all the eccentricities of the current generation. He kept the douchness without sexualizing the girls who are the protagonists and in a way delivered a very interesting and cute plot of teenagers discovering their sexuality and how relationships in the adult world are complicated just like in the original. I sincerely enjoyed this film very much. I watched without any pretense, with fear of being a failure or even an extremely predictable film, with a boring and exaggeratedly obscene story like all American Pies without the original cast, trying to force a female representation down the audience throat, but sexualizing them. I am happy to say that I was wrong, and I found a great contrast with the original, representing well the sexual awakening of teenagers and how they screw up and everything is fine with that. And I say this as someone who likes VERY much the original movie from 99 and everyone involved in the cast of the original and as someone who adores Reunion until today! Has it the potential to become a franchise like the one from 99? I don't know, maybe not. But if it does, I confess that I'll whatch it with the same enthusiasm that I watched American Pie 2 and hoping to see the characters mature as it was in the original franchise :) Very good, highly recommend!"}, {"id": 154, "text": "So, movie night with the buds has led us on a trek through the American Pie saga, which for now, has come to an end. I can't say any of them are necessarily good, but there's been a couple standouts. However, the last three spinoffs are some of the worst movies I've ever seen, and this one follows suit.I don't understand how American Pie, which, let's face it, is a very dated formula for a comedy film nowadays, is still going on. They can be blatantly misogynistic at worst, mildly amusing at best. That's when we're faced with Girls' Rules, which tries (and I mean that in the loosest sense) to subvert the series traditions by resorting to the oft-ridiculed idea of the all-female reboot. That's not where the problem lies. The problem is that beyond being a whole lot of nothing, unfunny garbage and not veering enough away from the series' formula, the characters actively agitated me as much as the ones found in Naked Mile and Beta House-- they're terrible people, but the movie never acknowledges this fact and they still end up getting what they want, despite being parasites. Piper Curda's plot-thread was especially... gross and manipulative-- her boyfriend breaks up with her (he's never presented as some jerk or anything, so it seems valid on his part), so she pressures him into constant casual sex to get him to...change his mind? But, it's all fine because they get back together in the end. Silly me. Then, in a rather cynical move, it tries to go for a Booksmart vibe, by attempting to be thoughtful and charming, but of course it doesn't work. Just watch Booksmart instead.It was clearly written and directed by men who probably have a thing for high-school age girls, and miserably failing at making something even remotely feministic.I've spent maybe 5 minutes writing this, and that's already too much time I've devoted to it."}], "reviews_amount": 155}
