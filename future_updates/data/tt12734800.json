You won't learn anything from it as from documentary, you might, however, watch it as comedy. It is created as a final try to win a presidency yet again, and probably it helped...

This I watched it again to digest all the conspiracy theories just for my own sake and I felt that my views and opinions haven't changed. This second view was after the 2020 election. Trump and the republicans have totally gone off the rails. Flint is suggesting martial law, 126 senators want to over tun the elections in four states and give them to Trump.

The man has made himself the most available President in history and that is his undoing. Not media. Because people can see him and hear him directly, people can hate him with no fear of spin being the cause. He put himself out there and most people don't like him, his behavior, or his policies."}, {"id": 12, "text": "The claims in documentary have been proven wrong multiple times by multiple intelligence agencies.

It helped me in connecting the historical events to the recent timeline. It provided explanations for many of the Why's that Americans must have. The people interviewed are credible and quite frankly, brave. The negative reviews that state this movie is propaganda indict themselves. To claim the movie is just propaganda without providing any reason why, assumes the readers are just too stupid to comprehend any counter points of specificity from the film. To sling insults without any mention of what exactly they claim are false comments in the film doesn't really constitute a review. In fact, it does more to support the veracity of this film. Everything reported in this film as fact has been proven. If it wasn't, the negative reviewers would have mentioned those falsehoods, agreed? Unless they didn't even watch the film. Instead, they would like to refer to you as, and these are just a few of the reviewers adjectives describing you, should you agree with the film or even watch it for that matter; insane, medicated, conspiracy theorist, ridiculous, to mention a few, so as to shame you for actually watching the film and forming your own opinion.

It is nothing less than a political coup to oust an enemy of the Leftists and other swamp-dwellers and they are completely unapologetic about their lies. So desperate are they to oust President Trump that leaders you THOUGHT shared your views on love of this country are exposing themselves as just more members of the swamp. Seeing this in James Mattis broke my heart, but it shows just how deep this goes. The Bottom line is that you cannot ignore facts. The Left will lie, then lie about the lies...all supported by MSM, Twitter, Facebook and Google. My greatest fear is the hidden Radical Left have been entrenched so long and their agenda so advanced, President Trump may be unable to save this country. He was (is?) the last chance to work this out with any civility....but the Radicals are not civil. Portland was just a blip.

This film explains that as well as reveals what went on with the FISA warrant abuse and spying on the Trump campaign.The film reveals how malevolent and corrupt our govt is from Rep Schiff to the FBI to the CIA. They are rotten and maggot infested to the core. The things being done to ordinary citizens by these supposed trusted agencies is appalling and against the principles of this nation.It's like we're living under Stalin where people are having their lives ruined or are being railroaded into prison for their political views.I don't know how long our govt has been politicized, but it's disgusting. They arrested Roger Stone with SWAT and an amphibious team like he was a dangerous, violent cartel leader. All dramatically caught on tape for effect.

I wish they had included more video clips of senate/congressional testimonies under the oath from the main bad actors (Comey, Strzok, Schiff, etc.) and had gone through more legal documents. I see a lot of reviews calling this right-wing propaganda, and including some of these proofs might have helped open the eyes of some of these reviewers.

The agencies that we depended on failed miserably and are wreaking with corruption. The media, as we know, might as well be a communist state run media. They are so afraid of Trump and all he did was expose what was already there. He will never drain the swamp during his time. The swamp is too deep, too dark, and too corrupt. The Democrats see a push for socialist/communist government. It's always been there but now they are exploiting their momentum. They know the more people that are tethered to the government, controlled by the government, need the government for sustenance, will always vote for them. This has never been about ethics and morals for the left, it's always about power and control. Every scheme they concocted has been proven a lie.

Hence the 2016 miracle or disaster...depending on which side you are on. Trump winning exposed so much of the way America thinks and works. Normal people like us feel as though what happens in the upper echelons of Govt doesn't really affect us. We need to think again. We have given up so much control to our Govt and have allowed the Intelligence Agencies to tighten its noose on our freedoms. Trump will either go in 2020 or 2024.

This was precisely the type of thing he did not want to happen, sacrificing everything to prevent it. And here we have President who was clearly the victim of it. If they can do this to the President of the United States absolutely no one is immune. Doesn't matter the political affiliation, race, gender, religion, or ethnicity. That, more than anything else, should be the takeaway here. Once a Monster is created no one can control it.

Never before have so many half-truths and misinformation been pre3sented as fact without any actual receipts to back up their claims.There is plenty to like and believe about President Trump and feel that his policies are what you stand for and wish to support, but the baggage that comes with that are the lies and deceit which are being force fed and swallowed by a very vocal minority who believe they are the silent majority.This documentary exemplifies all that , and then some.I am not a democrat and have voted republican many more times than not so don't think all negative reviews are simply liberals lashing out. As I said, why focus on conspiracy theories such as this film does when time would be better spent expanding the conservative base with fact rather than fiction.What a waste of time, energy and money making this state film. This is expected in Russia or North Korea, sad state of affairs that this is happening now in America...

Come on, In the last 4 years I have watched The Great United States of America become the complete unreliable, divided and selfish. We brits have a sense of humour but this is way beyond funny. It is sad that the once Leader of the free world is now the laughing stock of the world. It is sad to see. I thought we were screwed when Brexit and Boris were the headline, now you have not just your Orange Leader, the Republican Party leaders have ruined your reputation, health and your economy.All this from watching this Fiction programme.

Some like Trump, some don't. And some really, really don't. For those people, the truth is what they claim it is. It's not reality though. For years the democrats touted the collusion narrative. Adam Schiff was on every media outlet making statements of real evidence existing against Trump and his campaign. However, when the Mueller report came out, that was proven to be a lie. A lie formed at the highest level of what is supposed to be the epicenter of our countries' core values. Truth, justice. We know for a fact that the DNC paid Fusion GPS to come up with lies in order to get a warrant to spy on our own people. We know this. It's not opinion. For years we put up with this crap. Nothing, nothing has been proven to be what they said it was. Not a damn thing.What's so troubling is that nearly half of America believed it without any evidence. The misinformation was so vast that some still believe it. Actually more than just some. Our country should be better than this. Our justice system should be better than this. What was done is pure and complete treason. No matter what your opinion on Trump is, you should want something better for America. No matter how much hate is in your heart, you should want something better. To rise above your own hate. To stop listening to mainstream media when they stop reporting and start propagating for a narrative. It's disgusting to my very core what these people have done and the only thing that might make me feel hopeful is some accountability. Just because you don't like someone that doesn't mean that you can take the law and bend it to your will in order to serve your ends. It doesn't mean that someone is a horrible person just because you don't like them.

I found it hard to once again listen to debunked conspiracy theories put forth by partisan political hacks of questionable character associated with the Trump administration spinning and shifting blame to distract from their own wrongdoing (I've researched multiple sources on all of it). It's hard to believe any of this is fact as you would expect a documentary to document. So, I can say it is a propaganda film just like a Russian government film.The connectedness of the film at times too linking the different conspiracy theories just went off the rails and made no sense on the face of it and was hard to follow. At other times the use of buzz words and phrases once again sounded like perpetrators trying to keep their story straight.Finally, the film quality reminded me of a B rated film at best.I want to give the film a zero as it was a complete was a time."}, {"id": 94, "text": "Trump asked Russia's help to win the election on national TV. And they did. Who in their right mind asks another country to meddle in elections? Tyrants, dictators, madmen, ignorant and cheaters.We have this person who has been a con artist all his life. He cheats, he lies and he steals. He fails at all his business attempts. He breaks records of lies per day since fact checkers exist. He shares conspiration theories and throws accusation without any shred of evidence. All he is is a reality TV star. He sells a brand name, that's it.He hides his academic record and claims to be a genius. He hides his tax returns and claims to be a savy businessman and a billionaire.Just look at Trump's fake university. He charged 35,000$ per person after one conference and gave nothing to them. No course, no follow-up, no nothing. He got sued and was about to lose 400 millions but settled for 250 millions (even though he always said that he never settles when sued).He only ran for the election for the publicity. That's how he makes money. He did not think that he would win and had no interest in running the country. Even if he had lost the 2026 election, he still would have benefited greatly from the exposure. But he won (with way less vote than his opponent) and will be known as the worst president ever.He never cared about democracy and prefers to be friends with dictators from around the world than be friend with long time allies of the US like Canada, France and NATO.Those who rate this a 10 are Trumpists and/or conspirationists.

But they didn't stop there. They used fake evidence and attacked innocent people to try and impeach a duly elected official.When government officials flat out say on News networks that the President of the United States of America has partaken in collusion with Russia and Ukraine throughout his presidency, wouldn't you want to see that evidence? I would. The left media outlets tell the American public they are the only ones who can read you classified documents. Why is that? Is that suspicious? I think so.My take on this documentary is that whenever an allegation or conspiracy is brought onto an individual or president, I want To see hard evidence and where that evidence was sourced from and if it was paid for or not. Real journalism is not stemmed from personal opinions, it stems from facts which were not produced by the democrats in any sense in this situation.I hope everyone has a chance to watch this documentary and has the ability to make their own judgement."}, {"id": 96, "text": "Director witnessed this first hand as she worked in State Department.

As a result of that Intense period researching, I have not been surprised once in last 2 -3 years.I realize that nothing will change opinions- you are on one side or the other. It's become a Pro-America vs Pro-Marxist (and more). But, some people who do not research are confused by what they are being told.The director states she did this so people will never forget.

I get why the major media networks would ignore it. It is very much an indictment if the way that they have behaved in the last 4 years.It is a very straightforward documentary told from the point of view of congressman Devin Nunes. It chronicles his investigation of the various attempts to link the new Trump administration with collusion with Russia in the 2016 election. It also deals heavily with the framing of General Michael Flynn. The film contends that he was a threat to the intelligence community as the incoming National Security Advisor to the new president. It is pointed out by the very people involved how this man was railroaded and how the FBI obtained FISA warrants through lying and omission. The interviews are very straightforward and informative. It is truly disturbing that the beauracracy can wield the power to ruin someone and undermine a president. But the film takes big issue with the media. How the media was complicit in pushing the narrative of corruption and Russia collusion to hurt President Trump. The way that they took any story that would hurt the President and push it without caring if there was any evidence at all to support the allegations. It is truly disturbing to see a media that is supposed to be a watchdog of the government just push whatever narrative that would hurt a president they hated. I wish the film would have gone deeper and explored the story even more.I get that most people's opinions on this documentary will depend on their politics but it shouldn't. What seems to have been done here is criminal and shouldn't matter what party you support to see that this whole thing was corrupt and is the kind of thing that shouldn't happen in a free country. Anyone with intelectual honesty should be horrified.Not be ok with it because you don't like who won in 2016.Grade: B"}, {"id": 98, "text": "The Plot Against The President is a documentary made by a pro-Trump group to promote him in the 2020 elections.It has its opening scene wherein a peaceful transition of power has been taking place from former Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and former Democrat Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. It presents its opening theme as the true hallmark of democracy which is the United States is proud of. Then,it presents an idea that there is a plot against President Donald Trump with regards to the Russian investigation which is an attempted coup against him.Fast forward four years later,we get to see Trump not wanting to concede despite the fact that 24 out of his 24 cases of electoral fraud (so far) have been dismissed at different courts at different states despite the fact that more than 3 weeks after the 2020 elections after President-elect Joe Biden won. No question that Trump's claim of electoral fraud has not shown on courts. What is worse is that with the corona virus pandemic going on that has resulted to 12.3 million Americans infected (so far) and more than 257,000 Americans(and increasing) dying from COVID-19 as well as more than 30 million Americans that have lost their jobs due to the economic lockdown.These events alone prove that it is Trump who is a threat against democracy of the United States and the peaceful transition of power. The viewer does not need to get past the first 10 minutes of the documentary to prove who indeed is the threat against democracy . Evidently,it is Trump himself is the threat of the hallmark of democracy.This alone disproves what the documentary is trying to present and the theories it is trying to promote."}, {"id": 99, "text": "It's a political documentary so there's not much in the way of facts that you can rely on. If the very same story was done by the other side, they would be equally convincing with their point of view.These backroom operatives literally hate each other and will do anything , say anything, lie and cheat and spread bad publicity, to get the results they want.Now, I look at the current story from the point of view of a lifelong socialist who grew up in poverty back in England. A person who had a justifiable chip on his shoulder because of the terrible inequity in English society.Bear with me for a little background before I get to the reviewSocialism was an honorable pursuit in those days because so many of the underclass were treated like beasts of burden. Feed them and water them and you don't have to do anything more.So, I was led to believe that a vote for Socialists would even the playing field, would ease the chains of poverty and develop a more just society.As it took a toehold we saw the introduction of HealthCare, Universal Education, Workplace Reform, Unemployment Insurance and Social Housing... all immeasurably good progressions.Then socialism lost its way; in taking away some of the necessities that are the individual's responsibilities and assuming them for the State, incentive was nullified. This was compounded by the socialist's inability to manage its reforms properly, tax income just gushed down the drains.They got so carried away with their anger at the monied classes that they expanded their programs to the point where it was more beneficial for some to stay at home and do nothing. Eventually you didn't even have to leave home to get your benefits.The biggest weakness was that their anger blinded them to things they could have learned from the capitalists.This picture became clearer as I grew older and realized that I would get nowhere in this life if I just sat on my ass and complained, so I did something about it.I got a good job with the Government with unionized protection, didn't like the way the Union was run, so ran for President and was voted in.It was this seminal moment in my life that I realized that the Union Organization was more cruel to its members in many aspects, than the Employer itself was.The executive were all driven by blind hate. The most radical of them were intractable nutters and after a couple of years of this I surfaced as an unapologetic right winger, they never forgave me for it.This background is just to lead you up to the side I fall on when it comes to reviewing this Doc.Even though I think President Trump and his backroom boys have played some dirty pool (and some of them are real scumbags), I am convinced that the Democrats (and the Press) have been unable to come to terms with his election and would do whatever it takes (legal or illegal) to discredit and unseat him.They are driven by that same blind hate that has driven them from the start and biggest casualty is the country as a whole.With this current sitting, the animosity overrides every decision and it comes through loud and clear in the movie.I really don't know who to believe, there's nobody got up on the lectern and provided a vision for the country or a set of beliefs we can aspire to.It's all he said, she said and a country without a compass."}, {"id": 100, "text": "All the 1 star reviews are incredibly suspect, and should be thrown out as well as the 10 star reviews.
