It perfectly portrays how one lie can destroy everything. This movie makes us realise how difficult it is for a stand up comedian to do comedy when they are sad. Saqib Saleem was fantastic as Deep Sharma. He played his part effortlessly. Saqib Saleem shines in his role. Can't stop gushing over his cuteness. He made me laugh and cry at the same time. He is an amazing actor Also loved Shweta Basu Prasad. Every actor in this film has done the most brilliant job.You can see Saqib grace the screen with his charming presence.

Watch out"}, {"id": 606, "text": "This film full of comedy will entertain you completely. The director has brought the relationships of metropolitan life to the screen on the pretext of Deep and Zoya's story.Media and conservative ideology have also been attacked fiercely in the film. Taking up the theme of 'Go Mutra', the director in the film has also tried to satirize about 'freedom of expression'.In the 21st century, everyone claims to be modern, but when it comes to living in a live-in relationship of a boy and a girl, the high society and people who consider themselves very modern, also show their true colors. Huh. This is the focus of the entire story of this film.ZEE5's one-hour 55-minute comedy Couple is basically a film to attract the youth of the metros who find moments of laughter in the face of problems and tensions.Bikas Ranjan Mishra, Raghav Raj Kakkar, Kashyap Kapoor and Gaurav Sharma write and devlope the story of ZEE5 film Comedy Couple.Constant hiccups arise in this relationship and stability does not come easily. The comedy couple states that the two were raised in a completely different way. While Zoya is a self-sufficient girl made of a single mother (Pooja Bedi), Deep is a young man from a traditional Hindu family, who cannot rebel and adjust herself to the rites of childhood.The good part of the story is that in this, along with the couple, every effort has been made to bring out the changing political-social environment of the country. The film could have been tightened a bit.There are no chances of laughing out loud in the film, but Saqib and Shweta have handled the opportunities of stand-up comedy.A chemistry between Saqib and Shweta is fantastic. In particular, Shweta has flourished in the film beautifully and effectively.She is doing a consistently good job in the web world and this role of Zoya is noticeable.Pooja Bedi has returned to the entertainment world after nine years.Director Nachiket Samant has made Marathi films before this. This is his first Hindi film. Certainly, he retained the Metro feel of the story from beginning to end.He has given the two main characters of his film 'Comedy Couple' their separate zones. For this reason, the entire cast of the film 'Comedy Couple' is actually on its director Nachiket Samanta.ZEE5 film Comedy Couple's story keeps you feeling from beginning to end. The film could have been tightened a bit but this film will tickle the minds of the metro youth."}], "reviews_amount": 607}
