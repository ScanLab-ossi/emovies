{"name": "In a Valley of Violence", "titleId": "tt03608930", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "In a valley of violence is a pretty low key western starring Ethan Hawke as an unlikely hero out to avenge the death of his beloved dog. This part of the plot sounds similar to John Wick but that's where the similarities end. Hawke is a drifter who ends up in a run down town controlled by the Marshall played by John Travolta. He has an altercation with the marshals son who is the town bully and is advised to leave town. Even though he does so he is still attacked and left for dead by the Marshall's son and his cronies who kill his only friend and companion Abby the dog. And from there the story becomes one of revenge. From the opening credits and the music score it becomes clear that the director is a fan of the old spaghetti westerns. The story is pretty basic although what separates this movie from the old spaghetti westerns is that the hero at first tries to avoid confrontations. He just wants to be left alone. Even when he is pursued by a young girl running a hotel in the town. He is in fact not a brave hero but a mass murdering army deserter who left his wife and daughter to enlist in the army and never went back. The Marshall who is portrayed as the main villain also tries to prevent bloodshed till the very end and never actually kills anyone. Even the other villains in the movie are not typical gun wielding psychopaths and in fact most of the people shooting guns end up missing their targets most of the time. There is also some comedic dialogue between the characters as well as great scenes of the dog interacting with Hawke's character. Overall this is a fun western movie that does not go for all out gunfights or bloodshed and yet there is still enough fighting in it so it does not get bogged down in dialogue. Ultimately the whole plot is basic and there is no real reason for what occurs other than the fact that someone was at a wrong place in the wrong time. A nice homage to the more dramatic westerns of the 60s and 70s."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Paul is a man that is trying to leave everything and go to Mexico but on his way he encounters a drunk priest and passes through town Denton and manages to draw trouble to himself. Plot is very well developed allowing you to see that Paul is running away from something and has lost touch with world. After being challenged by Gilly and beating him up we are aware of his strength and capability. Then after being forced to leave town, he was followed by Gilly and his men. Killing his dog and trying to kill him obviously left his in agony and thirst for blood, he decides to go back in town. On way to town encounters priest one more time but he was so drunk that he didn't manage to shoot him so once more he got beat up by Paul. When he returned to town it was a cold blooded shoot out for every men except Gilly, he hang him and beat him eventually leading to Mary-Anne shooting him. Marry-Anne character is also incredible as she is young and wants to be taken care of but falling in love with Paul from the first moment she saw him. On the other hand Clyde, Gilly's father is a marshal that leads town that wanted to peace out with Paul and bring some reason to all and in doing so got shoot. Only bad part was when you are being shown flashbacks from Paul's past that was kind of poorly done and felt wrong. Ethan Hawke as Paul is absolutely amazing with his acting as well as Travolta with some long monologues and great dialogue. Others didn't quite fit and some gave not so good performances. Movie also uses a weird sense for humour it was absurd at times but sometimes gets it. Directing of the movie was fine there were some pretty good scenes with a lot of tension and script is at times amazing and sometimes fails to achieve it's true potential. Same goes for dialogues some were great and there were times when it was hard to listen them mostly because they were silly. Musical score was pretty good and well balanced. 2.5/4"}, {"id": 2, "text": "I like Hawke in this role. He does a good job. In fact the whole cast does a good job.This movie however is just written on napkin. It's like a class for writing where the teacher asks what are the main elements of western and then you tie a thin red string through that. I do not understand why big names are in this movie at all. I thought perhaps maybe there was a national competition and that fresh out of school kids won and that the actors joined up for charity's sake.There is however some humor in this movie. They sort of managed to make traditional western dialogue a bit cheeky. I managed to get through it, but I was questioning why the whole time. 3:10 to Yuma or True Grit are great movies. This does not make the cut."}, {"id": 3, "text": "This movie is terrible. The dialogue is completely incongruous with the 'characters '. Completely predictable, lacking any suspense or interest. The only redeeming feature except to laugh at is some decent music. I can't believe Ethan Hawke and John Travolta made this movie. It is almost as bad as Battlefield Earth."}, {"id": 4, "text": "While this movie isn't as bad as it tried to be, it's still not great.The plot is slow moving and predictable. I know it was supposed to be made, based very loosely, on Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns but it's not even close to that level. Besides, Eastwood never told anyone his name in the movies, you just saw the tombstone.From the time Gilly starts harassing him in the bar, you know exactly what is going to happen. You can predict scene after scene and it brings nothing special to the screen.Ethan tries hard to look the part with his eyes and his gravel voice is decent but as for the other non-speaking action from Travolta to Ransone, it's severely lacking. Travolta could have been a little more convincing if he had tried but this looked like a half-ass attempt at acting in his first western.I don't know what they were thinking with the flashback scenes and it was confusing. He says he left his wife and child but you see a dead woman and child in a flashback. He says he's a killer but obviously he's not in the sense of the old westerns.The flashbacks were so poorly approached that I had to fast forward the movie through them because of the way they were filmed, looking like someone was holding a bad flashlight, it was hard to follow along and try to see what the director was trying to convey.Finally, the cliff scene is so unbelievable it's unfathomable. They throw a man off a cliff and he survives, walking fine, no problems, etc. He obviously hit rock and fell through some brush so you'd think he would at least have a few scrapes and bruises but there isn't anything there to indicate he had been thrown down a cliff.I don't mind the wasted time watching the movie once but I won't watch it again."}, {"id": 5, "text": "This is a waste of good talent. Don't shoot my Dog. Seriously? Hollywood green lit this one dimensional terrible script. Nothing happens except the main characters dog gets shot and killed. BFD. Lets seek revenge for my dog. hahahaAnd nothing else really happens besides that main event. Pointless script. Maybe the director loves Dogs...or just had a limited budget and no funds to write a 2nd and 3rd act and only could afford to use his buddy's stunt dog. Great acting by the dog. Heck this movie might turn into a cult comedy classic as it is so darn stupid. I give it a 3 because at least the camera work is decent.. great music, but what a waste on such a terrible script. hard to imagine why on earth Hawke and Travolta signed up maybe for a trip to New Mexico. Crazy what has happened to Hollywood low budget films. At least Corman did not pretend to take himself serious like this Direct to Video film.3"}, {"id": 6, "text": "Bad script and bad acting. Can't imagine why someone like Ethan Hawk or Travolta would want to be associated with this movie. Did they read the script before hand? Only thing good about it is the soundtrack."}, {"id": 7, "text": "I like Ethan Hawke and I like John Travolta or used to and I love Westerns so I thought I'd give this a shot. Another reviewer said the cast was good but the script could have been written by a Grade School class and that isn't out of the question. They take all the most stereotypical aspects of Westerns to the point where its almost spoofing. It uses elements from every Sergio Leone Wester, High Plains Drifter, First Blood, John Wick and it drives home that point. At times you feel like it's almost laughable BUT the cast is very good. They seem to be taking it very seriously and it makes the film watchable. It might be one of the only movies I've seen that is equally ridiculous as it does serious and entertaining. It has some genuinely outrageous moments and yet you still somehow buy into it. It's almost stunning to watch it unfold.Ethan Hawke is far more captivating and good than the film deserves. He channels a Clint Eastwood stranger very well and a little bit of a back story helps make him more mysterious. I had hoped his anger of vengeance would be a little bit more thorough and brutal but he still serves a purpose and his character is well developed for a story lacking truth depth. John Travolta has a very small role and it's an interesting role because he isn't really the villain but rather a victim of circumstance in this case. His death is hilarious in some sense but the performance is quite good. James Ransone is more the villain as Travolta's son and a bit of a nitwit bully. He's not exactly a worthy enemy to Hawke but he works as a vile character. Taissa Farmiga is a young girl trying to come to grips with losing a husband and becomes enamoured with Hawke's stranger. She is also a victim of circumstance ultimately but her character and the connection to Hawke is interesting enough. Toby Huss, Tommy Nohilly and Michael Davis all have decent small roles in the support cast.It makes a lot of sense that Ti West writes and directs this film. He has a background in really low budget horror and there is so much about this film that would be ridiculed and passed over by a lot of people but I liked it for the brainless entertainment it was. It paid an homage to an age old Spaghetti genre and the performances were much better than the film itself. It has little depth but somehow has a backstory worth watching. It is genuinely one of the best bad movies I've seen in a long time if not ever. As a Western fan you can't help but enjoy it. I truly see it as a respectful tribute to the genre. Check it out but keep your expectations proper. It's not Unforgiven, it's a Saturday matin\u00e9e popcorn flick for adults. 8/10"}, {"id": 8, "text": "Ethan Hawke and his dog ride into a dusty Western town with a population of no more than ten, stop at the local bar for a quiet drink, and Ethan is insulted by a a wan and villainous young man in black, is challenged to a fist fight, knocks the bad guy out with one blow, is warned by the marshal, John Travolta, to leave town and never return, does so, but that night is attacked by the loudmouthed braggart in black and three of his friends, who kill his beloved dog and throw Ethan Hawke over a cliff. Hawke returns and kills them all.That's about all the attention this chimera deserves.But, being a generous kinda guy myself, I'll note that there are two professional performances in the movie. There is John Travolta, who does quite well as the crippled and common sensical sheriff, and the dog. This is the kind of dog that would melt the heart of anyone except the braggart in black and his accomplices. The dog responds to Hawke's comments as if with a fully blown Wernicke's area. He covers his face with a paw when shamed. He goes out and fetches kindling for the camp fire. He investigates strange noises at night without barking, for fear of waking his master. Taissa Farmiga, Vera's sister, is a lonely widow of sixteen. She's appealing in the way that some nineteenth-century dolls are cute but it's impossible to judge her acting chops because the role of desperate chatterbox has her so completely hemmed in.James Ransone as the baddie in black, and Karen Gillan as a housemistress at the hotel, are unspeakably bad. Gillan gives a performance of the sort you might find in a high school play in East Windsor Township, New Jersey, but Ransone is even worse. My God, he's outrageous -- sneering, shrieking, blustering, and otherwise engaging in what's usually called overacting. He's not helped at all by the script, which introduces some romantic comedy exchanges about pregnancy into what is otherwise a thoroughly dramatic situation."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I saw an early showing of this film many months bock, and can promise Everyone... if you like Westerns, even just a little... You Will enjoy this film as well. I walked into the theater not even knowing what to expect (as it is with most early previews of films), just having a basic idea that its going to be a western, based somewhat on revenge. I almost decided not to go too... but damn, I am glad I did. It moves at a decent pace, had really good characters, and even months later I still think of random scenes from it. There has been an increase in westerns lately, most being pretty good, and this one is no exception.\ufeffI decided to write a review about it now because I honestly want people to go see this film and help it be a success. All the actors in it do an outstanding job, and the story keeps you entertained the whole time. Remember, I saw a early cut too... so it may have even been improved on by now, though even if it hasn't it wouldn't matter, its a great film regardless."}, {"id": 10, "text": "I've seen worse, but the only things that I found truly entertaining about it were the dog and Taissa Farmiga (what a doll).I felt that the movie teetered back and forth between being serious and being a parody - without really accomplishing either one. When the plot called for a truly gritty, violent scene it was played out in a way that made it seem awkward and uncalled for.It had its moments, but they were rare and left me with a sense of dissatisfaction - sort of like when you really want to sneeze and it never really materializes (G rated analogy) I wouldn't consider it a TOTAL waste of time, but set your expectations to about the C+ to B- movie grade scale and be prepared to endure a lot of womp womp moments."}, {"id": 11, "text": "I don't know what movie did the other reviewers saw. What I saw was an oversimplified, uninteresting and predictable plot, and bad acting (maybe Hawke and Travolta did what they could with the bad script, I don't know, I just judge based on what I watched). There was not a single time during this movie when I cared about any of the characters (that were, as expected, very underdeveloped). Most scenes were hard to believable, and for moments it looked more like a black comedy than an action/thriller.Maybe you don't have anything else to watch, but if you do, just pass on this one."}, {"id": 12, "text": "A decent spaghetti western, don't overthink it. As other reviewers have mentioned it is entertaining."}, {"id": 13, "text": "This film tells the story of a lone man who travels around with his dog in the cowboy country. The lone man stumbles upon a town where the son of the marshal picks a fight with him, leading to a series of bloody revenges.In a Valley of Violence has a very simple and linear plot. The lone man is aggravated, there is revenge then more counter-revenge. The simplicity of the plot means that the pace is quite slow. I find the first half rather uneventful and lacks excitement. The second half picks up and is much better. I like Ethan Hawke's calm character, standing up to the son of the marshal, who is the local bully. The local bully evokes disgust as he is very unlikable.I am not usually a fan of Western films, but In a Valley of Violence is alright to watch."}, {"id": 14, "text": "I liked this film, I thought the timing worked well, the build up of tension worked well in most scenes . The acting is decent, not sure why someone on here would say otherwise, my favourite character was the girl, Mary Anne,I liked her humour and compassion for Ethan Hawke. I also thought the overall humour worked well. I admit I'm an Ethan Hawke fan,but I don't like everything he's made.I'm not usually a western fan either,but somehow this pulled it off for me. I found myself wanting to watch it to the end. I was surprised to see Karen Gillan in this role, she usually does science fiction. So overall I think you could do a lot worse than watching this on a Saturday night, I enjoyed it,and i'm fussy !"}, {"id": 15, "text": "Paul (Ethan Hawke) is some specially trained soldier who has deserted his wife and daughter for what he has done to run off to Mexico with his dog. He makes a pit stop at the town of Denton where he is forced to beat up Gilly (James Ransone) the town bully and deputy and also son of the Marshall (John Travolta). Then through a series of circumstances this becomes a formula, clich\u00e9 filled revenge film. Paul gets the help of Mary Anne (Taissa Farmiga) a talkative girl who has a thing for him. Karen Gillan who is top billed has a smaller role as her sister and girlfriend of Gilly.This is not a great film, although I found it strangely entertaining, like watching a train wreak. The characters were written poorly and I wondered how these top names were coerced to make a film I would expect to see Eric Roberts. Ethan Hawke spends the entire film in a mental fog. The final killing was a formula twist that I saw coming from 30 minutes into the film. And what was with the dishonest preacher? (Burn Gorman) Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."}, {"id": 16, "text": "With In A Valley of Violence, Ti West takes the plot of John Wick and turns it into a western. Although this isn't as ultra-violent as the Keanu Reeves vehicle, the story is identical. Local boss' son kills the bad man's dog and the bad man gets revenge by killing everyone in his path. In this case, the reason there isn't such a huge body count is laughably because the town of Denton literally has only 9 residents living in it: the Marshal, his four deputies including his son, the two women, the bartender, and the general store manager. Oh yeah, and there's a preacher roaming around somewhere out there. Yeah, I know, quite silly. But silliness in this homage to spaghetti westerns is part of what makes it so enjoyable. It gets pretty intense at times too; it's by no means a comedy. What can I say? This is no Unforgiven but I enjoyed it all the same. If you like westerns and also like films that pay respect to film history, check this one out. You won't be disappointed."}, {"id": 17, "text": "the writer/director of this film has made other films but you wouldn't think so. The dialogue was so painful it became almost unbearable at times. My ten year old could have written a better plot.The characters are so obvious and the plot so simplistic that this spaghetti western clich\u00e9 could have made it except nothing worked, it was silly to the extreme.I will be keeping my eye out for this director in the future and made sure i have something else to do on that day like paint the front fence, wash the car, or mow the lawn. What i fail to understand is how did someone get funding for this film? I remember a few occasions when i seen a really silly movie, but this one just breaks all records for silliness."}, {"id": 18, "text": "This is one of the worse movies I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. Poor dialogue, poor acting, poor cinematography - it fails on all accounts. Imagine a high school play performed by amateurs with stilted, ungainly dialogue - that is better than this movie. I like Travolta and Hawke. They are both fine actors but this piece of crap makes them look bad. Whoever wrote the screenplay should be flogged. Even if you could fast forward the movie at 3-4 times speed it would still drag. I watched it to the end hoping for some glimpse of competency, some chance of redemption and was disappointed. If I paid to see this I would demand my money back. This is not worth watching even if you are bored and nothing else is playing. Stay away, stay far away."}, {"id": 19, "text": "A drifter is left for dead and returns to the town that wronged him and his dog.After a spate of disappointing low budget westerns including two featuring Scott Eastwood, In the Valley Violence is entertaining crafted with care. While it's no Hateful 8, Unforgiven or Tombstone to name a few, known for his atmospheric horrors director Ti West offers a solid off beat modest Western. With opening credits that are reminiscent of Sergio Leone' Dollars trilogy and story beats which echo, John Wick and Rambo, West offers a Western in the vain of High Plains Drifter. It's a dusty grim dead silver mining town, there's no hustle and bustle. It's a low key affair with a small cast including John Travolta as a tough mediating marshal who steals the show. Burn Gorman is notable as an intoxicated Priest. Ethan Hawke's Paul is quite fleshed out, wanting to forget his past and get to Mexico. His dialogue with Taissa Farmiga's Mary-Anne rings true. It's really a James Ransone's Deputy Gilly Martin versus Hawke's Paul rather than Travolta versus Paul yarn. Abbie (Jumpy) the dog deserves a mention. Karen Gillan is worthy of note along with Eric Robbins' cinematography who masterfully frames the makeshift town.Although past West collaborator Jeff Grace's score can be intrusive it oddly works better when it's not channelling Ennio Morricone. Bloody and violent in places with a few shoot outs, a hanging and slit throat, Grace along with West build some effective tense moments and to Ti's credit he also offers some humour that gives In a Valley of Violence a refreshing push.It's a pity that West's marked as an army deserter Paul, didn't emulate the Man With No Name rather than try hard to avoid clich\u00e9s as the homage in context of the tale may have elevated the story more and satisfy fans looking for a resurgence of the Eastwood style.While it's paint by numbers stuff and won't shake the genre, it utilises the emptiness in contrast to the big budget Westerns and wisely makes the small cast ensemble and empty town part of the story. Recommend."}, {"id": 20, "text": "I've got to ask - were people watching the same movie as me. To put this on a par with John Wick is stretching it to the nth degree of extremity. OK there was a dog and there was violence, you can also add it was also made into a film, whey-hey. The acting, at best, was second rate. the plot had more holes than a sieve and the attempted humour was dire. I don't know how much John Travolta was getting for this 'cameo' but he must be laughing all the way to the bank, apart from Ethan Hawke, i think the rest of the actors were rounded up from the casting couches of 3rd rate commercial extras. The biggest load of rubbish I've seen in a long time. More entertainment watching a house brick sitting in a wall, garbage from start to finish :0("}, {"id": 21, "text": "I liked the post Spaghetti Clint Eastwood westerns of the late 1960's and early 1970's. This movie deconstructs those stories and presents you with real characters. This movie fleshes out real people from those movies as I would expect to meet them: the Preacher was from 2 Mules For Sister Sara was nasty and mean while the man with no name reluctantly gives a name. Ethan Hawkes character is not just a loner, but also lonely with a haunting past. The gang of men who try to kill him as in the movie Hang 'Em High are fleshed out as readily manipulated men with a mean guy who is the son of the Marshall. The Ethan Hawkes character comes back for vengeance is not the man who wants to paint the town red like High Plains drifter, but a man who wants to kill only those who killed his dog, a true companion that has personality and charm you care for. John Travolta's Marshall is perceptive and brave, the antithesis of the sheriff in Joe Kidd. Yet it's Taissa Farmiga's character Mary-Anne that steals the scenes she is in with a strong female character (not a version of a woman playing a man's role) that is distinctive from what I have seen in a movie. There was humor and intelligence with a restraint of no guns being fired until the 3rd act. This is not a great movie (few are) but it took me into an interesting relatable world (where many movies fail). It deserves a wide viewing and not the current low rating."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Don't waste your time watching this movie just because Ethan Hawke and John Travolta are in it. It is a very badly acted and cheaply made movie that has been poorly filmed. The story is very weak and doesn't have much to offer. I have no idea why two major Hollywood stars would choose to act in this especially when the story is so poor and gives very little value to the viewer. The movie tries to be a western but fails miserably across the board, including script, shooting and acting. Even the color of the film could have been more like a typical western movie with a some simple editing but unfortunately they didn't do that. I assume it is hard to put some effort into creating a great looking film when the script is almost worthless."}, {"id": 23, "text": "i admit that i have not seen all the films ever made, but, i am 64, quite a movie fan, so i saw my share of them, and, this one my friends is the worst or among the worst. in the seventies there were all those 2 a dollar Italian spaghetti westerns, none of them was as bad as this In a Valley of Violence. the directing was descent, the actors acted, the director directed..... i never saw such bad acting, never, i understand that Vera wanted to introduce her sister to the world of cinema, but she missed the point i think, as no one will remember this film. do yourselves a favor: don't watch this garbage. watch some boring stuff on TED, at least it's free"}, {"id": 24, "text": "Me and my family loves western movies and was looking forward to seeing a western the evening before Christmas.

I believe that the same amount of American dollars could have been spend and with a much grater result if the story and acting would have be taken care of..

Back to the roots of spaghetti westerns, but the movie itself lacks a bit of je-ne-sais-quoi. The story is very predictable with the good retiring killer meeting the bad villains in a terrorized city in the middle of nowhere. And of course at one point there is revenge.

I was not disappointed.... Karen is an actor who suffers from what all poor actors suffer from...The character exists in the head but the face and actions portray nothing of depth and so all we see is a person in a costume, speaking words a writer has provided, without any realism whatsoever. A one-dimensional character with NOTHING behind the eyes. (Having been a Director myself for many years, I've seen my fair share of 'nothing from the neck upwards' performances). As to the film, is it whimsy or a serious attempt at bringing a revenge story to life? I'll leave you to decide that. I wanted to comment on Ms Gillan's unbelievable acting ability...and that is said NOT in a good way. All she does is spout words, guess what....yes...in a petulant (again) spoiled brat manner. You see, performing in a Theatre production can be compared to a surgeon working with a scalpel, TV and Film work (for the actor) can be compared to a surgeon working with a laser...it HAS to be soooooooo precise as the audience are so close to all the action and the face is in incredible close up. Karen Gillan can be compared to a surgeon working with a machete...clumsy, ugly and creates a bloody mess. Not that Ms Gillan is physically ugly....Certainly not but she is awkward and obvious, there is no precision, no finesse, no belief in who she is conveyed to the audience. It's my belief that she was so popular in Dr Who because she was written to play somebody who wasn't afraid to answer back, to ignore others' thoughts and push her own forward, men were idiots and beneath her. In THIS film the only difference is that she daren't speak out too much for fear of abandonment. Anyhoo....I say  Good Luck  to Karen Gillan with her career as a model.

Yes, both movies cross in this tribute to the seventies western, where the killer's father - here John Travolta - and the hero have some kind of mutual respect, and the father disaprove his son behaviour. And that won't prevent them to fight against each other in the end. That's my own opinion. I love the opening credits, another tribute to Saul Bass. Very sixties."}, {"id": 38, "text": "The half half has some promise.It just gets a little boring after awhile.There's little character development from the main character.

It's cheap thrills. It's disgusting.I am tired of renting movies, only to find out that any cute animal in the film is going to be brutally killed along the way, simply as exploitation. I think why it galls me so much here, is that I saw the opening, and the cute dog, and then the titles, which FEATURE the cute dog running around being cute and doing tricks, so I figured they wouldn't feature the dog if they were going to cause it harm. Stupid me.Generally I refuse to watch films with violence to animals, on principal, but I never heard of this third rate direct-to-video cheapie, and I thought maybe it would be OK. I was wrong. It is not OK.It's basically an attempt to remake one of those cheap, spaghetti westerns of the 60s -- right down the titles, which are an homage of 60s style -- but update the flippant language and graphic violence to the present day. Frankly, I never much liked spaghetti westerns in the first place, but at least 50 years ago, the violence was cartoonish.Here its buckets of blood, slashed throats and of course -- dog murder.It doesn't make things better that Abby (Jumpy) is about the cutest, cleverest best trained dog I've seen in films or on TV in a long time -- she could be the next Lassie or something. She steals every scene with and out-acts protagonist Ethan Hawke (she out-acts John Travolta, too, but that's a low bar to clear). Because she is SO adorable and the camera (and crew and cast) clearly adore her....they focus on her so much, she stops being an animal and becomes the film's HEROINE....only to see her brutally killed in a sickening way.I'm sorry folks, but that is not entertainment. And I won't pay for it or watch it (by choice) and I will tell anyone in hearing distance to stay far, far away from this pathetic piece of garbage. No surprise this went direct to video. And how desperate are Ethan Hawke and John Travolta, who used to be A-list actors? They are a bit older, but look fine -- they clearly could do better stuff than this. If I were forced to this level of degradation in my career, I'd hang up my spurs &amp; retire. 2 stars solely for Abby (Jumpy) giving an Oscar level performance, and to her trainer. What a sweetie! I'm just sorry I had to see her in this, and because I will never see her parts in this film again, because this film is an abomination that will never enter my home again."}, {"id": 40, "text": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS - Absurdism at its core is the belief that human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe. Anything can happen at any time and there's no discernible reason why it happened.That is very much this movie. The events that occur in this movie, the dialogue that is said in this movie, the relationships that exist in this movie sometimes make no sense to the audience. Why are these characters friendly? Why in the hell is there a casual conversation happening during a gunfight? Why start killing people THAT VIOLENTLY over a dog? Who is this random priest character and why does he come back?! These were questions that I had throughout this entire film and frankly they will never be answered. That being said, this was one of the most fun Westerns I have seen in quite a while. Ethan Hawke and John Travolta give great performances as a drifter and sheriff respectfully and have great chemistry when they are on screen together. The other actors in this movie were...not as good. The two sisters' actions were unable to be explained even from an absurdist standpoint with rushed line delivery and questionable acting choices throughout the movie. The sheriff's son and his posse were much better, but sometimes got too caught up in their characters for their own good. In the end, this is a film that has humour, decent action, and handles its absurdity well. But the poor acting by the supporting cast and the overall time (this movie was a solid 20 minutes too long in my opinion) keep it from living to its full potential."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Hollywood reminds us once again what happens to slimy dastards that kill a man's dog. Initially, this heinous act happened in the 2007 Mark Wahlberg thriller Shooter. Next, it showed up in the Brian Cox movie Red (2008), while most recently the hero's doggie was killed in the Keanu Reeves' shoot'em up John Wick. Writer &amp; director Ti West's bloodthirsty western saga In the Valley of Violence appropriates this premise for its slow-burn horse opera graced with fine performances by Ethan Hawke and John Travolta. This far from memorable, low-budget oater boasts impeccable production values. The Cerro Pelon Ranch in Galisteo, New Mexico, where the action transpires looks terrific. Although it is obviously a movie set, the producers have touched it up so it looks like a run-down town instead of a run-down set. Eric Robbins' widescreen cinematography is first-rate. Moreover, he lensed this movie on 35-millimeter film. The pictorial compositions lack interesting angles, suggesting that West helmed the action quickly. The most objectionable thing about this western is the murder of a canine. Mind you, you don't see the poor pooch bite the dust, but discretion makes the violence palatable. The big surprise that occurs 91-minutes into this western is one the last thing you may expect considering the caliber of talent involved. The chief problem with In the Valley of Violence is the loutish villains who pose little threat to our resolute hero. Travolta seems wasted as a lackluster, one-legged sheriff who cannot make a believer out of his rebellious son. The opening credits sequence is an obvious but admirable homage to Sergio Leone's classic A Fistful of Dollars. Our mind-his-own-business kind of hero, Paul (Ethan Hawke of Training Day) makes the terrible mistake when he rides into the mining community of Denton rather than riding around it on his way of Mexico. He clashes with the son of the local sheriff, Gilly (James Ransome of Broken City), and beats the cowardly braggart in a fair fight. Actually, he smacks Gilly in the face with a bowl and breaks his nose. Marshal Clyde Martin (John Travolta of Pulp Fiction) observes that the fight was fair. Nevertheless, he runs Paul out of town because he suspects that he is an army deserter. West provides some eerie flashback scenes of Paul in an army uniform with a rifle. Paul has made his way through the west with a collie mix named Abbie that is his beloved pet. After he heeds Martin's warning and leaves Denton, Paul is crouched around a campfire talking to his Abbie when the vengeful Gilly and his lamebrained cronies emerge from the darkness. Gilly shoots and stabs Paul's dog to death, and Paul vows that he will liquidate all four of them. Gilly's henchmen push Paul off the side of a mountain. Of course, these villains neglect to check that Paul died during his rocky descent. Predictably, Paul survives the fall, and he rides back into Denton. Once back in Denton, our resourceful sneaks into a hotel and catches Gilly's paunchy henchman Roy (Larry Fessenden of Hellbenders) as he is soaking in a bathtub. Paul reminds him about the events of the previous evening before he slashes his throat. Sheriff Martin finds Roy's body and sends Gilly into hiding with two women. Later, Paul sneaks up behind another henchmen, Harris (Toby Huss of Cowboys &amp; Aliens), that Martin has posted on a store rooftop with a repeating rifle, and kills him. We don't see Paul pull the trigger on Harris. Instead, all we see the reaction that Martin has when he hears the gunfire. Meantime, Paul blows a hole through the chest of the third henchman, Tubby, and kills him with this well-aimed shot. The resolution features a twist since Paul doesn't get a chance to kill Gilly as he had promised; this distinction is left up to someone else. In the Valley of Violence is Travolta's first western, and we never see him swing astride a horse. He plays an unsavory character with little steel in his blood. Nobody makes a strong entrance in his oater. West doesn't milk the situations for a modicum of suspense. Presumably, he was struggling to get this western made before either the budget elapsed or the stars left to fulfill other assignments. Unless you are a western completest, you should probably avoid this saddle-sore sagebrusher."}, {"id": 42, "text": "Mistified how anyone gave this a positive review.

If you are familiar with and enjoy the movie 'In Bruges' then this movie is perfect for you because this film implements its drama with dark humor in a very similar way IMHO.

I have several examples of verbiage not suited for the time period, but I will leave that to be experienced by the viewer. Some of the violence seemed to be a little overcooked.

The film reminded me so much of First Blood and John Wick. I believe In A Valley of Violence to be a remake of both films. The cast especially Ethan Hawke, John Travolta, Karen Gillan and John Ransome all gave outstanding awesome performances and I think both Karen Gillan and John Travolta deserve to be nominated for Oscars for their supporting performances in the film. Karen Gillan stands out the most as Gilly's snobby wife Ellen. The film's main antagonist Gilly is truly one of the nastiest characters in cinematic history and he truly deserved to die. In a Valley of Violence is truly one of the greatest westerns ever made. 100 minutes of entertaining, brutality, blood and violence. If you enjoyed westerns such as Hannie Caulder (1971), High Plan Drifter (1973), Mannaja (1977), Django Unchained (2012) and The Magnificent Seven (2016) and if you are fans of Ethan Hawke, John Travolta and Karen Gillan, I recommend this film and I think it's worth adding to the DVD collection."}, {"id": 70, "text": "A fun movie until the dog dies, the rest is buffalo chips.

Yeah, I know, all the clich\u00e9's apply and you could predict virtually everything that was going to happen, but what's so bad about that? Ethan Hawke brings an entirely nuanced and understated menace to the role of Paul No Last Name, speaking surreptitiously to his dog Abby about his past life with wife Cathy and daughter Abigail. We never do find out what happened to them, but it must have been bad. Real bad. So bad the screen writers couldn't mention it. Use your imagination.Watching James Ransone as the idiot son of Marshal Martin (John Travolta) reminded me of how over the top Skip Homeier could have been if he was guided by a modern day director like Tarantino, or in this case, Ti West. Talk about an inability to foresee unintended consequences. Of course, there's no reason our man Paul should have ever come back after falling off that cliff, but hey, he had to avenge poor Abby. What Gilly did was pretty sick, Homeier would have just shot Paul.You know, I like Travolta as a bad guy, as he ages he seemed well cast for his role here. He even managed to put a little cowardice into his role as the Denton town Marshal, pushing 'don't call me Tubby' into a corner and watching as Paul took him out as victim number three. Besides a thousand other Westerns with a revenge motive, this one reminded me an awful lot of Straw Dogs without the bear trap. Take your pick, the original or the remake, they both offered a protagonist who didn't know when to quit.With some of the serio-comic sensibility of 1995's The Quick and the Dead, I thought this was quite the entertaining little Western flick.

However it soon becomes apparent that director Ti West's venture into the Wild West is much more. A rather surreal affair where characters do not act or behave like people usually do in this genre. There's a mild dose of wacky humour that is some times jarring but ultimately compels the audience to keep watching. Much of the humour works and is welcome but some of it falls flat. You can almost see the tumble weed roll by.In a valley of violence could be considered to be a loose retelling of John Wick with influences of First Blood thrown into the mix. Ex soldier wanders the land with his trusty and rather talented dog. He's turned his back on all the killing only to stumble upon the town of Denton. Here he falls foul of the marshals deputy and yes you've guessed it they snuff the poor pooch. Violence then ensues. There's some wonderful performances here. Particularly from John Travolta as the towns Marshal. He has some hilarious lines that are delivered effectively in a way only he can. Ethan Hawke is superb as the troubled hero but it's his dog Abby that steals the show. One scene that springs to mind with a blanket will melt the audiences heart. Support is strong throughout, however it is here where some of the characters behaviour is most jarring. The two girls who run the hotel seem out of place as does James Ransones character Gilly. This is not a criticism as their odd demeanour adds to the films intrigue.I commented recently when reviewing Jane got a gun that movies of this genre are becoming few and far between. So it's refreshing when a movie like this decides to honour movies of the past but yet dares to have its own unique vibe. There is plenty a nod to the greats of the genre. The opening credits and score being the most obvious.I was pleasantly surprised by this film and I don't believe it gets the recognition it deserves."}, {"id": 110, "text": "An original Western with a difference.

He does give quite an effort to shake his nice-guy image, sporting facial hair and doing his best to act tough and with authority, but despite his hard work, he doesn't really seem to fit in this movie. As it turns out, Travolta doesn't appear in as much of the movie as you might expect despite his billing (only one scene in the first hour, as it turns out.) So the movie did have plenty of opportunity to make up for this miscasting. Does the movie in the end work? Well... I guess it depends on what kind of movies you like. If you enjoy westerns, you will probably like a lot of the movie. It was clearly influenced by spaghetti westerns, from the opening credit graphics to the lean and violent revenge plot. The violence does pack a punch at times, and the production values are pretty good for a low budget enterprise. And the movie is never dull.At the same time, there was something kind of unsatisfying about this movie, despite my love of westerns. I think the script is the main problem. While the movie is not boring, it is pretty predictable and slow-moving for the most part; this simple and familiar story didn't have to be stretched out this much. The characters are kind of thinly written, seemingly motivated by base emotion and nothing else. And the movie ends on a note that feels sudden and somewhat unresolved.Since there are very few westerns being made nowadays for western addicts, I think this core group will probably find this movie okay entertainment despite its predictability and other flaws. But I think even they will probably understand why the distributor only gave the movie a small and brief theatrical release before quietly dumping it on home video."}, {"id": 114, "text": "If you are a fan of classic Westerns, you'll find yourself glued to the screen enjoying every minute of this film.

Let's start with the obvious part: Ethan Hawke. He's fantastic, as per usual. I don't think I've ever not been impressed by this guy, and that trend continues here. John Travolta pulls off a solid performance as well, playing one of the most interesting characters in the movie. And James Ransone does the same, pulling off a good ol' western hothead. Personally I don't think that Taissa Farmiga was very fit for this role, but she did her best and thankfully fails to take anything of significance away from the movie. The writing is good as well. The movie builds the characters and conflict for a while before anything of real significance happens, and it makes it all the more effective. It excels at building tension, making the last 40 minutes of this movie just that much better. Speaking of the last 40 minutes, they're awesome. After an hour of solid build up, we are treated with some great western action. It's tense and exciting, yet not over-the-top. It's just right. Overall I really enjoyed In a Valley of Violence.

Damn I'll just go ahead and say it: I was more entertained by this than John Wick (some of that I simply chalk up to Hawke being a more emotional and curious presence than Reeves, personal preference, and beyond the premise and some key moments it's not exactly the same as that).This is no masterpiece or anything, and I don't necessarily think it was trying to be. West clearly loves this genre, and wants to do his own twist on it, which carries some especially graphic violence (if you had trouble with movies like The Thing, don't watch this), and some strong supporting work from Karen Gillan and John Travolta (the guy who plays Travolta's son, the real main bad-guy, is one note but the actor plays him for all his worth).This kind of well-produced, surprisingly and wildly funny straight-faced homage western (especially near the super intense and, as the title says, violent climax, that threw me for a loop, such as everything with the one guy who protests being called by his nickname by John Travolta and demands to be called 'Lawrence') is something that pleases me.

Now it is Ti West's turn at bat, a director known for fringe pictures but, to be fair, this type of film probably qualifies as fringe too.Although a great many directors (including, believe it or not, the great Tarantino and even Eastwood himself) have taken on the challenge of this genre, the truth is that Sergio Leone -- the man who invented the category -- is the only director in history to have fully mastered it. (Have seen the Man With No Name trilogy a half-dozen times so far, and I am not done yet.) Which does not mean -- as the other reviewers have already noted -- that the attempt, even if it falls short a mite, cannot be fun.And this movie definitely qualifies as fun.Hawke is a great choice, at the same time skittish, taciturn, and yet also strangely dangerous.Travolta will always be Travolta. He has been playing the same role since Kotter, and audiences never get bored.The most fun is watching Taissa Farmiga chew up the furniture. Clearly the young lady wants to show the world that she has her sister's acting chops, so she does not merely enter a scene, she attacks it and wrestles it to the ground.In different circumstances, this strange brew might have missed the mark.

It resides In A Valley of Violence, the titular warning to all of us that beside the dust, nothing is going to be pretty.But don't be so gloomy, for this oater is a genre hooter, a tongue-in-cheek satire of the Western generously seasoned with absurdity and dark comedy. From the serious take of Clint Eastwood (think The Good, the Bad and the Ugly; Unforgiven; or whatever) to Quentin Tarantino (think Pulp Fiction and The Hateful Eight), this Valley is temporarily governed by an ambivalent Marshal (John Travolta) and a stoic drifter, Paul (Ethan Hawke).They are bound to clash as the Marshal tries to protect his lame-brained but hostile son, Gilly (James Ransone), from Paul's vengeance. Not so much because Gilly and the resident thugs employed by the Marshal are robbers or even lazy but because they have murdered Paul's ever-so- cute dog Abby (Jumpy).Because that mutt is more adorable than The Artist's Uggie, we shift our sympathy immediately to him and forsake the humans. Talking about shifting realities, the town is set in Texas but filmed in New Mexico, whose landscape thankfully looks nothing like Texas's.Writer/director Ti West, best known for horror films but just as much at home with this genre, has an especially good eye for the contradictions in the Marshal, who is a saint next to Gene Hackman's menacing Sheriff in The Quick and the Dead. But then, our hero Paul has his own contradictions, best to be enjoyed while watching the film, for character development is not West's primary goal.No, he is interested in spoofing the Western while he crafts a blood and guts mini thriller. Along the way we can enjoy Jeff Grace's Morricone-like spaghetti Western music and titles and credits worth of the playful Tarantino and James Bond franchise. He does this all to produce an enjoyable black comedy whose absurdity is in check while its comedy wins the day."}, {"id": 119, "text": "I read some reviews here criticizing this movie as too much of a satire, so I went in with a cautious mind. I surely didn't want a straight-up comedy or a movie that has too much commentary about its genre. I'm happy to say that In a Valley of Violence is played very straight, it's a traditional loner western with a revenge plot.There is nothing quite new here, and you'll see plenty of clich\u00e9s played out. Which suggests that Ti West wanted to pay homage to traditional, small-scaled westerns. So if you want something profound or fresh to challenge your intellect, you'd want to look elsewhere.But there is something to this film. Most of the characters, despite not having much depth, are fun to follow. They have that certain spark to them, most of them are over the top and very on-the-nose. It doesn't reach Tarantino-levels in the way these characters are portrayed, but the fact that this comparison even came to my mind is telling. You don't get that invested in the characters, but you start to enjoy them nonetheless - which is good, because the movie is carried by this weird little group of people. The scale is small, and there are only a few people on the screen, so it's that much more important. Ti West's other movie The Innkeepers had the same element to it, and he just might be a pretty good director concerning characters, making them even remotely interesting when the premise or material doesn't help.Actors are fine. My favorite was Taissa Farmiga, who was a sweet blabbermouth. Even John Travolta did fine, and Tommy Nohilly was good too. James Ransone was absolutely hamming it up at times, which was a nice contrast to Ethan Hawke who played it straight. Ethan Hawke doesn't have much of a range here, and he's not supposed to either, but he always delivers just by his mere presence. He's one of those actors I just enjoy watching, no matter the movie, and this one is no exception. Karen Gillan was certainly having fun with her role, as most people did. Perhaps that's it, the charm this movie had: people were having fun and some of it translated to the screen. Otherwise the movie would have been very dry. Oh yeah, and the dog helped too.There's something to be said about cinematography in Ti West's films (although I've only seen three). There is something intimate and warm to it. Nothing feels pretentious or grand, but at the same time not too familiar either. They're easy on the eye in a lovely way. I hope Ti West makes more films, I'm starting to get interested.In a Valley of Violence isn't deep. It's probably a love letter to simple westerns, and isn't trying to do anything what it can't achieve. For this movie that particular approach works well. It's a simple story about simple characters with some weird charm to it. It's not very engaging, but I found it very enjoyable nonetheless. There is nothing cynical about this movie, even though we've seen this story a thousand times, and it warmed my heart. If you like simple, confined movies and you're willing to adjust your expectations, this might be worth the shot for you too."}, {"id": 120, "text": "In a Valley of Violence stars Ethan Hawke as a wandering deserter, Paul, who happens upon the town of Denton.

He tries his best not to become involved, but soon finds himself gunning for revenge in a town that needs saving.This was a well made Western heavily stylized after many classic Spaghetti Westerns. It had many campy elements, and presented a lower budget sheen that really nails the Spaghetti Western feel. The acting was competently done, with some moments feeling cheesy and slightly comical, and others offering some heart. The direction was solid, with scenes, close ups, vistas and so on handled with care. The story itself was predictable, but far from bland. The relationship between Paul and his dog, Abbey, was especially well done. All in all, this was a fun and campy Western very much paying homage to the Spaghetti Westerns of the '60's and '70's.

I am someone who believes that a movie without one single moment you couldn't imagine after reading a one sentence, or even one word, description of the plot, is a movie you have no reason to watch.How is it that you know the name Ti West? A guy whose movies are as formulaic as these should be directing episodes of Big Bang Theory. But he does do them well, and gives his superior actors room to breathe. The problem is that he writes these movies himself \u2013 if you can call stringing a bunch of clich\u00e9s together writing.This is a movie that is so predictable that you don't notice the genre clich\u00e9s that would have rubbed you wrong in a better movie, i.e.. the main character being the typical hard-bitten and reluctant hero type who doesn't say much, who never intended to draw steel but ended up being forced to. And how about the town being basically just two rows of houses with a main street running down the middle? Is there a saloon with rooms to rent upstairs? How about a plucky young heroine who dreams of escape and thinks the hero might be her ticket out? He doesn't take her at first. Of course.No, it was the smaller details that rubbed me wrong. For example: before killing his first victim, why does the typically terse hero suddenly become insanely verbose, rabbiting on like someone who has truly lost control of himself? What was the point of the speech where he outlines exactly what he's doing as if it wasn't already completely obvious, not only to the audience, but also the victim? And when the bad guy has the plucky heroine up against the wall with a gun to her throat, and he begins threatening her, what does she do next? Her response is engraved in stone, alongside the all towns in Westerns are just two rows of houses with a street down the middle rule, in a tablet enshrined in the Screenwriters' Guild bathroom. When the camera focused on the heroine's determined eyes in the climax, I cringed. This is West relying not only on clich\u00e9, but on the trend of the day: girl power.Having read this far, you might wonder why I didn't give the film a lower rating. The answer is that for all the predictability, In a Valley of Violence has actors who you can't help watching and rooting for, especially Taissa Farmiga, one of the best young actors in the world, who gives this tired material more energy than it deserves."}, {"id": 127, "text": "Life in the Old West was anything but easy, and many classic Hollywood flicks of the western genre paint an explicit picture of this. Fresh out of the indie horror genre with the films 'The Innkeepers' and 'V/H/S' under his belt, director Ti West explores the western genre in this violent revenge thriller set in the depths of Wild West Texas. Tapping in on homages to the old western genre from the Golden Age of Hollywood, this historical fiction piece places two-time Academy Award nominee Ethan Hawke in the dark corners of a vicious revenge plot against a league of evil doers who wrong him -- and it gets pretty bloody. But by the end, Ti West proves himself more than capable to delivering pure grittiness and wit to the slowly fading genre. Set somewhere in the 1800s, the film stars Ethan Hawke as Paul, a lone drifter sprawling across the Texan wilderness with his dog Abbie hoping to make across the border to Mexico. As he makes his way through the old town of Denton, he meets 16-year old innkeeper Mary-Anne (played by Taissa Farmiga) who makes for a good acquaintance. He also comes face-to-face with ruthless deputy Gilly Martin (played by James Ransome) who happens to be the son of the town's sheriff Clyde Martin (played by John Travolta) and boyfriend of Mary-Anne's sister Ellen (played by Karen Gillan) -- and he's not a very nice guy. On that fateful night, Gilly and his monstrous three brothers attack Paul, kill his dog, and leave him for dead. Upon miraculously surviving their attack, Paul sets out on a quest for vengeance.As the title suggests, things get pretty mess and director Ti West does little to sugarcoat the brutality of the man vs. man conflict. Though the plot is nothing particularly original nor does it rise to the level of a sprawling epic, it is greatly empowered by a sucker punch of a script that proves how well Ti West appropriately comprehends the genre. From the opening credits playing in the style of an old 1960s western B movie, to the vintage-style cinematography; the influence of Sergio Leone's classic western film series definitely bleeds through. But the main diamond in the film is the plot which follows lead character played by Ethan Hawke on a brutal quest for revenge against a quartet of morally depraved individuals. And at a fairly solid pace, the film takes its time to develop both the lead character and the antagonist while building up to it's bloody and emotionally jarring showdown that packs just enough thrills and bloodshed to leave the sensitize hearted viewers squirming. Yes, the entire sequence is quite gritty, but Ti West manages to operate the sequence in a fashion that's more realistic than gratuitous Beyond from the nifty cinematography, the biggest star here is Ethan Hawke who exercises his role with pure grit and humanity that makes him truly believable. Predictably so, he is no John Wayne or Clint Eastwood here, but his performance safely stands out. James Ransome delivers a brooding portrayal as the shady deputy who's heart on the wrong side of the moral compass, and the writing plays him out as a villain who is though is devoured with demons, carries a sense of humanity. Young actress Taissa Farmiga, John Travolta, and Karen Gillan all take advantage for their time to shine, but perhaps nothing special beyond performances that provoke a good thumbs up.In a Valley of Violence is brutal, but riveting western piece that proves itself more than worthy as an astounding entry in the western genre. While this film may not rise up the hierarchy of classic or modern day westerns, it is certainly gripping from start to finish. In a short summary, it is a fascinating one."}, {"id": 128, "text": "'In a Valley of Violence' is a movie that absolutely deserves its title as it is indeed violent. With this gritty western-that was shot on real film-director Ti West, who has been making a name for himself in the horror genre with 2009's indie hit 'The House of the Devil' and 2011's 'The Innkeepers,' tried out a completely different genre than what we are used to seeing from him. It's obvious that West is a film aficionado who has seen a lot of movies, studied them and uses his knowledge very skillfully to create something new and refreshing much like Quentin Tarantino does. Still, I couldn't estimate how he would do in the western genre as most of the projects he was associated with up to this point were horror-related. What can I say, West knows his westerns! That is very obvious when you watch 'In a Valley of Violence' and know a couple of movies from the genre. It's as if West combined all of the best elements from 1960s westerns like 'For a Handful of Dollars,' 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'The Wild Bunch' and paired them with the sort of graphic violence that is usually found in horror movies, and it works very well. I'd say it's rare that a genre director's first attempt at a different genre turns out so well as it did here.The movie's plot about a mysterious stranger who passes through a town ruled by a gang of misfits who kill his best friend and leave the stranger for dead is one of the classic western themes. The twist here is that the best friend is a super cool dog who can do spectacular tricks (He bites.). Of course the stranger, who is portrayed splendidly by Ethan Hawke, isn't dead and comes back to take revenge on the hoodlums who did him wrong. The performances from the whole cast are excellent! Ethan Hawke is great in the lead role and James Ransone ('Sinister') is equally convincing in the role of Gilly, the main antagonist. John Travolta portrays the town's marshal, who also happens to be Gilly's father, and it's one of Travolta's finest performances in recent memory. The charming Taissa Farmiga ('The Final Girls') and Karen Gillan ('Oculus') are also very good in their roles as managers of the local hotel. Taissa's character is fascinated by the stranger and helps him achieve his revenge. The direction and cinematography are excellent, as is the film score by Jeff Grace, who has composed and performed the scores for the majority of Ti West's movies, is reminiscent of Ennio Morricone and completes the gritty western experience of 'In a Valley of Violence.' The score combines elements of some of the most familiar themes found in spaghetti westerns and it sounds like it could be straight out of a classic Clint Eastwood movie.I think 'In a Valley of Violence' is Ti West's most accomplished movie yet. I loved 'In the House of the Devil' and especially 'The Innkeepers,' but the latter only grew on me with multiple viewings. 'In a Valley of Violence' convinced me from the beginning an I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. I highly recommend this movie to fans of violent westerns!"}, {"id": 129, "text": "Ti West knows how to make stuff look good. The House of the Devil proved that, and just as that is a full on throwback to 80s slashers this is a throwback to old westerns. But it shares a lot of the same problems as it too. The script isn't very good. The acting is.. pretty bad.. to say the least in a couple of cases, no names mentioned. I do not understand why Toby Huss isn't given bigger roles though, he's an excellent actor and in this just like the American remake of Martyrs last year he only gets a few lines and no real character. Toby Huss is too good for this! The music is great! Kudos to the composer! The cinematography is where I thought Ti West could do something special, the great wide scope of old westerns are beautiful and with his copy/paste-style of film making it should be great, but this feels more like a modern thriller.The story in general is generic, pacing is way too slow, and there's a weird dream sequence lit with, what feels like, a flash light mounted to a hand held camera... That's not western at all. It would look bad in any movie but especially a western.No, save your money on this good people!

It stars Ethan Hawke, Taissa Farmiga, James Ransome, Karen Gillan and John Travolta. Music is by Jeff Grace and cinematography by Eric Robbins.Ethan Hawke plays Paul, an ex soldier accompanied only by his dog, Abbie, who is drifting across the desert towards Mexico. Stopping off in the dying town of Denton, Paul finds trouble that will have consequences for himself and town alike.Ti West is more well known for his horror ventures, where although divisive in that genre sphere, he can be proud of his success rate. Here he tackles the Western, and true to form, he homages past genre masters whilst unmistakably putting his own stamp on things. Opening with credits straight out of Spaghetti Western land, and introducing us to a musical score that will accompany the story that is wonderfully feverish, West is in no hurry for blood and bone shenanigans. He always favours the slow burn and so it proves here.There's nothing remotely new here, it's a standard tale of a gunman - one damaged by his war efforts - who through circumstance is forced to abandon his hope of a quiet life. He's a loner man of few words, thus giving viewers a classic Western character staple, an anti-hero to root for and for us to yearn for him to find peace. When the violence comes, it's sharp and bloody, but often there is humour as well, deftly inserted into proceedings, whilst the canine is skillful and a key character to all and sundry.Perfs are more than adequate. Hawke sifts seamlessly into being a believable drifter type of complexity, Ransome is annoyingly brattish, but that's actually job well done, and Travolta - sporting a wooden leg - gets better once (and if) you buy into him in this setting. Gillan isn't given much to do, but lands some decent emotive punches, but it's Farmiga who stands out as Mary-Anne. She's utterly infectious and thankfully she gets a well written part, that of a young woman trying to hold her own in the most trying of township circumstance.The purpose built town of Denton looks just that!, but this is off- set a touch by the nice location landscapes (Santa Fe, New Mexico), and with the story working from solid genre foundations then this is a pleasure - without pulling up any trees - for fans of such. 7/10"}, {"id": 131, "text": "10/16/2020 This was a fairly decent cowboy/old western movie. Never very exciting but still an OK watch. Taissa Farmiga (Vera's younger sister) plays MaryAnn, the young hotel proprietor and does an excellent job in her light hearted character presentation. Ethan Hawke did a decent job too, but he never comes across as being very real to me. His quirks and facial mannerisms always ring FAKE in my book, but I still watch his movies anyway. I liked his dog better, much prettier too. Travolta (aka Stumpy) was pretty good as usual. The bad cowboy (a Christian Bale wanna-be) SUCKED.

Gilly, a son of a marshal (Ransome as the son and Travolta as the marshal) bullies the stranger and they fight on the main street of the town. After losing Gilly revenges by killing Paul's dog. A final scene is a series of many gunfights. There is some unnecessarily boring periods in the middle of the movie but after these the final scene is good enough.The actors were surprisingly good especially Farmiga as Mary-Anne.

The whole film felt shorter than an episode of the Simpsons, and after all this all happens over the space of a couple of days. The sheer speed in which the movie goes through the stages may well be a testament to the screenplay or editing, not sure which. Much of it especially the first half seemed very clich\u00e9d with the new stranger just passing through a dead-end town. Very reminiscent of the classics of the Clint Eastwood era but with less grit. As enough time has passed since those movies I guess this can now be considered as an ode. Even the soundtrack/coincidental music is comparable to classic westerns. Hawke, as usual, plays the loner well and Travolta can't but help play his part with some wryness. It is just the whole movie passes by so fast I barely apprehended any interactions other than Travolta and Hawke. The film coulda shoulda been longer. Cinematography is nothing special but has definitely been made for the big screen more than home viewing. I was expecting a lot more laughs for this was marketed as being set in a town of nitwits yet the supporting cast were ordinary with the exception of the two sisters who had very attractive qualities and a touch of kookiness.

Bad mistake because just like John Wick, killing his dog means he is now out for vengeance.John Travolta has a supporting role as the Marshall trying to find a compromise but he overindulged his idiot son too much as the town is a hovel and its inhabitants afraid.This should had been a lean mean western but suddenly becomes flabby and verbose when Hawke's needed to be bad-ass.

As far as I'm concerned what he did was perfectly justified when someone tries to kill a pet. The key scenes in this film are Hawke just talking to his dog.

And it could be he's not in the ordinary sense of the word, a good guy.Neither however is Marshal John Travolta whose town Hawke has stopped in. He considers himself ruler of the place where he brought law and order emphasis on the latter.

After Ransone and his friends kill the dog and leave Hawke for dead, Hawke's taking names and numbers.Elements of a lot of good westerns are present in Valley Of Violence. Two Clint Eastwood classics High Plains Drifter and The Unforgiven, the Burt Lancaster western Valdez Is Coming. You might also include the two John Wayne westerns Hondo and Big Jake since both involve the Duke and a dog.

Some unoriginal second-rate screenwriter got away selling a script that a first-year film student could do better. The film virtually steals from three films: A Fistful of Dollars (and uses similar graphics and musical instruments as well lol), High Noon (with almost an identical ending lol), and A Boy and His Dog (who, by the way, is far and away the most talented actor in this film). Travolta is hilarious, with his shoe-polish black hair offsetting the rest of his naturally grey hair. His characterization veers wildly from an almost-convincing first scene (except for the shoe-polish side of black hair lol) to falling back to the traditional wise-guy Pulp Fiction character, with a little bit of Saturday Night Fever (although John cannot dance in this film because we are supposed to believe he has a wooden leg). Trust me, the wood is not in the leg, but a bit higher above the shoulders. The movie officially makes the Top 100 Turkeys of All Time (which is a very difficult list to get on) and has the potential to become a cult film. It was the funniest film I've seen so far this year; and I've seen some funny ones. You really must see it to believe it. By the way, Ethan Hawke was not able to resusitate his career, ala Clint Eastwood, with this Turkey; and Travolta has been flatlined for several years now.

No, it isn't something you've never seen before. It isn't even something that hasn't been done in a long while. This is a Western to its bones and it is truly great and it coming from one of the best horror directors of the decade just adds to the shock that is this film. Starring Ethan Hawke and John Travolta, the film is an addicting odyssey to embark on from the first frame to the last.The film starts with a seemingly innocent drifter (Ethan Hawke) and his dog as they trek across Texas wasteland in hopes to arrive in Mexico. Along the way, the drifter meets every Western clich\u00e9 from the drunken priest to the corrupt lawman and his overbearingly villainous young son but what sets this film apart from other Westerns of this type is its sheer persistence to break from the normative beats of this story. Ti West does an amazing job at incorporating clich\u00e9s just to totally strip them down to nothing you'd expect it to be. The cast here is brilliant, especially a surprise performance from Taissa Farmiga that damn near steals the show.Overall, this is a high intensity Western that is worth every penny and every minute of your time.

Fantastic as Paul, the loaner with the misfortune of stopping in Denton for water and a bath on his way to Mexico with his dog. Hawk is the perfect balance of boyish vulnerability and toughness, whose character is a disillusioned former union cavalryman who has abandoned his family and is possibly a deserter. 2. James Ransone. Pure Villain if he were not so charmingly funny picking a fight with Paul just to get leveled with one punch in the first act. 3. Taissa Farminga. She's beyond ADORABLE. She plays a tough, sharp witted disengaged seventeen year old who runs the hotel at the nearly abandoned silver mining town of Denton and quite pleased to wait on Paul after she's learned that he is the someone who finally put Gilly in his place. 4. John Travolta plays the US Marshall assigned to the town and is father to Gilly who asks Paul to leave town and you'd almost expect Paul to argue the point with him, but he's leaving it anyway, and it's just Classic John Travolta, playing another war veteran and the town's only real grown-up, so sure Paul was leaving anyway. 5.

Either the characters, such as the protagonist, are too gruff and typically beatdown; or like the antagonist, far too cocky and bullish; or like the pretty bathhouse owner, just too damn perky and stupid.How does all of that work in a western? It plays out like a comedy without the humour really. Westerns are my favourite genre so I tried to enjoy this, I let it play through. Something different, the protagonist has a dog companion. Things happen, and he goes crazy.Anyway the plot is very shallow, and in the end not much else is offered to beef the plate up.

Oh dear... With three individuals with three different perspective, it could have been rather better.The score by Jeff Grace, although excellent in places, doesn't know if it wants to be a western or a spaghetti western (overtly Morricone) and gives conflicting messages. The movie is not quite a spaghetti western although, with a few tweaks, it could have been. Some of the scenes with SW music cues play against the on-screen action and invite a sardonic comedy perspective which isn't really justified.Some scenes are comedic although more in the style of slapstick than dark SW humour and, really, not needed.As the movie progresses, the music becomes increasingly SW and the theme of revenge - one of my absolute favourites! - comes well to the fore.But who ever heard of a 'man with no name' called Paul? Oh dear... And the town only seems to have eight inhabitants.Ethan Hawke is excellent but not quite Clint. John Travolta has lost some weight and must be desperate for parts although perhaps the script looked better than the end result.Star of the show, apart from the dog, is Taissa Farmiga who has a wonderful part and plays it well.In all, this is a nice, easy-to-watch action western.

Certainly it's a western - gunfights and horses and a marshal. It often feels as though it wants to be a comedy. The scenes with the drunken preacher wanting to save the town of Denton were humorous, as was a lot of the interplay between the various characters. It's most certainly a revenge story. Paul (Ethan Hawke) is out for blood after the killing of his beloved dog. And don't forget the dog. One of the cutest dogs and most talented dogs you'll ever come across in a movie - it upset me when she was killed partway through. So this is going in a lot of different directions all at once, and yet ... it does work. It's not great. It's not going to win an Oscar. But it works.Hawke was good in his role. He was believable as the lonely drifter seeking revenge after his faithful companion was taken from him for no particular reason. James Ransone as his main adversary Gilly didn't hit home quite as well with me. He was all right. I was more taken with John Travolta as the marshal - who also happened to be Gilly's father. I've seen some criticism of him - suggestions that he was miscast - but I thought he handled the part pretty well, and to be honest I was sympathetic to his character. He didn't do anything. He let Paul off the hook when he could have taken him in after he and Gilly got into a fight to start the whole thing. He told his son and his buddies not to go after Paul - and he wasn't happy when they defied him and did it anyway. He didn't deserve his fate.It's not a lavish movie. The sets are pretty barebones - and the opening credits were bizarre. They reminded me of the opening credits of a 1960's TV show somehow and kind of lowered my expectations from the start of what I should expect. But the movie exceeded those expectations once it got started. I also appreciated that in the end there was no attempt to introduce a romance into the story. Had there been one it surely would have been between Paul and Mary Anne (Taissa Farmiga.) The problem would have been that Mary Anne was supposed to be 16 years old. I suppose in the context of the Old West a romance between them wouldn't have been shocking - but given the current climate in Hollywood, it's probably best that the movie didn't go in that direction. This just turned out to be a pretty decent and interesting movie.

Ethan Hawke plays Paul, a revenger with a past, whose most pressing motivation appears to have been at least partly inspired by JOHN WICK while the film also makes affectionate nod to Italian models. Other members of the cast include John Travolta, playing a Marshall with a false leg.Straight from the pre-titles opening scene, Western fans can relax back in their saddles and say to themselves 'this is how it is done!' as Ti West finds just the right balance between homage, tension, and saying something fresh. Hawke's anti-hero is a complex creation while Travolta's idiosyncratic character works well in a film which, never the less, does occasionally veer too abruptly in tone between the light-hearted and the violent. As a western maker, a director like Tarantino could take a lesson in something which he seems to have forgotten of the merits of stripped-down B movie making, buoyed up by some interesting dialogue, from this. Critics have rightly pointed out that there are one or two weaker performers further down the cast list, but this is not a major distraction and ultimately the result gets a strong recommendation from me.

Well, to be honest, In a Valley of Violence is not as memorably cheesy as The Quick and The Dead or dramatic as Mackenna's Gold. Nor is it as epic as the Dollars trilogy (Which is an unfair comparison). You can say its pretty standard 'new gun comes to town and frees the people from goons' kinda western. Its a cross between Rambo and John Wick but set in the wild west. Which is pretty simple and there's nothing wrong with that. What's interesting is the director choosing such a chocolate hero to play a rugged manly man, a killer at that!Hawke has most recognizably played suave, sleek, urban gentlemen characters. Be it in Before Sunrise and its sequels or films like Predestination, Gattaca etc. Some of his hardcore action movie roles like in Assault on Precinct 13 or The Purge are as cop or an everyday man in unusual circumstances. How he blends into any role with ease is just pure fun to watch. Btw, Hawke plays a civil war veteran, sharpshooter in another western this year; the remake of The Magnificent Seven. I think that's enough horse-riding and cowboy hats for a lifetime worth of career. Also, Happy Birthday to you Mr. Hawke!Watch In a Valley of Violence for the non-stop, all out vengeance driven shoot-em-up action. John Travolta returns as a bad guy but not as an intimidating one. He just happens to be paying the price for raising a bad seed. Its a snappy western with almost Marty McFly in the wild west kind of pace. No time for deeper plot development. Although, there are enough dialogues to paint a decent picture of how the characters think. There are some hilarious moments in there which mostly come from the self awareness of a character's own situation. In all, its not a difficult movie to watch at all plus there's a sweet dog in it!

It also shows that flicks without expensive CGI still can be made and do work out fine. a western in it's purest form.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 0/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"}, {"id": 146, "text": "Believe it or not, this is the western version of 'John Wick'. Same storyline except it takes place in the desert of the old west. A man who had enough killing native Americans, is now abandoned everything and heading towards Mexico for a fresh start. But on a way in a small town, he gets into a trouble. After surviving the assault, he goes back to hunt them all and like most of the western film, the end is predictable.This is not a bad flick, but it was not fresh enough, either its story or the gun fights. With a bunch of decent actors, a decently made film. The characters were limited, the atmosphere was like deserted. So the overall narration was focused on a few characters in its entire 100 minute run. I felt sorry for Travolta, they did not get anything out of him, he just had a presence and nothing else. In other hand Ethan was okay, but his role was designed as an average man in the old west, not a powerful one as we expect in this type of film.The title says it all, but it was not that ruthless as compared to the most of the similar western films I have seen. Mostly it will bring a disappointment for its viewers, but definitely a few would enjoy it for its simpleness. For me, it was an average, but thought it could have been better, particularly in the gun battle. So it's nothing more than just once watchable with a low expectation.6/10"}, {"id": 147, "text": "I have looked in other peoples reviews, if I have to accept that this is an Spaghetti Western then I would have to say that Italians do a much better Western than Hollywood ever did without Italian influence. I'm not Italian, I'm a Uruguayan/Aussie that at 60 can tell when I'm watching unworthy movies or not. Not since unforgiving have I seen a better western. Everyone in this film outdid themselves. Including those I loved to see getting their just comeuppances. Nothing was reduced to silly sentimentality or ridiculous over the top machismo. Just the right touch of humanity and decency. Ethan Hawke, John Travolta, Taissa Farmiga and the rest of the cast were superb. Very few Ethan Hawke movies impressed me much, but I always thought that a good actor sooner or latter stumbles on to a role that shows their true talent. A previous movie that kept me hopping for better from him was Day Walkers. John Travolta, well he has proved many times that he has a better than 50/50 nose for a good movie or he was hunted down when a solid actor was required. Who would have guessed when as young man I was occasionally forced by some chick to watch Welcome Back Kooter, I think it was called. Well I thought the whole show was so silly as to make me cringe with second hand embarrassment. Oh please don't think I criticize John Travolta for his role in it, I applaud any-one who gets paid for doing a TV series and gets paid for it. I'm pretty sure that the J Travolta of today wouldn't take back to such stupid, vapid shows except if he really thought the role would be a blast of fun and humor or even perhaps a gracious repayment to a show that indeed many fans of his liked."}, {"id": 148, "text": "The Writer/Director Ti West Relies on a Tarantino Trope too Heavily and does not have the Writing Chops to Pull it Off and Compares Poorly to the QT Schicht of Long Dialog Exchanges before Bursting into Violence. It is a Weakness so Glaring that it Stops the Film Cold Frequently.This Spaghetti Western Homage does have some B-Movie Charm. Minimalist and Moving in Parts, Funny and Absurd, it uses some Good Low-Brow Actors like Ethan Hawke, James Ransone, Taissa Farmiga, and John Travolta (who almost steals the show).Abby The Dog, doesn't quite Steal the Show but in the First Two Acts manages the Part of Partner/Side-Kick Affectionately and Admirably.Predictable in the Extreme there are No Surprises or Cinematic Flourishes and in a Genre so Well Worn that is a Disappointment. Two Recent Modern Westerns are Examples how that is Possible, almost Necessary, in the New Millennium.

But still, I was given the chance to sit down to watch In a Valley of Violence and with Ethan Hawke as one of the lead actors, I thought that it might actually be worth the watch.And it turned out that In a Valley of Violence actually was quite good. Sure, it did follow that standard blueprint of how-to-make-a-western-movie, but still it managed to squeeze enough contents into the storyline and plot to make it somewhat different than many other westerns.The story, albeit quite generic, turned out to be entertaining enough. Sure, it was simplistic to the point where you could just entirely switch off your brain and still keep up with the movie, but it still turned out to be adequate entertainment.In a Valley of Violence doesn't really offer much new to the genre, nor does it revolutionize it in any way. Director Ti West cashed in on a formula already well-established and well-used in other movies, and managed to make it different enough to work out in favor of this movie.Ethan Hawke actually did quite a good job in the lead role, and it was nice to see him perform in a western movie. He was carrying most of the movie all by himself, and did so quite well. I was initially a bit hesitant about John Travolta in a movie such as this, but he nailed it here, as he was quite convincing in the role that he had.I am sure that In a Valley of Violence will be quite pleasing to fans of the western genre, especially when a non-fan such as myself happened to be quite entertained with the movie as a whole."}, {"id": 150, "text": "In A Valley of Violence is a Western movie and I saw it due to the presence of Karen Gillan.For Karen this is not her first Western as she previously done one during her time playing Amy Pond in Doctor Who in the episode A Town Called Mercy.Karen is not the only person from the Whoniverse who is in In A Valley of Violence as it also featured Torchwood alum Burn Gorman.Other members of the cast include John Travolta, Ethan Hawke and Taissa Farmiga.After In A Valley of Violence Hawke did another Western in the 2016 version of The Magnificent Seven however The Magnificent Seven before In A Valley of Violence had its official release in 2016.Taissa Farmiga is an American Horror Story luminary and coincidentally I also saw her in her one appearance in American Horror Story season 6 Roanoke.In A Valley of Violence is a very enjoyable Western movie with a easy to follow plot that is ultimately about revenge.Coincidentally at the same time I watched In A Valley of Violence saw another Western movie with the word valley in the title that of Valley of the Sun (1942) starring Lucille Ball who is a redhead like Karen Gillan."}, {"id": 151, "text": "Paul (Ethan Hawke) is riding to Mexico with his dog Abbie. He's a former soldier who has had enough of violence after killing Indian civilians. In the town of Denton, he is challenged to a fight by braggard Deputy Gilly Martin (James Ransone). Only after Abbie is threatened, Paul decides to knock out Gilly with one punch. Ellen (Karen Gillan) is Gilly's equally annoying girlfriend. The only friendly face is Mary-Anne (Taissa Farmiga). Gilly's father Marshal Clyde Martin (John Travolta) pushes him to leave the town and he's happy to do so. Gilly and his friends catch up to Paul and kill his dog.From the opening credits, this is trying to be a spaghetti western. The outlines of the genre is absolutely there. The problem is that everybody seems to be a bit off. Ethan Hawke is being too modern in his performance. He should really be the man with no name. As an actor, he's not great at being quiet. He's too fidgety. Compare this to Keanu Reeves in John Wick and that's what this needs. Ransone is too weak and doesn't pose a real threat. Karen Gillan is too silly. Taissa Farmiga is at least trying to do good work. Travolta is completely wrong. As I'm watching this, I keep thinking of how it could have been done right. The movie in my head is vastly better than the one on the screen."}, {"id": 152, "text": "'IN A VALLEY OF VIOLENCE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another dog revenge tale (which reminds me of 2014's 'JOHN WICK'), this one is a western starring Ethan Hawke (making it his second western of 2016, following 'THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN' remake). It was written, edited, co-produced and directed by Ti West; and it costars James Ransone, John Travolta, Taissa Farmiga and Karen Gillen. The film tells the tale of a drifter, in the Old West, that gets into some conflict with some small town folk, that then kill his dog, and he wants revenge. The film received a limited indie theatrical release, while also being made available on video on demand, and it got mostly positive reviews from critics. I really enjoyed it as well.Paul (Hawke) is an ex-soldier, and drifter, that's traveling to Mexico (in the Old West), with his dog Abbie. They decide to cut through a small town, called Denton, despite being warned that it's an unfriendly place, by a drunken priest (Bum Gorman). Once there, a Deputy, named Gilly Martin (Ransone), picks a fight with Paul. Paul then humiliates him, by knocking him out. Later Gilly, and his friends, seek out revenge on Paul; by killing Abbie and leaving Paul for dead. Paul survives the attack though, and he then wants revenge (on his attackers) for the death of his best friend.I love a good western, especially a traditional homage to the genre like this! I also really like Ethan Hawke, and I've enjoyed Ti West's other films, which have all been horror flicks before this, and I think this is his best work to date. The score is great, and the action scenes are all pretty awesome. What I most love about the film though, is it's an animal abuse revenge tale. I'm a passionate vegan, and an obsessive animal lover, and I really like movies like this; that treat animals as they should be treated, like equals. The film should become a popular cult classic.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo"}, {"id": 153, "text": "Paul (Ethan Hawke) is deserter from the Civil War probably on the Union side, had abandoned his wife and child and is heading to Mexico and we are not sure why. He encounters the Marshal (John Travolta) and his son Gilly (James Ransone) and the boys. The Marshall runs the town and his son Gilly is a bully. Nothing good comes from this encounter and later Paul's dog is killed. Now Paul knows what he must do. This tries very hard to be a spaghetti western and fails. There is no good music that would normally accompany a spaghetti western. See? Yes, it's that bad. The script is okay, but the way lines are delivered makes one cringe. The dialogues are unbelievably bad with exceptions: John Travolta's and Ethan Hawke's dialogues are the only ones that are passable. And to be fair, Travolta's dialogues are sometimes humorous and you get the feeling he enjoyed every utterance. All other dialogues are off the charts and this is hard to explain, but one needs to hear them to understand what I mean. It's almost embarrassing to watch and listen to. Really not sure whey Ethan Hawke and John Travolta are in this. Did they owe money? Were their families threatened? Inquiring minds want to know. Now the only good parts in here are the shoot-outs in the town that come later on. Here it's sometimes quite comical even though people are getting shot. But when the last bad guy gets his, the violence is harsh, not comical. We are not sure what this movie was all about, but definitely not a spaghetti western. Notables: Karen Gillan as Ellen, Gilly's girlfriend; and Taissa Farmiga as Mary-Anne the sister of Ellen. Both sisters work in the hotel.All in all this is not entertaining. In the beginning, we thought this would be a good western as Paul meets a drunken priest (Ben Gorman) who claims he needs Paul's horse. The priest is here as comical relief, but nothing was funny. So we were wrong. The priest shows up again at the end when Paul tells him he can now stay and save everyone. Still not funny. (2/10)Violence: Yes.

My only complaint was Travolta. Really, anybody would have been better. Why Travolta?? He's still Staying Alive. He really took away from the movie. The acting by the rest of the cast members was admirable, downright excellent. The characters brought out by all were fun, refreshing, and a joy to watch....except for Travolta. : /  Kryst! Why did it have to be Travolta?? I give the rest of the cast and crew an 8 out of 10 for this fun filled hayride.Taissa Farmiga stole the show. Holy Smoke!!! This beauty owned this movie. She's a force to be reckoned with, for sure. Keep an eye on her. She's the next Queen of Hollywood.I saw Ethan Hawke as the Lead Character &amp; thought, Eh, this ain't gonna work. Right away I'm thinking Before Sunset, Before Sunrise - Movies I loved. But, Ethan as Clint Eastwood??? - Ain't gonna work... But, he pulled it off in grand fashion. Well Done!!!Check this moving out if your in the mood for a contemporary western. It will hit the spot!"}, {"id": 156, "text": "This film is ostensibly a western. But it is more than that.For starters, it isn't a modern version of a western, but instead is more akin to the old spaghetti westerns. The music, the sets, the graphics, etc., are both an homage to spaghetti westerns and a humorous take-off on them.The plot is one you have seen in many westerns. A drifter comes into a small town that is controlled by a psychopath, conflict ensues, and there is a gun battle where the drifter saves the town.On one level that is all this is. On another, it is a wry, and dry, take-off on this old, familiar tale because in this film the drifter doesn't go after the town bullies to liberate the town but because they killed his dog.That's right. This is a film where the battle-hardened, killer hero is mush when his dog is killed. He cries.So, right there, you don't have a traditional western or a traditional spaghetti western. In NO OTHER western I have ever seen (hundreds, as I am a die-hard fan) has the hero ever cried. Even Nathan Brittles wasn't crying in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon when he went to his wife's grave.This guy cries and then exacts his revenge.Now, Ethan Hawk is great in this. Just a week earlier we had seen the (dreadful) remake of The Magnificent Seven, which he is also in. However, this film, In a Valley of Violence, is far superior. In Mag 7 II, the town bully has hundreds of hired gunmen, all of whom meet their deaths in about 20 minutes. It is so absurd as to be ridiculous.In Valley, there are 4, maybe 5, and none of them are even close to competent, or even scary. There is a bully, his dad, and three guys who just needed a job because they couldn't do anything else.And the gun battle is hilarious. You realize, while watching this film, that you have been had. It starts off to be a standard western, and slowly evolves into rib splitting humor as you watch the gun battle unfold. The dialogue is clever. And the humor doesn't beat you over the head. In fact, it is understated, which makes it even better.We enjoyed this film. We will watch it again. Just give it a chance. It will be especially rewarding for people who have a history with old-fashioned westerns, as it is a wry, dry take-off on them that pounds you with subtlety and intelligent humor.Enjoy, pilgrim!"}], "reviews_amount": 157}
