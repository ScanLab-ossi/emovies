The plot holds your interest, moving along at a good pace and although the ending's a bit odd, it fits in with the overall theme. Good acting and setting, but apart from the opening, is lacking in truly memorable characters or scenes."}, {"id": 1, "text": "The good: beautiful cinematography, dark, gritty atmosphere contrasted with the sunny seaside environment. Gory, hardcore action scenes.The bad: almost all characters are \u00fcbermacho middle-aged men in dark clothing and no personality whatsoever. For me it made it impossible to follow the plot. At no point of the movie had I any idea who is who, who is shooting at whom and why, and generally what is happening. On the plus side at least I can't give you a spoiler.The balance: if you are exceptionally good at keeping 30 French men's names in mind and linking them to nearly identical characters then maybe you will have a better time than I did. Otherwise don't bother."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Ya see what I did there? \ud83d\ude1c The cinematography and special effects for the gore scenes were excellent. The directing was decent as was the cast performances, but I felt some actors were missing that oomf factor, and felt like they were there only for the paycheck. The action wasn't really anything to get excited about and felt bland. It certainly needed much more of it. The pacing was quite slow so the 116 min runtime felt like almost 3 hours. There were many plot and technical issues, and the story somewhat convoluted and seemed to be put together in a rush. Nevertheless, it was an entertaining film, but I feel it missed the mark to be a great one. So it's a 7 /10 from me"}, {"id": 3, "text": "A very French cops and gangsters film set in Marseille. Nearly everyone's having an affair, smokes, drinks too much, turns a blind eye, breaks the rules, is corrupt or a corruptor. Well framed with some excellent shoot outs, some clever twists to keep you guessing, and a finale that I certainly didn't see coming. I almost hit the stop button as a twee French acoustic love song came on, a que for the end credits. It wasn't, don't stop, keep watching. Recommended but not an award winner, a solid 7."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This would definitely be a decent movie if you are French.

Just don't expect it to be realistic, apart from the non existent communication between police departments. I agree the end is very unimaginative and not at all plausible. They missed an opportunity here and it's a common thing in European movies, they don't have advisors on law enforcement procedures. A simple police officer can give you mistakes in procedures after 5 minutes in the movie that would change the entire plot... examples: the weapons and bulletproof vest would definitely be found in the bar, when 9 people get shot they would investigate every little piece so impossible to not find those. The police officer shooting the arrested criminal is not tested on gun powder residue and he would definitely be arrested after ballistic testing and bullet direction impact... it shows the angle and distance so it would be clear the criminal was sitting down and not fighting. Watch it when you need a no brained movie to pass time."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Disappointing. Poor writing damages this film, story full of ridiculous, improbable or convenient situations.

For example: Taking a prisoner to his wife's hospital bed before transferring him to high security upon prisoner's request.

A lot of random characters with no background, all just to make it more dark and artsy' I guess. And the ending is just plain stupid.

There we go... that makes more sense."}, {"id": 24, "text": "A drama with hints of French action. It is about some policemen who are involved in a shooting of gangsters. Do you remember the game of the scrambled basket? Well, this movie is like this: gangsters against gangsters, gangsters against policemen, policemen against gangsters, again gangsters against gangsters, then policemen against policemen and gangsters with policemen against other gangsters and other policemen. A movie to see carefully detail by detail, so that you understand. Entertaining, although it takes a while to start, bear with it. Quality. Some unnecessary nudity and some cruel, as well as some murder. Good action scenes, and good effects although two or three moments are not completely achieved. The only problem is that it doesn't really develop the characters to a large extent, it goes more into situations and in some shootings the moment is ruined by putting a soundtrack on it. The ending is flawless and realistic. Talk about corruption and the power mafia. Nice Sunday."}, {"id": 25, "text": "The trailer got me hook, line and sinker.

The pace of the movie is good that it gives us the feeling of reality and not like the artificial action packed Hollywood movies.The movie shows the depth of corruption in the police force and that we are living in a hopeless world.

It wasn't. What it was, was a really hard to follow storyline filled with criminals and criminal cops all meshed together, only to see who would come out on top or still alive?

Using a very fast pace, a couple of well known actors in small roles (Reno, Lavin and a cameo from Claudia Cardinale), and others not so well know but effectives; BRONX becomes a violent thriller full of unexpected surprises and even an ending. Explain the story is not easy. There are a three gangs fighting for drug control. A lot cops; some very corrupted and others rebelling against the system and superiors. Everybody betrays somebody else and you must pay attention because things get very ugly for criminal, civilian and policemen.

Yes they have their reasons ... but are they good enough for what they do? Can you understand their thinking and forgive them? This will be up to the viewer.I was going to give this a 7 instead of an 8, but I have to admit that the ending really did the trick for me. I understand if some feel the opposite - but I do think it's the only way to solve this ... or absolve? Finding peace or whatever you want to call it - no pun intended.

There is a tad sex/nudity and this may be a movie for guys only - but, it's a cut above most, so I gave it an 8/10 for being a gritty/cops/gangsters movie in Marseille."}, {"id": 58, "text": "For me it's the corruption.

But he put too many elements, which brings much complexity to follow, and maybe not depth enough to the characters. That's not LES LYONNAIS, nor CARBONE or 36 either. But if you crave for rogue cops and violent action crime flicks, that's definitely for you. OM is the heir of Jean-Pierre Melville, not on the shape of course, but surely on the DNA. On the war of police topic, you also had COLT 45, made six years ago. Different story, but so dark and gloomy too. I repeat, I LOVE this film, but I would be fair enough to admit that OM lost much of his inspiring after LES LYONNAIS, in 2011. Look again BORDERLINE and CARBONE, nothing to do, with his second, third and fourth film ( 36, MR 73, and LES LYONNAIS.), the magic spirit, so powerful regarding of the deep characterization which was his trademark this magic, outstanding atmosphere has disappeared. This film is NOT a Netflix creation, no, no; no, it is a GAUMONT one. It was destined to the movie theaters, as the rest of his movies, except BORDERLINE, which was a TV movie. But I am sure Gaumont realized that a theatre release would be a disaster, so they preferred a Netflix distribution, they took this decision in July. They told it was because of the COVID, . Hmmmm...This way, Gaumont 1) Saves money from printing hundreds of copies destined to movie theaters for a film which would have been a gross failure and 2) gets a big check from Netflix for its release and 3) is distributed nearly all over the world. Actually, BRONX, which is a powerful crime movie though, really looks more like a Netflix production than a prestigious Gaumont feature.
