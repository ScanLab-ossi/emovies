I can't believe I cried over an Octopus"}, {"id": 1, "text": "As I sit here in my living room with the 'very unhealthy smoke' outside (from all the rampant PNW fires) I turned on Netflix and saw this Documentary. I thought Hmmm...that looks good. I was immersed from the get go. 23 minutes into it I paused it and had to text all my friends and tell them to watch it. I just put a post on Facebook to please watch this incredible film. It was one the THE very BEST documentaries I have ever watched. I always knew the octopus was smart but this film reminded me how smart. The bond between the octopus and filmmaker were beyond amazing. See this film now. And tell all your friends. There are important messages to take away from this documentary and we need to share those messages. We are part of this earth. Not just visitors. By the way, this is my first ever review. I felt compelled to write one after seeing this movie."}, {"id": 2, "text": "There's not much to say about this documentary type movie. It show cases an animal that's one of the most intelligent creatures we know and interacting with it, in its own environment. I was pretty shocked by how much personality the octopus showed, and intelligence. It gives you such a large level of empathy and love for a creature that's so alien looking compared to a regular pet (a dog or a cat).Definitely needed this in 2020. Would recommend this for anyone that enjoys the sea, or really, anyone."}, {"id": 3, "text": "What a beautiful film. Behind all the stunning imagery, emotion and story is the relentless discipline to dive every day for 5 years and then discover this bond over a year in freezing cold water. I have been to the kelp forest and gone into the water. To hold ones breath and be still to capture such astonishing beauty over such a long period of time is nothing but remarkable. In an age of staged nature films the simplicity and authenticity of the story is brilliant."}, {"id": 4, "text": "A truly touching story of two species connecting on a level that is unknown to most. Animals are the greatest teachers out there, and what a blessing it is to connect with such an extraordinary creature. This just goes to show no matter how unlikely the connection, love can exist in any form."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Loved everything about this amazing documentary. The manner in which the story unfolds keep you needing to see and learn more about this amazing creature and its relationship with the filmmaker.Brilliant !!"}, {"id": 6, "text": "This film redefines the documentary genre. The film touched me more than 99% of all films and was more exciting than the best thriller. You get a humility towards this world and everybody should have seen this film. At school it should become a compulsory subject."}, {"id": 7, "text": "Wow. No other words to say.If you're a film junkie like myself then you'll appreciate the time and effort that Pippa Ehrlich, James Reed, Craig Foster and everyone else put in to make this happen.I enjoyed it. Not my place to say where it could have been improved. It is what it is.Thank you."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Craig and team have created a magical world. Gives insight into the magical coastline off the western cape of South Africa. Stunning photography and videography and a beautiful thoughtful story about a man and his friend the octopus. I'm pretty sure some of the scenes have never been documented before and this contributes to science and understanding."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I just know I can't put into words how I feel about this movie, or even try to explain it. I literally cried over this. All I have to say is that it's a must. Such a beautiful story, such smart creatures."}, {"id": 10, "text": "This is the second documentary I have watched on the Octopus, but this one is more personal. We don't get to know the context except that human protagonist has gone through a period of crisis and goes back to one of his childhood occupations--underwater exploration. He doesn't set out to study the octopus, but is surprised by one in particular and in over a period of several days earns its trust. He learns something everyday right up to the end (and beyond). My title comes from the protagonist, Craig Foster who originally saw himself as visitor, but came to realize we all are part of nature. Beautiful and I mean beautiful cinematography and moodily appropriate music."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Wow. More than I was expecting. Had a tear in my eye by the end. Wow."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Beautiful images, heartbreaking story, and ...I will definitely never eat octopus again...."}, {"id": 13, "text": "I have never seen such an amazing film in my whole life. Nothing could distract me from being glued to this film. I never expected I would be hooked into the development of an animal human relationship. The Octopus has intelligence and and awareness seemingly to the level of a young child but in its own environment raised to superior intelligence. Well done Craig Foster for your insightful approach. Somehow it was meant to be you."}, {"id": 14, "text": "I watched this, and it is different from other documentaries because it is just a documentary about just one octopus and a man's relationship with it. It was hard to watch in some parts because he had to stay neutral and not interfere with nature, something I would find very hard to do. I have seen quite a few documentaries about the octopus, and they are extremely intelligent. They do not live very long, the female that is. The narrator and documentary maker is not a very excitable person, he is extremely mellow and relaxed, so if you are expecting a more Americanized type of documentary with a more rambunctious type of host/film maker than you probably won't enjoy his voice. I found it to be one of the most intimate documentaries that I have seen, and it really consumed my emotions."}, {"id": 15, "text": "This is one of those events in your life you just have to experience in order to understand the magnificence of the experience. I dont want to tell you about this movie. Because it didn't feel like one. It was an hour and a half underwater experience. I visited the underwater world and I was taken on a journey. I have two regrets, I wish I saw this on a movie screen in stead of at home and I wish I could have met the octopus. Blessings to the makers and the kelp forest. And now you close IMDb and immerse yourself..."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Phenomenal. This movie excites me that humans still have time and can integrate and live in harmony with the natural world. I am inspired to be more in tune with and more gentle with nature.

It demonstrates how precious life is, in every shape and form. I dare anyone to indulge in calamari after viewing this heart wrenching relationship between this beautiful female octopus and this equally beautiful and compassionate, south African man. The cinematography is visually stunning, and his remarkable ability to capture the soul of this mesmerising octopus is truly amazing. If eyes are the window to the soul, then this octopus with her huge, expressive eyes will convince you. Her fight for survival, every single day of her short life, will give you strength, her relationship with the man will renew your faith in humanity, especially in this dark time. He entered her world, with such love and respect, unlike most humans who go to steal from, and destroy the oceans. The kelp forests took me away to a world l wanted to retreat to, a mystical world so different to the life we live on dry land. When she gives her life to reproduce, l challenge you not to shed a tear.

So beautiful, mesmerizing and heartbreaking"}, {"id": 23, "text": "I've always held great admiration and wonder for wildlife films and although it's often frowned upon in some quarters when humans interact a little more closely, I found this to be an incredibly emotional, respectful and fascinating story.The Octopus Teacher is a beautiful tale of soul searching and unlikely friendship, combining an absorbing view on complex animal behaviour and how the natural world can humbly guide our perspective of life.The story is matched with stunning photography and sound.

Who are you to dictate what species is denied food? He interacted with a species, but at no point did he become a guardian.

No bravado from the narrator, just a soft spoken man who embodies the gentleness he has received through being in nature. We might all want to take a page out of his book and get outside... this world needs it."}, {"id": 29, "text": "This film manages to incorporate narrative and stakes into an octopus documentary. That is no small feat. As a result, it becomes much more than just a National Geographic special. Just as the filmmaker built a relationship with this octopus, the viewer builds a relationship with both of them. The down side is that everything can feel a tad overdramatic at points - do we need another shot of Craig Foster staring deeply into the camera? It is far from perfect, but my kids watched this entire thing on the edge of their seats. It is a beautiful little tale."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Exemplary footage but misplaced trust. The filmmaker got many things out of the encounter including the trust of the octopus but didn't reciprocate the one way exchange rationalizing it was okay to watch its demise. Why couldn't he give back and try to chase off the shark to see if the bond might have been stronger. We think its okay when dolphins save humans from sharks or orcas, why not save creatures in turn?"}, {"id": 31, "text": "Amazing story.Amazing camera work and footage.Amazing story about a beautiful intellectual human/animal relationship that has the ability to entertain and emotionally move any viewer or audience.Watch it and you will never regret it!"}, {"id": 32, "text": "Cheap shots. Honestly, this is a fantastic film, when the octopus is on screen. But the problem, as many others have stated, is his lack of empathy. She came to trust this man and even possibly care for him. Yet when she's being picked apart? Nothing. Not a simple hold for comfort as she passes on; just this cold, unfeeling man, getting his camera in the right position for when the sharks come along.This film made me cry, but not because it was so touching; the relationship he had with the octopus. What made me cry was that this man interacted, interfered, and created this bond between himself and this octopus; only to stand idly by in her last moments of need.The film clearly established the fact that these creatures are highly intelligent. It makes it painfully obvious she feels things, such as when her arm is taken by a shark; what more how she can be shaken by such traumatic incidents. And yet, while she is withering away, feeling these scavengers picking at her flesh, he gets his camera in place to take a nice shot.What made me cry then? I'll tell you, it's the thought that she probably recognised him when he came into the ocean at night. She probably knew he was there while these fish were pecking at her body, slowly drifting away. What comfort she might've felt in that moment, only to be sadly disappointed watching her friend from afar, setting up his cameras and lights to get a nice shot.At one point in the film, he brings up the question: what is she thinking right now?So, he can clearly understand that she isn't a simple mollusk, filter feeding on the bottom of the ocean, but rather a complex being with more intricate emotions and cognition than average sea creatures. Yet, he films her wasting away. What if she was thinking he'd be there to hold her again, while dying? What if her thoughts were: I would like to die in the safety of my friend's arms?Well, she's not going to get that, because that would cause him to lose his money shot.At first I thought that maybe I was reading too deeply into these things, but then another thought arose, reminding me that I never originally cared so much for any octopuses. It was this film that taught me to care. It was this film that showed me there is an intelligence displayed by these creatures, and that bonds were possible between humans and mollusks.So, in one swift blow I was taught to care for these creatures, then (I wish just as swiftly) I was taught to prioritise money; getting the best shots, over being a genuine friend; no matter the species."}, {"id": 33, "text": "When this pandemic is over, I hope each and every one of us, finds the ability to do something to elevate the meaning of our lives and of those around us, including animals. As a sometimes overworked editor, I too have thought I never wanted to see an edit bay again. But when the universe chooses you to tell such an incredible story, you must. I hope to one day be able to tell stories such as this. We need more positivity in film and this doc delivers massively."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Just simply amazing and finding it rather romantic... Everything about it is very beautiful and something that I thought impossible to have such bond in the water life, especially with an octopus..."}, {"id": 35, "text": "At first I went away thinking it was a good documentary, looking at the life of such an interesting creature. However, something did not feel right about it. The octopus was interfered with and paid a painful price for this man to get some good footage. Next time just bring some bait to attract the sharks so you don't have to wait so long to get that good ending you wanted"}, {"id": 36, "text": "I love nature documentaries and this was no exception. It was a beautifully shot and informative documentary. I found Foster to be pretty self indulgent and trying to draw a metaphor for everything in his own life against the natural world of the octopus. It really was a one sided friendship where the octopus took a chance and let this man into her world. Foster was a little dramatic and truly seems to only care about the octopus in regards to his own life's purpose. I found myself screaming at the screen when he would not help his little friend in very dire circumstances. We rescue animals in nature all the time. I don't see why he thought his little friend should not be afforded any benefits from having a giant human advocate. Even the octopus' end -left to be ravaged by the nature surrounding it was too much for me. I know it's the 'circle of life' but under the pretense of him supposedly having formed a special loving bond with her- it really bothered me. He interfered with her natural habitat to make his video but would not interfere to save her. He is a rich self absorbed bore.Him aside- I've always been fascinated by the magic of octopuses. She does not disappoint with her quick mind, magic skills, and sweet curiosity. Hopefully this documentary will raise sensitivity and awareness towards these beautiful intelligent creatures and why they should be protected much in the same way we do with dolphins. The only reason I give this 5 stars instead of the 1 star (Foster deserves for his narcissism) is for raising awareness for octopuses."}, {"id": 37, "text": "As another reviewer rightly said, Craig is a brilliant film maker and a lousy friend.This is an incredibly moving story of a beautiful, highly intelligent creature who let a human into her world, only to have him watch her die a gruesomely slow death while he pontificates on his own struggles. To those (and Craig!) saying that this is nature and that he didn't want to interfere, the time to draw that line was before developing such a close relationship that she would leave her place of safety to go and cuddle up to him, certainly before she altered her natural behaviour and started using him as an assistant in her hunting and seeing him as a source of safety. At that point, his protestations of not wanting to interfere to preserve natural balance! are nothing more than a pathetic excuse for wanting a good shot of that heartbreaking final scene. The least he could have done after irrevocably altering her entire existence was give her a peaceful death.This is a brilliant film, made at the price of a wonderful creature's trust."}, {"id": 38, "text": "It was an amazing experience. I was impressed and cried at the same time"}, {"id": 39, "text": "Very deep and meaningful content here. Hard to shake this one off. I feel like I had an minor existential crisis after watching, if such things can be minor.Before watching, the title spoke to me and I'm thankful it did. The finest documentary I've seen in ages. I was opened minded and immediately fully engaged with the story until the end. It takes its hold!To be immersed, engaged and aware of your interactions with all things is a spell binding tale we can take tremendous cues from. What a gift to be reminded of our world's incredible complexity, and that we are only but a part.A brilliant film. Thank you."}, {"id": 40, "text": "The footage of the octopus is stunning and beautiful. Unfortunately, this man used the gorgeous creature to make himself the center of the story.

Exquisite footage, beautifully simple, fantastic edit, highly educational, amazing soundtrack and all brought through the lens of a true connection between a human and a very misunderstood creature of the sea. Highly recommend."}, {"id": 42, "text": "First of all, it took a while to comprehend the documentary was filmed in South Africa as it had a white South African male in it, and I thought they're all in Europe or Australia to mentally check-out of the nations problems they created.That aside, I simply can't believe the lengths the octopus went to to inform all of us of the man's character deficiencies.Not only did she gift him a veil of purpose through her trust and kinship so he could delude himself into validating his long periods of family desertion; I was utterly impressed by the commitment of this cephalopod to endure the friendship after he willingly watched her be mauled by a predator shark so that all could observe his lack of emotional availability and understanding of reciprocity in friendship - the same qualities she had in abundance.Later, as she lay dying of natural causes, I couldn't help but think a large portion of her last salient thoughts would be devoted to a re-assessment of their friendship as he sat there filming her still alive body being picked upon by scavengers and doing nothing about it.As her corpse was unceremoniously taken by a shark, I was struck by the misfortune a more fitting end didn't transpire - one where he was a pallbearer at her funeral so he could let her down one last time.I, for one, salute this cephalopod's sacrifice. Vale, my eight legged friend.Nice colour rendering though."}, {"id": 43, "text": "... There's this guy who laments not spending enough time with his son. So he decides (instead) to dive in the ocean everyday to spy on an octopus and make it his pet dog. Fascinating photography, sure. But who's taking all those shots of him, when he's ostensibly alone?I dunno. This felt cringeworthy in some places and I never cried. Except for the 90 minutes I spent wondering how many people have flocked to that very kelp forest only to destroy its entire ecosystem."}, {"id": 44, "text": "The only good thing about this Movie (Not a Documentary) is the beautiful images. Everything else is just made up by a guy who is in his mid life crises and in love with an Octopus. Everything Craig said about his relationship is made up... Would have been a really nice Documentary if we would have seen more from the Octopus and the way they live as they are really interesting, but could not lissen to another woord of what Craig had to tell us.. Very disappointing.. I would recommend to see it with the volume down and having some classic music in the background"}, {"id": 45, "text": "Star Treks prime directive comes to mind 'Dont interfere with anything... unless it makes for a good story'.Cry me a crocodile tear river! My Octopus Teacher really bugged me. I thought the filmmakers motivations were totally insincere and selfish. He goes into the octos territory, constantly. Stalks it after he forces it to move habitat, then plays with it, completely interfering with it and the organisms around it that it relies on to survive... but then says 'I can't interfere' when a shark attacks it or whatever. Seems like he was just doing whatever possible make a dramatic story at any cost. Not only that but he projects all of of his own issues on the octo, spend all his time anthropomorphizing it when he know little about them, and begins the film by talking about how his son needs his father then escapes into the ocean everyday!Netflix seems to be changing the definition of what a 'documentary' is and a lot of what they produce is exploitative, tabloidesque and (in the case of rubbish like Gwyneth Paltrows awful Goop series) dangerous.It looked nice tho, 3 stars for that. I would have been satisfied just watching the kelp forest washing about. Thankfully there are still filmmakers like David Attenborough out there."}, {"id": 46, "text": "Beautiful visuals make this worth watching, but the creepy guy's narration and back story are just painful. 85 minutes of self-indulgent rambling and nonsense made me want to hang myself!

The way she hunted, showed herself, made her more vulnerable. Yet you sat by when she was hurt because of you, not helping. How can you say you were touched by a relationship of trust when you failed her everytime she needed you. You took advantage of her trust and didn't return it. You failed her."}, {"id": 48, "text": "I won't inflict the storyline on everyone all over again as it has now been covered many times but I felt a sense of betrayal at the end. During their friendship there were moments of great tenderness which bridged an abyss between two worlds that couldn't have been more different. Maybe the first time this has ever happened in the history of this earth. The beautiful moments when she reached out to him and felt secure on his arm or chest and then at the end when she needed him the most he watches her begin a night of being eaten alive by every nibbler in the sea! What kind of crap is that. Are we Capt Kirk now and the Starfleet Directive to never interfere? He goes back to his cozy beach house and feels sorry for himself. This film left me angry."}, {"id": 49, "text": "Beautifully filmed, interesting storyline, but I would never want Craig Foster for a friend. He is just a heartless documenter of events around him and he thinks in profits and kudos. I don't think he is capable of true friendship. Although he did display a hopeful moment of possible redemption when he tried feeding his ailing friend. Unless that was just playing to the camera too... Craig, FYI once you have penetrated that ecosystem, you are part of it. You ARE interfering just by being present. Just like the sharks were interfering by being present. But, my guess is you knew that already, because your excuse for not helping out your friend sounded silly and hollow, even to your own ears. You had a choice to make and you chose your craft over your friend. Enjoy the fruits of your decision.

Don't understand however how anyone filming a creature that they have befriended in a way is able to carry on filming while this creature is being attacked and not try to help. 'You don't want to interfere with nature'? Really? You are already interfering with nature by filming it, befriending it and luring it out of the safety. The least you can do is try to help when it's being attacked. But I guess this way you wouldn't get your footage and make profit eh?

How could you sleep if you really cared about it? Slowly being eaten, her flesh being torn off her throughout the night while you sleep comfortably in your bed? Until you came out the next day and a shark Finally came and ate her.. Seriously? You said you supposedly Loved that Octopus nut you let it suffer for so long. It's not stupid, if it used you to unknowingly help it catch lobster, it knew you could have helped it when all the animals were tearing at it.Also couldn't help but feel your family, especially your son needs you to be home more often and be present and there for him.

It's the personal project of a man who, following a midlife crisis, decides he can't work anymore and chooses to spend his time free diving instead. After a while, he realizes that it might be possible to monetize his activities by filming the local fauna and does just that. Because he's not a biologist, he adds some sappy, manipulative storytelling rather than informative narration to better sell the footage.To be honest, whether it is an act or not, I find the overly sensitive, self-centered and undependable nature of this man to be quite off putting, and his privileged life doesn't make for compelling storytelling. Octopuses, on the other hand, are naturally interesting creatures and there's plenty of close up footage of them going about their business, so in that sense it sort of balances out."}, {"id": 59, "text": "There's no denying this doc contains some of the most interesting and beautiful footage of kelp forests and octopus(es) ever captured. But it's simply the vanity project of an obnoxious man experiencing an existential crisis while possessing vast means. Viewers aren't granted even a minute reprieve from Craig Foster's overly polished prose delivered with an extremely exaggerated soft tone and full of forced reflections. Only 3 scenes show actual physical contact between him and the same octopus. If more instances of physical contact occurred, viewers surely would have been treated to that footage. There is no guarantee other scenes of an octopus generally going about its octopus life (playing, hunting, evading predators and eventually becoming prey at the end of its own life) contain the same animal. When nature documentaries focus on the narrative of a single animal, filmmakers generally manipulate viewers by editing footage of different animals of the same species together. I'm sure at least some of this trickery exists in My Octopus Teacher. It tramples the entire premise of the film while also casting doubt on its sincerity. Mostly, it makes Foster's non-stop narration all the more pompous, pretentious and self-aggrandizing."}, {"id": 60, "text": "Craig Foster, you may be a great filmmaker but you are a lousy friend.

The whole thing could have been condensed in the only relevant moment of interaction between the octopus and other animals. Amazing images though, I just wish the team had decided to bring someone with real knowledge of the biodiversity and the species of the area so we could leave that creepy stalky documentary a bit more informed on that seemingly unreal habitat."}, {"id": 62, "text": "Far from a big budget, globe-spanning wildlife documentary, My Octopus Teacher is incredibly impressive is a very different way. One man's personal journey is reflected in the life of an octopus that he discovers then observes and films every day for a year.

The candid and philosophical narration explores this relationship and relates this small, personal story to the larger cycle of nature and the wonder of the wild places of this earth."}, {"id": 63, "text": "As a freediver myself, often playing with octopuses, I really enjoyed this movie. Also, as a freediver, I must add that swimming with your snorkel in your mouth and taking very few safety measures (buddy system, breathe up between dives etc) are not good ways to introduce the masses to safe ways of diving under water on one breath. If I forego that mayor flaw, remains a beautiful and touching movie that highlights the unique nature of octopuses. Truly the dogs or social cats/parrots of the sea. Hopefully people will refrain from killing or eating them (as did I!) from now on.

He watched his friend beeing attacked by sharks and did nothing. He tried to cry a few times (his eyes were red, so I guess they put something in his eyes to make it look like crying). He befriended an octopus and then watch it being mauled by sharks with an excuse 'I can't interfer'. But he forgets that he already touched the being, established an emitional connection and bond. And after that he breaks the shell to try to feed her (?). So, he did interfer after the attack, which shows how slimely and inconsistant this creature is.Despite everything, the octo forgives this slimely being and teaches us that octopus has a bigger heart than some humans.

Tragic and disturbing.To the filmmaker (WARNING! Harsh words) You are not a journalist covering a war conflict and reporting from the sidelines, you are a human being who built this wonderful relationship with a beautiful creature that followed you around, relaxed herself on your torso (and your heart if you noticed) and clamped on to your arm all the way to the surface, who stared at you with love and trust, who shared her beautiful home with you, and you watched her lose her arm to a shark, and being chewed. How is that possible? And how could you overlay this footage with emotional music when you just stood there motionless and emotionless filming her being dismembered?The fact that her arm fully regrew is a testament to HER resilience, despite YOUR ignorance and indifference to that tragic event.If it takes a tragic event for you to learn compassion (I'm assuming this is how you came up with the title My Octopus Teacher), then please stick to your family and leave the compassionate world be, until you learn compassion, and you can learn compassion by watching films about people care for animals. I have never had an animal or pet in my home, but I know to be compassionate towards them.Please stay out of the water, you don't belong in the ocean covering these wonderful animals.

You interacting with it is no different from the numerous species that are constantly interacting with each around the world since the beginning of life on the planet.

This documentary is without a doubt visually stunning, however it's both Craigs growth, learning and understanding along with the wisdom of a new found world, and the emotions that new world evokes in the viewer, that makes this a 10/10.Some are less in favour of the personal, narrative types of nature/environmental documentaries, arguing against their lack of 'science' and overreach into sentimentality. But this is different. As we learn, the world of the Octopus, and that of the oceans, are so unknown to us. So much of what Craig discovered and provided a glimpse into was completely new.

More importantly, 'My Octopus Teacher' made me feel so intense for a living creature I never imagined in my entire life. That's the magic of storytelling, entertaining us, giving us a different perspective wrapped with a novel treatment we could have ever dreamt of.It is very obvious that the film is about an octopus from the name and the poster, me having absolute zero inclination towards sea life, nor the octopus, I had a tough choice to make on this film, thought for a while and with the least expectation, I chose to watch it.The film left with awe how could the makers conceived the narrative that would create an impact of such magnitude. The narrative solely dives on the shoulder of a female octopus and her relationship with a human being, Craig Foster. I'm sold to the plot, the moment the octopus reciprocates her trust to Craig, a beautifully emotional moment. The film unfolds the supreme level of intelligence and the social skills the octopus posses, it was an eye-opener for me. The film delves into the complete lifecycle that an octopus faces in the sea forest - Survival, Socializing, Deceiving, Playing, Mating, Hatching Eggs, and eventually death.The film is shot brilliantly, it's like - the shots wherein Craig dives into the sea to the piece of rock where this octopus used to stay hiding gets so emotional, that I just prayed for the octopus to return after she has been preyed by the deadly shark, that's the power of imagery, haunting yet emotional. The action sequences between the shark &amp; octopus, the octopus playing with fishes, she strategically preying on a crab, and many more sequences bring out the right dramatics, keeping us hooked whenever I get to a point, what's next?The hardest part is when we get to the climax, and the enlightening part of this film to realize that every living being in this nature shares the same feeling, to be loved, and to reciprocate love to others. The parting of the octopus after hatching eggs gets so painful unexpectedly, I wished this to continue forever. At this point, Craig does not interfere to save the octopus, and that's the beauty of this film to let nature deal with it.My Octopus Teacher - Highly Recommended!

The point of the film is to demonstrate that octopus are intelligent creatures with feelings and thoughts and emotions. To that end, the film shows numerous instances where our lead, Craig Foster, engages with this octopus. In some instances, the octopus even swims to him and he cuddles it to his chest. Whether this is just instinctual behavior or actual attachment is probably up to each viewer to decide. But what is not subjective in any way is that Foster is a swimming, snorkling piece of feces. Despite expressing his deep emotional attachment to this octopus throughout the film, in the closing moments we see that the octopus is so famished from taking care of its young, that it is essentially helpless. Without food, it is basically left for dead. So, what does Foster do? He leaves it laying on the ocean floor while it gets slowly eaten alive by other fish. And I mean slowly. He films the carnage over a two day period before a shark finally takes the entire body. He claims he does this not to interfere with the circle of life, but he already did that by feeding the very same octopus when it was injured earlier in the film. The reality is that Foster had an opportunity to hold this friend of his and comfort it during its last moments on Earth. Instead, Foster simply swims overhead and films the ordeal so that he can have a tragic ending to this film. The irony is that the movie is supposed to be about appreciating nature and yet Foster exploits nature throughout. When he had a chance to truly give something back he became more spineless than the octopus he claims to have cared for.1/10 because bad people shouldn't be rewarded with good ratings."}, {"id": 117, "text": "Brilliant thought provoking warm sentimental and even courageous for a man to open his heart up to the world to show such a gorgeous and intimate relationship that taught him - and thank God and therefore the rest of us that some of the greatest lessons don't come from a book but from the natural world around us.

Essentially its 90 minutes of subjective narrative where very little new is learned and not much happens. Those who know even the smallest of bits of information about the wondrous phenomenon of the octopus will walk away with no new information, only that a depressed filmmaker apparently finds illumination through a relationship with an octopus. The idea is somewhat novel and romantic for sure, but, like the filmmaker himself when diving in the reef, he never really goes to any depths to convey anything interesting further than 'the octopus comes and touches my hand - she like me and i like her'. We are left with the promise of some sort of natural wisdom imprinted in this ancient and seemingly alien being, and - which needs to be said, some beautiful underwater shots, but that is about as far as we go on this journey and the 'lesson' is sadly exactly the one you imagine at the start of the documentary - choose life, nature good, embrace the world around you, be humble etc. Though through the lens of watching a personal story of a somewhat privileged white guy bummed out in a midlife crisis finding joy again by diving, relating to an octopus and through the animal finding a connection to the (natural) world, its not a bad thing in to have on in the background.

The title alludes to lessons that he learnt during his 300-over days with the octopus before it meets its natural demise. The cinematography is unquestionable, the interactions between the man and the octopus beautiful, but where are the lessons?At the start of the documentary, Foster informs us that he needed to take a break after burning out with his work, so he returns to his childhood haunt to restore himself. He says that he has not had a decent night's sleep in two years and his relationship with his family is worsening. The only other human face we see is his son's and we perceive an improvement to the father-son relationship as the son later joins the father on his underwater excursions.Foster reveals near the end of the documentary that the takeaway lesson from the octopus is that humans belong in the water. Except we do not because humans cannot breathe underwater which he clearly demonstrated numerous times by having to surface at inopportune moments to take a breath during his filming. I was hoping for something more profound. He stated that all creatures are precious; I expected a paean to marine conservation. He noted the parallels between the octopus' life and his; I was waiting for a commentary about human existence and practicing gratitude instead of being swept away by society's pressures. He neither discloses the full nature of his personal crisis nor elaborates how his perception of life and his role in this world has changed.

Cinematography was often excellent. The director is clearly depressive, and was seeking to cure himself of his own depressiveness. His biggest clue was that through his experience with the octopus in the kelp forest he learned to feel that he belonged, and was not just a visitor. Evidently he was feeling quite isolated and alone in society, just a visitor, before he started this documentary. Some of his narrating is a little sappy, but overall well worth the watch.

That's right, I said Best Picture and not documentary. The reason i think it is Oscar (Best Picture) worthy is that it is so rich on many levels -- it is not just a study of what happened. I read one review that said it is the love story we all need (or have been waiting for?) or something like that. And I agree. In these most difficult times, good news and good feelings come so infrequently -- we NEED this movie.

I think he collected footage first, with a lot of octopi in them - maybe even the same one over and over, and then built a story around it. Otherwise, his daily 10-15 minutes would magically be the time slots in which the crucial elements of the story unfold. It's a way of telling people to look out and look after our oceans, in which he is so right. In my opinion, he uses this documentary to get the narrative across.

It has a magnificent emotional impact on caring for the ocean lives in the water below our usual sights which we too often overlook, and sheds light on the micro-narratives and emotionality even between species normally perceived as incommunicable to one another.

But it's well done. Spectacularly, so, in my opinion. Such a simple premise: 1 man + 1 octopus + time - lots of time. No human has ever done this before, I'm sure. What unfolds is magical... an adult man who loves the sea meets and, incredibly, gets to know an octopus, female, just a few months old, and expected to live, at best, for 1 year. What unfolds is a story of connection, of recognition across species, of a lost man who finds meaning again in his life from a mollusc. Admittedly the most intelligent mollusc on the planet (equivalent, perhaps, to a dog). But hardly something you'd pitch to a Hollywood producer as a potential blockbuster. The result, however, is a drama... of meeting, of attraction, of mortal danger, of loss, and more.

This small creature is seriously amazing, with abilities you'd expect to see in a sci-fi film and an intelligence that far exceeds anything in its immediate surroundings. It's wonderful to see it up close, to naturally learn about (and from) it as the piece progresses. It becomes clear that the creature much more than most people gives it credit for.

I have a natural aversion to sentimental, 'inspiring' documentaries - but this film deftly avoids the traps of this nature and settles for simply telling a story and allowing emotion to evolve. It's not a scientific study - though the man concerned does study and learn as the year progresses - it's instead a portrait of immersion in the world of another, and how that affects and changes us. The alien, exotic nature of the kelp forest is beautifully evoked by the excellent cinematography - though there's a tad too much slow-motion for me, which ends up slightly dulling its intended impact - and I must make special mention of the lovely, evocative score from (full disclosure) composers known personally to me.

So it was, he came to re-enter the marine world of his beloved South African kelp forest. After a period of acclimation, his boyhood passion for the natural world re-surfaced and his love of wildlife photography returned. Before long, he encountered a wild octopus and began a mutually-respectful relationship, documenting the most intimate, grueling, and uncanny events in the life of this unimaginable creature.

We see an octopus exhibiting instinctual behaviors. It feels around looking for food or danger. It becomes accustomed to the repeated presence of another animal, be it human or fish, and that presence doesn't trigger hiding behavior. It doesn't problem solve to cover itself in shells, that behavior has been programmed in the genes through evolution. The female doesn't 'sacrifice' herself for her children, that self-destruct behavior is, again, the result of evolutionary selection, most likely because of octopus cannibalistic behavior she would eat her young.

If you bonded with a dog, would you just watch while the dog got brutalized, as the dog makes eye contact with you and runs up to you for help? This is the same thing. You had an understanding. The octopus used to rush up to him and actually hug him. After the betrayal, she never went up to touch him ever again. This creature was obviously bonded. She went out to spend time with him. She had her guard down in a way that she wouldn't have if she didn't have a (supposed) friend there. This was a beautiful and amazing connection, and you traded it in for interesting footage.

This is not the same as watching zebra hunted on the Savannah.He watches on at the shark attack and then falsely (well maybe loss of earnings were a genuine worry) wrings his hands at what could have happened. At that point there are series of short scenes concerning how interested my son had become in the sea. Who would be fooled by this?The 'scientific papers the film maker purports to be the truth concerning the known intelligence of octopuses are rubbish. I did my environmental degree more than 20 years ago, it was known then about the importance of the CNS in their high levels of problem solving intelligence + Self-awareness. This was not an extraordinary octopus. It's the same octopus that many people are eating. They are highly complex and intelligent.People need a closer relationship with the natural world. We are in a terrible extinction crisis. This film with a different narrative could have contributed.

First of all, it is very likely a lie. They must have captured all the footage within a couple of days and then added a twisted fanfic on top of it. Anybody who believes that thing is real is probably a flat-earther too.A middle-aged man stalking an octopus for weeks doesn't look like a healthy relationship at all - especially considering the tons of testimonies that can be easily understood as bad taste sexual jokes. Moreover, he broke the golden rule: LET NATURE FOLLOW ITS COURSE (yes, I'm talking about the clam).If you're looking for poetry, stay away from this atrocity. Go read some poetry. This movie is cringey at most. Or, whatever, watch it with no sound and subtitles while skipping the parts where the filmmaker is speaking.

The editing must have been a monumental task as there were probably countless hours of footage to pare down. What they came up with was a beautifully articulated story about life and what it means to truly understand an animal's world from it's point of view.Craig Foster is the man who discovers the octopus; at first she evokes his curiosity and desire to watch her activity. But it evolves into a complex and revelatory relationship of trust and loyalty. Craig free dives into the cold water daily, for hundreds of days, to see her and further develop their interaction. He has his own human struggles and diving brought him some peace. The octopus is known to be an intelligent creature, but we don't necessarily know it as an emotional creature, capable of more than survival. What unfolds before us is remarkable and almost a gift.

We tend to identify their behavior instinct as unconditional love and devoted companionship. We give them personifying traits to give us comfort and joy. (Although my sweet Zoey is the smartest and most loving of puppies!)Which brings us to the subject of this strange but diverting documentary, My Octopus Teacher. But more to its pupil, Craig Foster and his nearly year old obsession with his underwater buddy. Their bond is strange to say the most and slightly borderline off the deep end to say the least.Filmed off the coast of South Africa, the film follows their relationship from the beginnings of a beautiful friendship to its inevitable bye, bye octupi sign-off. The photography is stunning as it captures an underworld microcosm of life amid the ethereal world of color and light. Visually astonishing, we are transported to an unknown universe as student meets tutor. Their time together under the sea is quite riveting, but the words from Mr. Foster never reach the poetic beauty of his vision. His sentimental voiceover narration lacks, dare I say, depth, and with it comes an underlying desperation to impress and justify his risky and behavior told in his own words. (I kept wondering about his many night dives without scuba gear and his sometimes water-world jaunts alone. Granted he did have an assistant cameraman, Roger Horrocks, most of the time; yet my thoughts always came back to Mr. Foster's human world of isolation and his neglected son throughout most of the movie.) As the story unfurls, his observational actions become almost too obsessive, even if his footage of his alien friend is spellbinding in its beauty.The octopus itself is a fascinating subject and any moviegoer will be in awe of its survival instincts to camouflage its being and move so gracefully in its environs. We watch it evade attacks by sharks, go hunting as it systemically stalks its own prey, and communicate with Mr. Foster in his day-to-day marine biology studies.My Octopus Teacher, skillfully directed by Pippa Ehrich and James Reed, shows a different type of bromance that entertains in all of its curious oddity and sustained sense of wonder."}, {"id": 340, "text": "Ok, pictures are splendid, aquatic life is stunning and the story is an emotional rollercoaster. However after I watched this, and also during the viewing I had concerns about several things and this is why I am not giving this a 10. I will not spoil so I will not detail everything but I cannot help but wondering how much of this story is true. First if it is true, then this guy has serious psychological issues. He needed to find a purpose and meaning in his life so he became obsessed with an octopus. The fact the octopus touches him might have nothing to do with an imaginary friendship but rather with the guy's skin being warm. I believe the octopus was simply attracted to the warmth and did not care or even know about the guy at all. Then when the octopus gets in trouble I cannot help but wondering why the guy keeps filming and does nothing to help the animal. Hr could have but he did not, simply staring with his camera. So this is like he wants only to make pictures. This documentary looks insincere in the end, if you think about it and do not rely on the editing job to tell you what really happened. I think the guy is a good actor too. Feel free to believe what you want. Anyhow, this is worth watching, this is quite extraordinary to see an octopus in his natural habitat."}, {"id": 341, "text": "Ugh my entire (perfect) review just disappeared from accidentally touching something on my phone screen.

I don't want to say much else because to get the full impact, I believe you should view it without prejudice like I did.It is touching, beyond gorgeous, suspenseful, engaging, and important.

An unbelievable work was done by the director - which gave almost a year of his life to an unbelievably noble creature, while capturing all the best and worst moments of her short, heroic life on camera. Those unbelievably intimate moments of hardship, suffering, victory and happiness of such a noble creature - which are almost never captured on camera - where captured, literally for the first time, only thanks to this man, who decided to dedicate a year of his life, to living WITH this magnificent creature. This film makes one wonder, more than ever, how many of those incredible stories exist out there in the ocean (some of them are taking place right now) and how little and insignificant we and our problems are, even in the scope of out tiny planet. There's so much going on here, so many REAL events are happening around us, while we are dealing almost exclusively with OUR little and - in the grand scheme of things - absolutely meaningless problems. This world is so much bigger than us, and we take it for granted, while having the unbelievably selfish feeling that it's OURS. Nothing is ours, life is so very short and full of true wonder - don't waste it away."}, {"id": 343, "text": "2020 being the year it is, there doesn't seem to be anything odd about watching a documentary about a man who befriends and finds his life's purpose once more in the form of a friendship with a wild octopus.In what has to be one of the stranger documentaries to come our way in recent memories, Netflix's My Octopus Teacher is a quite literal title for its original release as directors Pippa Ehrlich and James Reed explore the intriguing mid-life crisis of fellow filmmaker and South African based nature lover Craig Foster whose chance encounter upon an octopus on one of his daily swims set him on a path of self-discovery and reawakening as he dedicates himself to studying and building a bond with this wild creature.At just over 80 minutes in length, Teacher draws about as much narrative juice as it can out of its rather confined and linear subject matters with the film broken down exclusively to Craig Foster narrating the story and his lessons from his kitchen table while footage he shot of his experiences making up a bulk of the action and while the film is no doubt hamstrung in parts by how much you can get out of such a true life story, there's also little doubt that the film features a number of heart warming moments as well as some incredible action shots of one of the worlds most misunderstood creatures.You don't run into many casual fans of the Octopus, an alien like creature that many discount as creepy critter from the deep but Teacher showcases a whole different side to the incredibly smart animal that seems to gain mutual benefit from its interaction with Foster and strikes up an undeniable bond with the likeable gentle giant as the two become more comfortable in each others presence and learn from each other as they spend more and more time together.It's unlikely that you walk away from Teacher with any lifelong lessons but if your going through a tough period, a tough day or just want to feel the love a little this is the perfect film to remedy those situations and a game-changer for any Octopus naysayers out there.Final Say -A simple yet effective documentary, My Octopus Teacher is the type of film you never knew would exist or perhaps didn't know you needed but its simple tale of friendship and acceptance makes for worthy viewing.3 shell shields out of 5"}, {"id": 344, "text": "This is a brilliant and empathic documentary about a man who finds an octopus off the shore of his family home.

This is by far one of the most incredibly well crafted, scripted and emotive underwater documentaries I have ever seen. This tender little film, shot in just a small plot of kelp-covered-bottom in any odd place of Mother Earth around South Africa, at least not precisely in what we understand as a scuba diver's paradise, tells us so much about how the sea is source of all life and how is never too late to approach our origins with the right mentality, accepting that we are not mere onlookers but active participants. This story teaches us that there are still unusual ways to read something that is forgotten but that we carry inside, communicating with other forms of life as part of a very big organism in a perfectly balanced environment that took billions of years to forge.The stubborn will of this man, diving everyday in the cold to meet this modest and yet so smart creature reminds me of the good old years of Ives Cousteau and the passion he instilled in us for the sea, the great unknown.If you are one of those lucky people who grew up diving and still feel that you belong down there then you'll appreciate each and every second of this little gem."}, {"id": 346, "text": "This was literally the most stunning documentary I have ever had the pleasure to watch.

She put on Netflix and she randomly picked this documentary (usually I pick what we watch but I let her pick cuz I didn't care what I watched I was just happy to be there). We had some acid that we had been holding on to for a special occasion and we took it a few hours before we put on Netflix. In my very emotional state of mind I started to watch this and I must say, it was a very soothing and comforting experience, and toward the end of the movie I almost felt a sense of relief, and I actually felt okay with having a new beginning in my life. This movie is literally about a guy following an octopus around for years, but Jesus Christ it's so relatable in so many ways.

It's a movie that sucks you in.The one thing I didn't care for as much is the human protagonist. But this may not be fair.

Craig Foster, Founder of Sea Change ProjectA lot of people come to an undersea doc caring mainly for the spectacular cinemaphotography. Not so much here because the Netflix original, My Octopus Teacher, is all about the relationship between an invertebrate and a man--the photography helps rather than dominates.Herman Melville could have learned a thing or two from narrator and diver Craig Foster, whose gentle delivery draws you in the way his octopus love does. Melville could have minimized most of his delivery, whereas Foster and co-writer James Reed gently tell us about this lovely miniature wonder and her world in the simplest, most lyrical way.She soothes us with her daily routine (Foster spends almost a year observing her without scuba tank (a year is the lifespan of the Octopus). She coyly draws him in like a lover.

This vital world of coral reefs kelp forests where magnificent creatures sea creatures like the octopus inhabit. My Octopus Teacher is a 2020 Netflix Original documentary film directed by Pippa Ehrlich and James Reed. It stars only 2 characters Craig Foster a diver who also produced the film and an unnamed Octopus . The film captures a year Foster spent with a wild common octopus. Foster followed the octopus for most of the octopus's life. Craig Foster Director, and Producer and underwater diver filmed My Octopus teacher off the Southern most tip of the African coast in 2010 looking for answers to his mid life What's it all About  crisis. Craig Foster was diving, bare-chested, in bitterly cold waters off the southern-most tip of Africa when he saw her -- an octopus hiding under a cloak of shells and stones. Enchanted, by this magical under sea world in the giant kelp forests where he first comes into contact with the subject of this wonderful story a wild common female octopus . He began following this incredibly shy creature, trying to prove he wasn't a predator by staying very still in her presence. For weeks she evaded him: hiding in her den, camouflaging herself, or pushing her liquid body into the nearest crack to escape. And then, after 26 days of near obsessive wooing, she reached out and touched him. It reminded me of that moment in Steven Spielberg's E.T. but this moment is more emotional because it's real and rare ,two creatures totally alien to each other suppressing their fears of the unknown and trying to connect and learn from each other. One of my favourite parts of the film is Craig diving with his son and passing on his experience to his son as their relationship is mended by the fathers interactions with the Octopus that changes their lives. This is very special movie making and 1hour 25 minutes of bliss . The feature Documentary by Craig Foster,Pippa Erlich and James Reed is a must see ,it's beautiful ,it's emotional and the message is subtle it doesn't preach but it does enlighten and teach us that our animal and sea creatures are one of our most precious assets on earth and must be understood and protected."}, {"id": 353, "text": "Stumbled upon this doc, on Netflix.

The cinematography is absolutely stunning, as well.Granted the edibles were pretty great, but once the interactions with the octopus began, I was fully immersed in this story.There were moments where I had tears streaming down my face. The beauty and the finite aspect to this world-both above and below the water, become glaringly apparent. At one point, I thought I was suffering an existential crisis, lol.
