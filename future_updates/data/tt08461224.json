Shea was pretty damn good in this and I've never been a huge fan of his. If you enjoy David Ayers films, then ignore the hate and just give it a try."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Shia did great, but he wasnt the main character.The acting by David could have been better, it almost seemed like he was reading off of cue cards in some scenes.And the girl who played the wife Alexis... her lips are so full of filler and it was so distracting during the movie! Her and David are supposed to have a passionate marriage, so they kiss a lot. There are a lot of close ups of the married couple- and all I could focus on was her lips full of filler. Jesus."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This movie has potential but everything goes to heck because of the extremely bad script. First, you need to wait almost 60 minutes of 90 to see something interesting. Second, when the action starts everything goes extremely fast. Shia's character was barely developed. Are you serious? Last, Fx's look cheap and acting amateurish, except from Shia. But...So, overall a wasted opportunity to create a great movie. Shame on Director 's and writers. Make yourself a favor and watch Sicario 1 and 2 instead watching this one."}, {"id": 3, "text": "Best part of this movie, the trailer. pretty funny he got real tattoos for this role for as bad as the movie was."}, {"id": 4, "text": "He should have stayed in movie longer..It was a good movie. Not the best.. not the worst.. he was great though."}, {"id": 5, "text": "It's a bit like a film student and a few extras had an afternoon off, and played with a camera .The story couldn't be more basic, acting and dialogues are cringeworthy, never credible, just very amateurish ."}, {"id": 6, "text": "Thinking it was going to be a badass gangster movie instead turn out to be boring and just bad cinema."}, {"id": 7, "text": "If you like gangster movies and you want to watch one that doesn't follow the same story as every single other one you'll like it. It made me laugh and made me say, Oh s$@t a couple times."}, {"id": 8, "text": "Granted it isn't going to win any awards but some of the reviews were straight up brutal - especially people who wouldn't like this kind of movie anyway and you can tell by their reviews.This was something half way decent to watch while waiting for some good movies to come back around. I gave it an extra star just because I thought it needed a little push."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I liked all characters except David. Felt like he was scary and lacked bravery (speaking nicely). Really excepted a different story line and more action and roughness on CreeperS (Shia LaBeouf's) end, however I still liked him as a character. The story line should've been written differently IMO."}, {"id": 10, "text": "It's generic. I thought it would be better. The women in the movie are beautiful. The story is generic. It's every hood movie ever made. I've been drinking and couldn't even get into it. Nothing stands out and makes it special. It's just a movie."}, {"id": 11, "text": "So the movie starts off interesting, with both characters equally important in their own ways, however, is suddenly turns into a hodgepodge of scenes. I don't really know if it was edited this way purposely or not, but many scenes seems like to time had passed by. It really distracted me from finding the movie interesting anymore and I ended up fast-forwarding until the end."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Best actor in it was Shia LaBeouf, creeper. Unfortunately he gets killed off pretty quickly. I expected him to be in the trenches with his partner and getting his hands dirty because that is what the trailer had portrayed. Speaking of the trailer, if you have seen it, then you have seen literally every scene shia LaBeouf was in, not very much. If you're watching this for shia LaBeouf, you will be disappointed. Side comment, I am not sure why he got the tattoo, I dont recall seeing it at all in the movie."}, {"id": 13, "text": "Some good bits which were watchable The main problem is that the 2 main actors just mumble all their lines, and I had to watch the movie with subtitles."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Weak plot, weak writing. Very messy. Great actors but let down by the poor story."}, {"id": 15, "text": "I really enjoyed the flick. Definitely not as bad as most are making it out to be. I definitely think it could have been longer to tell more of the story. A lot did seem rushed. I actually like the fact that Shia wasn't the leading man. I think both main characters did great. It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. I would definitely watch again."}, {"id": 16, "text": "A different look at life in the city, not everyone will understand because they don't have a source of reference. If you want a good movie with action and not predictable give this one a try. This movie isn't for everyone but it doesn't deserve all these negative reviews. Watch a movie that isn't predictable and will be a good time to watch, definitely check this out."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Another very watchable David Ayers LA hood flick. It's not no harsh times, the watch, street kings or training day but it's decent. I highly recommend you check it out online if you can."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Yea the budget wasn't big and We all know Shia LaBeouf is a tool but he is a decent actor and the story actually wasn't terrible.. Could the acting have been better, Absolutely.. But given the budget and mostly no names it was pulled off pretty good.. A story about corrupt and illegal business dealings that then turns into one man's revenge for what is done to his family the story is actually decent. Ignore the mostly negative reviews and give this a chance if you are a fan of organized crime action.. Give Shia a chance"}, {"id": 19, "text": "This movie is poorly made. There isnt any character development. Bobby Soto is not a lead actor. Una mierda Una mierda Una mierda I havent finished the movie and had to write its una mierda"}, {"id": 20, "text": "A lot of people giving criticism on a movie they can't relate to. This movie depicts how it really is. Something that has been hidden for so long. If you grew up in Cali and lived the lifestyle you know this is as real as it gets..."}, {"id": 21, "text": "Shia was surprisingly the best part of the movie. This looked like a student film because they threw in every camera angle out there. Spoiler alert... once Shia dies everything goes way down hill. Worst $7.99 I've spent in a long time. Save your money... if you're really curious, just wait til it's free like next week."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Wasn't bad liked it.

No..but definitely not as bad as some of these reviews are making it out to be. I agree the end seemed rushed and Shia's character wasn't the main character like we thought he was going to be, but still a pretty good movie overall. Have an extra star to counter all the hate."}, {"id": 25, "text": "I will say that this movie and especially Shia LaBeouf's part in it was a little overhyped but it's not as bad as these other reviews are saying. I say Shia LaBeouf part and it was a little overhyped because he just doesn't get as much screen time as you thought he would. He's great in this movie, he is totally believable. I will say this is a standard La gangster film. It's not going to break any records but this is not a bad movie. At least it's work a little bit more then the collective reviews that IMDb reviewers have given it."}, {"id": 26, "text": "I couldn't finish this movie. Everything about the movie was trying so hard to be cool and badass. The acting and dialogue from LaBeouf and Soto was embarrassing to watch. I finally turned it of at one point where a 'scary' boss asks to speak to his underling and proceeds to quietly laugh into the phone before hanging up. Very intimidating... and cringe worthy. You'll see what I mean if you make it that far into this garbage. I'll be very impressed if you make it to the end."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Hugely underated movie. Could have been better? Of course but the performance of Shia makes it just above average"}, {"id": 28, "text": "It could've been longer, it could've done w/ a bigger budget, it could've used some character or story development but, overall, a solid movie. I liked it. There's a character in this movie w/ the same name and played by the same actor as one in Training Day, I wonder if there was intention behind this coincidence?"}, {"id": 29, "text": "Deep, introspective - asking the big quesions of how far can you stretch your humanity, until you're no longer human. Gritty, stylized and unpleasant at times, but that's the point. Low budget to be sure - but they make the most of what they have. Very well made film."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Go look..as soon as he started incorporating minorities playing lead roles, his ratings started scrambling... just check. Now to the movie; it is ok! I think there's good build up to an outcome mostly predictable yes, and while he tries to not make it so predictable, it ends up like that. I think the first two acts of the movie were actually being well constructed, but then the last act seems rushed - it could be that there was not enough script development to fill in or studio pressure to cut the movie run time - and the ending is overly simple. But one can still enjoy the effort, the diversity in the movie and, the possibility of understanding the world he tried to portray. I liked Bobby Soto as lead; he pushed himself hard to bring depth to the role and for most part feels credible, and Shia LaBeouf, he is good too, finally has the kid feel stripped off him and it feels great."}, {"id": 31, "text": "Shia will be hating those tattoos for the rest of his life because the shame he will feel every time he looks in the mirror and remembers how bad the movie tanked if i could give it half a star i would better luck next time"}, {"id": 32, "text": "This movie is by far one of the best I've seen recently. It's not the same old b***s*** storyline with a happy ending. It's not always easy to watch, but for those in the know...this movie hits home. I have to believe that the people giving this a low rating watched it solely because of Shia LaBeouf. They watched it thinking it would be one like one of his other projects. While I approached this film knowing next to nothing about it and was pleasantly surprised to see Shia in it. This movie isn't about him or his character. It's about something so much deeper and if you don't get it, you won't like it. It's that simple."}, {"id": 33, "text": "I only rate films on IMDb and don't write reviews but since there's so many negative reviews aka haters, here I am. If you enjoy gritty cinema, know someone or you yourself are familiar with street code, or just plain like crime films genre - you will completely understand this film. They do the same thing with Tyler Perry films because they can't relate, they spread negativity and horrible reviews. Shia and the cast did a wonderful job! I laughed, flinched, and cried. Without too many spoilers, the real reason people are hating is because of the films messages. Some people don't like to see the black and brown pride. Some people may be confused and not understand how a criminal can be portrayed as a man of faith, a good man. This film is not for them. This film is for us and we will make it a classic, like we do all of our other films."}, {"id": 34, "text": "I came into this not have high expectations because of the terrible reviews. Honestly this film is for a certain type of person. First, a person who loves Los Angeles and everything associated including the criminality and gangs that are intertwined. Second, if you love the film Training Day and Sicario and like Shia then your in for a treat! Yes there is gore and extreme violence but that's been around in action since the early 90's.I have to admit I'm a huge Shia Labeouf fan and that was the motivation behind watching this but David Ayer is a fantastic director too. Long live LA!"}, {"id": 35, "text": "Gritty, confronting, violent movie. The story was well written, mix of Sicaro/ Savages/ Resoviour Dogs and Training Day kinda feel. Well acted, Shia's character will probably become a cult classic.If you like correcting ppl and telling them what they can and can't do, say, how they show say and what is acceptable... become a language teacher, don't bash movies with reviews.Movies are an art form. You don't like a painting don't look at it, you don't go bashing the artists with reviews telling them what they can and can't paint. Same is with movies.Definitely worth watching and you'll probably end up watching it again if your ok with graphic violence."}, {"id": 36, "text": "Not sure the hate here. The main character was sympathetic and the 2 deaths were certainly unexpected. I would have liked to see the movie end the way needed with the loop closed."}, {"id": 37, "text": "You can tell that David Ayer directed the film. With the los angeles location. This was a brutal film (especially shia LaBeouf's death and conejo death scene too. Could of been a lil bit better but overall...i enjoyed it and really liked seeing shia lebeouf play the role pf a psychopath cholo."}, {"id": 38, "text": "Movie got some lil bad choreographies BUT boy, loved the story line. It really was captivating and man, loved Shia LaBeouf and his performance not forgetting his wicked dialogues, wished more for his character though.

Don't get all the hate. Not great but far from terrible."}, {"id": 40, "text": "A lot of people hate this movie because they dont understand it. The movie shows a different world that most people will never be exposed to."}, {"id": 41, "text": "Stop comparing every movie to citizen kane or godfather. You guys complain about the acting. I didn't grow up in the hoods of LA. But I'm pretty sure a lot of these gangsters weren't well educated and some of them don't articulate very well. They probably speak very choppy and are not charming or funny. It's probably very awkward and scary to be around them. I thought that came off very well. And Shia lebouf was amazing. The violence I thought seemed real enough. I never seen someone get their head stomped in so I couldn't tell you how real it was. I'm sure if I did, I'd say oh man this looks like a movie, right before I pissed my pants and ran away. Sometimes a movie is just a gritty real look into these underworlds and their misguided loyalty, values, and bravery. So don't go in expecting Oscar bait. You're not going to get it. Especially with a David Ayer film. I thought it was Excellent."}, {"id": 42, "text": "This movie was one of the best I've seen in a long time.. reminds me of end of watch... THIS movie was great suspenseful and keeps your palms sweating.. amazing work Shia La'beouf"}, {"id": 43, "text": "Fire movie front to back. Most people that hate on this movie probably ain't familiar with the LA Chicano lifestyle. Only knock on the movie is that it was too short imo. When I saw they cast shia as a sureno I thought it'd be forced and wack but he pulled it off like a mf. Creeper reminds me of a lot of homies from the neighborhood, great acting."}, {"id": 44, "text": "This website won't let me use any profanity but I swear on everything I love this movie is so freaking dope.

Nine because we wish it was longer !!!"}, {"id": 47, "text": "Weak plot? weak writing? messy? Wow. Talk about killing a good movie. Acting was good for what it was portraying. This was not a Tom Hanks its A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood type of movie. It was an action movie, with lots of violence. That kind of movie and it was well done. No you don't learn from this movie other than you want to have nothing to do with selling drugs. It was entertaining. Acting was good. I would give it an 8 for the type of movie it was representing."}, {"id": 48, "text": "This was a good movie.. not Oscar worthy but it was a really movie... give it a chance... pretty intense and very emotional.. can't trust critics these days along with everyone who thinks they are critics.. this movie isn't a 10 but im giving it that to make up for the 1s it received from haters. I would say it is a 7.5 and if everyone gave it an honest review I believe that's where it would stand."}, {"id": 49, "text": "I loved it. Good beginning to end. Loved seeing the gang members from the past lol. Don't get the hate. Just enjoy."}, {"id": 50, "text": "I don't really comprehend the negative reviews as there is nothing wrong with this film - any rating below a five is unwarranted and unfair, although I am admittedly a fan of the gangster film genre. I could see critiquing some minor points, such as the pacing, but overall this film holds up very well and does a great job of capturing the gang atmosphere without resorting to stereotypes. The characters seem authentic, although the brutality might be somewhat exaggerated. The cartels are obviously extremely cruel and violent but this film takes place in America where in reality the violence is generally less severe. It's about two enforcers who mostly do routine collections but get caught up in an escalating turf war. It's a great street-level perspective on cartels operating in America and a great watch for a fan of such material. As an added bonus, it has a great Latin Rap soundtrack. Those who give it a low rating probably should be watching something else, just as I avoid all the comic superhero movies because I don't like them, although I never claim they are bad."}, {"id": 51, "text": "Was raised around similar circumstances and Shia did a great job! Only thing wish he had a bigger part. Great movie love the unity! Kudos to the director on this. That's what the world needs."}, {"id": 52, "text": "This film is just BAD! Awful acting, awful story, just AWFUL! Shia LaBeouf does not even save this. Don't bother!"}, {"id": 53, "text": "The trailer is misleading because it makes the film look like it's a Shia Lebeouf movie, but he's actually in a supporting role. There are a few very slow scenes and it's extremely violent, but, overall, I really like The Tax Collector because of its story. It's a fresh take on the gangster movie genre."}, {"id": 54, "text": "Wao wao... Horrible!!!! The worst tax collector in gang history. Horrible script, directing, the acting was sooooo baddddd my gosh, Shia's character was the only thing you wanted to see and well if you see the movie you will understand. The freaking cgi for the action you could see it that it was computer generated, I mean come on. Not recommended at all. The funny thing is Shia got a real freaking tattoo for this trash of a movie."}, {"id": 55, "text": "I really don't get the bad reviews this movie is getting, David Ayer makes cool action/crime movies which don't pull their punches and it's refreshing to see in an age where big studios are watering down their movies to get a PG rating so they can make more money. Shia LaBeouf was excellent and he was actually very intimidating which is something i didn't think i would ever say about him and Bobby Soto did a good job too, he really sold the emotions his character was going through.Is it as great as other movies he's made like Fury and End Of Watch? Not really but does it deserve a 4.7 on IMDB? Hell no, this is a fine movie which fans of this genre should enjoy. If you're a fan of action and crime thrillers then check out it, you might be surprised."}, {"id": 56, "text": "Awesome movie. Watched it 3 times so far. Everything about it is awesome. The violence was too much but that's about it. Lots of girls with big boobies, super suspenseful, etc. Loved it."}, {"id": 57, "text": "I'm no movie critic. I've seen the reviews for this movie before watching. If your like me and enjoy a good thriller/shooter, I thought this was a pretty good movie!! Some people get too critical, but if you're an avg person who enjoys good action, this is a great movie and you will like it!"}, {"id": 58, "text": "Quite possibly one of the best hood movies I've seen in a while, majority of the people being negative about it don't know what they're on about.

Shia was best part and best actor. After the killed him it all went down hill. But come on. Some people gave it a 1. Seriously? Way better than that."}, {"id": 63, "text": "When I first heard about Shia taking this lead role I asked myself if he could pull it off. But, i am surprised this went the way it did with David Ayer leading the way as director and writer.This script, particularly character development, was absolutely cringe worthy. The lead roles have this battle of trying to act with a horribly written script and imho couldnt pull it off.Truly unbalanced and not the quality you saw in Training Day."}, {"id": 64, "text": "It seems like David Ayer films get a lot of negative heat these days even though he has some solid movies in the past. End of Watch was an amazing movie, Street Kings was solid, Fury was good, and Bright was decent. It seems people have been hating on him since Suicide Squad.I've been waiting for this movie come since I'm a huge fan of Shia and he does not disappoint. I wished they did more with his character because he was the movie. Bobby Soto (David) was also good but the rest of the cast is where the acting gets weaker even though I did enjoy Cinthya Carmona (Alexis). Jimmy Smits part was very small which sucks cause he is talented. George Lopez was completely horrible, he never needs to play a crime boss ever again. This movie is not as good or as gritty as Street Kings but it is a solid watch. I would give the movie itself a 6 with Shia bumping it up to a 7. If you are a fan of Shia, you need to watch the movie."}, {"id": 65, "text": "What has happened? Shia LaBeouf. Transformers. I expected more. Why sink to this level? Is he desperate? Why mix with amateurs? Does he need money?

At that point we cared more about not getting stuck in traffic at the exit than the ending of a terrible movie."}, {"id": 67, "text": "A movie is about full of bad guys, but you see the first gun shot at 56th minute. Full of ego around all the time but no one is doing anything, just talking.LaBeouf, kept talking and he got shot at the first gun fight and then dead. What was that?What about the tatoo? We kept seeing news about his tatoo, his commitment but you dont see it in the movie. Only once when he is dying, covered full of bloood.Man, also he as supposed to be scary but with those ears he had in the movie and the size of his body he is like the wizard from pixars onward.Complete waste of time... How come all these people worked on this movie can not see that their creation is nothing but wate of time."}, {"id": 68, "text": "The film starts off alright, but quickly descends into confusion and boredom.

If you liked Sicario and Sabotage then you'll enjoy The Tax Collector."}, {"id": 71, "text": "Great movie! Incredible actors. I see a lot of critics criticizing the movie.

Nice film shia!!"}, {"id": 73, "text": "The Tax Collector has an extremely familiar and unoriginal plot but is still a good crime drama overall. Bobby Soto is mostly great, if a little wooden at times and he has sufficient chemistry with Shia LaBeouf who is reliably great if a little underutilized. David Ayer's direction is good and reasonably stylish, although it can occasionally look cheap in the more action packed sequences. The soundtrack and the music by Michael Yezerski are both good."}, {"id": 74, "text": "Movie is dope. It isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, there are some plot holes but overall the acting was great. I was surprised by Shia's and Conejo's performance.

It got a few screams out of me! In the end I love that the message was of good vs evil, and good always prevails.

It tries so hard to make you believe you're being introduced to a 'gangster' lifestyle. But it tries to do so with wannabe-tough guys played by actors that aren't convincing(and that apparently have never met real tough guys or fail miserably to impersonate them) and a script that produces paperthin characters that never develop any real depth. Any treaths make during the movie feel superficial and have no gravity to them, making them sound more like comedic lines.In short it's a movie produced by people utterly unfamiliar with the subjects the movie is supposed to be about."}, {"id": 83, "text": "To this day I still don't know who they hire to make a good movie have such low ratings.

I went for it despite the heavy tones of violence, gangsters, tattoos, profanities, not that there were no good movies with these themes in the past.

I couldn't take him and the other lead serious. Watching two pretty boys collect money from real cholo's looked unrealistic. The movie started to get ridiculous when they go to the club to meet Conejo. Although, it was great to see George Lopez's big ugly head in a cooler, I didn't understand how he got kidnapped right under the tax collector's noses. He was literally sitting at a birthday party surrounded by people in one scene. Then his head in a cooler the next. Anyways, the tax collector's decide to reject Conejo's proposal, which meant going to war. The very next day they go back to the mechanic shop. Why after starting a war would you go back to the one place where you'd be easy to find? leading the movie straight down the toilet. Creeper gets kidnapped and murdered. Creeper did absolutely nothing in this film. They try to make him look like this total badass, then kill him off before we get to see any action. It would of been great to see Creeper and David take revenge in the end. But nope! that doesn't happen. Really disappointing movie and sad story. 5 stars from me.

The plot and dialogue seem to be what a poser would come up with. From the main premise of gangs paying tax to some higher authority to the way it is collected to the people who collect it, not remotely true or portrayed in a way that's believable.The beginning was disappointing.The middle was disappointing.The ending was disappointing.It was beautifully filmed and there did not seem to be a lack of money or expertise for any of the acting, costumes, locations, vehicles, etc.It is just dumb. If you want to know what gang life is like, watch this movie and you still won't know. The funniest part is the portrayal of Shia Lebeouf's character as some bad-a** killer and he get's taken out like an amateur. The dialogue is incredibly off between the two tax collectors, do you meditate?. So dumb.The home life of the main character is so completely unbelievable it ruins everything that comes after.

Shia had his hands on the gun Everytime he met someone or collected money but yet you don't see him shooting or beating up anyone. Also you don't see any actual killing in this movie.

I wanted this to be a other version of Harsh Times with 2 friends that are Tax Collectors that's what I wanted but I can't believe how in earth David Ayer messed this up badly no wonder this film gets a 4.7 sadly I thought this film would take things simple, and it's film will be how it was like with David Ayer work in his previous films I thought it would be like Training Day or Harsh Times type of genre but in expect those 2 are Hustlers, Hustling people for money to earn it back. he just needs better writing because their are no other writers David Directed and Written this film he needs bit of support to have better writers hire Kurt Wimmer or Max Landis who worked with David Ayer they are writers from Street Kings &amp; Bright because I will be curious to know what other writers would think and how they turn this film differently then to David Ayer idea if you getting my point. . Ayer can't just keep this film very simple why does it have to be that hard to know how to keep characters alive the ones they don't deserve to die and could made better choices and choose wisely to keep characters alive and write film and fix up story follows 2 Tax Collectors witch meaning the collect Tax from other Gangs, people anybody that has money that people needs to payback to those 2 Collectors they Hustling everyday to people to earn money that people need to payback from. David (Bobby Soto) and Creeper (Shia LaBeouf) he plays a different type of character he is like gangster scary type of guy that you don't wanna mess with this is something I wish he could of played character like this in another film but in this. David has a family 2 kids and wife Alexis (Cinthya Carmona) he has Uncle who runs a car wash Uncle Louis (George Lopez) David is a very successful man who is rich guy has family and has a close friend creeper they work their asses off to collect money to start to middle first and second act of film was perfect the cinematography, location feeling type of film where it's filmed at a hoody type of gangster film like with Ayer films is Fantastic, and acting performance is perfect Shia acting was soo great he plays a different type of character with gangster look on him suit, tattoos, he is one hell of creepy guy tape of look that just you don't wanna mess with not because he is called creeper but in another way he is like devil type of character he plays way how he played it was 10 out 10 in Transformers type of role or Holes or any of other movies he play's either prick or nerd that's always like that I like Shia LaBeouf as actor as well I enjoyed some of his films, but him in this film was something a lot more different gangster type of role to it I loved his character. film was great to start to middle 1 and 2 act seeing those 2 guys acting performance out standing that's was worth of acting. then to villains Conejo (Jose Conejo Martin) plays a evil gangster type who uses Black Magic spell he uses. he wants his money to earn back from those Tax Collectors upends the business from those Tax Collectors Gata (Cheyenne Rae Hernandez) plays a villain chick witch I liked her role she was an interesting type of character I wanted to see more in film and get to know her more often but it's more on main villain Conejo. when s*it hits fan Uncle was trying to take down Conejo with his men then later you find out his dead with his head in box so then I am like why David could get his family his wife and kids tell them get out of town deal with other gangs or cult whatever they were but no I don't mind car wash action scene it was pretty good action scene worth watching for action keeps your head up then in 3rd act this is where David Ayer F up everything I Don't even know how in earth he is happy with 3rd act of film??eventually suddenly film destroys everything Creeper gets killed off for no reason I don't see why, I don't see why should Alexis should get killed off as well I mean like they could written this film a lot better too me it's either Ayer rushed this film soo much what was he thinking? did he think it was great idea? I don't freaking know how in earth he agree to this direction of film how in earth did he destroy 3rd act of film? Shia and Cinthya Carmona should been kept their characters alive but sadly no because writers wanna screw up and destroy film because they are dry and out of ideas film leaves you dry to 3rd act then David wants revenge because his wife, his uncle, his close friend dies that was Shia LaBeouf I just don't know why should Shia Labeouf character and Cinthya Carmona character alive I don't see them getting killed off in film for no reason wasted Shia Labeouf character I thought he stole movie not Bobby Soto he did fine in film but I thought Shia should have been lead keep his character alive and Cinthya character alive but no writers wanna take it very difficult idea where they are out of ideas. so after David wanted his revenge he hires Bone (Cle Sloan) who is in Blood gang he explains everything what happened he agree to work with David to take down Conejo final action showdown nothing too special then ending wasn't bad ending it was just flat when you see it your gonna say what the heck what else happened?? this could been written better this film is written &amp; Directed by David Ayer he could hired writers he kinda rushed the story and script of film he f up everything in 3rd act of film he could written it better or if he doesn't know what else he can write or if he goes dry hire great, good writers of film they could write this better David Ayer always keeps his films very simple but in some reason he could not keep this film simple I don't know why but in my guessing he was out of ideas that's why he decided to destroy 3rd act of film he could done a lot many things better of this film could been written better 5.10 things I liked about characters, performance, action, cinematography of film, location feel to it but rest of it where it screwed up with a fault ending of film killed it. this is a film I could watch it as time waster not something I would watch it like 50 times in row this film had half of good things then to middle too many missing screws witch it doesn't look too great."}, {"id": 138, "text": "I enjoyed the movie for what it was.

I felt like I was there at the crime scene looking at the aftermath of something real and not in a tacky gore-fest way either. This submerged me deeper into the main character's conflict from then on and by the end I found myself asking what I would do over and over. That, for me, made up for all the it was lacking.

I guess the reason for this was because if they made a trailer that represented the film accurately then there would have been considerably less interest. There just wasn't any substance here. Instead, it was filled with typical David Ayer imagery and cliche. Even the scenes where gun fighting was going on at were just trite. The main character bust into a room with his automatic weapon pointed at the 2 people in Bed and miraculously misses both of them...obviously because there needed to be more of a build up to add some drama for the conclusion but drama can't be built up if there's no compelling story. There were two things about it I liked though. Although Shia's character never really got fleshed out, I felt he was great w what he had to work with.

Also, the special appearance by the black gang leader from End of Watch was a neat surprise. I have 2 problems with this film: 1) The quickness in which George Lopezs character is killed - in a scene where he tells his son he's headed out to deal with the rival gang leader, a female comes in literally 2 seconds later telling his son hes been captured and to meet with the rival gang leader who has his severed head already in a cooler. 2) the wimpy way Shia 's bad boy character &amp; his crew went out - they didn't even put up a fight!

Not unfamiliar territory for him; he did End of Watch, Training Day, Street Kings and the very first installment of the now blockbuster franchise, The fast and The Furious. So, theoretically, he should have been able to write and direct a really strong, really successful film in this genre. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The Tax Collector started out strong but at about 35 minutes in, it fell apart and I found myself extremely bored. The saving grace of this film is Creeper, played by Shia LaBeouf. He was dark, mysterious, ultra-violent and extremely interesting, but he was only a second fiddle to Bobby Soto's main character, David Cuevas, an enforcer turned rising crime boss in the LA gang scene.

However, with this gangster lifestyle the calm before the storm does not last for ever. A tragedy leads for one of the antagonists to go down a darker path from which he cannot return. The way in which it is done it is unfathomably unbelievable &amp; film logic is implemented in that you know he cannot be killed. The suspense is nullified due to this fact. However, the action scenes are a mixture between of fashion killings and matrix style slowed down bullet time like a John Woo's action film.

Like other users have mentioned the trailer is misleading, peppered with the 'better' scenes and wrongly spotlighting Shia LaBeouf as the main protagonist.The character development was thin at best. The Protagonist 'David' is essentially a conflicted anti-hero but we're supposed to care just because he has a family, kisses his wife a lot and decides one day enough is enough? If he was really in that line of work he would be a lot more scarier and psychotic rather than reading off some 'cool' lines to scare the other criminals. Screenwriting 101 - Show don't tell.And where was Shia is all of this? Standing next to him, looking tough, always threatening but never really fulfilling his character's potential. And Shia talking about meditating and zen-like philosophy? What?? Are we going to see a yoga scene next? David and Creeper in the studio wearing spandex and juicing together...It seems to me this should've been Shia's movie. Less talk, more Creeper taking the reigns, doing more badass stuff and David doesn't like it. Create conflict between the brotherhood dynamic. Think Christian Bale and Freddy Rodriguez's relationship in Harsh Times (a great movie I might add). Maybe the Gandalf character (or whatever he was called) puts a hit on Creeper and David has to suck it up. Thats the business. Whatever. Something that could've built on David's conflicted conscience, not just loose plot points.Plot-wise it was comparable to a bad finger painting. You could kind of see what it was about but was muddled, sloppy and incomprehensible at the same time. Made me wonder if this was something David Ayer wrote when he was a kid and found at the bottom of a pile of good scripts.The action scenes were entertaining at times however it seemed like these were just filler scenes to mask some terrible acting.Overall, I guess like other reviews I had high hopes for this as I'm a fan of David Ayer but something about this fundamentally was off. Was it rushed through production and editing? Did David Ayer actually get a say in the script development? Was the budgeting decided by an accounts manager with a gambling habit? Did they shut their eyes and just point when casting? I don't know.I guess if you don't care about story structure, character development and just want to see some action whilst doing your own finger paintings then this is for you.

That being said, his character should have at least had the chance to actually do something gangsterish before getting taken out. Next, the plot was pretty generic with essentially two big crews going after each other, and it was pretty hard to believe that after the half dozen or so guys at their little sit-down all got killed, there was NO ONE else to come help?? Not exactly a very powerful gang if the whole thing can get taken out in seconds. I did like how the Bloods came to his aid in the end (don't ask me why) but the ending left a lot to be desired in my opinion. After all, Mr. Demonic Gangbanger did say he was just following orders so why did we never get to find out who was pulling his strings? Sure seems like the cartel will still be after him and take him out soon after the movie ends.

That being said you could feel his artwork present In this piece. Definitely well done and even though I am a huge fan of Shia and totally biased in the right ways. I feel like this role he played was captivating. Similar but not close enough to Christian bales in harsh times. I imagine Shia took it that way but wasn't given the proper return. Shia was top notch but the story was David Ayers most unthentic piece. If that is even a word. What I'm trying to say is David dropped the effort of making it 110% realistic and instead swapped it for WHATS most current: which is okay and it worked. However I don't think I have ever gave David Ayers work an 8 before. It's always 10s across the chart. If it was any other writer or director I probably would have only gave it a 7.

You're welcome. I mean, who thought this movie was a good idea? Who sat down around a table and said yeah, let's tell the story of some gang guys collecting their taxes until it all goes wrong. Were they under the impression it's never been done before? Did they feel they had something new to offer this overcrowded genre? Because if they did, they were sorely mistaken. It just lurched from one cliche to the next; Main character collects from the nastiest gangs in LA - but really, he's a teddy bear with a heart of gold. Ugh. A family man. Ugh. And a man of God and morals. Ugh. We had awful buddy chats in the car (a wee laugh about the fact they're psychopathic killers). Then we had moments with the kids to drive home the idea they're really good guys. Cut to a martial arts training montage reminiscent of bad 80's straight to video action flicks. Flashbacks to happier days like something a teenager would do in a 48hour film fest (but at least they'd do it with a sense of irony). And if that wasn't bad enough, the writers even added some clumsy exposition to make sure we could keep up (with an infantile plot a 4 year old could follow?). There was violence sure - if you like that kind of thing, but it was artlessly done and for the most part, unnecessary . Acting? Ugh. Art direction and grade. Ugh.

Yes there is a lot of weak writing and some of the scenes seem out of place but it is still entertaining enough nonetheless. The beginning starts out a lil dull but the film builds momentum as it gets going. Personally, I feel it would have been better as a film about Creeper with him as the main character and with David as the second to main. Shia Labeouf was immersed in his role as Creeper and he turned in the best performance of all the actors. Most people that watch this movie will be coming for Shia but staying for the mean spirited final act. Shia usually plays some variation of himself in literally every role he has ever done except for Honey Boy and sort of now this film. Shia has seemed to lose himself in the character of Creeper, becoming a victim for the screen in a turn of horrifying gang related events, allowing himself to be scene in a humans most vulnerable state: helpless at the hands of a killer. All the while, though, he was still portraying a personality that isn't too far from his own, im sure. Overall this movie is really good and doesn't deserve the bad reviews. In ways it reminds me a lot of Spring Breakers and I was wondering when another movie with that feel would come out. The actor who played Conejo was quite good as his character was rather menacing, committing atrocious acts. The way he spoke and acted was very similar to that of Gucci Mane's character from Spring Breakers. They even smoked their cigarettes the same way and they are both rappers as well. I totally don't get the bad reviews for this film. Yea, it wasn't the best movie ever made but it is definitely a decent one. The 4.7 rating is wayy too low.

In this case, the movie has been trashed, for any other reason than it's quality. And obviously for some kind of different expectations than given.Being a spun-off to Training Day, this movie is pretty much gangster as you might expect. I just saw Training Day for a 4th time a few months back. Given, this one isn't on the same level or production, it ain't bad.It had some fun old gangster scenes with fun violence. Guns, women and drugs. La Familia, I get it. It is an easy movie, like a good Friday movie with some buds (both beer and friends) and a large pizza. I liked the paste in the movie and the soundtrack. It's a bit cheesy here and there, but I did not mind, as I did not know what to expect really. I don't watch trailers.Please, don't believe all the bad reviews, they don't give the movie justice. I'm not a super Shia LaBeouf fan, but I honestly think he did a pretty good job here. And, Jose Conejo Martin is just pure gangster to the bone. He got me excited and delivered a really evil and ugly part in the movie.Don't expect Training Day and don't expect a Denzel Washington worthy performance.

No, not really in terms of originality, but the action, performances and an interesting narrative. I must warn you in advance that if you're expecting Shia LaBeouf to completely dominate the movie, you might end up disappointed. He's mostly decent in his role, and so are most of the actors. David Ayer has directed the film pretty well and has kept the story quite simple. There's nothing extraordinary about it, other than it's, in simple words, entertaining. It's not too long either; 90 minutes is a fine duration for a film like this.The Tax Collector starts well and goes on well for the most of the first half. Some might find this slow but these bits are necessary to set the story up. Once the setup is done, it's nonstop action from there to the end. Gunfights are choreographed and shot in a stylish manner, and some raw hand-to-hand fighting is also neatly done. Needless to say, it's the highlight of the film and makes it intriguing. I'm speaking for myself when I say I really liked the film. As for others, I can only suggest viewers to expect less of a character driven film, as it seems to skimp on heavy character development. Nevertheless, it serves a decent and gripping plot as the backdrop for the stylish action sequences.It's not David Ayer's best film by any means, as his other action thrillers had both great action and intriguing stories while this one, on the other hand, just offers good action with some nice acting and a good, not great, plot. But that one issue isn't big enough to stop you from enjoying it if you like action movies. It's enjoyable, and I can't deny that. It really worked for me, and I had a sense of satisfaction when it ended."}, {"id": 323, "text": "Before we go into the hot streaming pile of garbage that is The Tax Collector, I think it's worth remembering that at one time writer/director David Ayer was responsible for the script of gritty cop thriller classic Training Day and also was in charge behind the camera of really quite good thrillers Fury &amp; End of Watch.His also responsible for downright atrocious films Bright and Sabotage but we could previously put them down to bad luck or mismanagement, but now Ayer's lack of ability to craft a coherent or well-put together feature is becoming a major concern.Originally planned for a mid-tier level cinematic release, The Tax Collector comes our way now courtesy of VOD/direct to disc releases and if there was something to be thankful for its that we never had to witness this crime against cinema on the big screen here in Australia as the charisma free Bobby Soto and the extremely method Shia LaBeouf get caught up in a seen a thousand times before story of family loving criminals that find their business mixing with pleasure when a big bad throws his hat in the ring to be the new kingpin.Much publicity was made around LaBeouf's role here as the loose-cannon tattoo clad Creeper but make no mistake, LaBeouf may as well not have shown up (and could've definitely completed this role without adding to his tattoo collection) as Ayer is more focused on exploring the trials of Soto's David who has his money rich world turned upside down by the appearance of Jose Conejo Martin's chicken hating Conejo, a blood-thirsty criminal hellbent on taking over L.A's drug world.It's a constantly nasty and bleak affair, filled with some of Ayer's worst ever dialogue I got a .38 on each ankle, .38 on my right, .25 on my left, chopper in the trunk, lockin' my belt, I'm on it! is just one such moment that is supposed to get the energy levels up but ends up making you turn your head in concern and the film is filled with a bunch of characters that are neither likable or interesting as Ayer's obsession with the Mexican criminal underworld finally culminating in this atrociously staged outing.The films best chance at being something worth enduring was to be found in LaBeouf's Creeper but he plays a backseat role to proceedings here as we instead get a lot of badly staged family life snippets of David and his offspring/wife that begins to turn into a generic and highly over the top revenge tale that goes too places that make little sense or create little interest as the film falters badly in almost every department.Final Say -A new low for Ayer whose obsession with a particular sub-genre and subject matter has culminated in this humiliating misfire, The Tax Collector is not worthy to be placed alongside its creator's more regarded works and wastes a locked and loaded A-lister on a underutilized character in the process.1/2 a beer cooler out of 5"}, {"id": 324, "text": "Yet another movie poorly rated because the majority of audiences no longer know how to watch movies. If Robert Downey Jr. doesn't show up at the end to explain the payoff, through a moral truism, most movie watchers seem to be completely lost. Ugh.To be very clear: this move has good character development, a solid story, and realistic dialogue.I think one of the main challenges that people might have had is a lack of connection or understanding to the subject matter. I have a friend who used to be MS-13 and he said, years ago, exactly what this movie is about: you can't play around with being a good person in this world. You either live a good life, doing good things, or you be a gangster and it's all you are. If you try to be a good person in a bad life, the evil will get you. You may get out, but there WILL be a cost.That's what this movie is about. We see the two main characters being developed, David prays, and claims God is watching over him. Meanwhile, his buddy Creeper, refuses Christianity, and even invokes eastern meditation. They're relatively good guys in a bad world. They're involved in bad business, but they have good sides to them. More to the point, David is a relatively good guy; he collects money for gangs and threatens people who don't pay, but he acknowledges God and shows his kindness at timesUnfortunately for David, as we learn, the world he exists in IS evil. I won't give any spoilers, but there are costs to existing in the world he operates in, and you can fool yourself that you're a good guy and going to be ok, but if you try to be good while doing bad work, you'll be eaten alive by those who are dedicated to evil.The ironic complaints to me are about the dialogue. I've grown up around a lot of Mexican gangs as well as a couple friends who were MS-13, and I thought the dialogue was very authentic. As soon as David and Creeper were in their SUV talking back and forth I cringed at how much it made me feel like I were hanging out with some of my old buddies. The problem is that most people don't know how these guys really talk, I have to imagine, and ironically, movies try to sound like real life, while real life gangsters and such try to sound like they're ultra hard. So it's sort of a funny cyclical thing where if you want to sound authentic, then you also have to sound pretty cheesy since the real things are constantly posturing and trying to sound like the movies.One last note. As I was watching and feeling like the writer/director knew his stuff, I was wondering if they would get into a key aspect of the gang life that doesn't get any attention (a very dark aspect of it), and I was surprised to see they actually did get into it, which also made for the roughest scene in the movie. But again, it goes to show they knew their stuff when they made this movie.I definitely recommend it to anyone who is into gang life/organized crime type movies. If you're not, there may not be enough to make this worthwhile to you since it's definitely a dive into the moral plays in the criminal underworld.Final note: I don't like movies that praise criminals, and some might think that's what's going on in this movie. IT IS NOT. This is a study on an aspect of life that most people don't relate to. What might seem pointless to some viewers is everyday life to others."}, {"id": 325, "text": "I am reviewing this within hours of it being released. Currently there are 30 total IMDb votes. My guess is when the score settles down after enough people watch it, it'll hover around a 5.8. But, if you like violent crime movies, I recommend checking this out. It is not very long, so there is not too much opportunity cost (it's about 85 minutes I think).The dialogue did come off kind of tongue-in-cheek at times. Shia did great, as always. Even though I did enjoy being entertained by the movie, I wish it played out differently than it did. I am not saying it has a bad ending. The ending was okay for me and where most of the action is. I wish certain characters in the film played a bigger role in the overall resolve of the movie. This might not make sense, but if you watch it, you'll probably know what I am talking about.The visuals/cinematography was good. The acting was mostly good. The dialogue was hit or miss. Some of the stuff that was said was kind of corny. One non-spoiler example of corny dialogue would be Take this gun, it has a lot of murders on it. The way that line was delivered made me cringe. There are a few other examples of that in the movie.I also feel like the movie did not come full circle. Sure, there might be a tiny bit of a twist...but I would have liked to see the actual last clip to have been in a different setting to bring the film full circle. Again, this probably makes no sense unless you've seen it and remember how the film begins.It is hard to write a review without spoiling anything. Basically, if you like shoot 'em up crime movies, it's worth checking out. The characters do not go into much depth, but at an 85 minute runtime, that's kind of expected.I feel like this movie would have been much better if movie theaters were still open; and they had to run test screenings. Maybe a couple changes could/would have been made to improve the film...but I know that Covid, and the realization of a lower ROI of this film without a box office, may not justify investing too much additional work into it.It will entertain you, but it could have been better....and it probably would have been if Covid wasn't making things more challenging for filmmakers at this time. It's worth a watch, and I think a lot of frustration from the critics is due to the potential this film had. With more character development, some dialogue changes, maybe change up a couple scenes...there is a lot of potential for a great movie. It did feel a little rushed, but hey, I was entertained.6/10. That's what I give movies that entertain me, but won't stick with me for very long. Worth watching, but probably not worth re-watching.

Though film came out (painfully) average in my book, the disappointment was felt deeply. Nice trailer, right, nice poster, solid director, interesting cast, so what happened? Nothing much happened, sadly. It is undoubtedly the script dragging The Tax Collector down the most. Ayer, whose love for the gang and street culture have been prominent in his movies, injected a little too much of said love in The Tax Collector. The film, having a shallow story and all too familiar character doings, relishes gloriously on the spiritual nature of gangsters, boasting morales left and right. Being as openly preaching as it is, some of the dialogue feels very staged. The core plotline moves at a snails pace and ends seriously lacking. Acting performances in The Tax Collector are decent, though feeling wasted on the background of all the flaws. Shia LaBeouf, who was another pull for me, was given only a supporting character whose role in the story and ending went underwhelmingly. The man got real tattoos for the role of Creeper. I hope the man is rolling with it nicely, for his sake.Cinematography also is not in any real way impressive or quality feeling, but the editing and original score are worse. Very shortly into the movie it's apparent that there's something funky with the editing, weird cuts, weird shot changes, nooks and crannies feeling a little off. It's not constant, but consistent enough. There's quite a lot of cheap dramatism displayed, random slow-mos, befitting and cheesy high stakes score pieces. The music overall is a lackluster. Honestly, too much about The Tax Collector simply feels like a TV movie.The Tax Collector hardly even justifies its own name, and is a gang movie that feels itself like a king of the underground, but is in fact a thug for hire. I can hardly recommend it to the audiences its aimed at, because I believe it has a real knack to elicit a pure sensation of disappointment. My rating: 4/10."}, {"id": 328, "text": "(3.5 out of 5 stars).The Tax Collector is a pretty fair crime drama film about David (Bobby Soto) and Creeper (Shia Labeouf) who are tax collectors that collect money from other gangsters.

Can be a little predictable with the direction it goes. Creeper and David are best friends that would die for each other. Even when things turn for the worse.The film is violent and gritty with its content. Like a brief torture scene. The action sequences was decent.The script is lacking the emotional depth with the characters. Which makes it difficult to care for when lives are at stake. Which the film really needed with the main characters.It was a pretty fair film if you enjoy gangster kind of films."}, {"id": 329, "text": "While it pulls no surprise punches, the greatest issue with The Tax Collector is that it doesn't add depth to any of the characters. Running in at just over 90 minutes, it feels that the film is rushed, and doesn't make the most of the fenetic actions scenes David Ayer is famous for, managing to only get one in extremely briefly.If more thought, time and money was put into the film, it could have been much more akin to End of Watch, but falls quite short of it. Short enough to call the film bad? I wouldn't say so. Shia LaBeouf carries his role as Creeper extremely well, but again this doesn't feel like it is explored nearly enough, but there's enough there to make this film a solid eh, it's okay.Given that there's a lot of significantly worse films out there with a higher rating e.g. The Evil Dead (2013), which has zero redeeming qualities, has abysmal acting, terrible script, garbage pacing etc coming in at a higher rating, I feel this film is overly criticized, although don't expect anything that's close to greatness."}, {"id": 330, "text": "When The Tax Collector starts, it feels as if writer-director David Ayer is headed back to his L.A crime roots.. in the same universe as Training Day, End of Watch, Street Kings, and Harsh Times. But no, it quickly turns into an unbelievably shallow gangster saga with dreadful dialogue, oozing machismo, a generic revenge plot, and stock characters. All the action is reserved for a climactic showdown which, by the time you get there, feels too blah. Out of all the cardboard gangsters we come across, only Shia LaBeouf (in a supporting role) manages to leave a wacky impression. A feral vibe could be felt from the guy.I'm not going to comment on the performances of the rest of the ensemble, or the uninspired soundtrack choices, or the overdose of violence. The Tax Collector feels more like a Michael Bay prototype (if you disregard his zillion explosions) and less like a gritty Ayer attempt. The writing, the cross-cut edits, the underused talent, the much-seen turf-war heroics - it's all just a giant, gory mess with nearly zilch payoff."}, {"id": 331, "text": "Much like great comedies, gangster movies seem to be very few and far between these days. From cartels to mobs, it really seems like television shows are covering the bases, leaving no room for a great film to break out. Of course, there are tons of movies like this either being made or trying to get off their feet, so that statement might be a little hyperbolic, but it just seems that way lately. The Tax Collector is the latest film from director David Ayer, which surprises me because I've really liked some of his in the past. Even though this definitely has his style written all over it, this film is kind of a mess.The basic premise is that a rival gang shows up to reclaim territory and David's (Bobby Soto) family is placed right in the crosshairs. This film could've easily been a lot simpler and focussed on the revenge aspect of the story, but it decided to play out more like a video game. There were multiple times where I felt like a writer from the Grand Theft Auto video games stepped in and decided to randomly throw in side quests for these characters to go on. This in turn made the movie feel very disjointed. Even though it has a short run time of 95 minutes, it still seems to lose focus on the core premise until the final act truly begins.The anchors of this film are the duo of Bobby Soto and Shia Labeouf. Labeouf has proven that he's better off investing himself in a meaty role in a smaller project and those films have ended up being some of my favorites from the last few years, so I wasn't surprised to see him deliver a great one yet again. Soto, having appeared in multiple episodes of television shows and a few smaller films, never stood out to me until now. His devoted performance to bouncing back and forth from criminal to family man felt very authentic and I felt for him by the end, even though his actions were atrocious at times. He's definitely an actor I'll be keeping on eye on.David Ayer is a very good director when he is working on the right project. Whether it was his superb effort on Fury or the very well-done End of Watch, it's lower-budget movies like this that get me excited. With that said, the story here deserved much better dialogue and the look of the movie felt too unfinished in my opinion. I get that Ayer was going for a grimy and simple aesthetic, but it felt too plain to me. I was engaged in the story at first, but eventually lost interest and didn't care all that much about who lived and who died in the end, because the screenplay just wasn't strong enough.In the end, The Tax Collector is a film that has some very well-rounded characters in a world of crime that was interesting to explore, but the movie just feels like a series of side plots that eventually leads the core character of David on a plot of revenge. That choice made the movie very disjointed and uninteresting as a whole. Some viewers may enjoy the characters enough to look past these issues, but this film just didn't give me enough substance. A nice effort from all involved, but it wasn't truly worth it by the end. Looking at the talent in front of and behind the camera, I must say that I came out of this film feeling slightly disappointed."}, {"id": 332, "text": "David Ayer is a bum; Bright was mediocre at best, but basically a carbon copy of Training Day, Tax Collector is basically a carbon copy of both of them, but not remotely realistic.Not saying the gang life doesn't exist in LA but no cops can be found for what seems like an entire day of gunfire, explosions, and killings until the end, when a house is on fire.Movie is dragged down by the cliched figurative portrayal of gang life. Underboss thinks he's hard but when faced with a challenge he runs away. Goon is hella suped up that he doesn't even realize he's puss. And, any other tough guy gets deleted before they can even do anything.No empathy for the loss of family as that was brought on by their own actions. This was a film I laughed as the hero had everything taken away from him.Old Blood set leader decides to ride for a rival gang; ok David is a good guy but what set leader is really going to put their gang on the line for someone elses' issues?The story was a mess, too fast, too short, too ambiguous, too sloppy.

Despite rumors of this film being good because Shia LaBeouf took it to the next step and got his whole body tattooed, doesn't save this film from being a huge plot hole of messes. The Tax Collector brings nothing to the table besides some well choreographed fight scenes, but that is at the very minimum. The bland vision behind this film is what really destroyed its potential, with lazy writing, sloppy directing, and acting. The only good thing that came from this movie was the potential that Shia had, his acting was top notch with the script he was handed. Of course we all know that Shia has a background of taking things a bit far, with cutting his face for fury, tattooing his whole front body, and even getting arrested while filming the peanut butter falcon. The sheer lack of chemistry between each character makes it seem as if I'm watching test footage. Stupid plot holes that add nothing to the story besides some cliche drama found in these types of movie. It's just such a shame to see a movie fail so badly, with a director that has a good background of directing and writing film. But, Shia's performance and some well choreographed fight scenes doesn't save this film from being an absolute train wreck of cinema."}, {"id": 334, "text": "This movie is like End of Watch for the bad guys of Los Angeles. Very much like End of Watch this movie had all sorts of potential. The L.A. crime vibe is undeniably cool in all periods of history and there is such a good opportunity here to make another Heat or Training Day with a Hispanic protagonist. This movie in concept seemed destined to win. The Tax Collector, however, fails miserably in seizing the opportunity and already belongs in a $5 DVD bargain bin at Walmart.Firstly, almost all of the characters are incredibly shallow and/or cliche. Sadly this includes the protagonist and all of his family, the antagonist and all of his crew, and even the great George Lopez's character Uncle Louis. Amazingly the one bright spot is Shia LeBeouf who plays an interesting antihero role. Though personally I find Shia intolerable in most movies, he actually is the one character with any depth in this movie and I grudgingly admit the part is well-acted.Secondly, the writing and plot is just as shallow and cliche as the characters. The dialogue is mostly horrible with some quirky Shia bromance moments being the only exception. The plot is also completely telegraphed and seemingly taken out of a bad 80s Steven Seagal movie. If you are the kind of person who can sense where plots are headed you will find yourself knowing exactly what will happen at least 10 minutes in advance.Thirdly, to compensate for uninteresting characters a predictable plot there is a lot of gratuitous violence in this movie. This type of crime movie is going to be violent, I get it, but the violence is poorly set up and executed dramatically in all cases... abrupt, cheap, repetitive and generally meaningless to the plot other than to broadly justify revenge.Finally, the tactical consulting and special effects are also of the lowest possible grade for a movie released this century. Gun handling never looks professional with any character. You will not believe most of the actors have ever held a gun before. For John Wick Keanu got months of training with world-renowned experts for each movie, seemingly these guys were just handed prop guns the day of the shoot and told Do the best you can. The effects were also atrocious. Some of the muzzle flashes look like they were drawn with Windows Paint.All in this was a terrible experience I don't recommend to anyone. If you like good movies you will not like this film. You should a) wait until this movie is free on your streaming service of choice, then b) only watch the first 30 minutes just to see Shia in all his absurd gangster glory, and then c) turn the movie off because you already know what's going to happen, thus saving yourself from the bloody mess (literally) that is the rest of this movie."}, {"id": 335, "text": "I am going to be concerned about that smoke detector until someone puts the battery back.Is Creeper his Christian name?Shia is an excellent actor.

Examples: of Pulp Fiction (hardcore gangsters in cars having conversation about not so gangstery-things), of Michael Man-movies (the protection racket money handling montage with the girl riding the motorcycle with the cool song behind it), of Shot Caller (the way the crime organization is organized, even from behind bars), and of Drive (extremely violent behaviour from guys portrayed as being not th\u00e1t bad).Sadly, while a combination of imitations can work, it just doesn't here, as while watching this you are constantly reminded of those other, better crafted scenes.Also, I can always bring up a little suspension of disbelief, but hey, don't think too little of me, movie making people. When, in the beginning of the movie, a guy gets in a car to drive to work in a tracksuit and suddenly wear a totally different outfit, I'm quickly getting the idea I'm not being taken serious. A continuity error so early on? C'mon.But it's not all bad, even tho' sometimes it cringily written. Just: don't expect too much. Watch this while having a couple beers with friends and you'll have a background movie with some conversation starters."}, {"id": 337, "text": "I feel so bad for David Ayer at this point. The man went from critical acclaim with End of Watch and Fury (both of which I need to rewatch now) to dud after bomb after Dumpster fire. Suicide Squad remains one of the worst superhero movies of late and Bright is still one of the strangest blockbusters I've seen. After hearing about Tax Collector I was hopeful that he could get his career back on track.Unfortunately, that is not the case here. Tax Collector, while not the worst thing ever is yet another skid mark on the career of David Ayer. This is just not the right thing to kick your redemption tour off. Not only is this mafia revenge story played out, but it's also completely incompetent in terms of the execution.It's ugly, poorly edited, and the dialogue is consistently terrible. The editing especially is baffling. Jump cuts and the lack of establishing shots make this utterly jarring and hard to follow. This mainly takes place in the first half, seemingly to rush through the set up. Which is disappointing because I enjoyed the set up.I liked watching Shia and the main character, David, attending to their daily tasks. Collecting money, dealing with people doing stupid things, and planning for a family party. It establishes every major player pretty well and you even come to like some of them. The dynamic between David and Creeper was very reminiscent of End of Watch which I liked.The main story mostly revolves around a new player in the mafia game shaking things up. People get killed, chaoes ensues, and David has to take revenge. It's all quite simplistic. If you liked some of the characters more and gave this more time to breathe then maybe it wouldn't feel so bland. I'm sure it was also disheartening to see Nicholas Winding Refn virtually do the same story with To Old to Die Young. (But with exponentially more skill.)It's saddening to see David Ayer tumble further down the proverbial rabbit hole. Any further down and I fear his career may not recover. If you can't make something good out of a Mexican mafia story starring a committed Shia LeBeouf, then maybe you should take time away from the game. Find a story that hasn't been done to death and put all your passion into it. I'm not saying that this isn't a product of passion but it certainly feels as if many corners were cut. The structure is there, the talent is there, but polish was an after thought in every sense."}, {"id": 338, "text": "Well, the 2020 movie The Tax Collector was what it was; essentially just another generic gang-related action crime movie, for better or worse. But there was something oddly entertaining about the movie though.Sure, if you enjoy watching movies with street gangs and criminal activity, then I believe you will find The Tax Collector rather entertaining. However, this movie had a tendency to feel like just about every other movie based on the same formula.The storyline told in The Tax Collector was pretty straight forward, although it was fairly generic, and with writer and director David Ayer leaving no room for surprises, the movie felt linear to the point of being overly predictable. There just simply were not surprised throughout the course of the movie.I will say, though, that writer and director David Ayer did manage to concoct a movie where it felt like the audience was right there alongside David (played by Bobby Soto) and Creeper (played by Shia LaBeouf), and that definitely added an enjoyable level to the movie.It was also nice to see the likes of George Lopez, Jimmy Smits and Noel Gugliemi show up in the movie.While The Tax Collector was entertaining enough and enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be, it was ultimately just another run-of-the-mill-gangbanger-movie, truth be told. But some pretty convincing acting performances managed to bring the movie up a notch. Which reflects in my rating of the movie, which settles on a six out of ten stars."}, {"id": 339, "text": "This movie boarders on B status and is only saved by the performance of Shia LaBeouf. His character was so believable and makes me want to see a prequel of Creeper. The movie started out well. Although I feel that David wasn't correctly cast, I feel David (director) did a great job of character development on David. Showing his domestic and spiritual side, then the street biz. There was some lag midway into the movie then picked up again.The interaction with the brothers joining as the cavalry at the rear of the film was where it lost plausibility along with the level of acting skill, but I was already hooked and I rode till the wheels fell off.Getting back to Shai. I know he's been through it and we all have to deal with life, but I think we'll look back to see him as one of the greats. He'll have an Oscar before he's done. You can snapshot this prediction. :)"}, {"id": 340, "text": "I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that had so much potential, and just consistently squandered it to this degree. 'The Tax Collector' has some truly excellent scenes sprinkled throughout, it's the stuff in between that is bordering on rubbish. So often the film feels like it is about to take flight and kick it up a gear, only to stall for the next 10-15 minutes with inconsequential nonsense. With about another 5-6 rewrites I could imagine this movie being something truly excellent.Shia LaBeouf really impressed me in this movie. He had a great character, who the script didn't let live up to his full potential, however he hit every note perfectly. His accent was convincing, and he was very cool and menacing. The problem the script found was that the more screen time your characters get, the harder it is to keep them cool. The characters are introduced in a very stylish and compelling way, but then as we get to see more and more of them we realise they are just normal guys, and the mystique is lost.All the ingredients were there for this film to work - good characters, played by capable actors, and a story that should have been a lot more compelling than it ultimately was. Basically 'The Tax Collector' has to go down as a missed opportunity. We know what David Ayer is capable of. When he's good, he's amazing. But when he misses, it can be quite a mess (see also 'Suicide Squad'). Unfortunately this was the latter."}, {"id": 341, "text": "This movie is just so awful it is honestly like something a high school class would put together. Shia never the best actor plays a role that makes absolutely no sense. The acting is awful, the film is full of awful cliches and you know what is going to happen every step of the way because of these cliches. It is definitely a white director thinking he understands the LA gang and minority culture and it fails in every level.If you run across the film while bored like I did don't watch it. If someone tells you it is good call them a liar. If someone says you should watch it cut ties with that person. If any of those actors or director ever get another job after that train wreck movie there should be an investigation in to it. I as sit here I mourn the little Digital 0s And 1s that gave their binary code lives for this movie. It was so bad we may want to consider protesting it. We should all meet in Hollywood and insist that this movie be pulled so innocent people do have to suffer. The only good part of this movie is the first 1/10th of a second when the end credits start because you realize that you'll never be subjected to it again..In fact, I should get money for the pain and suffering I experienced writing this review but I need to warn others. Seriously, I have no idea why they even bothered with Shia's character it ultimately makes no sense. Don't watch this you have been warned."}], "reviews_amount": 342}
