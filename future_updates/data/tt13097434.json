If you are expecting this to be a rom-com it isn't, comedy is present but this is more of a tragic comedy. The climax could have been better, its emotional and good but I didnt like how it ended.

It's high time we put an end to bias of any type - be it color, race, caste, religion or ANYTHING. Given the mounting issues of such sorts in this day and age, movies like this are highly needed.

(thanks.. world's first pure form in nature as per your movie).. Director indirectly tried to film the life of downtrodden also. My humble suggestion to the cast and crew is Please remake or dub in Tamil also. Why because you will also get to be identified in further movies for your artistic and creative skills in Tamil too. In Telugu most of the people watch movies for entertainment only, the people who are giving lower ratings and negative reviews are the like people. They don't want hero or heroine to be died, whatever the story goes, the film should have a happy ending, infact not at all happen in real life. But in Tamil it's not like that, that's why people like Vijay sethupathi are getting success there. Don't feel that I am a Tamilian. I am a pure Telugu guy.

Suhas already proved he can pull off comedy roles easily and this time he proved his mettle with a top notch all-round performance. Viva Harsha finally got an excellent role and he lived his role. Chandini should have done better. Sunil too is just decent. Songs and BGM by Kala Bhairava needs a special mention. Overall, the story is very much predictable but the performances are excellent. Dialogues were superb but direction should have been better. There was so much lag in the screenplay of the first half. Some scenes should've been trimmed. Overall, Suhas will surely be in the list of top actors in TFI.

The underlying topic(colourism) is a really important one, embedded in a romantic love story in the 90s. Especially the main characters were drawn out well&amp; were interesting , except for the brother of the girl( he was potrayed as a narcissistic, mysoginistic and controlling psychopath, but for my taste his character was over the top and his motives quite immature). I also liked the dialogues, they were really thoughtful and deep, and encouraging the viewer to think about them, but at the same time you had really funny punchlines. The cinematography was astonishing ! and the music was fitting perfectly into the film. What i didnt like was the ending because it kind of feels misplaced and maybe encourages the youth to do things, which will harm them, instead of finding better solutions to deal with hardships in life ( by the way the high cigarette consum was also critical). The topic spoken about is important, but it would have been more brave and even groundbreaking, if the woman had been darker and the men fairer, because colourism affects woman much more than men.( but this is a minor aspect ) Otherwise a really touching movie, with amazing perfomances especially from the main character ( its the first movie after a long time, which made me cry) :)"}, {"id": 128, "text": "The story and the idea of elevating the racism in rural areas around late 90s wasnt a unique story..there have been numerous stories coming our way since east man color times. Finally what i wanted to say is, colour photo isnt a story untold during its time. Just that its retro love story it doesnt necessarily sell. It should have its selling point. And having said that.. it had huge resemblance with Pariyerum Perumal which released in tamil in 2018. Chandini and viva harsha stood out for their performances. Certainly they have rroved that they both has the potential to perform. Suhas has done well but his character arc wasnt consistent, its the flaw in writing i guess, because he had his moments of being confident unlike pretending to be one like in proposal scene. That ending would have been a heartbreaking one in 1999(according to timeline used in movie) but it wasnt the same(for me atleast) and I was in the exact state how deepu reacts to her dads death but at the same time if it doesnt end that way, it would have given the vibe of pariyerum perumal so we had nothing else to take this. But it did address some issues genuinely and didnt tried to polish the bad consequences of love which were prevailing during late 90s. I wish director doesnt get carried away with the appreciations this film gets and correct his flaws in writing for his next. Its not a bad one, its not very good. Give it a try."}, {"id": 129, "text": "Being a nature enthusiast, I usually look forward to serene frames throughout any movie. This movie was sooooo quite and blue. I really loved few frames in the cinema. I fell in love with every character. LOVED THE DIALOGUES. Nobody needs to specially speak about the humour these people would generate when they're all together! I was not into music much before the release, but after watching it, everytime any of my friends put status or just any random thing I come across, I listen to few beats in the movie, gives me goosebumps and drags me down to watch it again. Definitely, if you're 3 scale sensitive atleast for 5, you'll she's tears at the end. Beginning was absorbable, ending was reflective. You'll find the normal scenes in the beginning to be sooooooo beautiful at the end. Over-all movie was great. Sandeep, Harsha, Suhaas, Chandini, Vidya and Drishti. I've known you, your work on YouTube since very beginning, I've seen you grow like daaaaamn good amount through this film. Harsha was seperately appreciable. Sunil was good. Could be better.Lastly, just go for it if you're here for reviews to decide to watch or not to watch, just go!!! (I'm from Vijayawada, people from my place are GREAT movie critics :P)The story line has a reason to be watched for. It's meant to be watched by everyone of us to instigate a sense of realisation and responsibility. People like such still exist, if you dig deeper you'll see lot such people around and even among us.Whatever is shown in the cinema is for us audience to understand how deeeeeep things were and sadly can even today. It has to be stopped by any means."}, {"id": 130, "text": "TheColourPhoto During lockdown I have always been appreciating other languages movies for their content, simplicity, and depiction of nativity (especially Malayalam ones), I think with 'Uma maheshwara Ugraroppasya' &amp; 'ColorPhoto' Tollywood has reached that quality milestone.Color Photo is pure 90's love story in the village backdrop focusing on caste, social differences but highlights much on the racism based on the complexion, movie succeeds to capture the nuances of the transformation from 90's to 20th century Era where the education impact &amp; importance is imbibed among youth with high ambitions &amp; the spirit to do something better n bigger in life. Suhas and Chandini were phenomenal in their roles \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f, they both brought the life to the characters played by them.The background score and music was too good that without mentioning abt music we can't talk about movie. Movie starts with 'Telusa Manasa' song, I felt the reference when I realized music director to be Son of this melodious song composer MMkeeravaani. Every song has soulful feel, especially I loved d way Ramya Behra has crooned 'Ekaantham' song and just love the pure magic in 'Arere Akasham', have been listening to all songs on repeat mode. Movie is not to give a miss, very rarely we will come across such films these days.Movie is knitted very beautifully and it gets very heart wrenching as it farewells. Suhas character shall leave an impression on you that you will have a pang in your heart for quite some time, cheers to entire team and director SandeepRaaaj for blessing Telugu audience with this jewel \ud83d\udc90\ud83c\udf8a"}, {"id": 131, "text": "It was 2016, when I came across a Marathi movie #Sairat. It was a roller-coaster ride filled with emotions throughout its runtime. The impact of caste and class on the love world, left me perplexed. It impacted me on a level that I never imagined.Colour Photo had similar impact in me; the movie made me laugh and smile, as much as it made me cry! Though both the movies deal with love affair amidst caste issues, they are true to their own background. That's what make it special.#Suhas as Jayakrishna carries the movie on his shoulders, with his non-dramatic portrayal of a young college lad. After an impressive performance in #UmaMaheswaraUgraRoopasaya, he stamped his presence in this movie as well. It will be curious to see him portray a variety of roles in future.Though the screenplay had enough space for puns from our Bala yesu (Child Christ!), the supporting characters could've been backed up by better performances. There were situations where the plot was about to change directions, but the screenplay tried its best to get it back on track.The editing pattern caught my attention throughout, using windows to convey the emotions of the contrasting worlds of the lead. Combined with the background score, they helped us in getting glued to our screens without much hassle.The YouTube gang of #ChaiBiscuit getting on to make a mark on the big screen, is a massive step ahead in Telugu Cinema. I hope many young talents can follow their suit up the ladder. As said by Hriday Ranjan of Film Companion South, these people really developed the negatives of their industry into a beautiful colour photo!Overall, the Colour Photo movie is definitely a welcome move for the Telugu Cinema industry and I hope it will be appreciated by everyone alike. It is a worthy watch.!"}, {"id": 132, "text": "We've truly come a long way in looking past the masala movies produced by the big actors and rewarding rich stories - Colour Photo is a sparkling example of his.Suhas and Chandini play believable small town roles, that don't have many frills. There are no rich cars, explosive entries or thumping music numbers in this movie - just the people and the wonderful interplay of their emotions in a semi rural setting. The narrative constantly focuses on understanding people - a small town girl who is outspoken, an average dark skinned guy who is under confident, and a psychotic older brother who is conservative. It's their story from multiple perspectives, that comes together magnificently on the silver screen as the audience is hooked to each scene.Exceptional writing, genuinely hardworking actors, soothing music and well thought out direction make colour photo a gem of a movie to watch. Do not miss this movie which leaves you floating in a sea of emotions from start to end."}], "reviews_amount": 133}
