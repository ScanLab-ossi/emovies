I knew this was a stinker when I didn't care one iota when the grandmother died. The plot could have been more interesting if Sara would have been taken to a q zone and and then Nico could team up with rebels to break her out. Another thing is it is supposed to be a broken down society but the setting has manicured lawns, super clean streets I was thinking, man, even though it's armageddon, gardner's, lawn people, and street cleaners, are still working. More development on the villain would have helped, his speech about thinking he is a god because he is immune was stupid as far as motivation. It was understood what nico and sara wanted. But why the villain did what he did was unclear. The side stories didn't add much to the plot either. I didn't care about the sickly little girl character. Overall this was just a waste of time and money."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I have no idea why they thought this would be a good idea to green light... it looks so cheap and rushed, 80% of the scenes are on FaceTime or him riding a bike. They're definitely just trying to make bank on the fact we're in a pandemic and they can push the fear narrative. The villain had no real motive, there was no tension at all, and all the characters were dumb. We never get to see these quarantine camps, never got to see the progression of the virus, and never saw anything that was truly scary or fear inducing in the slightest. Give this one a very big miss."}, {"id": 2, "text": "When this was announced it had Michael Bay's name attached as producer and was supposedly going to be a pandemic thriller. Now I know many people have a disdain for Michael Bay, but I actually think that he brings some visual prowess to his projects however it's clear that his name was only attached for recognition purposes. This is neither anything visually bombastic or anything close to being a pulse pounding thriller. It's a very amateur romantic drama that focuses more on the interpersonal communication between characters as they struggle through the changing times. It becomes increasingly dragging and you just keep asking yourself what the real intent of the overall film really is. Some of the actors are seasoned veterans but are truly underutilized for new or younger actors that are frankly not on par. The production value is that of a cancelled TV series on the big networks as well. Overall this is just a very big failure and definitely not what I was expecting."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The Covid movies are here and this one is so uninteresting actually catching Covid would be more exciting. Covid-23 is far deadlier then Covid-19 and it seems that only the most bland, only in a Hollywood script characters are immune. Really this film is just a sappy love story and a chance for KJ Apa to show off his very sculpted nude body. Yes he looks fantastic, kind of male model bike delivery guy handsome and if you are a fan of his this is worth watching. For actual adults with a functioning brain, this is just poor. How do you make a movie about a deadly disease wiping out the world and turn it into 2 people talking through a door ? This is completely predictable , the performances are uneven, but KJ wears shirts throughout the movie that are just short enough to show off his killer abs. Maybe his abs can fight off Covid ?"}, {"id": 4, "text": "Save your time and money...I was interested to see how they showed the pandemic and the surveillance measures being put into place. I would have liked to see how dystopian it could be.Instead, I got a garbage, predictable movie with VERY CRINGEY dialogue between the two main characters. None of the character arcs were developed. I couldn't care less about any of them. None of the interactions made sense. The immunity bands didn't really even play a role. For instance, when she was transported to the Q zone, they didn't realize she never had it on? Why would they arrest her if she had one on already, now after she's out of the van they see she has one?There's no politics in this movie, it really could be made with any underlying crisis in the background. People who used their reviews to make political rants need to stop drinking the kool aid. It's a bad movie, that's it. It's not bad because I don't like the non-existing political message. It's bad because it's bad."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Inconsistent, plot can be ripped to shreds when the protagonist main objective is to receive a bracelet, however bracelet has no effect on survival"}, {"id": 6, "text": "Michael Bay should release this movie like 5 years after the world is normal again.

This should have been a blockbuster thriller and they blew it on a love story that wasn't even good. They had a perfect story for an adventure and they ruined it. I'm so disappointed.

Written and directed by Adam Mason who has no real movie experience besides B movies and this is almost a guaranteed failure before the first casting.On a good note, Demi Moore plays a believable housewife, everyone else just stumbles through every scene frustrating the audience.Munies are people who are immune to the virus, but it seems that they have limited intelligence to go along with it.

Film and television is still being made, but none have gone as far as to capitalize on current events as Songbird tries to. Produced by Michael Bay (yes, the man behind Bayformers) and directed (and co-written) by Adam Mason (of Into the Dark fame), this romantic thriller gets by on a relatively short runtime and some good performances.It's 2024 and COVID-23 rages on. In Los Angeles, the majority are on indefinite lockdown while a select chunk of people - known as munies - are found immune to the disease. One such individual is Nico (KJ Apa), a late 20s former law student who delivers packages for a high-end courier service run by Lester (Craig Robinson). Nico has an obviously difficult relationship with a young woman named Sara (Sofia Carson), who lives with her grandmother (Elpidia Carrillo), and they dream of being together on the outside.There are a couple subplots that try to be as exciting - or lack thereof - as the main action, and it all comes together in the end.

There's even random one scene characters introduced that you THINK might be important but mean absolutely nothing. It's definitely not realistic, and everything will just make the viewer frustrated.

What and how did some random loan man show up to help Niko escape the parking garage when being ambushed? What happens at the Q zone?

The camerawork is horrendous in typical Michael bay style. The touching moments come across as corny and the references to the pandemic feel so forced you cant help but cringe. Theres no point in watching this movie unless you deliberatly want to annoy yourself. The exaggerated pandemic is completely disrespectful against anyone who's been confronted with covid, in any way.

Yes it's about a pandemic but that's not the whole story. The story is more about hope and keeping it alive through dark times. And isn't that what any of us what, a bit of hope for the future???Okay, sure not a Grand masterpiece, but it's not trying to be ether. What it is, is a low budget movie that delivers a nice story of hope. Hope for a future in times of trouble. Hope for a bette tomorrow. Hope for uniting and reuniting with family and friends. Hope, it's what we all want and some desperately need right now. And it's what it gives an abundance of. Never give up and never give in. And that's why I say give it a chance.Young KJ Apa does a fine job caring the movie as he place the main character and it's that character's story. And though he's not given much to work with he's able to still give a great performance that makes you feel for his character and his struggles. The others do well to with their material from Demi Moore being a worried mother to Peter Stormare doing what he does best, being bad. LolAgain, it's no big screen money maker but it is still a winner for what it is, a low budget movie about a few individuals living though pandemic made during a pandemic. Makes for a very realistic and heartfelt story despite not being a big money maker.Again, I say don't listen to the nay sayers and give it a chance.

It is thoroughly watchable and in my opinion, totally underrated at this time on IMDB (4.3). It's set in the very near future following the progression of Covid-19 and, despite lacking any advanced tech, has a real dystopian science fiction feel to it. It describes a bleak future which requires some suspension of disbelief but which is also uncomfortably realistic in many ways.

Sadly, this movie largely falls flat.With the Covid pandemic as its backdrop, and a dystopian near future as its setting, 'Songbird' had all the ingredients for at least a solid thriller. The movie has trouble finding its own identity however, following several different plotlines, none of which are thoroughly worked out.The two main romantic leads, played by KJ Apa and Sofia Carson, get the majority of the screen time, and their arc is the one that's arguably best worked out. However, their story feels bland, and very derivative of a load of other doomed romance stories. The two bad guys, Peter Stormare and Bradley Whitford, are uninspired and boring, with neither getting to do anything particularly memorable. Add some other one-off characters played by Demi Moore, Craig Robinson and Alexandra Daddario, and you have a reasonably talented cast who are not given that much to work with.The movie's plot furthermore would have allowed the filmmaker to add some biting social critiques and maybe even some satire, but this is nowhere to be seen. The movie is a basic romance on one end, and a bland action thriller on the other. Really, aside from being a quarantine movie coming out during a quarantine, there isn't that much special about this movie.Furthermore, I have to mention my dislike of the movie's camerawork and editing.

I thought this film would be much more similar to the outbreak, and subsequent emptiness that was found in I Am Legend. Anyways....While the trailer hinted at a decent story. I was filled with skepticism going into this film. Based off both the trailer, and the description, this film falls way short of its intent. While classified as a comedy, drama, and romance, I felt very little to no emotion within each of those categories. Nothing stood out as funny. There was very little drama to be had. Hearing there were Q-zones, and people trying to fight back, I assumed there would be riots and intense action to show how tired people were for being oppressed and contained of the virus. There was none of that. Lastly, the romance was sub-par. There was no spark, no emotion that made me feel the leads were truly in love, or had any connection that would've brought them together. The most engaging sub-story was the one with a military veteran trying to help an internet personality escape her oppressor, and I felt that story was stronger than the main one.Overall: The film was slow, emotionless, and a waste of time.

Who even writes these scripts and how do they get actors to agree to play such terrible roles?There is no way the 10-star reviews are genuine, nobody could remotely like this movie. Listen to me and give this movie a pass."}, {"id": 69, "text": "Songbird is directed by Adam Mason, who wrote the screenplay with Simon Boyes and produced by Michael Bay, Adam Goodman, Andrew Sugerman, and Eben Davidson. The film stars KJ Apa, Sofia Carson, Craig Robinson, Bradley Whitford, Peter Stormare, Alexandra Daddario, Paul Walter Hauser, and Demi Moore.Immune to the COVID-23 virus, a courier races against time to save the woman he loves from a quarantine camp.The film is an interesting take on what we are all going through right now. It is an acceptably entertaining thriller that's more notable for what it achieves technically than anything else. It won't be too close to home to scare you, but it is a fun watch. The pacing is a little off, admittedly, in places, but it's also audacious and the first mainstream film to address unapologetically, in every scene, in every frame of film, our present situation. The film is surprisingly gripping and tense and at its most interesting when holding a mirror up to us now, but magnified - a new normal. Songbird's world is recognisable but frightening and hard to look away from. It will be interesting to watch the film again in the future and see how far we've come. The film has two great performances from it's leading stars, especially in the films more emotional moments and Demi Moore can still steal a scene. Give it a chance, the rating doesn't justify the quality of the film."}, {"id": 70, "text": "This is not just the best movie of 2020 but the best movie I have seen in my whole life.What made it difference than the rest ? First of all, the right atmosphere, best acting, best music. I can hardly anybody can create a movie like this in such a situation with so little crew.How often can you see a movie which is about a bad period which was filmed in a human bad period of time ?I really like the idea of Department of sanitation and Q zone. And freedom is something worth dying for.The fear for the virus is far worse than the virus itself.Stay safe, sane and sanitize."}, {"id": 71, "text": "(Responding to these reviews so far about this film that's already playing and being studied in High School) Understand that this film was made within 8 months, not another year, through the COVID-19 pandemic itself and was worth the effort (this can still happen to us, if we're not ready) given these extraordinary events. Understand that they did this remotely and via solo shots, not the usual groups of actors in one scene after another. Yes, a vaccine has been approved and more will come, but even that could be insufficient and the coronavirus may mutate and strike back harder. Yes, a new Administration should be able to better handle this disaster made worse by inaction and delays in relief by political nonsense abound, but how far will people want to endure that necessary restriction on livelihood until things look better? The directors and writers, actors and cinematographers behind this deserve a round of applause for producing Songbird during the pandemic with most theaters closed and films going directly to streaming services. Otherwise, it could be better thoughted about or longer. It's as good as it could be.UPDATE: Thanks for hating my review! It goes to show who you really are. Stay home."}, {"id": 72, "text": "In 2024, the world has been ravaged by COVID-23. Los Angeles is under strict quarantine and the control of the Department of Sanitation. Various people navigate this new world. Nico (K.J. Apa) is immune and a delivery boy working for Lester (Craig Robinson). He loves Sara (Sofia Carson) who is isolated with her grandmother in their apartment. William Griffin (Bradley Whitford) is a corrupt record producer who lives with his wife Piper (Demi Moore) and daughter. May (Alexandra Daddario) is an aspiring singer stranded by the virus. Emmett Harland (Peter Stormare) is a ruthless Sanitation agent.It's exploitive. It's too soon. It's derivative. It's basically one of those disaster movies with interconnected character stories. It takes too long to start the narrative engine. It's too much in love with showing the disinfecting of stuff and the minutia of this world. Once the action thriller starts, the movie finally gets some kinetic energy. Its Michael Bay production gene finally shows but it's somehow empty and it fizzles out anyways. I am willing to give this a little credit for filming in the middle of the pandemic. It took advantage with filming in the empty streets but on the other hand, it is constricted by social distancing. Year from now, this will be interesting not for its cinematic value but as a time capsule of a specific real world."}, {"id": 73, "text": "REVIEW - SONGBIRDThe most scary films are those that could actually happen in real life.Filmed during the first lock down in Los Angeles this is the story of a couple trying to survive the pandemic, but Covid 19 has mutated into Covid 24 which had a 67% fatality rate.Stricter rules to comply with or be taken away by armed guards, arrested if leaving you home.Enjoyable film as I've said especially as this was filmed during lock down so certain restrictions means that the film possibly couldn't be as good as it would have been but certainly a good watch especially with the current situation we find ourselves in with Covid.Rating 6 out of 10"}], "reviews_amount": 74}
