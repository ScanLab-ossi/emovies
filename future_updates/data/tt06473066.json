Remember back when it was okay to like a movie that inspired you? Before everything got gritty cause it's soo edgy and artsy that way? Back before everyone was overly critical? Remember when we had movies like Radio, Remember the Titans and Forrest Gump? Movies that just made you feel good about life? That is this movie! I'm here to tell you it's the perfect way to end the negative year that is 2020. Look...I appreciate a good gritty film as much as the next guy, but when that's what everything becomes it's not original anymore, it just gets old. This is simply the film we need right now. So do yourself a favor, ignore the negative critics, don't let them take that from us again! Just enjoy this truly moving and powerful true story with your family. A story that will give you a positive outlook on your life upon its completion. Bring the Kleenex. #makeitcooltobehappyagain"}, {"id": 1, "text": "It's just not a movie to go around saying it's so good, it made me cry, it'll make you cry too. Really it's best to use as an example of the real world of terminal cancer victims and their families. The movie was done well because it wasn't one of those sell out movies where they run scenes that have sad music, acting, tears, to make you cry. It's the raw fact that emotions were held back because it was difficult enough to handle not being able to do a thing about the cancer situation. It had no scenes that were like reminder: this is a movie, let's make it funny, let's pop it up, let's throw in a corny plot twist. None of that here. Beautiful writing. The actors complimented the writing down to the timing. What killed me most was not knowing it was a true story until the end. I was watching the movie thinking, yeah this happens in real life but it isn't likely. Then the ending showed the real people involved in the actual story. I was hitting stuff in my car and crying. Again, great writing because of the fact sometimes a character was difficult to understand until they spoke their feelings out with a few lines instead of the writing laying it out for us, making the actors look clumsy and stuck to being instant on their emotions. Movies should really go in this direction."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Omg do not watch without tissues! This was so freakin good and sad. Love the music, story and characters.

The best caracter in my opinion Sammy. But she didn't get much of a story. I was also pissed after they made a song and everyone was talking about Zach being on radio and HIS song going viral.

I knew this movie would be hard to watch, as I had an uncle who passed away of leukemia in 2013. I knew this movie would tug at my heratstrings. I was able to make it through the film without crying...until the last 10 minutes or so. When Zach starts being unable to finish his performance at his prom, and the audience of his friends, family, and complete strangers finish the song for him....that was the moment I started bawling. Absolutely beautiful. I cried even harder when I learned Zach passed away around a month before my uncle. My uncle was in his mid 20s when he passed, so they were around the same age. I volunteered in a cancer ward at my local hospital for 2 years as part of my mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, (the Mormons.) I have a few medical conditions myself. Heart murmer, COPD, skeletal issues and a few learning disabilities that make me look and act younger than I am. I love stories of people with similar struggles, and this was one of them. I'm taking a star off for an unnecessary sex scene. There is NEVER a reason to have a sex scene in ANY movie.

Wow what a powerful movie Clouds it was by far one of the most beautiful and inspiring movies I have seen so let's get started.First of all there was great cinematography, likeable characters, great themes and relationships. I loved the visual aspects of the movie, the visual metaphors linked to the title of the main song and movie was very powerful and had a lot of emotional impact that worked really, the movie just looked very slick and had great set pieces. The whole cast was extremely likeable, Fin Argus playing Zach was great, he had such a likeable charm to him, he kept a smile and to his face and his same humour and charm no matter how ill he got which was truly powerful and heart-warming to see even in the darkest of times a positive outlook can still be achieved. The themes this movie conveyed were truly inspiring, the themes of living life to the full no matter the limit, and the deep themes of the emotional impacts it can have on someone's relationship were explored very well throughout and truly made you appreciate life. The relationships within this movie were also excellent and relatable. The friendship between Zach and Sabrina Carpenters character was truly charming and well thought out, and reminded me of how close I am with my best friend, and the family dynamic and how close everyone was really touched and related to me with how close I am with my family, and the movies deep and realistic portrayal of these relationships reflected well on what people go through with a cancer diagnosis.My next few positives would be the charming tone, soundtrack and performances. The movie had such a charm, the real life in depth look at a family coming together to cope with their brother/son getting weaker and weaker everyday was handled so well, this charm never went away and made you connect to the characters even more making you genuinely care for everyone and taking the journey with everyone, the soundtrack was also great, it had very touching and heartfelt songs that added depth to the characters and instantly made you want to get the soundtrack which I did. The performances all around were phenomenal, everyone managed to achieve deep, versatile and organic performances that truly bought the characters to life, but the key standouts for me were Madison Iseman and Fin Argus were just phenomenal and heart-breaking.My final few positives for the movie would be the character depth, emotional weight and the final act. The movies attention to detail with its character depth was truly fantastic, every single character had a role to play or had some form of arc with how they accepted Zach's fate and their relationship with him, you understood how each and everyone of the characters was feeling, this was also partially down to the fantastic script as well, with some powerful and thoughtful dialogue, but you understood the characters on such a deep level that you formed a deep connection with them all, the movie also had a huge amount of emotional weight and depth, wow this movie is a tearjerker, it was sometimes hard to watch, they didn't hold back with showing the effects of cancer which despite not being nice to watch was needed for what this movie was going for, and the diverse and different reactions from each person in Zach's life was truly powerful and heartbreaking. The final act was also perfect, the final performance and death of Zach was handled with care and perfection, the sense of love for him as everyone sang his song was truly for me powerful filmmaking that hit me hard and ended the movie in a sensitive and deeply moving way.Overall Clouds is my favourite movie of the year, the movie was powerful, heartbreaking and inspiring and really makes you stop and appreciate the life that you have."}, {"id": 33, "text": "I love this story tissues needed RIP Zach Sobiech."}, {"id": 34, "text": "Very touching true story about the last few months in the life of a young man dying from metastatic osteosarcoma.

While the movie covers a some aspects of his life, the movie is not a good depiction of Zach Sobiech. Fin Argus does not accurately portray Zach. Most of the details about relationships are fiction.

It's well acted, touching story about a teenager suffering from cancer and some of his final accomplishments.My biggest issue with it is these types of movies are largely the same. Sure they're based on true stories but Hollywood picks the feel good (well as best you can in these scenarios) stories. Person meets love, person accomplishes goal, miracle cure is found/happens etc. They tend to very lightly gloss over the person's suffering, their family/friends' suffering, just to make a heartwarming story.Enough have been done that you can pin the general outcome and they become depressing."}, {"id": 39, "text": "First hats-off for bringing this story in to a movie.

The fact that it's a biopic intensified the emotions attached to it. Although, there was more scope for expressing the sadness better, it wasn't as watery as it could have been with a 2hr runtime, and a somewhat predictable plot.

It felt like the whole movie was going to be a heaping pile of sadness with random inspirational parts coming from his love of music and fulfilling his musical dream before he died.

I didn't feel like I was given enough background on the characters to care about them-such as Amy. The movie started out almost in the middle of their story, yet also the beginning of it, but it felt forced and rushed. The scene between Sammy and Zach was just kind of glossed over. Something was missing. Timing and pacing was weird. The scene when they leave for the trip and Amy comes over seemed rushed and out of nowhere. And other similar scenes. The acting was fine, dialogue was fine, story behind it was touching, but I needed more. More depth, just more.I love Five Feet Apart and that is fiction, but I felt like I knew the characters at least. I was hoping this would be similar."}, {"id": 66, "text": "Sometimes familiar stories and films with imperfections can even break through the mould and impress you. Recently released to stream on Disney+, Clouds is one of the most emotional films I've seen all year. Being based on a true story helped it in that regard, but the subject matter alone is what makes this film work so well as a cohesive film. Due to the nature of how this film was released, there probably won't be any awards consideration, and that's okay because I believe that if you stripped away the emotional core from this film, you'd have a pretty standard drama that you've seen a million times. With that said, here's why Clouds stands out as a very well-done true story.Based on the true story of Zach Sobiech (Fin Argus), Clouds follows him as he grapples with the fact that he only has a few months left to live. With this limited time, he chooses to make light of every scenario that he can, all while continuing to write and perform music in order to leave behind a legacy. With his best friend Sammy Brown (Sabrina Carpenter) by his side every step of the way and his new girlfriend Amy Adamle (Madison Iseman) doing the best she can to be there for him, every bit of this film is littered with emotional moments. Whether it be a new revelation about his condition or something his family did for him, I found myself in tears on multiple occasions. These aspects are both the strongest and weakest parts of the film as a whole though.Yes, I cried throughout the majority of this film, due to the great performance by Fin Argus and the fact that the screenplay by Kara Holden hit all the right chords for me. This is also where I have to make my one big complaint though. Yes, this entire film is tastefully done in every way, but the heartstrings of the film are pulled on nearly every five to ten minutes and even though it usually works, it just felt like a lot. Due to how strong the real-life story was, this film hinged on that alone, making for both a sad and repetitive watch. With that said, while watching the film, I did not feel this at all. I only thought the emotion was focussed on too much upon reflection, so I can't see that being a complaint for many viewers.Director Justin Baldoni also has a huge knack for directing films that are driven by a very heavy, emotional narrative. Although I really haven't seen much of his television work, I really enjoyed his feature film debut with 2019s Five Feet Apart. That film, much like this one, uses the emotional core of the story a little too heavily, but I found that it worked really well as an experience. Baldoni is a director that likes to let scenes drag on a bit and let the emotion linger, which I really appreciated about this film in particular. It can feel long at times, but that also felt like a reflection of how cancer speeds things up in a sense. I really enjoyed watching this film due to his direction.Overall, Clouds is a far better film than I was expecting it to be. Quite honestly, upon first viewing of the trailer, I had no prior knowledge of this true story or the music that made him famous in real life. For that reason alone, I think I appreciated the film even more. Never once did I feel the film dive into cliched territory because it all felt authentic and true. If for nothing else, Clouds is absolutely worth watching if you like a good cry when watching a film. It absolutely tugged at my heartstrings and I feel that many viewers will have that same experience. Clouds is now streaming on Disney+."}, {"id": 67, "text": "That makes people look like theyve been binging emotions inside a bunker , sniffing and snorting teargas, just to be able to still feel alive after viewing a film like this, because its a sad true story with extreme high and lows, and extremely disney guttsey, and remember toothpaste wont releve the pain so dont smear that into your eyes.its a cancer in youth film plus music talent on the plot, with swirling talents of the acts, and a cosy musical content that that lures you into the abyss of deathg and despair. its clever but genericly made, even though based on a true cloud(story)so if youre babysitting tonight with your love one, balm yourself in handkerchiefs, youll need them, i will for sure evade and evacuate miself from the premises when my better half through an awful lot of years will be introduced to this sadeyed megamonster deathromcom flick, the mourning usually lasts 3 days and three nights after an event like this( and i will never forget the titanic days)so im grumpy and old and not easy to frail, but it took me over the edge , so have a look at my recommends"}, {"id": 68, "text": "The words to define what Justin Baldoni is doing are fighting and making dreams come true, ever since I discovered his life after being Rafael in JTV my whole perception changed, he's an amazing actor and even bigger director, but also an amazing husband and father and in general, an amazing man. I love how he has gotten his wife a role in both of his movies, and he even appeared for a tiny second in this one.He has an extraordinary gift to keep your eyes on the screen even if you are crying and sobbing, in a world of movies with no special meaning, no learning and no faith in humanity and such in a tough year for everyone, this movie is literally a ray of sunshine in our lives.Every single second if worth it, every single second shows truth, pain, dreams, strength and finally love, family and relationships fill out lives with meaning, even if we only have a few months to live.Enjoy every day, love with everything you have."}, {"id": 69, "text": "Clouds is an inspirational story that helps the viewers to realize the value of our time. Not only is the message beautiful, but the cinematography is beautiful, as well. It is a powerful film that will make you reach for tissues.The film is based around the true life story of Zach Sobeich. Zach was a high schooler diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a type of cancer, and told that he had less than a year to live. Instead of giving up on the rest of his life, he decided to make the most of it. He started to write music and set up the band A Firm Handshake. He wrote the song Clouds, which was a viral hit on song charts in countries around the world. Zach Sobiech inspires others to do the same as he: make the most of life. In the film, Zach Sobiech (Fin Argus) tells viewers that you don't have to be told you are dying in order to start living.Zach Sobiech's best friend Sammy, is played by Sabrina Carpenter, an exceptional actress who draws the audience into the emotional scenes. The family members of Zack Sobiech, such as the mother Laura Sobiech (Neve Campbell), the father Rob Sobiech (Tom Everett Scott) and the sisters Alli and Grace (Vivien Douglass and Summer Howell), are all exceptional actors as well. You can see how much they care for Zach Sobiech, how much they love him, and how badly they want him to live. The intense emotions they are able to convey is what brings the audience to tears.The strategic cinematography by Ben Kutchins also brings the audience into the scenes and makes them feel as if they are right there, in the moment, with the characters. The strong performances of the actors combined with the excellent cinematography helps to deliver the message of the story right into the viewer's hearts. My favorite scene is when the story comes full circle while Zach is performing for his audience. They sing his own song back to him, just like he dreamed. At that moment, I felt really proud of him, and I felt his happiness.The message of this film is to start going after your dreams now. Zach said that teens mistakenly feel invincible, and we always say that we'll start working towards our dreams tomorrow. Zach's story proves that life is a gift, and we have the power in our hands to make the most of it. With time, we can do anything we want, achieve anything we want, and be anything we want. We just need to take advantage of that power.I rate Clouds 5 out of 5 stars. I really loved it, and I think that everyone else will too, even adults. I recommend it for ages 13 to 18. You should definitely go watch it now! Clouds is streaming on Disney+!Reviewed by Jolleen M., KIDS FIRST!"}, {"id": 70, "text": "4 out of 5 stars.Clouds is a musical drama film about a high school teen Zach (Fin Argus) who is suffering from a terminal illness. After years of treatments and nothing stopped the illness. Zach decides that he cant stop living and decides to follow his dreams. And sing with his best friend Sammy (Sabrina Carpenter). Which there duo sparked a high rating on youtube. Which gets the attention of radio stations.It is an emotional and powerful plot. Tough to watch someone going through an illness. While feeling lost and short on time. Zach never stopped fighting. Fighting to live his life still. Fighting to do what he wants. Trying to make others happy. Trying to be there for his girlfriend Amy (Madison Iseman). Trying to be there for his best friend Sammy. And being there for his family. Its a good inspirational and sad movie about a message of struggling and living life.The cast ensemble did good. Fin Argus did a fantastic job playing a character that is struggling. Sabrina Carpenter, Madison Iseman, Neve Campbell, and Tom Everett Scott all did good. Lil Rel Howery did good playing Zachs inspirational teacher.It is a feel good. Emotional and strong film. Which the climax and final moments of the movie was very hard to watch."}, {"id": 71, "text": "I have to admit, I am somewhat positively biased towards films and TV shows that deal with serious illnesses like cancer. Even more so when the plot is based on a true story. Still, it always remains to be seen whether or not the adaptation is respectful to the real life tale and the people within it. I'm happy to say that I think that 'Clouds' does Zach Sobiech's incredible story justice.First and foremost, this film made me bawl my eyes out, which was obviously its intended purpose. Zach, played by Fin Argus, is such a kind and spirited person, and it is both heartwarming and heartbreaking to see how cancer can so abruptly impact someone's life like it did in the film. We follow Zach as he deals with being terminally ill, and how his subsequent decision to start making music inspired thousands of people worldwide.The film leans heavily on making its viewers as sad as possible, taking every opportunity to implement a scene that tugs at the heartstrings and can cause anyone to spontaneously burst into tears. It's a tad melodramatic at times, which kind of takes away from the stark realism in the rest of the movie, but that's only to be expected from an adaptation like this.We get some interesting character development between Zach and those people close to him, who all deal with Zach's illness in different ways. Everyone in the cast delivers solid performances, with Lil Rel Howery being the standout amongst the supporting roles in my opinion.Aside from the story, this movie's true star is of course the music. The songs that were actually written and performed by the real Zach Sobiech are absolutely gorgeous, touching, tragic, beautiful and all the things... It's no surprise that the movie's titular song topped the iTunes song chart for the second time after this film's release.All in all, this is just a great film. If you need a good cry, I highly recommend it."}, {"id": 72, "text": "What a beautiful movie! I read a little about the movie and the director's personal experience with Zach before watching and it's incredibly apparent how much this young man touched the directors heart. There was definitely something real and personal about the movie.I'd never heard of this talented and brave young man's life before this movie, despite being heartbreaking in so many ways for so many people in his life, it's also at the same time incredibly inspirational.There were so many layers to this story that included different people in Zach's life, Zach's personal journey with cancer, how those close to him were dealing with his diagnosis and the music.Truly emotional throughout I cried many times for many reasons.I look forward to seeing more movies from Justin Baldoni as he's proven that he has great talent in making movies with so much love and heart."}, {"id": 73, "text": "I know you might not know what this film is but Clouds is a 2020 Disney Plus film that came out in October. I found out about it because I got Disney Plus to watch The Mandalorian again. I ended up enjoying this film more than I thought I would.Clouds is about a boy named Zach Sobiech (Fin Argus) who has cancer and only has a few months to live. Knowing this, he does everything he can with his girlfriend, Amy (Madison Iseman) and his best friend, Sammy (Sabrina Carpenter) to make them feel happy.Disney Plus has offered a mix of films. They have offered distinguished films like Togo, mediocre films like Lady And The Tramp, and hard to watch films like Noelle. So I didn't really know what to expect from this film. I think Clouds falls into the mediocre category. I was in a good mood after Clouds. That might have not been the films goal because many people have said that they were sobbing like a baby but I wasn't. I am not some machine that doesn't cry for any movie. Believe me, I have, but this film just didn't really feel like a dagger in the heart as it did for many people. I found that to be a problem. It just felt awkward because the film took sort of a crying break after a sad moment but I wasn't really tearing up. The director is Justin Baldoni. He also did Five Feet Apart and that film also had some awkward crying breaks. Besides that though, the story was fine. It wasn't anything special. There were some funny moments but also the dialogue came off really, really basic. There were just many lines that you have heard so many times before. For example they said I just act that way sometimes. That was a major one that got me furious. There were just so many lines that did that. There was a love story that was going on in the film too. At the start I thought it was going to be like the John Hughes film, Some Kind Of Wonderful but then morphed into something different which was refreshing because of how basic the rest of the plot is.The acting in the picture was what I expected from a movie like this. The leading actor, Fin Argus, did fine. His performance was nothing Oscar worthy but it was just fine. Neve Campbell playing his mom in the picture and was mediocre in it. Her best performance is still the Scream films. Lil Rel Howrey was also a teacher in this film. He was a fantastic character that did add to the story. I have only seen him playing a comedic character before like in Uncle Drew. In this film he still had the comedic attitude but was also very caring and compassionate to the main character. Sabrina Carpenter played Zach's best friend, Sammy. She has been in a Disney media before. In any of the Disney Plus originals there is always a Disney Channel star unless they moved the film off of their release schedule for theaters. She was okay in the film though. Madison Iseman played Zach's girlfriend. This has been her biggest role yet. She has been in Jumanji but not much besides that. She played her role well but it was nothing special. Overall, the acting was just mediocre.The score might have been the best thing of the whole picture but it was nothing I would listen to outside of the film. It was mainly piano or a stringed instrument which it typical for a sad film. It did its best to try to add emotion to many scenes in the film but ended up just being the star of the scene because of how sloppy the plot ended up being.Clouds had potential to be an emotional ride but ended up feeling like a sloppy film that had exceptional acting. I would recommend this film to anybody who has Disney Plus already."}, {"id": 74, "text": "I was looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I saw the announcement. I've known Zach's Story for quite a while and I love the song Clouds.But this was way too sappy, so many quotes that nobody in real life says, it felt too fake. You know when a movie tries so hard to be emotional? this one did.It also felt quite rushed, especially when they travel, everything happens too fast, I also feel there wasn't enough Zach and his insight of things. It's like he's just there.It's a shame because his story is very moving but the film failed to capture that, songs were nice tho.If you like this type of film, I recommend Now is Good and 50/50, they're far better in my opinion."}], "reviews_amount": 75}
