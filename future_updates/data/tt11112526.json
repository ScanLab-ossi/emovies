Predictable story line as it preaches to love thy neighbor even if he is hell bent on destroying you through thousand cuts. No novelty in the story line@ boring to the T. Difficult to survive the entire length of this movie."}, {"id": 9, "text": "I also have friends, but we don't always discuss about sex. Mallika Dua and Kiara Advani's half scenes are all about discussion of sex. Story is average, a better comedy would have helped it but nonsense comedy is what you all will see. Kiara Advani has done a lot of overacting. Why Aditya Seal chose such a disastrous film? Can Bollywood only give such disastrous roles to newcomers ?My recommendation: Please stay safe at home and save money and don't watch it in theatres, not even on Telegram as it will only waste your time."}, {"id": 10, "text": "A good message with brilliant acting from Kiara.

If you want to survive, please maintain the distance from this propakistani movie as much as you can.. just an another attempt of bollywood to malign Indian and vocal for pakistanis.. these bollywood pigs never realized that what kind of anti social activities they are doing by making these kind of films.. totally time waste.. regretting my decision to watch this in theatre.. thanks God for I am still alive.."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Awesome movie it is very interesting to watch i suggest u this movie.

All uncles / boys residing in her locality perennially lust after her. On her friend's suggestion, she invites a man home for a one-night stand but is shocked to discover that he has a Pakistani passport. So who exactly is this man? Whats he doing in our country? Is he a terrorist? #IndooKiJawani started off well and I hoped to get entertained. Regrettably this never happened. Kiara n Aditya are decent performers but the direction is puerile. Running time needs to be reduced by 20 minutes. Rating 1.5/5."}, {"id": 24, "text": "Avoid watching this waste of time.

Set in Ghaziabad, the movie revolves around Indoo and her social life, which later turn out to a chaos. well directed, good photography, soothing music makes it a good watch. Kiara enacts girl next door pretty well."}, {"id": 34, "text": "It's funny how Kiara thinks, she's the best actress on earth just because her previous films were blockbuster \ud83d\ude04.

It doesn't want innovation, nor ideas but stick itself to the same idea of misogyny, portraying Indians as bad, an over obsession with Pakistani and their so called righteousness that its almost laughable now, but it still passes off through the filter of Bollywood industry. The over use of sex discussion between Kiara and others make us think, how much deprived of sex and romance are we as collective indian that it always has been placed in our entertainment industry for more than 40 years. And that too, when we are a country of more than 1.3 billion people. Even after ignoring all the erotic and hogwashing elements, the movie still falls flat on the surface due to lack of story, unfunny and totally cringy jokes, and no actual plot whatsoever. The only suggestion I can give to bollywood is: If you have so much money to waste on, then why not donate it instead, so that atleast it can be put to a good use."}, {"id": 45, "text": "Sorry I can't find anything worse \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude02 Pathetic film.
