I was expecting a lot more from the Spanish. They usually make very good films especially horrors. This was mediocre at best. Standard Hollywood horror. Yes the ending is decent but it doesnt take away the fact that there was a missed opportunity here. From what started out as a promising horror with a good storyline just fell a bit flat in parts. The jump scares were predictable, the tension was good and could have been so much better if they focused a bit more on the payoff of built up suspension into a jump scare but it just didnt do it for me. I dont get the 10/10 reviews for this. The acting was good but i wasnt drawn into the characters as much as i wanted to be. Still worth a watch but dont go in expecting a horror classic that stands the test of time."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This film gives the impression of being carved by copying parts of many films and series that have achieved success in the industry. but unfortunately, I can say that this movie was unable to create its own originality. IMO the biggest betrayal of horror cinema is to create fear by making the audience to wait only for jump-scare scenes. Other than the jumpscare scenes, other scary(!) scenes, as I said before, were stripped away from other movies.Of course it's not bad at all; to some of those who'll read this maybe it'll become the one of the best movies of the last couple of years. But for me it's just NOT! Watching productions such as haunting of hill house, the conjuring or insidious for the fiftieth time will satisfy you more, it is incomparable."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I really liked this movie.

I must say I wasn't disappointed but wasn't surprised either .

At the beginning the jumpscares were great but as the movie progressed they got cheaper.

Great acting, the set was good, very edge of your seat kinda film. There was a lack of connection and anguish with the main actors.

It was just missing that depth and didn't feel any anguish for the dead actors or the witch that would have been tortured under the house. They should have lost it more, built up the noises and the message from the other side, they just skimmed the surface .This was defo a rated 12 rather than a potentially excellent rated 18.

Or sneaking around in the worst places hitting the flashlight because it's pitch black and the battery ir failing. I use the mute button on these scenes. Its not worth it.

It was not so long and action started in first 10 minutes of the movie. The next aspect I loved was the style of the house. I liked that child and mother was killed, because it brings a little bit more action. I wasn't expected that child is going to die. The idea seemed a little bit bland. There are plenty of movies with flies in the wall and childs who can hear voices so it didn't surprise me. The ending was rushed. I get the idea of drawings and etc. but it doesn't make a lot of sense then. No one saw drawings in the entire movie just at the end of it. In backflash, where guy killed his son, also didn't see a lot of logic. How mom didn't heard when child was calling for help, but she heards when gates are not closed, that's just ridiculous. The whole movie wasn't bad. I would say a little bit above average, like 6/10, but it's 2020 and there are not many movies so I'm raising it to 7.

Could have been wy better"}, {"id": 88, "text": "Don't Listen (Voces) is a movie that takes a lot of cues from the very successful Conjuring franchise, but at least it does so stylishly well. A family of three are fixing up an old mansion to sell it for a profit. The father, Daniel, seems to make his primary living doing this. He and his wife Sara have their eight year-old son Eric speaking to a therapist at the very beginning of the movie, because apparently Eric is having trouble adapting to the new environment this time around. He hears voices in the house, through his toys and the walkie talkie he uses to communicate with his parents. The therapist presumes he's acting out but very soon learns to regret this assumption. One thing this movie does that's interesting is that it takes a drastic turn sooner in the runtime than you'd expect if you're basing the pacing on other haunted house movies. Daniel asks an EVP expert for assistance, and the expert brings along his skeptic daughter Ruth to help him search for answers in the house. They find out that the house was once used for other purposes and realize that they have to perform a ritual to stop the haunting, and then it all starts really hitting the fan. The acting and special effects are good and the use of saturated bits of color in a desaturated landscape gives the film an interesting visual style. Eventually, though, it becomes obvious that this film is setting up a franchise, and it might turn unintentionally funny if everybody winds up dead every time this guy shows up to help. Like when Yor the hunter from the future visits your village, you know he's trying his best but everybody's doomed. It is a very watchable movie, though.

Personally, i followed the movie without really wondering where it was going to take us, because the script follows easily, the performers are not bad at all, a little lengthy, a script that the Spaniards have already exploited before and apparently they like that kind of movies.

I am not going to give anything away in the film, so sorry about that. Overall I enjoyed the film, I watched it as a dubbed version which was done very well and I didn't feel that it took anything away from the impact of the film.

If your child is hearing voices there are three probable reasons for this:1) He has a very strong imagination. 2) A traumatic life experience or mental health problems such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. 3) The house you are in is haunted.As Don't Listen is a horror movie the third option is clearly the obvious one. This is a fine Spanish horror flick that is full of creepy moments - we get many of those wonderful shots of shadowy figures in the background - and the atmosphere of dread and horror as the malevolent spirit preys on the residents with a series of brutal mind games is great, that all said, it's unfortunate that the last act relied heavily on our cast of characters acting like complete idiots, which to be is fair standard horror stuff.

You have to really like the formula to sit through most of them. It helps if you shake things up by watching the occasional non-English film. But, even so, you frequently end up feeling like you've already seen that movie a few times already.Don't Listen doesn't stray from the template used by so many other haunted house movies. There's the standard bit of exposition about why the family can't leave the house. And, of course, someone finds a book that explains the movie's plot in detail.However, quite a few of the scenes were well-acted, and the characters were all pretty likable. Each of the characters got to have their own spooky moment, where they sloooowly reach toward something they probably shouldn't be reaching toward. Then there's a sudden, loud noise, and the character sloooowly backs up, not realizing that there's something spooky behind them. If you can handle such cliched scenes, it's actually done pretty well.Near the end of the movie, everything is explicitly and tidily resolved. There is absolutely no metaphor here, and there is literally no chance that you walk away from this movie scratching your head. It left me wondering if maybe this was meant for a younger, less jaded demographic than me."}, {"id": 102, "text": "I really liked the first 20-30 mins of the movie: The build up was good. The visuals give you the creeps (and depending on your level of scare, they might even seem scary) and you can tell that it's about to go down, the movie does a good job of building the anticipation. Watch this movie for the first half if you'd like to. Would recommend that! The acting was good too!But halfway through, I lost interest. The movie had so much potential but it was a let down then on, especially in the final 30 mins. A couple blatant things were missed to move the plot on that made a character seem dumb, only made me care less for him. The narrative around the paranormal/witch/ghost in the final third felt weak and rushed. The lore could have used more time and stretched bit.The final twist - Interesting. I'm torn with this one though but I'll take it. I guess the first 20-30 mins and the this final twist are the two things that I'll take away from the movie. That's about it. Turns out, there was a post-credit scene, that I missed, about a new story. I don't think it's worth the time to go back watch it, it's not gonna salvage the story in this movie for me."}, {"id": 103, "text": "An abandoned house in a dense forest, a family indebted in constant changes of housing, sinister and haunting figures and voices.The horror genre doesn't necessarily have to have original works to stay active. Although it has a premise already known to the public, the Spanish production, Don't Listen, will make you be surprised and never look at flies the same way again.With great impact right at the beginning of the film, literally, the plot unfolds with a moderate amount of twists, but forceful quality in all of them.After the loss of his son in a tragic and mysterious accident in the house where the boy said he heard voices, a stunned father remains in the house where the horror happened to end the reform in which he invested his savings.Without the company of his wife, who left the place to try to overcome what happened, Daniel, very well played by the expressive Rodolfo Sancho, returns to hear his son's voices in recordings and calls made after his death.The boy's request for help on the other side despairs the late father to the point of seeking and convincing a paranormal investigator marked by traumas, accompanied by his affectionate, but incredulous daughter.The similar concept of this narrative with other productions of the genre is slightly irrelevant in view of the development of the way in which the production accompanies the plot.Beginning with a dramatic family tragedy, the work manages to maintain this line and link it, in an increasing and surprising way, with traces of action, mystery and the different lines of terror.Like most films of this genre, dark montages of scenes, settings and jump scares do not go unnoticed. However, the tension and attention built over the course of the plot will maintain the priority and fright for the progress of the narrative without deteriorating or even exaggerating in any aspect the other approaches to production.Without reinventing terror as a whole, Don't Listen captivates and disturbs, in a coherent way, with the optimal use of the particular elements of its script, environments and cast.The freshness of this Spanish production ranges from the empathic and suffering family relationships wounded and haunted by the entities from the beginning of the film to its shocking ending without the absence of high doses of bitterness, as was experienced throughout the course of the plot."}, {"id": 104, "text": "Having trouble sleeping in their house, the parents of a young boy become distraught when he accidentally dies around the house, but when he stays behind to grieve a series of paranormal incidents causes him to gather a specialist and his daughter to investigate bringing them in contact with a dark supernatural presence.This was an above-average if slightly disappointing genre effort. One of the films' biggest positives is the atmospheric touch this adds to the material that feels rather creepy. The general vibe here is of a true haunted house effort, mainly coming from the constant static and noises occurring throughout the house on any device capable of producing such sound but the other attempts to introduce the technological enhancements into their ghost-hunting practices which reveal evidence of the paranormal. These manage enough to generate a rather dark and chilling atmosphere here that plays perfectly into the finale where the ghosts are much more active, much more frequent and actually manage to become somewhat chilling in their recreations of the past events but also interacting with the group left in the house which has a lot to like for the most part. There are a few issues to be had with this one. The biggest issue affecting this one is the completely cliched and predictable setup here that follows all the usual rules and ideas usually associated with this type of film. The idea of the parents trying to figure out what's going on with their kid who's clearly disturbed by someone or something else other than what he's been telling them is going to result in the same stereotypical scenes usually featured here, from the parents yelling at the kid to behave and not understanding what's going on to showing the kid being influenced even further by the spirits in the house and the resulting strain being forced onto the parents trying to cope with everything. This resultant tragedy serves the film nicely in creating the perfect backdrop to the unease within the film but also feels quite tropey and expected as if nothing new or unique is done with the material as a whole. The general series of subplots and revelations about the ghosts' past brings nothing new here either, making them feel so expected and generic that they don't register much in the long run. Moreover, the scenes in the second half where they bring in the paranormal researchers cause more problems. Their introduction and immediate entrance into the supernatural goings-on are unbelievably rushed as a few lines of dialogue at a book-signing is enough to enter into the fray which is wholly unrealistic, while this also ends up bringing about so many ghost-hunting cliches in their search of the house it can feel like outright plagiarism at times. The scanning sequences with their devices are nearly shot-for-shot from just about every other attempt to utilize this setup, while the expected jump-scares of something running by in the background or off in the distance are telegraphed by jarring musical stings and expectant camera cuts which render the shocks ineffectual. With a glaring twist ending that changes the entire scope of what had previously, rendering everything into a huge waste of time, these issues bring the film down considerably.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language, Violence and children-in-jeopardy."}, {"id": 105, "text": "This was a movie that I checked out as part of wanting to see other films that people were on high when it came to rounding out my year end list. This one popped up as Marknado, a friend of mine on social media, had high up on his list so I figured I'd give it a go. The synopsis here is Daniel (Rodolfo Sancho) and Sara (Bel\u00e9n Fabra) have a 9-year-old son Eric (Lucas Blas). They've just moved to a new home, not knowing the neighbors call it 'the house of the voices'. Eric is the first one to notice the odd noises behind each door.We start this movie out with a dirty swimming pool inside of a gate. Daniel retrieves a ball from it with a net and it shifts over to show us the house. It is pretty old and rundown, but this family has moved into it. Daniel flips houses so along with his wife of Sara and their son Eric, they move around quite a bit. The movie then takes us into Eric's new room as he meets with a psychologist, Beatriz Arjona. She gets from the boy that he's sad they moved and that he has to make new friends at school. He reveals also that he has trouble sleeping due to the voices that talk to him. They also ask him draw things. The movie then gives us our first taste of something supernatural when the psychologist dies on her way home. Eerily, Eric drew a bloody branch as it happened.The boy continues to be plagued by things he hears over walkie-talkies. Daniel got these so his son can always talk to him. While the boy is the in the bathtub, he asks Sara if his father hates him. She asks where he heard this and it concerns her. Things are even more concerning when he gets expelled from school.Tragedy then strikes the family with something happening to Eric. Daniel can't leave the house as most of the family's money is tied up in it to renovate and flip it. Sara can't stay in the house though. When Daniel hears what he thinks is Eric through a recording on his phone he sent to Sara, this causes him to seek out Germ\u00e1n (Ram\u00f3n Barea) who is an expert in EVP phenomena. He brings his daughter Ruth (Ana Fern\u00e1ndez) who is skeptic. They're in for much more than they bargained for when they investigate this house. It leads to a dark past and why it is called 'the house of the voices'.Now that's where I'm going to leave the recap for this movie. I don't necessarily want to go into spoilers so that gets you up to speed where this will take you. What I really want to comment first here about the movie is the foreshadowing that this movie does so well. As I'm watching this from the beginning, I knew the swimming pool was going to come into play which it does. They show Germ\u00e1n really early in the movie on television and again, I figured this was going to allude that he would come back in later. This movie does well in setting up things without making them too obvious and then strategically coming back to them later.What really strikes me about this movie is how well it handles heavy subject matter. This movie goes to some dark places, but handles it in a way where it avoids going into the exploitation movie. It does something that is very depressing and can be a trigger for some, but it spurs Daniel into what he does. It also deals with the idea of suicide. This is something that really has tore Germ\u00e1n and Ruth apart. They're still close, but there is a dark secret that isn't spoken about between them. The entity in this movie is pushing suicide on many of them and it is quite convincing with the lengths it will go to convince them. This movie shocked me a few times in a good way for sure.Again I don't want to spoil what the entities are in this house, but it is really something that I'm a huge fan of it. It actually makes a whole lot of sense and realizing that this is from Spain, it really works with the dark past of things done in their country. What is interesting here though is that we don't have someone who was killed unjustly. The entity that is back probably deserved to die from what we learn was done in the past. The way that their execution was carried out might have gone too far, but they did some evil deeds for sure.Where I want to shift over to next would be the soundtrack for this movie. I'll be honest, I don't love the title. It does make sense in the grand scheme of things, but it really isn't a viable option to prevent what is happening. I'm assuming the original title is translated as Voices, but that is a bit generic and there are at least 2 movies in the horror genre with the same title. Regardless, we have this static that is telling Eric horrible things and then it branches out into others. The sound of static is just creepy to me now-a-days thanks to a lot of movies I've seen. There are a few set up jump-scares, but they were pretty effective. One got me for sure as I wasn't expecting it. I also think that the musical selections worked to the advantage of this movie. With the title, if these weren't effective it would have been a major letdown.Since I've been going over the scares, I'll shift over to the effects. This movie has some really good practical effects. The opening death looked really good. I like the look of the entity. They were quite creepy. They do another scare with strobe light that was eerie. On top of that, they're using infrared cameras and there is some creepiness that comes from them as well. There is a bit of CGI, it is looks fine to me and for the most part really seems to be there for enhancement and not the focal. I can get down with that for sure and I'd say the cinematography is well done. They really liked to use the depth of focus. You really need to pay attention to the whole frame as they like to hide things in the background which makes me uncomfortable in a good way.The last thing that I'll go over would be the acting. Let me lead off stating that no one here is going to win major awards. That's not meant as a slight or that they weren't good. I first off want to commend both Sancho and Fabra. They do really well as these loving parents. We get that baseline before they become the grieving parents after what happens to Eric. I believed them and it made me feel for them as well. Blas was fine as their child. I really liked Barea in his role. He at first doesn't want to help, but then he becomes pulled in by the facts. He also has some trauma to deal with as well. Fern\u00e1ndez was good as well. She's quite attractive and I like her as the counter to her father in not necessarily believing. Everyone that played the entities did well in being creepy which along with the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.Now with that said, I'm really glad that I didn't sleep on this movie. Seeing how high it was on a list for 2020 makes a lot of sense now. This movie really has some good emotions along with the dark subject matter that it is dealing with. It really made me feel uncomfortable with what they did with the depth of focus, the truth of what happened here and what this entity is forcing people to do. The soundtrack and sound design help with the atmosphere, the acting was solid and the effects were well done in my opinion. I don't really have a lot negative to say if I'm honest. Overall I'd rate this as really good movie, bordering on great. This is a contender for me for my year end for sure."}, {"id": 106, "text": "Into this spanish horrorverse, and i think youll come back outside pretty disturbed, if not to say shaken. because this is some of the grooviest of soulshocking non gore horror, close to the gates of purgatoy ive seen anytime. you know everytime something sinister is at the doorstep and , at least i, couldnt help to retain my juvenile reflexes of closing my eyes and thumping my ears, only to find out that the air stood still still ...so if your not a fan of shock jolts 15-20 times in a 100 minute film then make a pass. also if convinced religious, take a nap.the story is really plain and simple, its a ghostbuster kinda thing, but the acting and the score makes this all more intense. the location and set designs are perfect for the story, and the editing and filmography goes hand in hand into the other side with bravour.i am not a real horror fan due to negative effects of films thelike in my childhood, but this is a gyssare, so wanna feel uncomfy and small kid again then watch the voices, ''voces'', its a 9 from the grumpy old man"}, {"id": 107, "text": "I was reasonably entertained, but not much more. The story is in the well-known vein of a clueless family that comes to live in an old house, that turns out to be built upon an ancient place where once horrifying things have happened, so as a result restless ghosts-with-a-vengeance spook around and turn against the new residents. There's nothing wrong with such a premise, if it's well worked out, provides some original twists and succeeds in being seriously scaring.Here I was not so impressed. The first half hour was promising, but after the ghosts appear the sinister atmosphere is mainly dominated by one jump-scare after another. Original twists are't there, the arrival of an experienced ghost-expert and his assistant, who fills the house with microphones and camera's, is something of a clich\u00e9 in this kind of story, all in all it reminded me a bit of Poltergeist, albeit that here the ghosts don't polter so much, but are more of the whispering kind (hence the title Voces). In the very end there's an ultimate plot-twist, nicely made-up, but to me it didn't make sense at all, since it didn't have anything to do with the origin of the haunting. Anyway, the acting of all concerned was good, especially the little kid did a great job."}], "reviews_amount": 108}
