I often wonder why more thrillers like this don't utilize the power of sound and musical scores to build tension in a scene. Anyways I was pleasantly surprised by this in a year that hasn't released many good movies. I hope to see more from this director!"}, {"id": 3, "text": "Very well executed mystery thriller that keeps you on the edge the entire time. Well done. Bravo. Thank you!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "The opening scene of 'I see You' is an interesting one. It implies a supernatural element to the film and consequently made me lose interest for a little while. In hindsight it's a really clever and well executed scene that I can appreciate. And that's the thing about this movie. Everything is about hindsight, and I love that. I love a movie that presents something seemingly bizarre and then explains itself. The problem with that is that the audience has to be patient through the first half of the film. It requires trust and in the modern world of terrible films that can be a tough thing to give to a film. However if you do use patience with 'I see You' you will have a great time.It was hard to tell early on just how dark the film was going to be. I knew it had an R rating so there had to be more going on than initially met the eye. The film tends to get darker and darker as it goes along and reveals itself. There's a concept used in this film that I can't reveal because it would be a spoiler, however it is starting to be used more and more in films. It's a really creepy idea because it could happen to anyone and could even be happening to you right now without you knowing. 'I See You' puts its own twist on it and does it a little differently which I liked, but it's just another element to this film that works extremely well.I love it when horror movies gets things right. 'I See You' is a well crafted little film, that is well worth your time and almost demands a second viewing afterwards to fully appreciate it. This is one not to be missed."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Don't believe the genre tag. This is straight up a thriller/mistery, there is absolutely no horror at all and you will be totally and completely dissapointed if you're in for the horror.Said that, if you enjoy thrillers I See You completely delivers. There are a handful of surprises and will make you want to see it at least twice (I didn't really saw it twice but I definitely rewinded to some parts).It has a smart script that keeps you guessing, and while the behaviors of the characters sometimes made my eyes roll, most are explained later. There are only two or three things that they had to force and you have to turn a blind eye to in order to fully enjoy it.I See You will stay with you for a little while and won't give you all the answers. I'm still wondering why he chose -that- song, and what happened in -the trailer-. Leaves it to the imagination and mine went to really dark places.

Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through!!"}, {"id": 7, "text": "The movie is different from usual horror/mystery films - not involving much gore/torture still maintains very good story-line and puzzle1st half of the movie is originating puzzles, complicating the story; while the other half is filling in the gaps to solve that puzzles in a very unique way of back-patching/filling parallel eventsAlso, the sound-effects are very unique and different from usual, heard a bit new thingsAnd, Yes, Passively marketing a few new terminologies and Singers/Songs :)Overall very decent movie to spend good time and deserves to be in Horror/Mystery Category"}, {"id": 8, "text": "I love a good mystery. The problem I have with most though is that I've seen so many I tend to figure them out before the final moments of the film. So when one comes along that catches me completely off guard it becomes one that I want people to know about. I SEE YOU is one of those films.The movie is actually divided into two parts, the second half reflecting on the first. It's fall in a small town and the people are frightened for their children when a young teen goes missing. Det. Greg Harper (Jon Tenney) is the lead detective on the case, a case with few clues. But that's not the only issue Harper is dealing with.There is problems at home as well. Harper's wife Jackie (Helen Hunt) was cheating on him and they're trying to make things work. His son Connor (Judah Lewis) is resentful of his mother's indiscretion and holds her responsible for the falling apart of their family. Every effort she makes to try and correct things he tosses back in her face.The have you seen posters are placed around town and the search for the boy continues. When Harper and his partner Spitzky (Gregory Alan Williams) go back over the crime scene they discover something they missed the first time around. It's a green pocket knife and references a previous crime they worked years ago. Could that same killer have returned?As the case moves forward strange things begin happening in the Harper home. And entire drawer of silverware disappears. Noises are heard. Windows are found open. Then the worst of it all happens when Jackie's lover shows up trying to convince her to run away with him. Leaving him in the garage when she goes to answer the door, someone kills him. Is there something supernatural involved here? Or could it be something else. Time for a spoiler alert if you don't want to know.This is where the movie shifts gears as Connor reads a text screen that asks him if he's ever heard of phrogging. If, like me, you haven't I'm sure your hitting your cell phone now to look it up. Phrogging is when perpetrators, mostly teens, sneak into a home and attempt to live there without the knowledge of the home owner. It's a way to have a place to stay and to get some sort of thrill.Mindy (Libe Barer) and Alec (Owen Teague) are two such teens who have placed themselves in the Harper home, hiding out when they are home and wandering around when they're gone. These are the two responsible for the mysterious goings on. But it gets better. Alec is one to push things to the edge while Mindy plays it safe. Could it be that Alec plans on taking things even further than Mindy expects?This plot twists is mesmerizing and director Adam Randall uses a deft touch to bring it all about. Using up perhaps two thirds of the films short 96 minute running time he crafts the story to fit a certain mold, a horror film if you will involving what are potentially spooks gone wild. And then like Hitchcock did when he altered the story of a secretary stealing money into a serial killer in PSYCHO, the movie changes into something completely different. Quite an accomplishment for only a second film from Randall.Screenwriter Devon Graye is now someone I want to watch. An actor with 53 films under his built this is the first one he's written. He's done a magnificent job for his first time out. The characters are believable and ones we come to care for. We wonder if perhaps Jackie is losing her mind. Or is there something supernatural? Or is it the phroggers? Or could it be something else entirely?Hunt doesn't make that many movies these days and it was a pleasure to see her back in a role she handles with ease. It looks like she's making a return to acting after several years away and that's a good thing to happen. Tenney is an actor who's been overlooked for too long. He too does a great job here. And all of the young actors on hand also turn in performances that are exceptional, something we rarely see from teens on film.To my knowledge this film played in few if any theaters and that's a shame. I've seen bigger budgeted films with more hoopla upon their release that didn't compare to this one. For me I know it's one I can not only recommend heartily but could sit and watch more than once looking for those tiny details I might have missed the first time around. For now I would tell any and all that this film makes a great viewing night and suggest you rent it when you can."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Such a quality thriller...

Everything falls great in place, keeps you guessing, makes you believe you finally cracked the code but most likely in the end you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised.Thus, I See You is a great example of cinema done right, close to no loop holes, just a wonderful puzzle revealing itself in front of your eyes, while you might be scratching your head about it.

Everything was top notch like acting was great from everyone.. But for me is writing and directing was phenomenal and third is twists and turns in the middle of the movie was good time to give us something to get excited more and more....

All casting and performances were spot-on, with the exception of Helen Hunt, who seemed spaced-put and truly on all those pills she was popping. The score was perfection, creating the perfect tension and suspense. This film was actor Devon Graye's first screenplay, and he hit it out of the ballpark. Some of the twists were certainly over the top and there were some plot and technical issues, but for an amateur screenwriter, he did better than some recent seasoned writers' films I've seen lately. In comparison, his writing was genius. The 96 min runtime was perfect, but I felt the start was too slow and the ending too fast. I would've liked to have seen more even pacing. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed it and my head is still spinning from the plot twists. I'm definitely going to see it again.

Alec (Owen Teague), whilst meant to be an a unlikeable character is just too annoying. Helen Hunt's plastic surgery abundance is so distracting and no character is very likeable except Spitzky.There are borderline ridiculous moments where the Phroggers would be seen, like on the roof or behind the glass door when Jackie is STARING RIGHT AT ALEC!? Mindy's meant to be a super cautious person, yet before she dies she's yelling on the phone when she knows Greg's around and just wanders into the caravan? The most annoying bit is when Greg is looking for Alec in the house, he's a detective, he knows he's there and he knows the record player was put on as a distraction so what does he do? Stares at it like it's a complex puzzle? No detective would be that stupid. Soon after he hits Alec in the HEAD WITH A METAL FIRE POKER which let's be real would've killed him, yet Alec's up a second later completely fine...It's okay... but the fact that people are giving this movie a 10/10 is simply ridiculous. There's no real build up to the main reveal. It's a plot twist just for the sake of it and its not overly surprising or clever.Overall it just loosely ties plots together, with twists that have zero substance and I guess people think that's worthy of a 10? Are you serious? You must have to be young or seriously simple to think this is worthy of anything more than a 7."}, {"id": 22, "text": "Just saw today at Cleveland international film fest, very glad I got to such a quality thriller.

It is part murder mystery and part family drama with some points teasing at supernatural goings-on. We have a couple trying to get through a recent affair and their teenage son reacting very negatively. This gets overshadowed by some unusual occurrences in the house and a recent spate of missing children, which is being investigated by our poor cheated-on husband. The film shifts entirely halfway through and we start seeing the story from another perspective. Though the twist and the execution are very clever, the second half needs trimming. We are shown things that are somewhat unnecessary and the set-up for this act is a little long. What could have been a great film is just a good one because of the overly long reveals at the end."}, {"id": 24, "text": "I See You starts out with some strange camera angles, a bit overly dramatic score and a creepily-too-thin Helen Hunt.

Don't let the negative obsession with Helen hunts face reviews get in the way of enjoying this film. So what, she's aging how she chose to. That's not why we're here. This hugely underrated film I've never heard of deserves way more attention and recognition than the likes of parasite. That film is a joke over all the attention it got. However the acting, production, screen writing, creative multi layered plot and right down to the score all check the boxes for me! No wasted time to get the story going either. No stupid side romance plots. Just enough information to throw you off and then guide you into what's really going on. And not overly jumpy to make it more realistic to connect to the true story unfolding. It's been a while since we had a good one. I highly recommend."}, {"id": 27, "text": "This movie might have been interesting if it weren't so absurd. It has it's good points, starting off with an intriguing mystery, nice cinematography and a great soundtrack which adds interest to a story that eventually falls apart. The acting certainly isn't great though and I can only agree with what others have also written, Helen Hunt's obvious plastic surgery is actually distracting. The movie just ends up being annoying and is structured in such a way that any emotion or suspense is sucked right out.

Nicely put together thriller.For some reason I had in my head it was a sci fi thriller. In fact, the opening shot seemed to indicate something invisible yanking the child from the bike. Then there were little things that made me question what is happening and when is the monster going to reveal itself.The movie starts off pretty quick getting to the point. You meet the characters and are instantly intrigued by the story.Helen Hunt cheated on her husband. Her son is rightfully pissed as her infidelity has led to a rift in the family. In the meantime, someone has abducted a child, which is actually the second one in a couple week period. That sets the backdrop. The husband is a detective assigned to the case with another one who handled a case years ago with similar patterns. Knowing that he put the guy behind bars, they believe that they're probably dealing with a copycat.The man with whom Helen Hunt had an affair drops by her house. She rebuffs him but not before someone throws a mug from of the roof causing a pretty nasty cut and bump. She takes him to the basement to treat the wound and leaves to take the son to school. While she's away, someone knocks him over the head killing him. When she returns, she sees his dead body and looks to her husband for help. Concerned that the son would be the likely culprit, they proceed to bury the body deep in the woods.While they're away, the son is knocked unconscious by a masked figure creeping up behind. The next scene you see Helen and the husband find him and Helen drives the don to the hospital while husband remains to check the house. While upstairs, a record begins playing and when he starts to turn it off, a figure creeps up behind with a weapon seemingly injuring or killing him.The story takes a flip to two phroggers who move from home to home for a place to stay. But they do so without the people knowing. They are actually filming their antics and it becomes apparent that we are watching a flashback to earlier parts of the film. They've been there the whole time. The guy in the duo becomes increasingly weird wanting to mess with the family. As his behavior becomes bizarre, he drives the girl to want to leave.It is revealed that the guy threw the mug at the dude who hooked up with Helen. When the girl goes to the basement to retrieve her stuff, she sees the guy and dips behind a shelf. As she watches, it is revealed that husband killed the guy in the basement.When she tries to convince the boy to leave, he accidentally knocks her unconscious. He places her in s trunk which is then driven by husband to undisclosed location. It is there that we find the husband is the serial killer the whole time. When the girl tries to save the two boys who were kidnapped, husband suffocates her. Next scene he wakes her up so he can stage her death as self defense. He shoots her. When her buddy sees that she is dead, we learn that he is the one who attacks husband. They have a fight and husband is stabbed then shot by him. The partner enters and shoots the guy. It is revealed to the partner that husband was the killer all this time, even former ones and the guy who was in his house was one of the kids who got away. Helen learns her husband was a serial killer.Good flick."}, {"id": 30, "text": "There's a twist! It's a pretty exciting twist: it was pretty fun, a bit long. Overall a good watch!

Fact of the matter is, without any suspects a movie like this only has two options: either the 'good guy' is the murderer, or the murder is introduced in the final scene via a non-sequitur. I'll let you guess which.There seems to be a trend in a lot of modern films where the concept of an anti-hero is cast not as a chaotic character with a benevolent heart, but as a low-life who's actions drive the plot as oppose to enrich the narrative. If the view finds the hero of the story repugnant, then how can the story work?This bring us to this film's two main weaknesses:1. When the bad guys is the only interesting character, there is not point in resolving the story. I don't care how it ends as the complication in the plot is more enjoyable than the resolution. When the twist is revealed I was genuinely hoping the serial killer would be victorious in this tale.2. When the story is resolved by the actions of what is ostensibly (for the first 70 min of the movie) a low-life creep, why would I care about anything vindicating qualities he/she might possess? You can't tell the audience that a character is a thief, a liar, show them commit an act of sexual assault and violate their child and then expect them to not want to see that character lose in the end.5 stars for being well shot, well acted and well scripted.

Unfortunately there's a major tonal shift about halfway through, followed by some pedestrian twists that almost ruin what had been, until that point, a very tense, engrossing thriller. Despite being left with an unpleasant taste in my mouth, I still enjoyed a lot of it, and I'm very interested to see what else the director and cinematographer have done."}, {"id": 57, "text": "I see there is some young writing talent out here. This script is not the orthodox one and in fact it is written in a layer form. The film starts out and does everything in order up until a certain point in the story with the main characters. Then it restarts the entire story using a different set of characters point of view and shows us viewers what is really happening. The way to enjoy this film is to watch the first part, and try to guess what is really going on. Then expect to be wrong on some parts when you get to the second layer. It is darned entertaining to do it this way.I think it falls short of perfect in 2 places. First- the music theme tries to imitate John Carpenter's Halloween but this new theme is way over done. I think if the music was toned down or even lost it would be a more effective film. Second - spoiler- there is a point where a character named Alec is left alone in a garage for a long time. Logically with everything that has already happened most folks would have not sat there and waited for anyone to return to the house. Logically, they would have gotten the heck out of there and possibly gone to the authorities. That would spoil one dramatic scene, so I guess that is why it's not done.As far as the acting, Helen Hunt is fine though her role is limited in some ways. It is a fairly large cast so I can understand that her role is a lead, but she is not -spoiler- the action lead- so she really only has a handful of scenes. Judah Lewis as her son is the same way, his acting is fine but he has little action so his role, like Hunt's is a bit limited. Jon Tenney as Hunts Detective husband is excellent and he is one of the major roles in the entire film because his role is totally involved.Libe Barer plays Mindy very well and she is heavily involved in the story, though only in the second part of the film. Owen Teague as Alec is more involved in the second half and is very good too. Spoiler - the second half gets into certain clues visually which you see in the first half if your attentive. When watching this movie for the first time, pay attention to the clues, and then see how they turn out. That makes this a solid entertaining film."}, {"id": 58, "text": "I lasted all of 15 mins (if that) into this movie before having to switch it off through utter distraction of Helen Hunt's face!

But, not willing to rewatch to verify any holes. One scene a woman asks Helen Hunt's character about the investigation. Hunt seemed cold. It feels like the director wants you to feel its a small town, but is it really? Don't really know the characters. No depth, no passion, a good anger seen from the son.

Helen Hunt is fantastic as always but oh my what has she done with her latest plastic surgery, I do have to admit that seeing her now it is quite disturbing as she looks like Mason Verger from the movie Hannibal so disastrous is the plastic surgery she had in 2009 that it does actually impinge on her acting now and distracts the viewer every time you see her as she actually looks like she has had horror movie makeup and latex fitted to make her look unworldly - how very sad that such once beautiful and talented actresses such as Hunt have to do this to keep up in Hollywood - what is wrong with growing old gracefully but for me it does distract your attention in almost every close up scene she is in.I digress however, the movie itself is well paced and thought out and the ending is masterful. I wonder how many people got the little scene at the end intimating that Alec was indeed the child who escaped from the serial killer at the beginning of the film and that was his reason for Phrogging the house as he wanted to exact revenge on the Serial killer who had killed his friends. It is little things like this that make this film a better than average thriller, even the scene where the little boy is mysteriously pulled into the air from his bike seemingly by an evil ghost/spirit to draw the viewer in when in fact it was actually just a tripwire - magic!But what elevates this film above the usual is the superlative music and sound effects reminiscent of the recent Stephen King series The Outsider and which lends itself to making the film seem like a horror movie rather than the thriller which it is - my advice on this one is if you have 5.1 surround then turn it up to the max; pure cinematic ingenuity so this one gets very good 7/10 hatchets."}, {"id": 126, "text": "This is a well-told story that slowly unfolds with an unconventional timeline.

But honestly, her expressionless face works in selling her part in a very complex story. A story that even if you think you got at the end, I will tell you the movie's even bigger secret up front:It was no accident or coincidence that Alec was in that house. You see, right when the movie turns from what you think is a supernatural thriller into the actual story, Mindy literally tells you that Alec, who is from the town while she is not, picked the house. Why this house? Because he knows who lives there. And the resurgence in the kidnappings has triggered his memories. We know from the end that he was one of the two earlier victims who escaped the man in the house in the trees. We also know that the experience really traumatized the other boy. Watch Greg's reaction during that scene. On the second viewing, it becomes something entirely different. And then we are cleverly led away from the subplot of the two surviving boys which helps set up the ending.Also on a subsequent viewing, you understand Alec's motivation for what he is doing inside the house. We know the initial kidnapping really messed up Tommy so it is not that unbelievable that Alec has become also equally unhinged. And this explains why Alec stalks Greg in the house. He watches him obsessively. He trashes his photos. He literally marks Greg in his bed. Alec is out for revenge by mentally and physically torturing his childhood kidnapper. It is also very likely he is in the house looking for evidence like the pocketknives.During the climax when Greg tries to explain his criminal reasoning, he is so readily dismissed by Alec because Greg and Alec have already been acquainted for 15 years. Alec is there on a mission and has no need to empathize with the monster who ruined his innocence and youth. And then Alec as he lies wounded on the kitchen floor gives us the signal that he knows and remembers the other detective who alone interviewed him and Tommy all those years ago by calling out Det. Spitzky's name.And then the flashback ending that we were teased about and made to forget finally reveals itself. And while we already know that Greg is the villain of this story, we learn ultimately who Alec really is.But what triggered Greg's return to child abduction that in turn triggered Alec's revenge? Well, it is highly likely that Jackie's infidelity leading to Greg's feelings of masculine inadequacy and Connor's rebellion pushed him. He briefly tries to blame some events of his youth before Alec shoots him. Neglect, abuse, divorce, even the enuresis - hallmarks of a serial abductor/killer in training.This movie is so very well-constructed and layered. It really is quite something.

The premise is quite original, with a very intelligent story and direction. There are some major plot-shifts, the first one tilts the whole previous story like 180 degrees and the movie then repeats all the previous scenes but now from the perspective of this new knowledge, which produces some surprising new insights. A second plot-shift pushes you off your feet again, and in the very end there's yet another, that more or less ties the remaining loose ends together. So you don't end up frustrated with some open ending (like in so many other movies) but get a real satisfying closure.The acting is over-all fine, with trusted forces Helen Hunt and Jon Tenney as the central characters. My only reservation concerns Helen Hunt's looks, there seems something weird amiss with her face, I guess her character is supposed to be like 40 something, but she looks here like she's seventy, which doesn't make it very probable that her character is supposed to have had a stormy love-affair with a good-looking guy of about 40.

Skip to the end if that's all you want to see.The summary of this movie claims that a small town detective is investigating the kidnapping of a child. We soon learn that this crime may be connected to a series of past child-murders through the discovery of a green pocket knife. Apparently the killer has a bunch of green pocket knives and he buries all of his victims with them.There's drama in the detective's house. His wife (Jackie) has cheated on him and his son (Connor) is angry. Strange things happen in this house, as if there were an intruder. At one point, the the wife's lover shows up and gets hit in the head with a mug. We are to assume this was the angry son. The lover is brought into the basement where he is killed my someone. Possibly the Connor (as the Jackie assumes) or more likely an intruder attempting to frame the son.At this point we're given a parallel story about a couple of young adults, one of whom is an avid home invader (yet the two of them take this crime quite lightly...). One of these two (Mindy) witnesses the death of Jackie's lover at the hands of the detective himself (Greg). Is this a simple revenge plot?Barer and her partner in crime (Alec) want to escape, but Alec has been playing pranks on the family (including throwing the mug at Jackie's lover) and for whatever reason, decides tranquilize and hogtie Connor and place him in the bathtub. While doing this, Alec places a green pocket knife in a bar of soap... Is he the child murderer?Alec and Mindy get into an argument and Alec pushes her down some stairs. Mindy loses consciousness, so Alec decides to put her in the trunk of Greg's car... Greg and Jackie find their son tied up and panic. Jackie takes Connor to the hospital, while Greg drives into the woods, gets out of the car, and disappears for a moment. In this moment, Mindy wakes up and finds a camper with some kidnapped children tied up inside. Greg (the detective) comes up behind her and knocks her out.Greg returns home and now decides to search his house for the intruder who tied up his son. Greg also kills Mindy, placing a gun that he had for some reason into her hand, making it look like she was trying to kill him. Alec confronts Greg. He knows that he is the murderer, and is also responsible for the series of child murders years before. Alec was one of the children that Greg tried to kill, hence why he had the green pocket knife. Alec kills Greg, Greg's partner shoots Alec, but Alec survives and exposes Greg.So, why did Alec decide to tie up Connor? That goes quite a bit beyond his usual pranks like turning the TV on randomly... Why did Alec stab a knife into the bar of soap? Was is just so we'd see that it was the same green knife from before? Why did Greg drive into the woods and just disappear for no reason, right after his son was tied up by a home invader? He wasn't in his camper, so where was he? Where did Greg get this second gun? If it's his gun, the police will be able to trace the gun back to him... Also, why did Greg's partner shoot Alec on sight? Was he also involved in the child abductions? You can't just shoot a guy on sight like that, but whatever.All in all this movie was entertaining at parts but there were just too many instances of sloppy writing for me to give this anything higher than a score of 'slightly above average.'

Im not being picky or shallow. I always liked the actress and appreciated her work ever since Mad about You, but this... If there is any emotion on her face you definitely cannot tell, its just a bizzare stretched smooth and alien looking shapeless surface with no upper lip. Other than that, I did not find the movie very interesting. The twist was kind of silly/forced and seems extremely impractical and unlikely. Its not one of those man, that was a good mindbender twist where the twist all of a sudden changes your perspective. It just felt like a bit of a let down and the whole movie is more or less a cycle of Helen Hunt's constant sobbing, the kid being angsty and father angry. The horror theme often takes second place. Also at times the music was too obtrusive and brought you out of focus. It just didnt vibe with what was happening on screen which is extremely rarely I notice that. It was too tryhard spooky and took over scenes instead of complimenting them, distracting you from whats happening.

Also, did Mindy survive the gunshot? They found the boys, but how? She lost service when she called the police and then was driven back to the home. Did they track her cellphone and place her at both locations? That part left me feeling confused.Edit: I wanted to add a bit more now that I'm watching it for the second time. I caught something I didn't catch the first time I watched it. Alec is a teen, but he was interviewed 15 years ago by Spitz when he was at least 9, which would make him at least 24 - not a teen.

It started out like a paranormal thriller, and paranormal things make me giggle. I was giggling the first 20 minutes.

Helen hunt isn't the greatest actress at the best of times, but when I watched this, I wondered if she agreed to make the movie because she needed the money to pay bills. The acting was on par with a c list made for tv movie. The teen son's acting was a little better, which stopped me from giving this movie a 2 star rating. I'm normally not one to judge a person's appearance, but I'm afraid that I also found Helen Hunt's new face extremely distracting.

The combination of the realistic portrayal of (a) a dysfunctional family, (b) a standard crime drama, and (c) a bizarre home invasion narrative, did not add up to a cohesive whole.The most interesting of the three strands of the film was the domestic situation with a family that is disintegrating due to an affair on the part of the wife, Jackie Harper. Her husband Jack is sleeping on the coach, and the son Connor is hardly on speaking terms with his mother. The problem with this strand is that the adultery question and the character of Jackie drops out of the final third of the film.The disappearance of young Justin Whitter, which begins the film never develops within the film. The filmmakers return to it only at the end with an all-too-brief wrap-up. The film's most stunning revelation was the clever way in which the perpetrator was revealed. But the portrayal of the cops and the investigation was routine and uneventful.The most disappointing part of the film was the invasion of the Phroggers, the amateur home invaders, Mindy and Alec. The long midsection of the film was tedious and never-ending because it repeated a lengthy section of the film from the perspective of the Phroggers.The cat-and-mouse game of Mindy and Alec paid some dividends in the home stretch of the film.

As for the directing Adam Randall maybe should have used creepier sound effects to make it even better but overall it's a good job. The cast was good as well, Helen Hunt can still act but what a transformation after all those years of absence, she didn't age very well but that doesn't effect her acting skills so it doesn't really matter.

Well, even though there is no confirmation, we kind of know don't we? But the result is probably a lawsuit of some kind against a cosmetic surgeon since she looks like one of those make up jobs in the original Star Trek when an alien beauty suddenly becomes a lipless, gaunt, ghoul which makes Captain Kirk step back in pitiful horror. I'm seriously not getting at her, she is very talented and I actually feel sorry, because with natural ageing her face would have been so gracefully embracing of old age and for that reason, attractive, and consequently the parts she was offered so much better than this.

Some really godawful shots of Helen Hunt looking like The Mummy, (like, be kind to your one big star, guys!! ) the aforementioned editing and directing style in the beginning of the film and a couple or three huge plot holes that could easily have been filled in but weren't - what stands out to me is why and how and what did the phrogger do to the son?, or was that supposed to be dad also?

To make things worse there is a creepy presence in the house.The poster seemed cool and I thought it would be cool horror film. It is actually a mystery/thriller film, not a horror film.There are three phases in the film. First phase revolves around the Harper family and the little strange occurrences that happens around the house. As the film progresses those strange events become increasingly creepy. There is also the drama centering the unfaithfulness of the wife. First phase takes almost 60 percent of the run time. I loved this phase, I had no idea what was going on, lots of questions were running around in my head. Then comes the second phase which takes a totally different turn in terms of cinematography and the tone of the film. Some hand held shots were used which distracted me from the ambience created by the first phase. This is the weakest phase of the film. Thank god it was the shortest phase as well.The last phase shows lots of details and tries to tie the story lines. I liked most part of this phase as well. The tone of the film shifts here as well.The acting was good by all the actors and music was nice as well. The frog mask is creepy. There were some solid twists which surprised me.As the film has distinct phases and goes from mystery to thriller to action the overall experience diminishes a little. The production value is low and sometimes feels like a low budget TV-movie. There are some inconsistencies in the story.I enjoyed the film.

Helen Hunt was FABULOUS, and the other actors were very good too. There's nothing wrong with Helen Hunt's face, by the way - except just one thing: it's called AGING, folks. Some of us age more than others, and actresses tend to age fast due to hours, booze and less sleep! And I applaud her for not going under the knife like most!

Now I've seen it &amp; I'm mostly impressed in unexpected ways, but the more I dwell on it, the more critical thinking starts to point things out.I was wrong though, I See You feels much more like Blumhouse than A24. I See You is particularly interesting and feels fresher because of two reasons, its twisty script structure &amp; the eerie atmosphere, driven by creative cinematography and an original score that does indeed remind me of the horror movies from A24. It'd be hard to speak of the plot, harder than usual, because the story is shaped by two or (arguably) three major twists. Before we get to that, I also want to compliment all the actors for doing a terrific job, although I didn't like one of the key characters/performances much - Alec, portrayed by Owen Teague. I don't know why, it was oddly hard to accept him. As I previously mentioned, major props to the cinematographer, as well as to the composer - top notch design on all levels, both are important driving forces of I See You. Back to the script - it's admirably constructed, highly effortful story with twists that shift the plot greatly. While that seems to be this flicks secret weapon, I also deem it a flaw in the process. The turns, while getting set up, explained and shifted again, take time and pacing suffers a bit at times. That's the least of it though. It feels as if I See You is multiple movies in one and the consequence is that it never finds its real ground. The tricks are effective, but drawn out and helped greatly by movies technical factors and overall tone, basically, some of the tricks in use are cheap in disguise.I See You is more than just enjoyable horror movie with nice touches of crime and family drama genre elements, it's technically and aesthetically amazingly done &amp; is awfully ambitious, playing out lots of elements - a third of them work, a third of them feel questionable and another third of them could've been excluded.

I could go as high as a 7 as it depends on one's mood at the time they watch this film. Some may view this as a 3 4 or 5.The writing and direction reminds me of one of the M. Night Shyamalan films. There are some subplots that are not flushed out well. A couple of people pop-up out of nowhere with bit-parts as though the wind blew them on the screen and then they are gone with little to no follow-up. The family dynamic was a bit odd and not flushed out well even when taking the special circumstances associated with the mother into account. I think they would have been better off if they did not include that issue in the family dynamic, which was not written well and was more of a distraction. In doing so they could have focused more on character development and added more substance to the overall plot.Instead, the film seems like a patchwork of people and circumstances as they toss scenes in for a few minutes then jump somewhere else a little too soon for my taste making the audience fill in the gaps. The closest description that comes to mind is Jack of all trades but master of none.The twists and the climax were very cool. I give them points for that. Other than that this is a mediocre film. Gets better in the last 15 minutes. The build up is too disjointed and slow in my opinion. Still, it is worth watching. I may have thought better of this film had it been made for TV, versus a rental. I expect more from movies that charge box-office prices to watch. That said, I have seen much worse films than this.I recommend watching it with the knowledge you have gained in this and other similar reviews.

'I See You' keeps twisting its story to keep you on the edge, until the shocking ending reveals the Harper family's secrets and a decade old unsolved mystery that will make your jaw drop to the floor.What seems like a peaceful small town at first, actually hides a dark secret of missing children. When a boy goes missing in the woods, detective Harper (Jon Tenney - True Detective) and his partner Spitzky (Gregory Alan Williams - Greenleaf) get put on the case, they discover connections to a similar missing person's report from a decade ago. At home, Harper's family is dealing with their own setbacks, with wife Jackie's (Helen Hunt - Mad About You) infidelity being the main cause of this seemingly perfect family's tribulations. Son Connor (Judah Lewis - The Christmas Chronicles) isn't handling the news very well, and strange things start happening all around the house.More than once we get to see the house as if we're flying over it, or when we slide through the halls of this lavish seaside mansion. Philipp Blaubach's (Gunpowder) stylish cinematography is so smooth, using every location to its full potential, with some interesting angles in the second half of the film. Photos and mugs go missing, the television switches on at random times and duvets get pulled from unaware sleeping inhabitants. With an eerie score, composed by William Arcane, the mood goes from dark to pitch black in nano-seconds to drive up the tension even more.What really works in Adam Randall's (iBoy) newest film is the element of surprise. The film starts of a mystery-suspense thriller hinting at the supernatural, but dives deeper when it flips the film upside down halfway through. First time screenwriter Devon Graye has come up with a clever and well constructed script that leaves breadcrumbs from the very start to hint at events later on in the film. Is Jackie losing her mind? And is the family really in danger?! This doesn't just make 'I See You's mystery fun for the viewer in guessing what exactly causes these bizarre occurrences, but Graye also succeeds by turning the story into some sort of whodunnit, which isn't an easy thing to pull off.As far as acting goes, Hunt is surprisingly under utilized in the film, but is the biggest name to attract an audience into seeing the film. Her character is nuanced, but it definitely would've been nice to explore the guilt that visibly devours her from the inside. Lewis, who plays Hunt's son in the film, is growing into a versatile talented young actor who's getting ready for a huge breakthrough in mainstream media.Nothing is what it seems, but one thing is for sure - 'I See You' is best experienced when you don't know too much about its premise."}, {"id": 540, "text": "It's clear to me that the people who gave this flick high scores either worked on the film or know someone who did. Or, they got paid to leave good reviews.I have loved Helen Hunt's work since childhood when she used to play mean, snobby, little jerks, through all of her adult roles, so I was terribly disappointed to feel like I'd been betrayed by a lifelong friend. I know it's not altogether her fault, if at all. I just found all of the acting to feel detached, uninhabited. Actors acting. Not once did I feel swept up in the story, except perhaps when Libe Barer was in the scene. She was exquisitely believable as a teenage girl thrilled by phrogging. There was no depth to any of the other characters. Is that the actors' faults, or the director's?The only even barely redeeming quality to the movie was a plot twist about halfway through when it was made clear that the character you assumed did the bad thing was revealed to not have done it, when you learn who did. But that is it. All the other potentially interesting story lines were so watered down as to make it a film of barely-there stories, each one separated from the other, brought together in a mishmash concoction that had no grip to it. I was grateful when it was finally over.The long slow shots had me hitting the fast forward button more than once, partly due to the sound design which seemed overwhelmingly creepy on shots that otherwise would just be a suburban house or living room.I'll refrain from expounding very greatly on my disappointment at seeing that Ms Hunt has fallen into the celebrity trap of plastic surgery. There IS beauty in the natural order of things, and I hope one day soon our society will accept women over 40, 50 &amp; up for the exquisite grace that comes with years. Think Katherine Hepburn, Charlotte Rampling, Vanessa Redgrave.

This was released as a VOD not in most theatre's and it's the best thriller of 2019 imo. Judging by the decent trailer I was expecting a watchable thriller/horror and what I got was something completely different in the best way.The film sets up with an intriguing bizarre intro that pulls you in from the start with mystery, filled with crisp camerawork and a fantastic ominous soundtrack that never lets up. You're introduced to the characters and their problems and as things unravel you think you know whats happening until it's the exact opposite with an utterly creative take midway through. As insane events start blending chaotically from every direction, this quickly becomes an absolutely intense and well woven tale of the creepiest and most twisted nature that will hit viewers out of nowhere.Many films try their hand at non linear stories and only few work with such meticulous effectiveness like this film does in such a smooth style. It makes you want to restart the film right after its over and that is a quality that only truly great films posses. This will stick with people for quite some time.

The direction which was made by Adam Randall was good and he did an excellent job without using any unnecessary jump scares that could lower the quality of his movie. I also have to admit that I was surprised with the very good interpretation of Helen Hunt who played as Jackie Harper and she was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Owen Teague's who played as Alec, Jon Tenney's who played as Greg Harper and Libe Barer's who played as Mindy. Finally, I have to say that I See You is a nice crime movie and not a horror movie so, if you want to watch a classic horror movie then you should watch another movie and not this one. I recommend this movie because it feels very real and I am sure that you will feel it too, after watching it."}, {"id": 546, "text": "Incredibly unique, thrilling, and with some truly twisted and original storytelling- I See You is certainly an unexpected scary delight that I am glad I had the chance to see (no pun intended). The acting in it is actually very good for a horror film, and though I wouldn't explicitly call it a horror film (more of a thriller), it does have its genuinely frightening moments. Helen Hunt, Owen Teague, and Jon Tenney give some fantastic performances throughout the film, as well as the rest of the supporting cast also giving it their all. The film may seem to completely change about halfway through, as a large majority of that second half can seem very different from the first half, but surprisingly, I See You is not only able to tie its loose ends together, but also brilliantly weave two very different plot lines into one story. Its direction is surprisingly solid, and its script quite brilliant and unique. I have never quite seen a film like I See You or at the very least, a film told the way it was like I See You and I am honestly very impressed at the fact they were able to pull off such a frightening, suspenseful, and interesting thriller with it being so simple. In the end, I See You is definitely an underappreciated indie flick that I encourage anyone to see. It may feel uneven at times, but more often than not, it is a quite interesting, and very well crafted flick that I wouldn't mind watching again.

While watching the film, I felt some frustration and disappointment because I wanted to see at least one story play out in detail. However, it was satisfying at the end when I understood this was the films intention.The camera work was effective. The music was effective. The acting was solid. Everything that makes a movie a movie was done well and professionally.So that leaves my impression. There was one scene with Helen Hunt at work, which was very short. I wasn't sure it was necessary for the film, except to give her character a bit of depth. In order to do this, I think there needed to be another scene of her at work. Perhaps it was to demonstrate her ambien dependency (if it is a dependency). This storyline here doesn't have much relevance either. There was relational drama between the characters which felt short and abrupt. I wanted this to be explored more.When the film made a dramatic shift in storyline and cinematography about two thirds through the film, I felt a little disappointed because I had to get familiar with new key players. That being said, it was this shift that explained much of the mystery in the first half of the film.Throughout the film, I didn't know who's side I was on. The protagonist and antagonist in this film is not consistent, which is the point. It may have been difficult when writing the script and editing the film to avoid plot holes. Fortunately, I didn't identify any, but there were probably minor discrepancies.I'd say the characters were underdeveloped but the suspense and overall production of this film is well done. Interesting twists. By the end, I definitely wanted more from the film. I wanted more reaction from the characters when all is revealed to everyone. The credits role instead.

A young boy goes missing, and the detective assigned the case must deal with it, as well as problems at home. This is a very subtle piece. We're not too sure what is going on at home, but know that the wife (Helen Hunt) has committed a betrayal of some sort. The son hates her, and the father/detective just sneaks about the house and sleeps on the couch. To add to this stress, weird things are happening in the house. Stuff is going missing, amongst other strange occurrences. Is it supernatural? Is it somehow linked to the missing boy? Then we get to the halfway point and the sudden revelation makes things very interesting, and I was reminded of 2017's sleeper-hit horror Hangman (If you've seen that, you may guess what is going on here). Then there is another sudden twist and revelation and things are fired up nicely... but then there is another, at the end, and it just completely sinks the film. Overall, excellent, brooding score, good performances and a strong, uncomfortable atmosphere, which makes this review from me all the more negative because the film ultimately becomes entangled it itself and strikes for a cliched, overdone and predictable pay-off at the end. Unsatisfying."}, {"id": 549, "text": "It starts out great, with an opening plot about young boys being abducted and killed which is reminiscent of The Outsider on HBO.

So far so good. Then some weird things start happening and you begin to wonder if the house is, yes, haunted.Then it detours into a found-footage second act which at first seems to disrupt the entire flow (it is indeed too long for what it's needed to do) but eventually appears to establish a new villain that would explain a subsequent murder that occurs onscreen and the highly improbable coverup that occurs.It's here when the film then pulls a neat reversal of perspective where you get to rewatch much of what just happened from a different character's perspective, which reveals a huge plot point.It gets an above-average rating for this cool twist and the ultimate reveal of who the villain was, along with the reveal of somebody you thought was a villain but was in fact a victim. The third act salvaged what appeared to be at first a weird insertion of found-footage into act II.So, worth seeing, if not a horror classic. Stay for the ending though.

In this role you can't see any difference between her and any other lesser known decent actress, there is pretty much no development or relevant back story to her character;The teen actors (except one, and if you watch the movie, you'll know who I'm talking about) aren't bad, yet again flat characters;Close to the end some decisions don't make much sense and feel forced and a bit rushed, also due those decisions the plot twist is given away to easily;the dragged out shoting/fighting scene (way to overused adds nothing thrillery wise;the movie ends a bit abruptly, I sort off see why, but they could have added just 2-3 more scenes with the aftermath.Overall not a bad movie, it sets itself for more expectations then it delivers but it remains decent.

Mindy and Alec are two teenagers phrogging and settling into the Harpers' house. What we learn only at the end is that Alec has a plan, but is initially presented to us as a disturbed young man. What makes the story here completely illogical is that Mindy is the one who lures Alec into this house, but Alec apparently knows where she is leading him. There are some not very plausible situations in this movie, which might make it exciting and surprising for newcomers to the thriller genre.

I was beginning to wonder if someone in the family was trying to gaslight another member of the family. But this film does NOT go where you expect.

Connor is openly angry while Greg is more aloof and this creates engaging and downright uncomfortable interactions that brings adds to the already present tension. Adding to the conflicts is the investigation of a child abductor that Greg is investigating that has eerie similarities to a case from the past. Meanwhile strange occurrences happen within the Harper household that test the already strained family unit.One can't discuss anything beyond the set up because this movie is very much built upon its twists and for the most part they do work. However there are elements that do strain credibility in just how perfectly aligned certain story elements need to be in order for events later in the movie to transpire as they do. Without giving too much away the direction we're shown in the opening is revealed to have been a misdirection and we're instead taken down another direction, and then another, and then another one in the last 15 minutes. Its usage of twists and misdirection do work in the moment, but they do not hold up to much scrutiny after the movie ends.I See You is an effective thriller with an engaging mystery, haunting mood and atmosphere, and committed performances, but it stumbles later in the story due to building itself upon a few too many twists.

And if you like a taut and twisty story, it's worth sticking with until the end.The thing this movie most lacks is a character that I was really rooting for. I suppose that the most sympathetic character is the mother, played by Helen Hunt. Unfortunately, she isn't much of a force in the story for most of the the film, and is nowhere to be seen in the climax. She's really more of a viewpoint than a full character.The father, Greg, seems like the world's least suspecting police detective. His wife tells him that all of the silverware has disappeared from their house, he notices that pictures have gone missing from their frames, he's locked in a closet by. . . someone. . . and he's also told that a repairman who came to the house has reported being let in by a well-behaved young woman (when there is no such person living in their household) and his only reaction seems to be, Huh. I guess stuff happens sometimes.As a detective, he did not come across as a credible character. But then, as it turns out, he's got a lot of other things on his mind.I know that a lot of obvious stuff that goes unsaid between our main characters is supposed to be because it's a dysfunctional family where everyone is angry with everyone else, but there's a limit to how far you can push this. These people let an awful lot of very strange stuff just slide.One last, small complaint: Enough with the drone shots, already.

A very odd introduction to a mysterious world that from thereon drips with tension and menace.The music especially is unsettling, even using timpani drums to give a sense of occult malevolence. And then ... a great big switcheroo! The pace had been a bit of a drag up to that point, but the plot puts its skates on to get us to the climax through clever story telling. Is it contrived?

When I see a story this good, on a budget of only $3,000,000, it pains me to think of what might have been with a larger budget and yet what they were able to accomplish with the money they had was pretty spectacular.It's not the low rent thriller knock off that it may seem but you have to get through the first act's genre ambiguity (is it a family drama, a thriller or a supernatural horror?) to get the well-worth-the-wait payoff. You might be tempted to give up on it 10 minutes in, given its straight to video feel, but you shouldn't. The Premise: A boy goes missing. He may be the victim of a serial killer who was already captured, a copycat killer, or something more supernatural. As the Lead detective investigates, family drama unfolds inside his homeThe performances, ranging somewhere between acceptable and above satisfactory, contribute to the first half's generic feel and yet, ironically or planned, they give the finale all the more impact. I wouldn't blame the actors though... there's no snappy dialogue, no breakout character scenes, no Oscar worthy monologues; this one is all about the story, the atmosphere, well crafted segments and a script that turns genre cliche's into the best part of the movie.Normally I give separate ratings for script, acting, cinematography, score, etc. but it would be difficult to do that without giving away the inventiveness of this film.

STREAM TO BIG SCREEN will have to do. Thanks for coming back to get your daily or weekly dose of movie reviews. This week, we are reviewing a psychological crime thriller, I See You. This movie stars the acting veterans Helen Hunt and Jon Tenney as some strange occurrences are popping up in their lives personally, professionally, and physically. We get a look into their lives during an intense few days. So let's get to what there is to watch about I See You.Definitely going into this movie with zero expectations created streaming gold. Now, my wife and I love a good psychological thriller or horror movie, and this only slightly disappointed. By slightly, I mean, this movie takes a little too long to get going and also somehow takes too long to end, even though it's only about 90 minutes. It was a strange fit. I felt myself saying hurry up and get to it; and, then once we were in the meat of it, I found myself saying hurry up and resolve this thing. One could take that as a positive sign. There was a constant state of anxiety in this movie. If that's what Adam Randall was going for, then he succeeded. If this wasn't intentional, then you lucked out, buddy!It was luck in the sense that the storyline is very similar to a lot of movies or even Law &amp; Order: SVU episodes. However, the movie has a pretty good twist that I wish I could say I saw coming but in reality I didn't. I think I must have been distracted by wanting the movie to getting going, and then being engrossed in the thick of the movie, and then, finally, wanting the movie to resolve. In fact, that's the sign of a very good movie. You think you know what's coming and BLAM-O the movie crosses you up like A.I. did Jordan (watch The Last Dance documentary, if you all get a chance).The only unfortunate part of this movie is the forgettable acting. Helen Hunt doesn't shine, and here, she can be quite annoying. Fitz, or Jon Tenney, is just normal - literally nothing to write home about. The only standout performances were probably from Libe Barer and Owen Teague, but, they were also too minimally in the movie and/or a bit annoying during their scenes. Libe was too whiny and cautious for the actions she takes in the movie and Owen, while appropriate in hindsight, seemed too weird for the characters mindset.Nevertheless, I See You is solid addition to the Prime streaming service. The movie provides needed entertainment even with forgettable performances from the cast. The movie presents a familiar storyline with an intense and unique concept twist that keeps the viewer on their toes and full of anxiety. The thriller/suspense fans out there will be pleasantly surprised with this streaming feature.

Jackie is attempting to make amends but is getting nowhere, especially with her angst riddled teenage son Conner(Judah Lewis) who blames her for the current family dynamic. When a local boy goes missing, Detective Harper is assigned lead on the case, adding to his already stressful domestic situation. He and his partner, Detective Spitzky( Gregory Alan Williams) soon realize that this case resembles a child abduction case from fifteen years ago. A case where Spitzky was the arresting officer and is positive they got the right guy. Simultaneously, strange things begin occurring at the Harper residence. Items go missing, televisions and record players turn on by themselves, and other seemingly unexplainable things happen. Each member of the household is aware of the strange goings on but since no one is speaking to the other, the mystery remains unsolved. Are the unusual occurrences at home somehow connected to the missing child case? That is the question, and one I cannot answer without spoiling the movie. The tension is ratcheted up by director Adam Randall by using a creepy minimalist score as well as overhead and point-of-view shots giving the viewer the feeling that the characters are being watched by someone or something. As with any good thriller there are some plot twists and turns along the way. Unfortunately, when the twists are revealed, they raise as many new questions as they answer. The performances by the leads are, at best, fair. Hunt spends most of the movie walking around with her mouth agape in a constant stunned/surprised/horrified expression. Tenney's performance is restrained and may have been better handled by someone with better chops( for some reason Mark Ruffalo comes to mind). The supporting cast, however, is actually quite good and their performances carry the second half of the movie.

Detective Greg Harper (Jon Tenney) is busy investigating what happened to the missing boy. The only link he knows to make is that this case looks a lot like an equal, unsolved missing case from ten years ago. Greg is too busy with the case, so he has little rest. He didn't get much rest after discovering that his wife Jackie (Helen Hunt) was having a secret affair. For example, there has been a restless atmosphere in their household for some time. Jackie also claims to hear strange noises when she is alone in the house and often loses things. For example, Greg begins to wonder if there is a link between the strange things that are happening in his house and the missing boy, or if Jackie is starting to lose her mind.This movie is promoted a bit wrong with the trailers of the movie, so you expect that there is a more supernatural something behind the story of the movie. The same problem also happened with the film The Village by director M. Night Shyamalan. Another problem with this movie is the script written by Devon Graye. This is only the first film script he has written in which he tries to put all his twists side by side, but he has forgotten to pay close attention to the details of his own script. For example, the revelations of the film happen a bit too precisely at the end, so that they ultimately do not seem really credible anymore.The acting is done well by most of the cast, but due to the somewhat messy script, they do not all come out equally well. This movie is not her best acting for Helen Hunt. Her character also looks a bit confused, so as a viewer you can not always follow what she is doing.

I SEE YOU definitely has an original take on a thriller plot structure, making us wonder what the heck is going on, but the surprises regarding the murder mystery or the identity of the kidnapper are easy to predict. Nevertheless it's a tense little thriller and while it's hard to care for any of the characters, it is an enjoyable ride.On the negative side, Helen Hunt is terribly miscast as the protagonist's wife, and only there to raise the stakes. She doesn't really do anything apart from looking scared, helpless and occasionally bemused.Director Adam Randell (you might have enjoyed his Netflix superhero flick I-Boy) does well when it comes to original ideas, but I SEE YOU is a mixed bag, as it makes too many u-turns and while none of the twists feel out of place, changing direction doesn't help caring for the characters the way we should.Dark, mysterious and devoid of any gratuitous violence I SEE YOU is rather a mystery than a horror movie.

And as the title suggests it's not bad at all. But the issues I'll illustrate below is what stops it being a 7/10 or higher, real solid movie.Characters were underdeveloped massively. The mother and son in this story served little to no purpose throughout and you forget they even exist after the midway point. The villain aka the person who you find out has been kidnapping these kids, doesn't give you a reason as to why. And yeah, none of the characters are likeable due to the lack of depth on them all.So I think the story is told pretty well on the whole, it's done different and it works. You watch this story unfold from one point of view, then the other. It also has 2 storylines to follow. My only issue with this is that, after the 45 min mark, it basically bins off one of storylines and then comes back to it with 10 mins left. This leaves the ending a little anti-climatic for me. Same for that huge twist. It was just too anti-climatic and lost that emotion.I know I've just slated the film, but on the whole it's well worth watching.

Well the fact it only cost $3 million tells you something. Tells you a lot. Tells you they couldn't be bothered to make a decent movie. They went for the hand held shaky camera option which I have to say I hate. I hate it in horror movies and I hate it in thrillers. It's lazy, boring and very irritating.Someone said I had to see I See You, 'it's great'. Oh no it's awful. Badly acted, a boring story but worst of all is there are no proper scenes. We're meant to believe people spend their lives walking around with a camcorder recording everything. You know why they did that, because the director couldn't be bothered to set up the scenes properly. Couldn't be bothered with the lighting, camera angles, etc. Nothing.

Authors like Edgar Allen Poe, Steve King, and M. Knight should watch out for this combination, I don't think you can get any more creative than this. I SEE U, is a game-changer. The background of this movie is perfect, in middle America, there is a family of three, a mother, which is a doctor, played by Helen Hunt, whos been out of the movie scene for what seems like a lifetime, but she's back with a VENGEANCE, her husband, Detective Harper, play by Joh Tenney and son Judah Lewis who is a high school student. This family has problems like the average American, like the mother having an affair and begging her husband forgiveness, which changed their family dynamic, causing them to fall apart and lose trust in one another, which sets the stage for one of the most creative films I've seen in a dog's ages. Detective Harper is working on a case in which he believes it's copycat murder/kidnapping from one of detective Spitzky's old cases, played by Gregory Alan Williams, for which the suspect was captured and sent to prison. If you're a Crime, Drama or Thiller fantastic, then I challenge you, to figure out the ending to this film before it ends. I believe this to be the Crime film of the DECADE. With this All-Star cast, I would put this up against any Steve King or M. Knight film. It's a wonder why it didn't make it into the Theaters. I See U, is a must-see, film for everyone that's into these genres. They labeled it as a horror also, but I do understand why they could put it in the horror genre, but I don't do spoilers. This film has more twists and turns then Michael Jacksons' performance at the 1984 Grammy music award show Writer Devon Graye and Director Adam Randall collaborated to make a MASTERPIECE.
