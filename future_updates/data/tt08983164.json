But the story is routine, and it's treatment, execution very ordinary. The climax is very weak. Background music is standard; hence the desired impact of the critical scenes are lessened to a great extent. The film could have been 15-20 mins less. The direction isn't extraordinary. So overall the film turns to be average. Music is decent. It's a one time watch"}, {"id": 3, "text": "The first half of the movie is nice but not that good. The second half of where the movie loses its charm and becomes predictable and slow. Don't expect too much from the movie. You may like it if you have low standards.Looks like bollywood is still living in fictional world, I'm from Haryana and if a couple are found hanging out they are beaten black and blue, but here they are going for dates specially in city like jajjar. And meeting guys Father. Eventually the girl will always end with the hero and in this case job too. The movie doesn't makes sense in the second half, it's like Sultan where he does training for one month and he beats the world chapions. Over here they had turned nerds into professional players within few days.Very disappointed and dissatisfied. Lost my previous time. I wish I could get it back."}, {"id": 4, "text": "Movie was not upto the mark.... First of all I don't like this idea of holding a competition for a woman.....

Though I appreciate the fact that the player who actually turned the tables and was the most reliable one was actually a girl and the team was having players of both genders..... The idea that the boys were chased by dogs in a guava orchard was bad, the is not how training is done....."}, {"id": 5, "text": "The movie deals really well with the attitude of people towards sports in India through the life of the protagonist.

(Then why did they spend our 30mins on showing the grit of kids to excel in sports, if they had to win through dogs barking aloud on speakers) Second thing objectionable is that when teachers would serve false court notices to parents in blackmailing the parents to work on the whim and fancies of the school Admin and to make the children do something which the parents don't approve off, (this they call it in the movie Sam dham dand bhed, chanakya would be really ashamed of this type of interpretation) Thirdly, to bring out the best underdog story, of never to give up even if all your chips are down, the laywer father comes out with so called motivational story about his client who he was fully convinced off, that the client the lawyers are representing was actually the murderer and fighting for his client was wring and a lost cause, and even though the whole village knew about the outcome that the client would be tried for murder, the lawyer bit into his grit and through his skill, even though he knew this was a lost cause, did manage to acquit the murderer, (what an underdog story\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f)"}, {"id": 10, "text": "Unrealistic movie..made up situations...90's type of movie..."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Its not like this story has not been told before , but what makes chalaang unique is primarily the direction of hansal mehta, who after a long time is indulging in such a project , and secondarily rajkumar rao's flawless acting talent .

Chhalaang aims to be about grit and determination and romance but the lead character's bumptiousness prevents me from taking him and the film seriously. It annoys you a little when the man (Rajkummar), a slacking fitness coach at a small rural school, is forced to pull up his socks at the sight of a nemesis coach assigned by the principal.

Flow is relaxed. Natural interaction between actors and does not feel like a commercial act at all. 3. Stunning cast. Rajkumar, Sourabh, Satish Nusrat, Zeeshan, Illa, all of them are outstanding, the entire team complemented each other's presence. Their expressions escalate the mood of this movie 4. The atmosphere of the movie is cozy, relatable to our everyday life, minus the music of course. 5. The dialogues are precise, funny, and appropriate. Most importantly the delivery is smooth.

All supporting cast was amazing, these are pro actors and hardly ever go wrong, no matter what role! Loved Rajkumar's mum's character, not very many scenes but she was the typical Haryanvi mother, impeccable performance. Jatin Sarna was quite an underutilized talent, he is a good actor but had no significant role and was totally missing in the second half. Music and humor was average, though the scenes of dogs barking in the finale was a facepalm moment for me!! I hope we get to see inspiring movies but without the continuous preaching.

Ofcourse. But you can't all have serious, grave movies with social messages because many won't watch it.This movie touches on many social issues in a light hearted manner that it *almost* escapes you.Raj Kumar is a part of the moral police in the beginning &amp; later in a subtle manner it is showcased how wrong he was. These movies are VERY important. There are so many such hidden dialogues.Yes, it's a cliche. Taking a rag tag team and making something out of them. As if alllll Bollywood movies so far have been so original.

The story also deals with the importance of sports education and gender parity. The first half has well-written characters and smartly written humour. The second half has well-executed Basketball and Kabaddi matches, although there was still room for tighter editing.Rajkummar Rao never disappoints, he again delivers a diverting performance. Nushrratt Bharuccha gave a charming performance with her lovable Haryanvi diction. Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub looks convincing as the competitive PT teacher.

It targets the frivolous nature of PT as a subject in schools with subtle yet powerful gender inequality still existing in society. Subject looks impressive and the hype it got before it's release sets the expecting sky high, something which it fails to live by. Hansal Mehta coming on the back of a blockbuster web series 'Scam 1992' somehow hasn't been able to make this as exciting. More often than not you might have deja vu with Dangal and Chichhore. The predictably of the script adds to yet another reason for this not living up to expectations. In no way it's a bad movie, but definitely a good distance apart from a WOW movie. Absolutely a good watch for entertainment but don't keep very high expectations. Rajkumar Rao have life to Monty and was brilliant as always. Nushrratt finally got a more character oriented script and she has shown quality and real glimpses of her talent. The Hariyanvi accent was beautifully.

A mediocre film with performing actors like Rajkumar Rao, Saurabh Shukla, Satish Kaushik, Nusrrat Bharucha, Ila Arunand Zeeshan yet it's a pastime and nothing extraordinary or great here.Writing felt ordinary at best, music was decent and score was good. Jatin Sarna 9f Sacrad games comes and goes as fast as a Parle G get drowned in Chai. Haryanvi accents are at par and film does intend to provide a social message but it looks more like a forcibl glass of milk than a smooth gulping milkshake.Available on Amazon Prime, watch it for the sake of watching it and nothing else otherwise lagao Chhalaang to the bed or couch nearby and sleep."}, {"id": 405, "text": "Chhalaang, Hansal Mehta's fifth time collaboration with Rajkummar Rao; is a breezy entertainer. Being an above average execution at best, especially keeping in mind the excellent track record of Mr. Mehta in recent times; It just about delivers as a pastime.Hansal Mehta has a distinctive style in his craft. As we have seen several times with his outings like Omerta, Citylights, Shahid, Aligarh or the recent hit Scam 1992. All those being critically acclaimed and inordinately loved by the audience. As a result with any of his new projects; the expectations are usually sky-high. Perhaps those exceeding confidence should be the one to take all the blames.A message is indeed there, the intent is discernible but an underwhelming execution failing to match those ideas on a similar level. Performances are great. The writings on every character had me surprised. Even the smaller roles made an impact. It's technically well made with a competent work behind the lens &amp; a fitting soundscore! However In all fairness, all the flaws &amp; loopholes in the script subdued its other qualities.Conveying the gravitas of 'Sports' and its irrefutable positive effects on children is laudable. But it was never set up as a sports drama, nor it had any naive intentions to do so. The sole focus was always on the underdog story of Rajkummar Rao as Montu and his journey from an ignorant fool to a sensible being. Hence, after its first half the storyline lost its charm and began its slow &amp; unfortunate descent into mediocrity."}, {"id": 406, "text": "Chhalang-- A Very Long Jump Another OTT original feature film release in Covid times, this time on Amazon Prime. Lately we have been hearing such names like Chak-de, Dangal, Panga, which point to a desi flavour in tales of inspiration in sports. They are comparable to similar offerings in Hollywood of fight and motivation. Generally such stories are drawn form real life. As the name suggests this movie too deals with the same genre I.e. sports but the inspiration is from a hurt to the ego of one man as, the movie set out to be Montu'sl story of goof and love but there is a jump literally midway. It changes to a story of the underdog. Though everyone has their respective favourites in sports but one's heart surely goes out for the underdog. The movie is set in a quintessential town of Haryana. Indians love their heros in the field of sports and are proud of our Tendulkars and Milkhas and P.T. Udhas and Sindhus and want our children to be as successful as them, but as Montu-Rajkumar Rao's character says we as parents don't want to support our children to be like these idols. It is naukri and chhokri for which the boys are prepared in their youth and if a girl studies even upto 12th in the mofussil towns of India it is breaking news as they are prepared for chula and chowka for their in-laws' house. People who support their children or their married daughters-in-law really have a big heart. Though things are a changing but ever so slowly. Realisation that sports can also give a career and has professionals is setting in due to the various leagues in football, kabaddi, badminton etc. apart from cricket which is a religion for our teeming billion. Some encouragement, some support and some financial aid is the need of the hour. It is a story of courage and never say die spirit. It is about never giving up in face of extreme adversity. With a little hope, encouragement, out of the box thinking, perseverance and you will come out tops. That is the USP of this film but in the second half. The first half is dedicated to an insensitive, ambition-less PT instructor whose main job is to avoid work and loaf around, his passions are aroused only when he faces challenge in both job and love from a superior individual. The story changes to a tale of inspiration from then on. The unique touch of Director Hansal Mehta who makes us forget that it started out to be a romantic flick and splendidly turns it around. He is also the person who has helmed such sensitive socials like Shahid, Aligarh, Omerta and his latest offering being Scam 1992 which is a web series streaming on Sony LIV OTT platform besides this one. There is a definite shift in his subject, whereas in the past his films have dealt with social issues, the latest offerings from his stables have been more of mainstream commercial cinema but the touch is definitely still there. The performances are as expectedly great from seasoned actors like Rajkumar Rao, it is very noticeable that Haryanvi suits this guy and he he has not let us down either , he has given us a superlative performance in the movie and has looked every bit the Hero for the movie and in his character. The surprise packet is Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Mr. Singh the Johnny come lately who it trying to take over Montu's job and love. Nusrat Bharucha as a whiskey sipping, out going and a girl with a head firmly in place has performed suitably for the role and she looks dainty too. The veterans Satish Kaushik, Ila Arun and Saurabh Shukla make their presence felt. The dialogues and the behavior of the small town characters have been captured with subtle finnasse, in scenes like the fight in vegetable market and the sports ground or the one at Monty's friend Dimpy's eatery where they tease him for his cooking and profession that's the kind of banter we hear in such places where small things matter too. It is the second movie in as many days after 'Ludo' where the heroine asks the hero 'daru pilayega'? The equation seems to be changing. It is food for thought to all ye horsing males.http://filmytown.com/movies/chhalaang-movie-review/"}, {"id": 407, "text": "The collaboration between Hansal Mehta and Rajkummar Rao is a force to be reckoned with. They've given us great films like Shahid, Aligarh, Citylights and Omerta. Their fifth collaboration, Chhalaang is not up to the mark.Chhalaang follows Montu, a PT teacher who is very lazy with his job. One day a senior PT teacher arrives and both clash with each other, leading to a sports competition between them to decide who gets to keep their job.I really like Mehta and Rao's previous works together but this time they decided to do something more mainstream and accessible. The end product is Chhalaang, which is one of the most ordinary and unoriginal films pf the year. The film isn't terribly bad per se but it's nothing special or memorable like their previous films. This doesn't feel like a Hansal Mehta film as all his other movies feel grounded in reality but some of the events that take place in this film don't feel realistic at all. The sports competition is something I've seen countless times and is riddled with all the clich\u00e9s you can expect. Nothing about it is very exciting or new. It's too predictable. What the film does do well is the authenticity of Haryana. The accents and location help in making the state feel real.The acting is pretty good. Rajkummar Rao is great as usual. There is a great scene with him and Satish Kaushik drinking during the night and the way he delivers dialogue is really well done. Nushrat Bharucha does well but it felt strange seeing her character wear high heels throughout the movie. Saurabh Shukla and Jatin Sarna provide a couple of laughs and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub is pretty good as well.Overall, Chhalaang is very predictable and forgettable. Nothing new or creative is done with this kind of story and nothing stands out in particular. Unfortunately it's just another basic sports drama..."}, {"id": 408, "text": "The strory is simple and interesting with good humour. Best part of the film is you all can watch amd enjoy it with your whole family. Although there is nothing new in this but still screenplay is so much interesting to keep you seat till film gets over. Story revolves mostly around a PT teacher Monty played by Rajkumar Rao and how his life change. Some of the sports drama in film you can compare from CHHICHHORE but still this film is unique in own way. Talking about performance Rajkumar Rao is the soul of the film and again he has given powerful performance. Zeeshan Ayub again prove his acting skills and he deserve more recognisation. Saurabh Shukla made you laugh whenever he came. Nushrat looks damn pretty. Rest of the supporting cast especially all child Artists have done a great job. direction of Hansal Mehta is good and yet again he has presented a good movie to all sections of the society with a strong message. Songs are decent. personally i like Care ni karda and teri choriyaan songs. Negative is you can predict easily what wil happen next in some parts of movie. And also sports drama could be presented in some more better way. But these flaws could be let aside overall This film deserve a watch with all your family on Diwali. Recommended level: High sir"}, {"id": 409, "text": "A very simple movie that delivers a very powerful message in a very entertaining way. It talks about an important issue and convey the message in such a delightful way without preaching. It keeps you hooked till the end, not a boring moment. Hats off to Luv Ranjan's writing and Hansal Mehta's direction. After Akaash Vani we can see Luv Ranjan has written something beautiful instead of his usual Rom-com movies like Pyaar ka punchnama and Sonu ke titu ki sweety. Reminds us that he is capable of writing good female roles too. Totally different genre for Hansal Mehta but he has aced this social comedy.Acting is top notch by everyone including the kids. Raj Kumar Rao is one of the best actors in this generation he has proved it again in this one, you cant help but root for this goofy PT teacher Montu in whatever he is doing. Luv Ranjan's muse Nushrat Bharucha does an amazing job as Neelu. She is such a natural actor and deserves good roles like this. Raj and Nushrat shares amazing chemistry and its delightful to watch two self made actors doing so good in movies. Supporting cast is top notch, not a single bad casting in the lot. Best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the kids. They have done a superb job each and every one of them. Like the balance between girls and boys. One character that stood our for me personally was the girl Pinky and her little storyline.All in all it's a perfect family entertainer that gives a message to teachers, students and most importantly parents."}, {"id": 410, "text": "Chhalaang (2020) : Movie Review -Chhalaang was lucky not to release with high expectations because the trailer clearly said that it is nothing new but just same old traditional bollywood stuff. Hero falls in love with heroine, third guy enters in this emerging Love story, hero feels jealous, challenges him and defeats him in close match. Chhalaang is as predictable as this typical 90s formula which is by far outdated in today's time but then it has sports issues to deal with. Whether it manages to deal with the issue or not is a different argument altogether, but yes we have it and we have it in outdated and predictable manners. If all this 90s or may be 80s formulatic drama if I'm not wrong makes to your watchlist in 2020 then you should definitely watch Chhalaang this diwali.Chhalaang is a story of a lazy and ambitionless PT coach Mohinder aka Montu who falls in love with a computer teacher Ms. Neelima. However their first introduction spoils his dreams, he tries to convince her through apologies and few local heroic tricks. Then the 3rd guy Mr. Singh enters in this emerging love story and Montu decides to take him on. Both the coaches makes this small challenge look like a national war and we all know who wins at the end. Chhalaang never ever looks like trying something new, it doesn't even bother putting new techniques in the love story nor it bothers doing something in screenplay. It looks rough right from the first frame till the last one and somehow manages to make an average flick with the help of performance and postive outcome.Rajkummar Rao is a brilliant actor and we have seen him taking tough challenges so this Montu character is too lightweighted according to his standard. He deserves better and tougher roles which can suit his potential but this Montu is very ordinary. Nushrat Bharucha looks gorgeous and handles local accent beautifully. Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub also gets underwhelming role to play and he does it like an easy daily life course such as walking or sleeping. Supporting cast is fine but remains unnoticed because of weak writing.Chhalaang did not stand a chance to come out as a good film because it falters in the on paper writing but directorial efforts make it look even more weaker than it was. Lame execution in almost every aspect kills the potential of decent story is somehow saved by Music and Performances. As far as such films are being made audience will keep saying, Enough of old school books, Bollywood needs to think out of the box or at least try something new. Overall, Chhalang got nothing new to offer but still it's an average watchable flick when there is nothing else to watch. Hopefully people won't show much interest to see just another frivolous short jump made by Bollywood filmmakers hence they might come with something new next time. It is hard to believe a creative mind like Hansal Mehta came up with something like this because he's one of those from whom we expect something innovative and hard hitting.RATING - 5/10*"}], "reviews_amount": 411}
