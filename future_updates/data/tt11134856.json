Is it just a coincidence or is it people's aspirations in search of easy money is churning out such movies. Each movie is different in its way thought with choked being technically apt, Lootcase for its wide array of characters and Chhappad Phaad Ke has the most believable screenplay among the three.The story starts around the Demonetisation era with an average middle class family with strong values stumbling upon a Cash stash by chance, and the changes that happens within the family as a result, forms the rest of the movie. Excellent Screenplay along with a sprinkling of humour as mentioned earlier is the main strength of Chhappad Phaad Ke. Very believable characters is another strong point in this movie that is casted decently. But very average cinematography and some poor makeup for the artistes spoils certain scenes. Music, especially the background score, filled with retro stuff is excellent. The director shows his class in the last 15-20 minutes of the film. Vinay Pathak playing the uncle next door character steals the show with yet another brilliant performance. Most of the supporting actors have done a decent job.Though Chhappad Phaad Ke's making looks like a soap opera on steroids, the story and screenplay definitely punches above its weight making it a better movie. If one hasn't watched either Lootcase or Chocked before it's definitely worth a watch. Overall it's a family movie and and makes an enjoyable watch."}], "reviews_amount": 357}
