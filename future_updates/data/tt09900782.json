The protagonist more or less looks like a immortal being sent into this plot who could survive infinite amount of melee attacks and could also survive several stone attacks on the back of head.One part of the plot that revolves around the police station was too good to be true. When a bunch of youngsters who are detained in police station for drunken driving in a normal world wouldn't involve themselves in acts that could potentially prove to be fatal. But, the director defies the norm here. The detained group of youngsters (read as good samaritans) decide to help a old cop who has been transferred to that police station that night keep vigil until the protagonist along with the senior cop arrive there. As one would expect, the police station that has rogues filled in it and parasitic thugs who try to jail break the police station from the outside finally butcher one of the detainees.Just like his previous film, maanagaram, lokesh kanagaraj has made this movie with logic defying stunts that are absurd to say the least. In spite of all this, the emotional bond between the protagonist who waits for 10 years to see his daughter for the first time lifts the spirits of the entire movie which is otherwise pulled down by the trite sequences."}, {"id": 21, "text": "An engaging one!

The entire film takes place over the course of one night. From establishing a drug crime to bringing different, unrelated characters into it, building the pace and finally resolving it, there is never a moment when one is bored. And between all this, the writer manages to include some good humor and emotion. There were so many scenes when the director manages to switch from a nail biting sequence to a light hearted one within a scene. Lovely acting by everyone and awesome music! No time wasted in unnecessary romance or flash back. If I had to point out flaws, maybe it would be some over the top heroism and slightly unbelievable action sequences in the second half."}, {"id": 24, "text": "What a painfully long movie....try making movies under 90mins.....bad editing ..too many bad guys....miserable and fake fight scenes ...totally unbelievable ...unrealistic cop functioning ....

The best 2 scenes are - when Karthi shares his past And Karthi and the other guy shooting their way out if a mob - very practical and don't know why the same wasn't applied for most of the good vs bad encounters??

They are powerful and influential enough to slip drugs in the drinks of entire police force including the retiring commissioner but they don't bring along any guns or sophisticated equipment to barge into the police station. No metal cutters, electric saws etc; not even when there is 900 crores worth of drugs at stake. They spend the whole night hammering at the gates with their bare hands and just at the last hour, they hit upon the brilliant idea of using their vehicle to smash down the gates.And the police station doesn't seem to have any guns in the armoury, so the old cop waits to face them with a sickle in his hand.Worst still is the fact that even when the key gang members (Anbu and Adaikalam) are both in the custody of the old cop, it still doesn't occur to him to tell the goons to back off by threatening to shoot them down."}, {"id": 36, "text": "All after it is a such a thrilling horror emotional movie.

It gave the satisfaction of watching a full length non stop entertainer after a very long time.

How is that when an entire police station is being brought down by the drug peddling thugs no police force arrives to neutralise the situation.2. Karthi is at times portrayed as someone who is superhuman who rides again and again bashing the villains.I understand that these movies are to be enjoyed without us dwelling deep into the details, but given that Lokesh is really talented and a director with a mesmerising craft, he could have made the story even more believable which could have propelled the film to an even more higher standard.Nevertheless the film on the whole is a blast and is not to be missed and we need more and more of these kind of films and more directors like Lokesh."}, {"id": 107, "text": "I have to say this is one of the finest Tamil cinema produced in this decade.

I think he is specialist of one-night action thriller.Because MAANAGARAM also one night thriller.There is no mistake in his narration and direction PERFECT js only one word match for him 10/10 is not enough. PERFECT FILM FOR THIS DIWALI. MUST WATCH IN THEATRE.MUST WATCH WITH FAMiLy"}, {"id": 197, "text": "A truck load of drugs is seized by a crack team of cops in what appears to be the biggest drug bust ever. The desperate drug gang wants the consignment back at any cost.Thus begins a narrative that is a thrill ride of events unfolding over a night with well placed moles on each side and safety of the cache as well as the lives of some top cops hanging by a slender thread resting on the shoulders of a recently released convict.Karthi brings a simmering intensity to the part of the protagonist, Dilli - both as a father yearning to see his daughter for the first time after spending a decade in prison as well as the titular macho convict rescuing the cops. Sam CS throttles the proceedings onwards with his pulsating score.After a stellar debut with Maanagaram, director Lokesh Kanagaraj (LK) delivers an above average action flick that is fairly engaging and entertaining.Overall, while it may not match Maanagaram in its audacity, Kaithi, despite its flaws, is a neat action entertainer."}, {"id": 198, "text": "It's fairly impossible to craft an action-thriller suited to the Tamil sensibilities without acknowledging its audience. Lokesh Kanagaraj does a pretty amazing job of staying true to the pure action genre in Kaithi. It's that action thriller with a lot of heart. As we saw in Kanagaraj's earlier venture Maanagaram, Kaithi too has interweaving storylines. But the treatment is what renders it engaging throughout. It's a long film (153 minutes or so) yes, but the story moves at such a rapid pace that the audience remains consistently hooked. To put it across in a funny way, Kaithi is the kind of film where there's so much happening at breakneck speed that a viewer who's about to open the lid of a water bottle to hydrate himself/herself may hold back from doing so, till the end of another elaborate set-piece.And when we talk about set-pieces, their crafting is stunning (though exaggerated at times). Anbariv is the man behind these well-thought-out sequences that often raise the levels of adrenaline in the audience. Sathyan Sooryan (the DOP of Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru) handles the cinematography - Kaithi has been shot entirely in the night (except for the last few frames) and yet, everything that unravels in artificial light looks good on screen. The background score by Sam CS definitely ups the style element of the film, and it's one soundtrack you'll want to check up on YouTube or SoundCloud immediately once you're done watching.There are no songs or sappy romances in Kaithi - well, that's how an action thriller ought to be. I appreciate Kanagaraj for doing away with these unnecessary commercial elements, even when there are numerous 'invincible mass hero' moments. It's wonderful how Kanagaraj has given emphasis to characters other than that of Karthi's Dilli. George Maryan, who is relegated to comical roles in most films, gets a meaty character with a fair bit of action - he does a brilliantly memorable job of it! Narain, whom we're seeing in movies after a while, is wonderfully restrained and lets Karthi shine in the scenes that are for the whistling fans. Dheena offers some comic relief in the form of pop-culture references and lightens the tone of the otherwise serious flick.At the core, there's also a story about a father who's travelling to meet his daughter for the first time. While this amps up the sentimental quotient, certain scenes such as the one featuring the crushed earrings, could have been written better (or completely subverted). There isn't any suspense as the important twisty bits are given away in the opening (half) itself, but Kanagaraj's packaging works wonders here. The action bits are strongly done, and that's a more-than-good reason to watch Kaithi. Well, how often do you see a lungi-clad hero using a Gatling gun?"}, {"id": 199, "text": "Kaithi (2019) : Brief Review -A Hollywood Remake converted into a 'Blockbuster A Grade Action Drama' in Tamil Cinema. Among all the South Action films i have seen till date whether it is on Television or on Mobile, most of them had insensible and unreasonable action sequences to please masses therefore i don't have much interest to watch such films. Somehow, Kaithi made it to my watchlist because of High Rating in IMDb and Bollywood Remake announcement. Now i can say that, Yes, South can make Sensible Action Films with right contect, well executed Action sequences and perfect emotional touch. Kaithi is a fine example of A Grade Action Film (not a thriller at all) which is far far away from those unrealistic and non sense action flicks where any thin hero could take on 40 healthy villains and make them fly high with unseen hidden punches. Apart from Action Kaithi also takes care of proper plotting from the start to the end having all the conflicts at right places. The leading role is amazingly portrayed by Karthi. He was into the character from the first scene and never took it out of him whether it is action sequence or emotional scene. It would be hard for me to forget his image and see Ajay Devgn in Bollywood Remake even though Ajay Devgn is a Great Actor. Rest of the cast is okay but no effective impact from anyone. Lokesh Kanagraj direction is matured which is rare in this genre because he kept the essence and content alive. He did not fall apart for adding comedy and make it just another masala film, rather he made it thrilling which is rare. And despite little dark tone the film became a Blockbuster success which proves that Director's vision to make an original flick in an unoriginal genre was right. Finally a relief from senseless Action flicks in South Indian cinema since Bahubali and KGF.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"}, {"id": 200, "text": "It takes serious guts to lock horns with a movie like BIGIL and release your movie on the same day. The guts can only come from tremendous confidence in the output and Lokesh Kanagaraj emerges successful once again with his Karthi-starrer , Kaithi. Similar to the screenplay style of Maanagaram, Kaithi also has multiple plots running in parallel, where all gets connected towards one common cause.The movie opens with a big drug bust operation led by Bejoy (Narain) where the lower level mafia group is detained. Irked by this operation, the mafia leader's brother fixes a huge ransom in return to decapitating the 5 police officers involved. Unaware of the insiders from the drug mafia, the entire police force is in a party where drinks are mixed with harmful sedatives. Bejoy now has the task of transporting the entire unconscious police force to a safe medical facility without alerting media, other officials or the mafia. His only option is Dilli (Karthi) who is brought into custody for an anonymous investigation, since he alone can drive the lorry to carry the officials. Whether Bejoy-Dilli were successful in carrying out the operation or did the mafia get hold of the drugs is the remaining plot.The movie holds the audience under its clutch right from the first frame. What is surprising to see is Karthi, an otherwise experienced actor in dialogue deliveries, has been given very little dialogues and yet he manages to steal the show by his mere body language and rustic attitude. Each time Dilli manages to escape the ploy of the mafia, it is literally a case of our blood pressure shooting up. Sam CS has terrified the audience with his BGM score. Another notable highlight is George Maryan along with the college students guarding the IG office forte from the mafia. While his comedy roles in movies such as Kalakalappu made him famous, this for sure will show him in a different light.Well, the ending definitely suggests there could be a sequel/prequel to this. We can't be more excited!"}, {"id": 201, "text": "147 minutes! Does it sound longer to sit and witness a single night's event? If you are an indian movies follower, does it sound boring to watch a movie which doesn't have a female lead or any songs to tap our feet? Huh. If you have any more of such doubts, take my answer. This movie is utterly impressive and absolutely worthy of your time and money. Lokesh Kanagaraj who made Managaram which again was a thrilling tale of few characters in one night. It was perfectly casted and made as a complete film and hence all eyes were on Kaithi. Lokesh had just arrested me with his screen writing and treating every scene with so much conviction to blow audience's mind completely. The cast again was topnotch. The constable Napolean (Maryan), Anbu (Arjun das), Inspector (Naren) and every little character was so tailor made for everyone respectively. It gave a fresh sense of viewing the movie as the buzz it creates right from scene one was perfectly fitting. Except for a slight (very minimal) slump in second half which was actually unavoidable to have the story completed, the movie was amazingly well crafted to it true genre. Loved this movie and look forward to next avenues of Lokesh as he seem to be one of the greatest asset to Indian cinema already."}, {"id": 202, "text": "STORY A prisoner on parole, who's on his way to meet his daughter, is enlisted by an injured police officer to protect a few cops. With the entire lot of gangsters in the place after them, can the prisoner save the day? REVIEW The film revolves around a prisoner which is released from the jail.. who is named Dilli. The entire film runs in one night.. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT it runs in one night just like Lokesh kankaragan Managaram. It's a very gripping and action thriller which hooks us completely.. Karthi shoulders the film where no actor in the movie does.. ONE MAN SHOW. Like most of the Indian Films do.. there is no any type of masala added in this film.. it's completely different from other films.. in terms of cinematography and the music. The cinematography was very good and engaging throughout the movie.. the cinematographer painted the film perfectly with his tools. THE music by Sam c.s was excellent and stupendous. It elevated the film and the hero. The technical aspects of the movie was good. The director grabs the attention through his art of taking movies.. The emotions which Karthi potrays in this film is heart touching. You can see different Karthi through this film.. OVERALL VERDICT - YOU HAVE TO GIVE A TRY.. OTHERWISE YOU'LL MISS SOME WONDERS.."}, {"id": 203, "text": "In cinema across the world, when the story revolves around mafia, corruption, police and a common man striving to help the right and be just, we have always seen that it never goes wrong. In Kaithi, we witness the same.In a gripping story on how the police lay their hands on multi-crore drugs and what ensues henceforth till the audience is left with a cue when the end credits roll that something more will happen, Kaithi is a power packed film which grips you for 2.5 hrs not allowing you to rest. It is an edge of the seat thriller where you cheer and root for the protagonist to be successful in whatever he has set out to accomplish.#Karthi is powerful in the role as Delhi, a screen name and role that will not be forgotten in the near future. He is rustic, raw, and convinces you easily as a convict who has been released from prison a good four years before he completes his life imprisonment sentence. Who knows why did that happen and if at all that was the reason. You will be left with this question when the true motive of the protagonist is left for the audiences to guess. And we just smelt a second part with that last dialogue.Karthi is that star who is an actor too and understands what works with the audience. It is very evident with the kind of scripts he selects and ensures that the message reaches the audiences without fail.The second hero of this movie is the terrific background score which keeps you restless and at the edge of your seat throughout. It is that nail biting tension of what will happen next, which makes this movie even more enjoyable.Kudos to the director for not succumbing to the usual pressure of committing to song and dance sequences trying to give the hero a role that suits his image. This song-less thriller will do wonders with the sole reason that the thriller genre has actually got one solid candidate in a very long time in the form of KAITHI.While other departments like action and stunts, cinematography, and art direction are also commendable, I wish the screenplay and writing was a little more crisp and avoided few glaring mistakes which could added more depth to this thriller. Since the audience have already smelt a sequel, I hope these are addressed well enough in the next part.Be prepared folks... Karthi is going to be back with a sequel and I cannot wait for that.Go and watch it now, else you would regret later for having missed watching this thriller in a cinematic atmosphere."}, {"id": 204, "text": "Lokesh Kanagaraj's script writing is fresh, intense and unique., Director's spl talent to convey a single line story telling over a night with good characters and direction made this kaithi a blockbuster.,Undoubtedly one of the best theater experience movie for the flawless gripping screenplay with a action packed thriller after a long time without a song and heroine.Karthi's top notch acting shows how a versatile actor he is either in a emotion or a action genre .,Sathyan sooriyan cinematography is crystal clear even the entire movie is shooted in night.Sam C S - Terrific BGM.,"}, {"id": 205, "text": "The title of the film is not kaithi because its the story of a prisoner but because when one starts watching it you will be locked up and won't move until the film ends. Initially, I was not interested at all in this film. I didn't even see its trailer. But the super strong positive word of mouth made me curious to watch it. Finally, I have got to see it and everything said about it is true. It keeps you glued on the seat from start to finish. The best thing of the film is its bgm which helps the film to not become dull and makes it worth a theatre experience. Screenplay of the film is watertight despite many things happening around. Performances of everyone is perfect. Karthi once again proves his versatility as dilli. His acting in emotional scenes were amazing. I loved the voice of anbu character (not sure whether its dubbed). Special mention goes to that police constable character who can be called as the second hero of the film. Tamil cinema is famous for family sentiments. Kaithi too has a daughter sentiment and it was very touching. Kudos to karthi and the child. And finally the action sequences. Though unrealistic and bit over the top it was very powerful. Film ends with a cliffhanger making you eager to know about dilli. On the whole, kaithi is a must watch for its interesting plot, tight screenplay and many thrilling moments. Waiting for its sequel. Hats off to lokesh kanakarajan and all the best for thalapathy 64."}, {"id": 206, "text": "Karthi delivers yet another blockbuster after Theeran adhigaaram ondru and Thozha with a performance in Kaithi that is subtle and nuanced in parts with big helpings of masala and action when needed. Although the movie is overstretched at 2 hours 26 minutes, a heartwarming climax makes up for it.Right from his introduction sequence, you can feel the pain and longing felt by Karthi's character 'Dilli' for the life he has lost behind bars and how much he misses his family. Director Logesh Kanagaraj has mixed in the right amounts of stunts and fight sequences without going overboard like most masala Tamil movies, keeping the script in focus. Especially loved the restraint the director showed in not going into Karthi's backstory with any elaborate, action-infused flashback sequences (as is the norm), but instead revealing it in pieces in well-enacted conversations that Dilli (Karthi) has with a fantastic Dheena as the hapless lorry-owner/caterer Kamatchi. A definite must watch!Karthi has an ability of picking good scripts, something his brother should learn from."}, {"id": 207, "text": "Ok, we are all exposed to all kinds of Tamil masala movies.One hero battling against an entire battalion is not something very new. But, KAITHI (Prisoner) has definitely a fresh approach among Tamil movies. Since the happenings are of single night events, the hero wears the same costume (that too very dirty) and with more of believable scenes.Towards the end, possibly the director is lured by typical (cliched) scenes, too familiar in most of the Tamil movies. Surprisingly, the important segment of the hero's life is told in words from the mouth of the hero, without flashback scenes. No melodrama (but for the very last scene, which is required to show the bond between the father and his beloved daughter), no songs and no stupid comedy scenes.The attack on the police station, though reminds us of old Hollywood movies, the director has modified the scenes suitable for a Tamil movie. Karthi, a main stream hero of Tamil film industry, is to be certainly appreciated for his selection of this role. Director Lokesh Kanagaraj definitely deserves to be appreciated for his overall presentation. Apart from Karthi, other actors like Narain,George Mariyan and the boy who acts as the cook and tags along Karthi, are to be definitely appreciated for their performance.Overall, a neat thriller for your weekend."}, {"id": 208, "text": "Slightly spooo, don't worry, ignoring.Script - 8/10 Story - 6/10 Direction - 7/10 Cinematography - 7/10 Acting - 7/10 Editing - 9/10 Genre - Suspense/Action/Thriller Flaw - severalOverall 7 but it deserve 8+ only because of its mood, non-unnecessary scenes songs comedy heroin etc. A compelling &amp; tensed environment from the very beginning, not a single second to ignore. A milestone in south cinema industry. It can be compared with another thriller A Wednesday. Though Kaithi have some flaws where A Wednesday is greater one.80 KM, takes time of 800 KM. Karthi's fatherhood is just fine where his overall expression doesn't fit the compelling situation. His story remains mystery. His expression towards his daughter is just show off emotion, as if not much serious about anything. In some points, Karthi's acting is worst, some expressions and actions make no sense. In fine, Karthi is one of the most flaw of this movie. If I say more about why it is, it will be spoiler.

When the drug lord takes revenge by poisoning the alcohol of a gathering of the police-inspectors, Bejoy has to take the responsibility to transport the fainted inspectors to a clinic that's in a nearby town, while also facing the threat of the drug lord to return back the seized drugs which will kill the guarding humans, who guard the police station which stores the drugs. A lorry is needed to transport the inspectors, which is where Dilli, played by Karthi, comes in to the picture with a swag, who desperately wants to meet his long-lost daughter. To do that, Dilli has to drive the lorry containing the bodies with Bejoy (who vows him his daughter), and the owner of the lorry (who exists for comic relief) to the clinic and then to the police station to stop chaos. That is the main plot of this thrilling film filled with well-choreographed action. To say more is to just destroy the thrill.To be frank, this is probably one of the best Indian films to come out this year, and probably the best career choice which actor Karthi has ever made. Talking about the acting, Karthi's screen presence is so good that you want more of that pump-into-the-lungs kind of heroism, and George Maryan, as the newly transferred police officer, is the true hero of this story, no doubt. The cinematography, man, is praiseworthy. The mood and tension that is set by various obstacles that these trio encounter is pure cinematic awesomeness. Though, the fight scene involving many people being fist-punched by Dilli in the second-half is kinda unbelievable, I had to give in to the motivation that gives him the strength.
