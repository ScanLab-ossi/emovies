There is a pair of criminals on the run after stealing money from their mob boss. One is the criminal mastermind, Mattias, and the other an unhinged character, Jamie, with whom his brother has the inevitable role to try and keep him in line &amp; out of trouble.As John Steinbeck famously once wrote, the best laid plans of mice and men: sometimes things occur that cannot be planned for. They are heading off to Mexico &amp; stop off to fill up their vehicle with fuel to make the remaining journey. Jamie, instead of paying for the fuel, decides to rob them instead, when they have already enough money to live off of, and during the shot out Mattias is injured.They cannot stop at a hospital as gun shot injuries are reported to the police but they so happens to stumble upon a disgraced doctor, Rich(Chad Michael Murray of One Tree Hill &amp; House if Wax), &amp; follows him home. They hold Rich and his family hostage and forces the doctor to perform surgery on the shot brother to save him.The most recognisable actor is Bruce Willis who plays the retired cop. There is a battle of wills and survival of the fittest in this film. This is one of Willis's better films he had done recently."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Why of why Bruce agreed on playing in this movie. The movie is simply bad and plot doesn't make any sense."}, {"id": 2, "text": "I saw Bruce Willis &amp; Chad Michael Murray so I knew I was going to watch it. I didn't have the biggest hopes for it but I thought it would still hit in most places. This movie had the potential to be really good but fell flat in a few places. I will start by saying this is another movie that pointlessly starts with a scene later in the movie &amp; then goes back in time. Some movies that works for but most it doesn't &amp; this one didn't need it. Outside of that, the first part of this movie was very good &amp; suspenseful. You get to learn the characters &amp; dynamics inside relationships setting it up very well. Once the brothers got inside the house, that's when the movie halted for me. It had its moments &amp; I felt the casting was very good, the acting was perfect for this film but there were also some head scratching moments. I won't go into them all but when Bruce Willis character leads the bad guy on the car chase, that goes for a few good minutes, how does Chad Michael Murray's character not get to his family in the barn (on the property he's already on) during that time, instead conveniently gets there once the bad guy returns setting up the final scenes. There was a moment at the gas station the worker mentions a 3rd brother that had passed in a tragic way but that's not explained any further which seemed odd. The money also seemed to play a large part of the story early but lacked at the end. I would've liked to see if the family took it (god knows they deserved it after what they went through)I love both Bruce &amp; Chad &amp; feel they put in fine performances. The story is good. The execution just didn't hit for me but it's still a movie I'd recommend watching at least once. It will hit for some &amp; miss for others."}, {"id": 3, "text": "The Home Invasion sub genre has been done to death at this point so to find a refreshing take on it is hard enough. This one is an admirable attempt to push the genre away from the violent and edge recent efforts and more into the deliberate and character driven roots of its origin.I won't spoil the story much but suffice it to say its got a lot going for it in terms of the way the tension builds. This isn't Bruce's best efforts as he still just a supporting role here but he does hold his own well enough compared to his prior B movie efforts. The real stars of the show are Shea B. and Tyler Olson as the layered bad guys with more going on for them then meets the eye.Worth a stream for sure!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "Films with Bruce Willis are sliding lower and lower. He was a good actor."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Survive The Night is a terrible movie almost from start to finish. The acting is not a problem as such but the story is so badly written and unbelievable it resembles badly written fan fiction. Two brothers who are criminals and on their way to Mexico end up in a shootout and one needs medical assistance. They break into a house where a doctor and his family are staying with the parents of the doctor. And from there the movie dissolved into an almost hillarious sequence of events and dialogue.The story is so bad it's difficult to describe. The doctor is apparently responsible for a death of one of his patients in the big city. Oh, and he has a job practicing in a clinic near to where his parents live because apparently small towns don't care if the doctors have killed patients in the big city. The wounded criminal says that he is bleeding out and almost dead but it takes him about 8-10 hours or so to bleed out even after the doctor says he has been shot in the Femoral Artery. The doctor actually says that he is not a leg doctor and then he also says or that kind of doctor when he is being forced to perform surgery. Because hospitals have leg doctors apparently. He also states that his last patient died on the operating table because he stitched when he should have cut or cut when he should have stitched. You would think that he might remember these small details.The brother who hasn't been shot and is the dumb psychotic criminal threatens the doctor numerous times because they literally had no better dialogue to include in the film. And I mean he continuously repeats his threats as if the doctor has forgotten that his family is at stake. Or it might be the case that who ever wrote this movie thinks they need to remind the audience. The dialogue also gets worse and worse as the movie goes endlessly on and on.The actions of most of the characters make no sense for most of the film and the scenes are so drawn out and repetitive that they might both make you cringe and laugh at the same time. The protagonists get free, run away and are captured again, then they are wounded and run away and are captured again and again. And of course the process is repeated once again. The wounds that they receive only bother them at certain times though and other than grandma everyone in the family lives through the ordeal and ends up sitting and smiling on the porch.This was lazily written by someone who tried to stretch out a story that should have been 30 minutes into 1 hour and 30 minutes and they couldn't even do basic medical research into gunshots or their effects. And for the record anyone shot in the Femoral Artery would have bled out within minutes. The criminals make dumb choices to advance the plot and the heroes of the film have numerous chances to run away but they don't and are recaptured repeatedly and then the villain actually gives up on chasing them for a while and continues in the morning...Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to watch a really bad movie and write a long review on why this movie should be avoided."}, {"id": 6, "text": "A taut family thriller set in one house. A simple story about a father/son and two brothers. Sometimes the simplest ideas can be very effective and produce great thrills because the script knows the boundaries and generates thrills by reminding us all the time that we are stuck within those boundaries. The two bad guys here are throughly vivid in their performances. Their imperfections give them a more realistic unpredictable sinister-ism than the typical scare movie villain with a mask.It takes awhile to get started, but once it does, the suspense and mystery is undeniable. The soundtrack dictates a suspense atmosphere very adequately, and the actors are quite good (though no crazy standouts). The story, even clich\u00e9d, is still interesting and suspenseful. Worth a watch!"}, {"id": 7, "text": "This was a pretty straight forward home invasion thriller set on a farm but with the criminals as more sympathetic villains. What kept me engaged was trying to guess how things would play out for the family and which side would come out on top in the end. The redemption story for Chad and Bruce (Frank and Rich) was the obvious central aspect. It was well done and had a nice conclusion to it that felt genuine. There's a couple violent scenes but it never crosses the line into all out gore. Worth a stream if you're into more dramatic thrillers."}, {"id": 8, "text": "This cleverly conceived thriller is about a doctor and his family trapped inside a farm by two criminals. The film is well-paced and the camera work is slick. Bruce has a surprising larger role then I expected as the grandfatherly patriarch and he's effective enough to keep be engrossed. The rest of cast are admirable. With the stand out being, Shae Buckner who plays a unhinged but sympathetic criminal and does well to add layers to the role. The single location setting is brought to the fore here by expert claustrophobic direction. The violence is intense, sometimes graphic but never over the top, and completely tense. It's not a big blow 'em up adventure story, it's just as dark, gritty, and realistic, in which things never go according to plan and innocent people always get hurt.Unfortunately, after an engrossing game of cat and mouse, the conclusion is somewhat weak. Staple clich\u00e9s crop up and the film goes for a crowd-pleasing finale that doesn't quite feel right. Still watchable though and a recommended stream."}, {"id": 9, "text": "This was a refreshing home invasion thriller that took a typical plot and elevated the drama between the parties involved. Bruce can still CRY on screen? That was a surprise to me. Shot well, edited with precision and given a subtle and nuanced score. Might be one of the better b movies I've come across in awhile."}, {"id": 10, "text": "This movie is solid for what it is, using scenes based on the mountain of movies of this genre, but keeping it\u00b4s identity, altough it has a pretty simple plot and recicled moments all over itself. The 2 robbers that this film presents to the audience aren\u00b4t anything new or refreshing, one compassionate and other irrationally violent and dumb, wonder where they picked that idea, (Pulp Fiction) maybe, my opinion. There are also some flaws in the way that the image is shown, because in some moments it\u00b4s clearly visible the green screen behind the actors. Even though the film is a little bit repetitive, the soundtrack is appropriated for what is worth and the moments of compassion between the characters are almost believable for the spectator that is really, really into the movie. The movie is short, doesn\u00b4t even have 130 minutes of itself, and for it\u00b4s runtime the plot develops poorly and slowly, promoting a near slasher in the end, wich is quite bad. They really didn\u00b4t need that scene. I\u00b4m terribly sad that Bruce Willis isn\u00b4t getting opportunities to shine, this wasn\u00b4t obviously even close of his full potential."}, {"id": 11, "text": "We weren't perfect but no one is. Survive the Night (my latest review) isn't perfect. Heck, it's not even close. But Night does have a few tense moments. And co-star Bruce paycheck Willis does emote slightly. In verity, he even manages to move from point A to point B and probably showed up on set for more than a week (ha-ha).Survive the Night while compact in its first half as a ruffian thriller, descends into senseless and labored drivel towards the end. Reminiscent of home invasion stuff like No Good Deed and 2018's Breaking In, Night recycles its evil that men do screenplay to the point where it rights itself into a corner. Night's eighty-six minute running time feels like darn near two hours. I kept wondering why the protagonist characters didn't just get in a car and drive away when they had the chance.Nasty, remorseless, violent, and taking place in the middle of nowhere, Survive the Night is a sweaty B-movie where the authorities are phantoms that never show up once. Filmed on location in Columbus, Georgia, Night's direction by Matt Eskandari is amicable but pretty basic.On the plus side, the kicker is that Survive the Night has an original hook. The only reason the good cop/bad cop criminals invade a country home is because one of them is dying from a gunshot wound and a failed doctor happens to live there.All in all, Survive the Night does have decent performances (especially Chad Michael Murray as the doc mentioned in the last paragraph) and it effectively hammers the notion that bad things happen to good people. Still, I can't for the life of me recommend Night (it was difficult experiencing a scene where a pregnant woman persona gets executed at a convenience store). By tooth and nail, I did survive it though. Rating: 2 and a half stars."}, {"id": 12, "text": "I am a fan of Chad and Bruce and this movie had all the ingredients to be great but it was poorly executed. At times it was repetitive and unrealistic when it came to how the characters would and should act. There were pointless scenes that seemed to drag on for no reason whatsoever. Finally some of the other cast, Bruce and Chad aside where (to put it plain) terrible actors. I have given it 5 stars because it wasnt all bad. It kept my interest and the story was good. To truly enjoy it though I had to look past some shoddy editing and directorial work. I really wanted to like this more but I guess sometimes yout favourite actors get it wrong."}, {"id": 13, "text": "This is another recent Bruce Willis makes a cameo action/thriller flick, but a definite notch above many of his other films(if not the best), at least in terms of story and performances.It manages to make a compelling home-invasion seem suitably layered, presenting the bad guys as rounded individuals with differing yet believable motives and personalities. The photography and acting from the main ensemble are all above par. The direction is tight and I liked the tense score also. It still feels immediately dangerous, though, never losing sight of its protagonists and the escalating peril they're placed in, until it finally reaches its truly tragic and slightly expected finale."}, {"id": 14, "text": "The only reason I watched this was because Bruce Willis was featured. I can't imagine why he decided to act in/put his name on this film. I am astonished at how disappointing this movie was. Willis's son's wife is a plastic surgery nightmare. The characters have dozens of opportunities to save themselves from their predicament. What a disappointment of a thriller. Waste of time."}, {"id": 15, "text": "Don't waste 1.30 hours of your life. Even with Bruce Willis, the movie sucks in every way."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Don't watch this. Waste of my time and such a bad movie."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Home-invasion movies are driven by a universal fear: Who hasn't worried about someone breaking into their home with malicious intent? It's why creaks and bumps scare you when you're home alone. It's why wind chimes become instruments of terror when the sun goes down. It's pretty twisted to think about watching movies that exploit these fears for fun, but there's something to be said for sharing such an emotional experience with people from across the world. The universal fear of domestic violation transcends language and local custom. It's the connective power of art in practice, manifested in mutual terror.What we have here is a similar told story but not with the anything new or exciting. I do give the writer and director credit for maximizing the suspense and giving us an ensemble of characters we care about. Ultimately, it gives you a tasteful and elevated 90 min excuse to watch something."}, {"id": 18, "text": "This film has great aspects, but it looks very average. Firstly, the plot is interesting, but it's very predictable. The beginning is intriguing, the finish is pale. Secondly, yhe cast os good, but all film is on Bruce Willis and his talent. So, it's a little bit pale film with good actors."}, {"id": 19, "text": "I quite enjoyed this. It wasn't super violent save for a couple gory bits of surgery.

After that, it's all rather run-of-the-mill action. Some of it is unnecessarily dark. I know it's the night but they could turn on the lights. They don't have any neighbors.

This is more of a psychological thriller than a Bruce Willis action movie, though at one point a comparison to an action movie would make sense.The direction works well with his whole ensemble often placed in the living room like actors on a static theater stage, and the camera views the psychological warfare often from a very distant ankle like in a documentary. The minimal and seducing sound track score adds much tension to this well-done drama/thriller."}, {"id": 33, "text": "Despite the small budget of the film (which is noticeable), done well! The acting is good and the action is enough to keep you engaged.

There's some great drama here for the villains and you see different sides."}, {"id": 34, "text": "This movie starts out slow, but it builds tension very quickly. This would be a very terrifying situation. This movie has a sense of realism. The dialogue is not fancy, nor presumptuous, but adequate for these type of dramas.

There's enough material in this film to capture the interest of viewers even if the ending twist lightens my intrigue."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Boring with no story really.

What really stands out to me is the cinematography and the score. the dark cinematography actually helps the audience to feel the dark and tense tone of the movie. and the score complete some moments at the movie.The ending is simple, and actually predictable, but left me satisfied.I really recommend the movie, if you're looking for an enjoyable thriller. but, if you're looking for a pure action, i actually don't recommend you since this movie is actually far from that."}, {"id": 38, "text": "Realy love bruce, but this is a terrible one!

With that in mind I always know to be little more open-minded but this one while not worst movie in world. I diddn't find it enjoyable either.First the acting Chad Michael Murray did pretty well in this role and I was quite impressed with him. He doesnt have massive movie resume and is mainly known for tv shows. Bruce Willis however as always in these type movies lately phoned it in. Terrible acting, weird facial expressions, just overall not believeble. The action in this was fairly engaging enough but not over the top and the visuals were okay.Second the movie diddn't make sense at so many parts. First one the brother goes to hold up the store he shoots the girl in the head and then the guy but doesn't proceed to take the money at all? The scene where Willis takes the car and drives off into different area with brother following him was strange as well. What was the son, wife, and daughter doing during that why not run while the other is incapiticated? The other brother gets out the car and doesn't even look for Bruce just leaves and comes back? Lastly the ending was just incredibly bizzare it shows Willis lean over as he is about to have heart attack then the son shoots brother walks outside with his wife and holds her and daughter on porch. No one checks or looks for Bruce though? He just casually strolls out and there all just still sitting there.Overall I didn't love this movie enough to recommend it to anyone."}, {"id": 86, "text": "This is the dumbest movie I ever watched. The movie is so predictable and stupid I have no words to describe how bad it is."}, {"id": 87, "text": "Not too long ago out came Trauma Center, the previous thriller piece directed by Matt Eskandari and starring Bruce Willis, and that one got me very disappointed, to say the least, even judged by B, C and by-the-numbers movie standards. Survive The Night, a (farm) house invasion thriller, has all the same flaws, plus it manages to feel even more flavorless, empty, and as if it doesn't have a lot of respect for the viewer.I'd also like to point out that multiple of the higher rating reviews here (as of 22.05.20) are from profiles who've rated little to none, and/or coincidentally have only written reviews for two movies, this one and the previous Matt Eskandari's and Bruce Willis's collaboration - Trauma Center. Schemes, schemes everywhere.Survive The Night introduces us to the disgraced doctor Rich (Chad Michael Murray), and his family, setting up to live with Rich's parents for the summer. Bruce Willis is the dad, naturally. Meanwhile, criminal brothers Mathias (Tyler Jon Olson) and Jamie (Shea Buckner) have pulled off a heist and are driving for the border to Mexico. With only 20 thousand. Oh, and their boss is taking a cut as well. Jamie is prone to violence and listens to nobody's advice and not even to the sound of common sense, which gets his brother shot and gets both of them on the search of medical help outside of hospitals. This is where our doctor Rich comes in - let the house invasion begin.Survive The Night is a real low budget thriller &amp; that's apparent on your every sense - eyes, ears and feels. No problem though, there are many decent and even great movies with very little financial means behind them, balanced out with extra creativity, experimentation and effort. Matt Eskandari's two latest features don't seem to have those qualities, quite the opposite, it almost feels like there's some money laundering schemes going on. Joke, of course, but you see the point. When a movie is bad-bad, there's often some comedic value to be found, when none comes our way we tend to find the entertainment ourselves - also not the case with Trauma Center and Survive The Night.The plot of Survive The Night is very straight-forward, and it isquite easy to predict it's entire journey and destination. The character's - both antagonists and protagonists - act irrationally more often than not, and basically have very little substance or individuality - one dimension all the way. Everyone can shoot a gun, unless the screenplay demands the character to momentarily lose all knowledge, skill and memory. The story, as whack as it is, is also rather short, and so it feels very stretched out over those 90 minutes, frequently making the pacing tedious, in other words, beware of aggressive boredom. Next in line is acting, and, well, it's fine, but... just fine. Trauma Center had the worst, most ridiculous Bruce Willis performance I've ever seen, and this one is a tiny bit better, though in both ones he's there for a short time, not a good time, and acts as if the paycheck's the only motivation. Maybe it is. I'd say Survive the Night's acting highlight belongs to the main villain Shea Buckner, whose character is weak and uninspired, but he seemed to truly try.The movie is presented in drab colors, the spaces often feel unfulfilled, until the third act there's no real fun with anything. Cinematography's alright, but it seems like nowadays most indies are shot at least somewhat decently. Make no mistake though, there's nothing interesting about the aesthetics of Survive the Night, unless you can be completely sold on them pulling out a good looking charger for a couple of minutes.Survive the Night will make you survive its runtime, for it is one of the most paint-by-the-numbers, uninspired, flat, clich\u00e9d quickly-made/quickly-forgotten kind of movies ever. I give it a very rare 2/10 and recommend it to none, but if you do decide to see it, I suggest going in with the minimum of 5 beers on hand."}, {"id": 88, "text": "The plot is pretty loose, but the dialogue is what made me quit.

In fact, he turned down $3,000,000 for a four day shoot for Expendables 3. So I assume it's not about the dollars. Meanwhile, to keep it short, survive the night is a slow paced bore fest with little to no interesting plot development. Bruce and company meander through the film with terrible dialog and subpar acting. No character buildup and holes in storyline throughout.

They wait for him to leave, follow him to his house, and break in. Again, Dumb can't contain himself and kills the dr's mother. They hold the wife, daughter and father hostage while the dr. is supposed to perform the surgery on the guy's leg. They get the bullets out and leave the wound wide open. The victims aren't any brighter though and constantly try to cause trouble for the bad guys instead of complying, which results in them getting injured, escaping, returning, etc. After going through this a couple of times they return to supposedly close the wound several hours later as things come to a resolution.The script tries to make something about the dr's. background. He's about to file for bankruptcy, I guess lost everything and has to return to live with his parents. His dad, the town's former sheriff has zero respect for his loser of a son. But all this doesn't amount to much. Willis's presence doesn't do much either here. As of late, attaching his name to a project is rather an indication of poor quality.Survive the Night manages to get you to dislike the bad guy, but then makes you dislike the victims even more, so you end up rooting for no one, or a bit for the bad guys.

It wasn't super bad and it just wasn't super good, or even great for that matter.Bruce Willis's role as the father was good, I mean he did good for what his role was, i felt the tension of the bond between father and son, and it worked - I would like to see Willis and Shea Buckner come together in more defined film with a more compelling storyline.simple storynot the greatest dialoguefelt the relationship between both Brothers and the father son bondthe story became dull towards the endReview: 2.8 / 5 or 5 /10 - liked the story but the dialogue fell flat - chemistry was there, but the story as well as the conclusion was dull - wasn't bad, but wasn't great.Justin Leblanc - Host of Real Talk Radio #Reelreview Twitter: @RealTalkRadio8"}, {"id": 244, "text": "There are few directors in the game today who know how to weave a yarn like Matt Eskandari. Much like the two outlaw brothers speeding along the highways after their most recent heist, Eskandari goes 0 to 60 without sacrificing any nuance or plot, fitting 90 minutes of taut action on the head of a pin while your head spins with each new revelation, each heart stopping altercation.The movie opens on a downtrodden Chad Michael Murray, he's recently lost his private practice after a wrongful death lawsuit drove him out of business. He's working at a rural clinic-his wife, father and child all having lost faith in him.Little does he know he's unwittingly on a collision course with these brothers. After a robbery gone wrong at a local convenience store, Mathias is struck by a bullet in the leg. Knowing they're on the wrong side of the law, they seek out a doctor under special circumstances.Leaving the clinic, Chad is followed home and ambushed upon arrival. The brothers lay siege upon the house and demand treatment.I won't spoil the next phase of the film. There are so many layers to this thriller. Familial bonds stretched and strained, the distances one is willing to go for love. The ambiguities of good and evil, light and dark, how necessity and circumstance dictate so much more than we're willing to admit. Eskandari doesn't just serve you a classic, edge-of-your-seat joyride, he plumbs the deepest depths of the human experience, turning a mirror on his audience and forcing them to ask the deeper questions. What would you do for a dying loved one, how do you rebuild yourself after tragedy, and can you put aside your fears to survive the night?"}, {"id": 245, "text": "Chad Michael Murray and Bruce Willis star in this violent thriller about a family whose home is invaded by armed criminals.Frank, a retired sheriff who has a contentious relationship with his doctor son Rich (Murray), whose career is in tatters thanks to a malpractice suit after the death of a patient. Despite their personal difficulties, the two men live together in Frank's home, along with Rich's mother (Jessica Abrams), his wife (Lydia Hull) and their teenage daughter (Riley Wolfe Rach).As the story begins, we're introduced to criminal siblings Mathias (Tyler Jon Olson) and Jamie (Shea Buckner), who, like so many nefarious duos, have distinctly different personalities. Mathias is the brains of the two, not wanting to hurt people if he can help it, while the hot-headed Jamie is a loose cannon, all too willing to resort to violence. His careless brutality becomes a major problem when the two rob a convenience store, with Jamie gunning down a customer and Mathias getting shot and seriously wounded by the armed clerk."}, {"id": 246, "text": "This isn't your typical ultra violent and fast paced masked strangers break into your home type story. You get to know both sides of the invasion and genuinely care about them. One one side is the family patriarch lead by Bruce Willis who has a contentious relationship with his son. This has to be the hands down BEST performance from Bruce since his M.Night days. He 's in at least 2/3 of the film and actually emotes several times - not to mention has a great chemistry with Chad Michael Murray as his son.The other side of the invasion is led by two compelling brothers in Jamie and Matthias. Both these men are morally grey and filled with interesting conflict between them. After the unhinged brother gets the other shot they decide to break into the home of a doctor and force him to remove the bullet in the leg.From here, it turns very much into a slow burn thriller as the brothers plans fall apart. There's a moment between them where one asks the other to just leave but he refuses to abandon him. Then Bruce and his son reconcile while they wait out the right time to strike back. It's not a whiz bang, fast paced and violent piece but more meditative and slow burning about characters in real situations forced to confront themselves and earn redemeption. Worth a watch."}, {"id": 247, "text": "I absolutely LOOOOVED the cinematography! Shooting so close and tight at times made you feel like another person right there with them instead of just observing. Viewers became part of the story. The coloring and editing was fantastic too! Gritty and real. What you see and feel in your day to day on your worst days.The relationships between the characters felt genuine and raw. Brother to brother, father to son. Husband to wife. Its what you would expect true relationships to feel like. Eskandari wonderfully directed the cast and made you feel like they truly were family.I love that Bruce had one semi-action scene but remained normal just being an average guy and Chads character growth and not being shown as your average, preppy, happy-go-lucky handsome dude. Playing against the standard types but still being real and authentic to who they are was great and refreshing!None of this could happen without Eskandari's vision and direction. Between the film and all the BTS he shared on his social media pages with his passion right in the middle ...he has nothing but great things ahead. His vision is wonderful and he created a magnificent film that had me shouting out loud ..which is rare for me. It was a great watch and left me wanting more."}, {"id": 248, "text": "There were more plot holes than the unnecessarily long and sappy 90 minute cat and mouse runtime smh. I get that this is amateur writer Doug Wolfe's first ever writing credit, but c'mon, didn't anyone else proofread this ridiculous long dragged out mess?Here's the math: of the 90 min runtime, subtract 7 mins for opening and post credits. Then we have 20 mins of some bad guys involved in, what, I don't know, that also pull off a stupid stunt, as well as the Brady Bunch family, where the son is a failure, for, I don't know what. The remaining 60+ minutes is the most ridiculous and illogical plot-riddled to the point of hilariousness cat-and-mouse game, with dragged out long and useless scenes. Add the soap-opera sappy dialogue between two brothers, and the father and son trying to rekindle their relationship - amidst the so called terror. Escape, come back, hide, get caught, repeat. And even for criminals, the stupidity in their actions were laughable. It got annoying very fast. Had this film been a 20 min short, it may have received a 5 or 6 from me.Bruce Willis was his usual look at me I'm Bruce Willis attitude with his stale monotonic washed-up tough-guy demeanor. But that I expected going into this, because anything worse than a Bruce Willis film, is another Bruce Willis film. Even the pretty Lydia Hull, who oddly is in almost every Willis film, was boring and stale. The rest of the cast were ok, with the bad guys being the most convincing, and made the effort to act. I'm sure failure from the director to direct his cast properly was a big part of the rest of the characters' failed acting.The directing was also sub-par with some terrible editing. For a b-grade film, the score wasn't as annoying as I'd expected it to be, but still somewhat overbearing and unfitting. The cinematography was ok, but bad in the night outdoor scenes.If you watch this film at 5x faster speed, even without hearing any dialogue, you'll get the gist of the entire story, which is nothing new and done many times before. Sadly, it's a generous 3/10 from me, and I will never get my 90 minutes back."}, {"id": 249, "text": "Where do you go from Die Hard, The Sixth Sense, Pulp Fiction, Armageddon and other classics? In the case of Bruce Willis, the answer is down a steady stream of dull action movies that add nothing new to the genre and are blander than bread that only get blander. Survive the Night is unfortunately next in line of Bruce Willis movies that will be forgotten about within the next month, if it's lucky. And it seems Bruce Willis knows this, because he was bored throughout the whole movie and it was obvious. Bruce Willis wasn't as big a part of this movie as he was hyped up to be. My biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. It's all over the place. We keep seeing the same things happen over and over again. It's like the movie is stuck in a time warp. You just wish they'd move onto the next scene. On top of that, the movie became so predictable that you could guess the next plot of events a few scenes ahead. However, I couldn't have predicted some of the stupid choices the characters make (but I'll get to that in a bit). Everything is explained in such a vague way that you can't really connect with the characters. They always play the game of talking about something the audience doesn't know about so much that it gets annoying. The action scenes are either too static or too disorienting. The color of the cinematography was unpleasant to look at. Everything mostly looked dirty. So many choices the characters make don't make sense (a couple I could understand but that isn't the majority). Without spoiling, let's just say you see an obvious choice the characters should make and for some reason, they don't go for that obvious choice. It's so infuriating, you'll find yourself shouting Why!? at your screen. Some of the nighttime shots look like they were shot in the daytime, and not even the recoloring could change that. The continuity was weird in this movie. It almost feels like the film editing was rushed. The only saving grace was that at least a few of the actors had some decent performances and looked like they were trying but those people's characters weren't really fleshed out. We know almost nothing about them. Overall, I'm sure they weren't aiming for any kind of award, but it's like they didn't even make the attempt. Not even the movie title sounds interesting. I was hoping for a slight amount of effort, and that seems to be all I got: slight. This movie may have survived the night, but it won't survive the test of time."}, {"id": 250, "text": "Why not 1/10? I give it three stars for the acting, which I can't fault much, and, stupid as it felt while watching the absurdities unfold, there was some suspense through the movie. And, well, Bruce. I always liked Bruce. It doesn't change the fact that it was a waste of time and I really recommend you invest your 90 mins of life elsewhere. I found none of the characters really likeable. In this kind of movie it's a problem, as I couldn't care less about them, towards the end actually hoping they'll die so I can switch it off. Honourable mention for the most annoying on-screen presence get the main bad guy - a, no way around it, really dumb meat loaf who keeps on accidentally shooting people, and the doc's wife. Mostly, for the amount of botox she must've stolen from hubby and injected in her face, but she also scores the Home Invasion Headless Chicken award for most pointless actions. Speaking of chickens - the whole movie is like watching a free range farm at work. The protagonists somehow break free, walk around for a while, get smacked by the meat loaf, repeat. Cherry on the cake is the car chase interlude, a completely absurd race to the farm fence and back. I felt at times like watching a zombie movie, as everyone was pointlessly staggering around and getting back to the henhouse. After about half the movie I really didn't care about anyone on the screen and stared in disbelief wondering who wrote this trash and how much more surreal will it get. No disappointment here, it got completely bonkers."}, {"id": 251, "text": "Now it's not best film or greatest film it's one of those time waster films to kill time off not if you expect BIG action well their isn't big action there are some of it but everything that you think it's bigger action film. Now I know Bruce Willis doesn't care anymore so he makes films that are direct to DVD or straight to VOD but at least he comeback on big screens recently like Death Wish (2018) luv that film to Death,  then to Motherless Brooklyn then now he is gone back to straight to DVD films sadly like to this film now last Bruce Willis films I enjoyed like last one I liked was Extraction (2015).I thought it was alright but wished it was done better, wished it could had more action in film it could been on run film just like with Run All Night film but this film was low budgeted so that's why entire middle of film it's filmed at double story house surviving against bad guys. Story plot follows A disgraced doctor Frank (Bruce Willis) who use to be an cop as well he has son Rich (Chad Michael Murray) who is married his wife Jan (Lydia Hull) who appears 6 Bruce Willis films Vice, Extraction, Precious Cargo, Marauders, after 4 years later 10 Minutes Gone and this film Survive the night Stallone films she is known for Broken City, Escape Plan (2013) as Receptionist not as big character until she got her character Jules in Escape Plan 2 Hades, Escape Plan 3 The Extractors, Backtrace. They got daughter as well they moved to Rich parents house to Frank that's meant to be Bruce Willis father and his mother house because they were Bankruptcy.He has 2 brothers that are criminals Mathias (Tyler Jon Olson) and Jamie (Shea Buckner) were 2 robbery's that robbed Gas Station theirs this cold scene ever brother killed an pregnant lady that was so messed up that's not mess that everyone wants to see but at least you wanna hate those cold blooded criminals one brother got shot they drive away then they ditched their car they run to woods that's when they broke into Bruce Willis with his family in house that's what it got all started now with this film theirs few issues like family not Bruce Willis character but others ran escaped then they got put back in house tied up same thing they hit criminals they run escape they get caught again tied up again like 3 or 2 times it pissed me off but I can handle it because I know it's straight DVD film so I know writing isn't best of film. I mean Bruce Willis does some action in film but not everything he does I Liked him driving an cool looking as Muscle car he drives car chase scene they chasing each other drifting car stunt looked amazing shot it wasn't fake like you seen in B films not it was real stunt it looked amazing otherwise you have Bruce Willis hitting those 2 bad guys trying to kill them but I really wished he would kill both of them rather then the son. at end of day if your Die Hard fan of Bruce Willis you will like it or not but as I said don't expect too much what you think like oh extreme action or Bruce Willis gonna kick ass he did but not much sadly I wish this film would be titled Survive to Dawn because Survive the night they survived to night to at very end they survived on morning you might think oh so the film is gonna end at night but characters really survived until very morning. I wanna see more Bruce Willis films so I wanted to see hey lets see what Bruce Willis has been up to he has been back in big screen then he has been bouncing on to Slaright VOD sadly his career has been in big screen like he came back in remake that was my favourite film (2018) Death Wish &amp; Glass (2019) &amp; Motherless Brooklyn bouncers back to Slaright VOD direct to DVD films sadly at least his career is not worse like Van Damme or Lundgren or Seagal or Mickey Rourke or Nicholas Cage look not all of their direct to DVD sucked expect for Nicholas Cage career has gone worse then to Bruce Willis career. some are but with Bruce Willis has been doing good okay direct to DVD films I seen worst of his like Prince, Precious Cargo, Marauders, Split, First Kill, Glass I know that's not a direct to DVD but hey at very least it's big screen film but it's pure garbage. Film has simple story, doesn't have greatest dialogue felt the relationship between both Brothers and the father son bond. I liked mixed idea of this film with Hell or High Water lite meets The Desperate Hours with the criminals as more sympathetic villains. they were cold blooded brothers that's What kept me engaged was trying to guess how things would play out for the family and which side would come out on top in the end. look if you Bruce Willis fan your curious to see what he is up to this film is good but not great this is just for Bruce Willis I would have to say film has it's issues but if you can deal with it I can but I know not everybody could but end of day it did annoy me but it didn't make me to hate film I would even put this in my Bruce Willis collection 6.10 worth watching if your die hard fan of Bruce Willis give it a go."}, {"id": 252, "text": "Whether it's in the movies or real life, when really really bad people do the things they do, you don't have to be a really good person to root against them. While most of us want to be someone our friends, family and God can be proud of all the time, we all have a demon or two that makes that impossible. But no matter how flawed the average Joe may be, he has more good in his heart than bad. In fact a guy like Matty could ALMOST fit in to that majority. I say almost because his degree of badness is too overwhelming to ignore.Now you have folks like Jamie who pretty much have the EVIL and SORROWFUL molecules of the world monopolized. This kind of person is easily despised by the masses. Regardless of his unbending loyalty to his brother, he is the very essence of wickedness. You can be the Bible thumpingest christian or the epitome of a social justice warrior leading the charge for defunding police and still crave for this man to meet a horrible demise.Sometimes it's difficult but when watching a movie I do my best to block the fact that it's scripted entertainment out of my mind. I find it adds to the enjoyment of the movie experience. Losing oneself in a story is what it's called I believe. I'm sure there are many who won't agree with me on this one and I can totally understand that. Not everyone has the same mindset or perspective. But as an aspiring script writer I use every movie experience as education. This one taught me some very important things too. In fact it's the type of writing I've aligned myself with.

There are also more than 2 HUGE plot holes that make absolutely no sense - you will see, if you waste your time on this.This is also a done-to-death-cliched story/plot..... If you see the trailer, you will see what I mean.The ONLY redeeming features of this movie are that the action and acting is decent. If you HAVE to watch a movie because you literally can't do ANYTHING else, then this might keep you entertained for 1 \u00bd hours.... Don't blame me if you are angry afterwards though...

He's still is a quality actor, however one can only work with what they are given, and in this instance, it wasn't a lot.Nothing at all wrong with the concept, nothing wrong with the aesthetic or general feel of the movie. However what made me think I had just wasted around an hour and a half of my life came down to what perhaps one call kindly relate to as continuity issues.Timing is everything, however the timing (no spoiler here, hence I won't elaborate) was so bad, so completely improbable, that it effectively ruined the plot. I'm all for a movie that involves you, irrespective of improbability for example with how a person is injured badly but is fine soon after.You can put those things aside if the movie is good and the action great. However it appeared to me that the writer or director was simply looking to pad out the movie."}, {"id": 255, "text": "As with many of Willis's movies in the past few years, most have been straight to DVD and unfortunately utter trash. This is slightly above some of his more recent movies, but it is still a low-budget and disappointing affair.Even despite my low expectations for this movie, during the beginning, I was surprised at the shockingly bad acting from the wife and protagonist, and also the kid. How the director allowed some of those cuts of the wife around the kitchen table to make the movie is beyond me, her expressions and acting were beyond bad and noticeably some scenes almost appeared as if they were an outtake or she herself figured it might be an outtake whilst acting, it was that bad. Similarly, even Willis let the show down with his attempt at crying in bed.The editing and cut scenes were brutal at times. So much so that it lends to a lack of complete discontinuity, to an already simple plot. The one saving grace in this movie were the brothers - in particular the crazy on-edge brother - it was a fine performance from him, especially considering those around him had no charisma to work off.The rest of the movie plodded along, until a point where I had to turn it off. Not recommended if you have any ounce of intelligence, skillful direction, and enjoy subtle plot-lines and fine acting from each and every character."}, {"id": 256, "text": "REVIEW - SURVIVE THE NIGHTIn these reviews I sometimes mention the issue of lazy writing something of which I simply can't understand. If you are finding a film this can and does cost a lot of money so why create a film which is just lazy writing?Unfortunately this film is yet another example, from people just not bothering to pick up guns to defend themselves, escaping and being captured in quick succession but simply the biggest issue with this is that one of the guys doing the home invasion is simply a nutter killing people for no reason at the start of the film and then with ample opportunity later in the film suddenly not so the story can play out.90 minutes long and 60 minutes too long with those 60 minutes filled with setting up the evening and not much else. Such a shame because as with other films which suffer from lazy writing this could and should have been much better but......Rating 4 out of 10"}, {"id": 257, "text": "Once so popular as he was Bruce Willis nowadays spitted out by Hollywood en his best friend (Expandables) due his difficult character and demands. But hey, I thought, I give him another change becaue he was a hell of an actor and made some classics.Sadly he isn't the main lead here and to make it worse, the flick itself isn't good. It starts all well and full of suspense and action but once at the house were they all try to survive the night this flicks become lame and slow.Towards the end it do pick up a bit due the Dodge Charger and the end scene but it's too late. On the other hand, the open leg surgery, no pain at all while his leg is open for hours, don't think so.The further the movie went the more I was grapping for the remote and push the stop button.

This is another one of those movies you find on Redbox and Netflix. Except someone bought it on Blu-Ray and me and my family watched it. Those are 90 minutes I'm never getting back. Why buy it on Blu-Ray anyways? The cover is not that great anyways.Well, what is this film about? It's a family held hostage in their house by two robbers who happen to be brothers. One of the family members is a doctor and he is forced to help one of the robbers who is seriously injured. It's like Trespass with Nic Cage. It's a home invasion film. Everything is dull about this film. The story is uninteresting, you don't care about the actors and to be honest, it's a boring film. Not to mention the video for the Blu-Ray looks ugly. It's yellow and orange and I don't like it. Bruce Willis is the one you're cheering for but he doesn't really help the family. The doctor is not that good. The two robbers are idiotic and I couldn't care less when they died at the end. The family is ok acting. Just a really ugly looking film and a forgettable one.Overall, Survive The Night is a disposable film. I can't recommend this. Please do yourself a favor and don't watch this. You can watch more excellent movies on Netflix and other streaming platforms. This was a waste of time. A big one, that is."}, {"id": 259, "text": "Bruce Willis Yippee Ki-yay days are long gone. The action star of mega hits like Die Hard, The Last Boy Scout, The Fifth Element, Armageddon, The Sixth Senseand Red is no more.Like Steven Seagal and Nicolas Cage he has reduced himself to cheap direct-to video productions, one even worse than the other.Survive the Night is no exception: extremely badly written with cardboard characters who do the most stupid and illogical things. Their actions are laughable at best and the story seems to drag on forever since the limited screenplay is only good enough for a 25 minute TV-soap episode.It's frustrating to watch Bruce Willis doing absolutely nothing after two bankrobbers kill his wife. One of them is injured badly so there are plenty of opportunities to take out the one single bad guy. Instead we get a ridiculous roadrunner cartoon of being tied up, escape, being tied up again. And speaking of the injured criminal, he has an open leg wound that is fatal within an hour, but somehow he survives right up to the end of this wretched tale.In Willis' defence, this is not his worst performance to date. That razzie award goes to last years' stinker Trauma Center where it was hard to tell if he was even conscious at all. If I knew beforehand that Survive the Night was from the same director, I wouldn't even have bothered. Just call it a friendly warning because it's 90 minutes of your life wasted you won't get back."}], "reviews_amount": 260}
