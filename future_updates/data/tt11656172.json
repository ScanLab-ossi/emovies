This movie is absolutely a waste of time. the acting is horrible..the movie plot is terrible...in fact there is no plot.. the movie is like a class X student practicing to make a documentary..........If there was a minus rating I would definitely give it minus 10"}, {"id": 1, "text": "Wow.Trees aren't this wooden. Another completely derivative shoot em up that takes place entirely inside the requisite abandoned factory in the middle of nowhere. Every character makes the worst possible choices at every opportunity. Every moment of this movie has appeared before in an endless list of other bad movies. And then there's Bruce, looking embarrassed just to be in this steaming pile... To top it off the movie just stops. There's really no ending. The story goes from life or death to let's forget that all of our buddies died for nothing, but let's get a beer. whad'ya say? Brewskis?You have been warned."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Time's up, send em' in. That's right, send in the paperweight villains who walk like stodgy storm troopers just waiting for the slaughter. Said villains enter an abandon building with lots of ammo and sensors in 2020's Hard Kill (my latest review).Now is Hard Kill full of bullet-ridden shootouts that seem repetitive and kind of presumptuous? You betcha. And is Kill a film in which the hero (Jesse Metcalfe as Derek Miller) offs every goon as if he were 1980's Chuck Norris? Oh without a doubt.Anyway, Hard Kill lacks plot buildup and provides the audience with another veritable, sleepwalking performance from co-star Bruce paycheck Willis. The lines are minimal, the movement on screen is lackadaisical, the bald head is binding, and the cue cards are for the most part, ever-present. The other actors ham it up while the Bruiser just sits there totally comatose.Reminiscent of a neutered Assault on Precinct 13, shot by a helmer who likens Willis as his muse, and driven by an antagonist who won't stop spewing numerous soliloquies (Sergio Rizzuto as The Pardoner), Hard Kill is about a group of soldiers who have to protect a computer program meant to end the world. Kill starts out taut until it drags its game actors down in flask continuum. The flick runs 98 minutes but probably could've concluded in just over an hour.Bottom line: Hard Kill has almost everything you want in a direct-to-video action thriller (I don't know if that's a good thing). There's the techno spy music, the Scorpion TV show-style dialogue, and a director who just feels so enamored to be working with Bruce I use to be awesome in Die Hard Willis. Too bad Hard Kill is such a hard movie to embrace considering that its terrorism interludes pale in comparison to what our world is going through right now. Rating: 2 stars."}, {"id": 3, "text": "To put it simply , the movie wasn't even worth the $1.80 rental at Redbox. As soon as I began fast-forwarding a lot to the scenes of first half of the entire movie, I realized, my $1.80 should have been just Donated to a poor homeless out in the streets."}, {"id": 4, "text": "This movie is pathetic. I have never felt the need to review a movie on IMDB, until now. That is how bad this movie is. NOBODY should watch this film. Poor story, poor acting, poor editing, poor dialog. Bruce Willis is horrible in it. He is just cashing a check and laughing at you the audience for watching this dribble."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Four writers and they still couldn't keep me awake. The struggle was real. It was 98 minutes and slow pacing of back and forth dumb endless gunfire hell, with major plot and technical issues. A Cub Scout could plan a better attack on the factory. The very little story that there was, was so cliched and insignificant, that you'll forget what the endless gun battle was for. Even the dialogue was infantile. Apparently this was filmed in 10 days... what did they do for 8 of those days? Then there's the terrible acting, mainly due to the director failing to direct their cast - as well as the entire film. Lala Kent was the only convincing actor - and she was easier on the eyes than her acting abilities, if that tells you about the rest of the cast. And why is Willis still in these garbage films anyway? It's not for the money, because there's no way he'll be increasing his 250M net worth with these type of films. Bruce, please, stop. The only redeeming qualities was the cinematography and a half-decent score for a b-grade film. It's a very generous 3/10 from me."}, {"id": 6, "text": "This is a below average action movie.

Never should have been released. How did they get Bruce to do this?Seriously. Extremely bad acting, (possibly the worst I have seen in a very long time), and a story line that simply wasn't.

He handles the physical aspects confidentially enough. It's almost a calling card for him to do a bigger budget action flick in the future. Willis is only in a 20 minutes as expected.Screenwriters Chris LaMont and Joe Russo stick to action movie bingo in crafting the script.

How many people would like that?Plus, let's assume that someone is playing Delta Force or any other action game and found that all enemies are Mr. Bean. Bean can't hurt you.

The shooting scene in the film at some point not showing the opponent getting hit, but overall quite intense, and bloody! The martial art fighting scene also quite watchable!

The story is what it is, been there seen that, but it moves along well. The look of the film is actually slick for its budget.....but at times it looks very well shot. One thing that stood out for me was the soundtrack, simple and at times memorable, much better than most films of this type.

The title says it all. Hard Kill. It surely doesn't sound like Die Hard at all. All we have is a bunch of John McClane wannabes stuck in an isolated .... something .... and they need to stop a group of techno terrorists led by Liev Schreiber lite after a something, which they would use to end the world. So, basically the movie has some world ending stakes, but doesn't feel like so at all. And on top of that none of it makes any sense. (A bunch of weird people who can use guns to stop the world ending threat, eh? Suicide Squad anyone?) Bruce Willis is just there to make 10 to 12 fools like me watch the movie, because people like me love Die Hard films (not the last one though) and John McClane is an absolute favourite action hero of us. He is there to sit on a chair for 12 (out of 15) minutes of his screen time doing absolutely nothing. I would've been fine if Willis was the lead. Would've still hated the film, but not to this extent. Through brief flashbacks and ridiculously boring exposition scenes, the characters are set up. And, though they pretend to have some depth in them, there's nothing there. And, all they do is blow up a whole bunch of cardboard and wooden boxes. And not to mention, the performances are much more wooden than the wooden boxes they blow up. They sort of built a supposedly intense conflict between the hero and the villain and their final fight is not even a minute long, and it ends before things even get started. Apart from this, it is full of rotten and overdone cliches of the action films. Former WWE diva Eva Marie doesn't seem to be that great of an actress.It's not worth your time. If you love action films, stay away from it. If not, you'll have a strong reason to justify why you're not a fan.

Another straight to video job, this - sorry."}, {"id": 189, "text": "Well I gave it 5 stars on google so I thought I'd give it a one star on here to cover the bases.I LOVE a bad movie, but it's got to be really bad, like Plan 9 from outer space bad not just meh - that was a waste of time but bad to the point where it almost seems like it was a deliberate parody - this is one of those films.Within the first minute, you know what you're going to get as the opening sequence shows a Bargain Basement Billy Butcher (fans of the boys will know who I mean) Taking cover from machine-gun fire behind what looks like a plywood wallpapering table, but better was to come.About 4 minutes in we are treated to a flashback where BBBB is in a war situation, they clearly didn't have any budget to shoot this so instead decided that a cut scene from a nnock-off Call of Duty type videogame would do the job just as well.Other highlights include a sniper rifle that not only shoots real bullets but inexplicably shoots paintballs at the same time, as you see them splatter on the walls.Bad guys who choose not to enter a massive deserted building through any of the myriad of doors and windows it has but to walk in groups of 3 very slowly in the middle of the path so they can get taken out more easily.The director who realises that the taking cover from machine-gun fire behind a wooden table wasn't bad enough, so doubled down and got the female character to take cover from machine-gun fire behind cardboard boxes - CARDBOARD BOXES!!!!In one scene tribute is paid to 80's pop music videos by having a girl meet the bad guys in an alleyway where steam seems to be emanating from skips and anywhere else they could hide a smoke machine. As a Gen Xer - this was a nice bit of nostalgia for me.The dialogue was absolutely minging, they must have opened the Big Book of Tough Guy Cliches to help them out with the script, my favourite was probably I got shot in the back, and I still have the scar to prove it - Well I'm sure you do mate, what did you expect to happen wit your bullet hole scar, did you think you could rub on some verruca cream and wait for it to fall off?Now on to the acting, it was awful - truly awful, so bad in fact that it made me ponder whether bad acting was contagious because Bruce Willis looked like he'd never been in a film before, almost like he'd been woken from a drunken night out, booted onto the set and had to deliver his lines half-cut and spending most of his brain processing power concentrating on not throwing up.The worst actor was the girl with the purple hair who I wouldn't trust to deliver a pizza let alone a convincing line, closely followed by the bad guy, who to be fair could have been worse but I'll be honest, every time he was on screen I got massively distracted trying to work out how scientists in a lab somewhere managed to create the love child of Liev Schrieber and Bradley Cooper and grow him fast enough so he could be wheeled out onto the movie set.I'll be honest, I could have written a lot more - this review has barely scratched the surface and it wouldn't be fair to spoil the fun for those who bravely follow in my footsteps.I'm actually going to watch this again but this time with my 17-year-old son because looking at his face wrinkled up in astonishment, shock and horror at what he's witnessing will be like watching the reaction videos to people viewing 2 girls one cup Don't watch if you like a film that requires your neurons to be functioning for you to enjoy it for what it is supposed to be.Do watch if you want to get a load of friends together for a watch party and laugh about how stupid it is.Enjoy!"}, {"id": 190, "text": "Please spare yourself and refrain from watching this garbage..even after 1 hour I feel like puking .."}, {"id": 191, "text": "Very flat story.

This standard-issue thriller with a double-digit body count focuses on a doomsday computer program which can be used as a devastating weapon to reset civilization as we know it to a state of barbarism. Mind you, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) succeeded in pulling off this stunt at the end of Escape from L.A. (1996), when he refused save the world from a similar disaster. Indeed, he succeeded in doing what the chief villain in Hard Kill, the dastardly Pardoner (Sergio Rizzuto of Green Rush), has spent two years planning. Willis portrays a billionaire tech mogul whose brainiac daughter, Eva (Lala Kent of 10 Minutes Gone), has concocted a two-quantum computer artificial intelligence program designated as Project 725. Meantime, the depraved Pardoner yearns to activate this proprietary program. Wiping out every computer in the world with it, he wants to level the playing field and incite global anarchy. Interestingly, the filmmakers modeled the villain after the character of The Pardoner in medieval author Geoffrey Chaucer's landmark literary masterpiece The Canterbury Tales. Chaucer penned this collection of satirical stories back in 1392, and they were published in 1400. Surprisingly, Eskandari and scenarists Joe Russo &amp; Chris LaMont, who adapted the story by Clayton Haugen and Nikolai From, have done a contemporary take on Chaucer's The Pardoner.Although Project 725 was designed initially to help society, The Pardoner corrupts its use. He exploits it as a weapon to annihilate all technology, primarily supporting combat, communication, and financing to forge a new world order. No longer will armies thrive on the digital components integral to their sophisticated defense systems. Wars will be waged as they were in the 1800s. Communication satellites will be obsolete. Men will see only as far as the aircraft they fly, the ships they sail, and the mountains they scale. Financial institutions will revert to 19th century banking practices. Nevertheless, bigger nations will enjoy manpower superiority over their smaller rivals. Similarly, those larger nations will still boast more cannon fodder in the form of troops to sacrifice on the battlefield. The Pardoner wants to destroy a society he denounces as sick. Paraphrasing Chaucer's Pardoner, he asserts, Greed is the root of all pain.Wealthy tech mogul Dayton Chalmers (Bruce Willis of Die Hard) hires seasoned ex-soldier Derek Miller (Jesse Metcalfe of Desperate Housewives) and his mercenary team to foil The Pardoner. Historically, Miller and The Pardoner are sworn enemies. During an earlier job, The Pardoner shot Miller in the back and left him for dead. Miraculously, Miller survived. Now, an old African American military chum, Nick Fox (Texas Battle of Coach Carter), who saved Miller's life, introduces him to his boss Chalmers. In the CEO's luxurious stretch limo, Miller seals a deal for his fellow soldiers-of-fortune: Harrison Zindel (Jon Galanis of Aftermath), his purple coiffed sister Sasha (former WWE wrestling sensation Natalie Eva Marie) and Dash Hawkins (Swen Temmel of Backtrace), to safeguard the company magnate when Fox and he inspect a derelict factory Chalmers may renovate for his company. Little does Miller know Chalmers and Fox haven't been entirely honest with him. When they arrive at the factory, a rambling complex of brick buildings with a looming clock tower, Miller and company discover Chalmer's life isn't the only one at stake.Simultaneously, an army of black-clad, heavily armed henchmen accompany The Pardoner to capture Chalmers. Furthermore, Chalmers informs Miller and company that the evil Pardoner has abducted his daughter. Truth is Eva Chalmers aligned herself initially with The Pardoner to test Project 725 in the field. Chalmer's company Chapter House prohibited them from testing it. Sadly, the father and daughter haven't seen eye to eye, but at the end of the day, they change their minds. The Pardoner needs Dayton alive because Project 725 requires his fail-safe access code along with Eva's to trigger this budding technological nightmare. The Pardoner orders his armed henchmen to occupy the factory. Miller and his team whittle them down, scavenge their weapons and hardware as a part of battlefield salvage, and then use them against them. During the fracas, Eva escapes from the Pardoner and rejoins her father, which overjoys him. Earlier, Eva had quarreled with The Pardoner when he abused Project 725 to crash a jetliner. Meanwhile, treachery lurks within Miller's own ranks and divides them. A lone dissident seizes Eva at gunpoint. He tries to use her as a bargaining chip to win over The Pardoner. Naturally, the Pardoner cuts no deals and leaves him sprawled on concrete with a bullet in the belly.In their third collaborative outing as director and star, Eskandari and Willis fare less successful with this potentially provocative potboiler. Their previous film Survive the Night qualified as an above-average thriller, with Willis confined to a supporting role while Chad Michael Murray took care of business. Now, Willis loiters on the periphery of Hard Kill, while Metcalfe takes a stab at playing hero. The scene where he goes on a rampage slashing and gashing several adversaries is as lively as it gets. Unlike Survive the Night, Hard Kill qualifies as mediocre because The Pardoner makes such a lackluster enemy. He neither chews the scenery enough nor infuriates us as the typical egotistical villain should. Any time a movie villain poses a less than genuine threat to either the heroes or the audience, you know the outcome isn't going to be in doubt. Despite the greater number of gunmen at his disposal, The Pardoner learns from his second-in-command that they have underestimated Miller and company. Predictably, the villain's henchmen turn out to be sloppy shooters and spend more time getting shot. At other times, those henchmen are just plain complacent. The heroes do suffer casualties, but the villains are easier to kill. Ultimately, Hard Kill relies on too many clich\u00e9s to be original."}, {"id": 380, "text": "I created this account just to leave this review. Don't believe anyone who rated this movie over 3 stars.

The lead guy was clearly excited to be playing alongside Willis and spent most of the film dragging up pastiche takes on McLean from Die Hard...except you just don't care. At some point someone asks, Have finished making your funny little speeches? and you have to wonder if this was actually a comment from a passing screenwriter horrified at what was clearly wasted studio time. Willis himself flitted between tired and bewildered to flattered and ego-massaged that a film could be entirely devoted to attempting to (and failing to) emulate any number of his 80s and 90s films.

Maybe they had a very limited budget and tried to cut costs by missing any preparations.But even if they got these things right, much of film was Bruce hiding away from the bad guys, which just felt completely wrong.This film should not be sold, needs to be deleted! it's going to waste a lot of people's time and just put tarnish on Bruce Willis's name."}, {"id": 391, "text": "If you want to have more fun than watching this movie you could go to your dentist and get your wisdom teeth out,, or you could clean the toilets in your house, or . . .I am an action movie junkie and I have to tell you that even when a critic rates a movie as scoring pretty damn low I still enjoy the movie.

It is about a team of mercenaries who are hired to keep a program developed by a billionaire CEO safe from a terrorist sect who want it for nefarious reasons.Plotting is mediocre and never strays far from the generic action handbook. After Project 725 is handed over to a terrorist called the Pardoner (Rizzuto), billionaire CEO Chalmers (Willis) and Fox (Battle) recruit Miller (Metcalfe) to defend Chalmers and activation code to it in an abandoned warehouse. Miller gets his old friends Sasha (Marie), Dash (Temmel), and Harrison (Galanis) to assist. Once the group get to the warehouse they find out that the Pardoner and his men, including Colton (Olson), have Chalmers' daughter and is coming to the warehouse to get the code, using Eva (Kent), Chalmers's daughter as bait. After the mercenaries refuse to surrender Chalmers, the Pardoner launches an assault on the team and they are forced to defend it.Characters are unbelievably bland. Miller, an already mundane last name for a protagonist, has little to offer. He is a sucker for family woes and was previously in the military but after taking a bullet in the back from a prior encounter with the Pardoner he was sent home and became a mercenary. This previous encounter is only mentioned in passing only to establish the Pardoner as a known threat, and it never means anything in the grand scheme. Sasha is even more uninteresting, having no traits to her aside from her blue and purple hair, and that Harrison is her brother; although it never feels like it during interactions between the two. Harrison himself is a blank slate, literally having zero impact on the story or the action. Dash is the cracking member of the group. I refuse to add 'wise' before cracking because he just spits lines that have no place in the script. Fox is merely the segue into the plot. That is it. Chalmers is similar, having little presence in the movie and only serves to allow the action. The Pardoner is a mish-mash of every bad guy clich\u00e9 in the book: he wants to burn down society, he has no use for money, he offers Miller a spot by his side, blah, blah, blah. Performances are mostly awful, Metcalfe and Marie are trying with flaccid material, and Willis is a coin toss, only putting in some effort in every other scene; and everyone else is just awful.Action is dull, leaving little lasting impact bar a few moments towards the end, literally and figuratively. A low budget forces the blood to be blatant CGI, and the bullets have no punch, with no holes in the material they land on or the people they perforate. Shootouts are poorly shot, with little energy in the movements of the camera and the on-screen participants; and geography is nebulous at best. Characters travel from room to room, but aside from a few overhead shots of the warehouse itself, the audience is left to wonder where things are happening in relation to others. The warehouse location provides little in the way of visually or contextually stimulating action regardless of the camerawork. Since the place has been long abandoned, there is little left to integrate into the action aside from old filing cabinets, long hallways, and cardboard boxes. Humdrum.Technically the movie is weak and clearly shot on the cheap. As mentioned before, nearly all of the impacts of bullets and the blood is shoddy CGI, but what might be worse is the muzzle flashes from the guns as they fire. In some situations the whole edges of the frame become yellow with the firing of the weapons, if this is a design decision it was a bad one, and if it was a rendering issue in post-production it would not be surprising. Direction is uninspired, it is as if Eskandari was told to shoot a bunch of scenes that would be commonplace in an action/thriller and then the producers cut them into a feature length project; and this is coming from someone who enjoys the director's other work, with Survive the Night being a recent favorite of mine.While Hard Kill is never uninteresting enough to turn off, thanks to commitment from Metcalfe and Marie to the material and Willis's occasional effort during scenes involving him; it relies too much on clich\u00e9s, a bad MacGuffin in Project 725, and weak action barring a few moments to be worth the time.36/100"}, {"id": 394, "text": "Derek Miller (Jesse Metcalfe) is haunted by a video game (I mean battle PTSD).

The pace is slow, a lot of boring gun fights, not enough hand to hand action to make it interesting.

It's occasionally punctuated by such lame dialogue scenes as Chalmers and Eva engaging in a heartfelt father-daughter chat or The Pardoner taking the time to explain the reason for his unusual moniker. During the latter, Willis, as if standing in for the viewer, listens with a bored expression on his face clearly Bruce Willis wishing he is interacting with Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber instead. The Pardoner, by comparison, is such a one-note villain that his chief distinguishing characteristic is his manipulations of a Rubik's Cube - although that's somewhat more arresting than Willis' character-defining wearing of a heavy woolen scarf. Clearly, screenwriters at least I like Matt Eskandari as better director not a masterpiece or great director but he is not worst like with Steven C Miller and why?

Hmmm. Okay, we can get on board with that storyline for an action movie.It seems like all of the actors in the movie took their cue from WIllis's wooden performance. WIllis's range of emotions was nonexistent, and he looked old and tired at best. In trying to figure out if any of the other actors had any experience that might contribute to a decent performance in this movie, I looked up the work of the two prominent female actors (one character played Willis's kidnapped daughter, one played a special ops soldier). Well, one of them came from reality TV, and the other from women's wrestling. Question asked, question answered.

If you don't watch this movie, it will be like not catching the flu - your life will be better for having missed it."}, {"id": 401, "text": "Beyond Terrible; it's actually much worse than 1 star but I have no one to blame but myself. Once I heard the bad guy's name was the pardoner and I kept watching I lost all ability to complain. The fact that he gave himself that name coupled with the fact the good guys know his actual name and yet everyone refers to him by that was cringe worthy. But moving on past that farce some part of me refuses to believe that Bruce Willis has fallen this far; yet each time I watch one of his straight to video movies it's worse than the one before. This one has to be the worst yet. It must be that 98.5% of this film's budget went to his salary. On second thought maybe 99.2%. Let's just quickly move past the fact that it is impossible to believe that anyone involved in this film ever handled a weapon or had even heard the word tactics before. But that's fine Hollywood gets that stuff wrong all the time. And there's about six hours of mistakes in this 90 minute film. What can't be excused is how horrible the writing, acting and dialogue were. On top of that each plot hole was swallowed by an even bigger one. As I said I only have myself to blame for wasting those precious 90+ minutes of my life that are now gone forever. Please don't make the same mistake."}], "reviews_amount": 402}
