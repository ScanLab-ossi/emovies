{"name": "Palm Springs", "titleId": "tt09484998", "reviews": [{"id": 0, "text": "Films that revolve around characters repeating the same day over and over again has grown very tired in my mind. Groundhog Day perfected it and it really wasn't until more recently with Edge of Tomorrow that I really found a film that seemed to stand out among the rest. Well, I'm glad that I can now add Palm Springs to the list of films to put a clever spin on this concept. This film was originally supposed to play at more film festivals around the world and eventually receive a theatrical release, but things being the way they are, Hulu has now released it. Although this may be a film that's hard to find for some right now, here's why Palm Springs is one of the very best movies to come out of this bare year of 2020 so far.Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) find themselves sort of bonding over the fact that they both really don't want to be at the wedding they're at. He's the date of someone who cheats on him and she is the sister of the bride, who clearly has many issues. Stumbling across a strange cave after the wedding, they both find themselves caught in a time loop that has them reliving the same day over and over again. Certain things are revealed about each of these characters that add a lot more depth to the story and I found myself incredibly engaged from beginning to end.Where this film shines the most is in the fact that it completely commits to the whole time loop concept, even giving a few winks at the audience. It never once makes any huge mistakes logically, which felt refreshing, especially in the ways it would subvert expectations and most importantly in the way that they choose to conclude the story. The way Palm Springs wraps up was a very entertaining and emotionally earned finale. Now, I feel like I say this about a lot of movies that focus so much of their time on very few characters, but I truly mean that if Samberg and Milioti didn't have any fun chemistry together, this film would've been a disaster. This is probably the most laid back and comfortable I've ever seen Andy Samberg be in a film and it made the entire experience that much better.Only having written and directed a few short films and a documentary before tackling Palm Springs, director Max Barbakow has honestly blown me away here. With a small budget, a small number of characters, and a small scope, this film felt much bigger than it was. I can honestly see a big future for him in the coming years. I will gladly seek out his next project. On top of his stellar work on this film, writer Andy Siara (who also doesn't have a huge filmography as of yet) added a very funny and clever tone to the whole concept. It was clear that the performers were very comfortable with the dialogue because their acting lept off the screen and that just seemed to be a nice mixture of everything coming together nicely behind the scenes.In the end, Palm Springs is a film that I was very much looking forward to, but was wary of due to the concept itself. Thankfully, this is one of the best movies that I've seen accomplish this concept in years. I'm not calling it a masterpiece by any means, but for a fun time loop movie, I really couldn't find many issues. At a mere 90 minutes, this movie flies by and has just enough clever surprises for those who may not have been completely engaged. While the idea itself has grown tired for me, this movie is undeniably hard to dislike. Everything about this movie put a huge smile on my face and if that isn't what the world needs right now, I don't know what is."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I was expecting a conventional rom-com where the guy meets the girl, but this one has a little twist. It's smart-funny, well written some of the shots are gorgeous and very wholesome. It's a fresh take for this type of genre."}, {"id": 2, "text": "Groundhog Day gave us some pretty realistic scenarios about life but still Bill Murray was grumpy as we saw the beginning of his character's curse. Here we don't. We meet Andy aka Nyles when he has already lived the same day for years and have had made peace with it. Cristin aka Sarah, on the other hand is new and starts out grumpy but becomes the adventurous one.J.K. Simmons is also beautiful in his character, although a short storyline. They took Groundhog Day and added some stoner existencial crisis type feels and added a beautiful romantic angle with an appropriate cinematography. This movie works on multiple levels, a weekend watch, a romantic watch and a fun watch. Although, there are some explicit scenes but in all they just add to the overall amusement.It opened with a bang in Sundance and is surely worth a watch.Cheers."}, {"id": 3, "text": "This movie is utterly wonderful. It's heartfelt, romantic, real, and topical. It made me think, laugh, and cry.The Groundhog Day setup may seem stale, but they get so many fresh ideas out of the concept that it solidifies this film as a future cult classic.I was never really a Samberg fan. I am now!"}, {"id": 4, "text": "... but re-dimensioned in such a way that the films it copies will look a little less appealing next time it comes to replaying them - whether it be in the past, the present or the future."}, {"id": 5, "text": "I really wasn't expecting a ton from this movie, I expected a pretty decent romantic comedy and I also love Andy so I was excited to give it a shot. But WOW was I very very pleasantly surprised!! I literally started it over immediately after finishing it cause I liked it so much. Completely not what I was expecting but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I laughed out loud multiple times, and the story is completely amazing in my opinion. Highly recommend if you're wanting a quirky comedy, but it also has very cute moments. LOVED it. I hope it gets the recognition it deserves."}, {"id": 6, "text": "I'm a huge fan of time loop movies and this one might be in the top 5 of those I've seen.The first half is fun and enjoyable. Samberg and Milioti are great and work well together, and the use of multiple people experiencing the time loop - something that's surprisingly rare for time loop movies - works well. Samberg's usual over-the-top schtick is turned down to 25% here, which made the movie more enjoyable for me, as it meant the humour meshed well with the somewhat more serious vibe of the movie.Where the movie faltered for me was around half way through the movie where it switches from fun to drama. As with a lot of stories, this is when the world falls apart for our protagonist(s) and they need to fix things to get back on top and come out stronger than before. But here the resolution is not greatly satisfying, so it's not really worth the switch from fun. The ending itself is not the worst they could have gone with, but even that feels somewhat underwhelming. In fact, despite the movie having a somewhat unique premise, the last act of the movie feels like the generic final act that a lot of rom-coms movies use. I also didn't find Samberg's acting to be fantastic when he needed to act more serious, although that issue only stood out to me a few times in the film.Overall, though, the movie was good. It did something a little different with the time loop concept, the good parts of the movie were really enjoyable, and even if the second half wasn't fantastic it didn't ruin the entire film. So I'd recommend this to anyone who likes the sound of a semi-serious rom-com time loop flick. (And now that those 90 minutes have come and gone for me, I wish they'd actually made it an 8-10 episode miniseries instead.)"}, {"id": 7, "text": "I was flipping through Hulu one night and saw this movie pop up, I saw it was Andy Sanberg and the cute chick from HIMYM, I thought hey maybe it'll be good for a chuckle, and if not, eh who cares. But it was a perfect late night gem, I love coming across movies or shows that I genuinely like by accident and with no expectations going in."}, {"id": 8, "text": "A good thing about movie is that it doesn't last long, it has a story and a beautiful message. You will laugh, I promise."}, {"id": 9, "text": "Palm Springs is One of those infinite time-loop situations you might have heard about. Palm Springs is a Rom-Com about Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) two wedding guests stuck in a time-loop forced to relive the same day over and over again. Samberg and Milioti are great together as Nyles and Sarah. The CGI may not have been great, but that didn't take away from the many laughs I had during the movie. Palm Springs is a great movie, and if you haven't yet watched it, watch it."}, {"id": 10, "text": "Movie was okayish at best. Definitely not worth 9/10 rating people are giving it. Good for a one time watch."}, {"id": 11, "text": "While Groundhog day was much more inspiring and transformational for it's main character, the characters in this movie seem to end more or less in the same place they started - being sarcastic and superficial. The first half of the movie was better, had some funny moments and interesting scenarios. But the 2nd half just turned into a very generic rom com and the end result was flat and uninspiring."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Im not gonna spoil anything or say anything else about the movie, if you've watched the trailer your just thinking to yourself oh another groundhog day. This movie goes beyond what it is intended and leaves you laughing and feeling better than before you watched it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Palm Springs was an okay movie. Script vice, the movie doesn't really offer anything new. The characters find themselves into a time loop and they just follow every classic rom com trop until the final ending. We don't get to know them, we don't get to understand them, or to understand the whole time loop concept really. The whole thing can be described as generic at best, with some odd touches here and there. The performances, in addition, were okay but nothing special. For all it's worth, it is not a waste of time, but nothing special either."}, {"id": 14, "text": "The time loop shtick has been done a number of times but this new film takes it and puts a great romantic comedy spin on it. Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti are great and their chemistry is off the walls. Watch it for a great time."}, {"id": 15, "text": "I'm impressed that people are still able to find new, original spins on the classic Groundhog Day premise of repeating the same day over and over. Palm Springs is a unique and compelling film that blends so many genres together into a dazzling package. It's slightly absurd at times, but that just adds to the charm of it. Andy Samberg is hilariously goofy and Cristin Milioti does a lot of the dramatic heavy lifting. This is just a really enjoyable, wonderful film that deserves to be seen and will undoubtedly make you happy."}, {"id": 16, "text": "Gorgeous movie with a great premise, time loop movies are something that I will never get enough of! This movie certainly met my expectations. The twists were subtle and surprising which is hard to come by considering the fact that the same day kept happening over and over. All in all, a fun film!"}, {"id": 17, "text": "Why all the buzz on this movie? Yes, it's a new and creative spin on the November 9 version of Groundhog Day, but it is nowhere near better. Except for some moments of JK, the repeat of nihilism day after day is not fun, nor is it entertaining. At least we weren't subjected to the first five minutes being played out each waking day. I so wanted to like this. I so didn't."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Thought I was not the rom com type, but this flick takes the cake. Such a refreshing and original premise and bombshell ending."}, {"id": 19, "text": "A weak-sauce rip-off of Groundhog Day, but with particularly unlikable characters who never really show the growth that Bill Murray did in that 1993 classic. It is all so slight and insignificant. I chuckled twice."}, {"id": 20, "text": "There's something about time loop movies that are pretty cool, though I guess it probably has to do with Groundhog Day simply being one of those classic films that spur people on to adapt it to different situations. This one is certainly no different, and it does have some uniqueness about it that I particularly enjoyed. The difference with this one is that multiple people are actually trapped in the time loop, and they are able to interact with each other, which I thought was quite cool. The other thing is that while we know who is trapped in the loop, we don't know how long they have been in the loop, namely because they have been caught in it for so long.So, basically have this guy Nyles, who as you can guess, has been living this day over and over again. Like, it's a wedding where his girlfriend is a bridesmaid, and it is located out in the desert, Palms Springs to be precise. Obviously, he has used the opportunity to, well, pretty much try everything, and he also discovers and awful lot of secrets as well, such as his girlfriend being unfaithful to him. However, the catch comes when one night he is out in the desert with the maid of honour, and is attacked, and he flees into the cave, the one that originally started the time loop, and she follows him in.It's pretty cool actually, and while I'd suggest that it is slightly different to Groundhog Day, it still has a lot of the elements. It's pretty funny as well, especially with a lot of the shennanigans that he gets up to. In fact, it seems as if he has been in this loop for so long that he no longer cares, and it has just become part of his life. Not so with Sarah, who is looking for a way out, and decides that the only way to do it is through quantum physics. Actually, it's quite interesting how these days quantum physics is thrown around with the idea of time loops, but that is probably because despite having been around for about a hundred years, there is still a lot we really don't know about it. In fact, it is just another one of those 'new frontier' type of things film makers and such that is probably why it appears so often.Anyway, this is a pretty cool film, and quite funny as well. While it doesn't really break new ground, it's stull quite fun to watch."}, {"id": 21, "text": "I absolutely love this movie. It's such a cool plot and cast. I love he pacing and resolution of the movie very much. Great job Andy, you played Niles perfectly."}, {"id": 22, "text": "My husband and I rarely agree on anything tv show and movie wise especially since we have two kids and our only time to watch is after they've gone down which doesn't leave much time before we got the hay too. We browsed through Hulu I wanted horror he wanted anime *eye roll* I actually accidentally clicked Palm Prints without looking at the synopsis. I thought since rated R it would be a horror movie...it is not it is a comedy that both my husband and I watched together there were laughs there was romantic drama it was good a solid 8 outta 10 I'd say and we both enjoyed it the actors worked really well together and gave it a real feel. Give it a chance."}, {"id": 23, "text": "Palm Springs works on just about every level. It has some genuinely funny moments, its heartwarming at times, and Andy Samberg/Cristin Milioti are fantastic and have great chemistry together. It's a romcom with a twist (which you should try to not know going into it) and it executes on its premise as effectively, if not moreso, as many other movies/TV shows with the same twist. Overall, I'd highly recommend this movie and would say that just about anyone can enjoy it."}, {"id": 24, "text": "If you'd suggested that I could like a fantasy romantic comedy, I'd have said you were off your meds.But I'd have been wrong, because this is a beautiful movie. It's so simple and fun and heartfelt and funny, it's just a joy to watch.Go in without reading anything about it, and just enjoy it."}, {"id": 25, "text": "This movie now is one of my favourite time loop movies. Funny, hilarious, enjoyable and romantic. \u2764\u2764 Do not think twice and watch it !!"}, {"id": 26, "text": "Cute story. Obviously, like 95% of the movies, you already know what's going to happen and how it's going to end. It's the journey that matters and all the jokes along the way. This movie made me seriously laugh out loud a few times at least (which doesn't happen that often these days) and I really enjoyed watching these two characters go through the story. Definitely recommend this but if you are going into this expecting something new or a masterpiece then... well, you need help."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Pleasantly enjoyable comedy movie. It was so casual. I liked it. Just lay back and let the drama flow. Oh, one crucial thing though; Do not get serious at this one tiny science part. That's a comedy too, in a big way. You should know that by now. I mean, didn't we watch this movie for eons? 'Woaaaaaht? (lol)'"}, {"id": 28, "text": "If you watch this with an open mind, no knowledge of what it's about and no expectations, it's refreshingly surprising and heartwarming. Much needed distraction from all the nonsense that is going on in the world. Some parts are a bit inappropriate, but what else would you expect from Andy?! Give it a try!"}, {"id": 29, "text": "Call me an old fashioned bore, but they really suck at making movies these days. How on Earth is this a 84/100 on Metacritic is beyond me, even by their laughable standards. This is absolute pedestrian drivel. Out of the many recurring day themes in movies and TV (Groundhog Day, 50 First dates, Supernatural), this is definitely the worst. This made an 85 minute runtime seem unwatchable and never ending. Probably because Samberg is such a third rate version of Sandler, with none of likeability of the latter. Even my girl who can consume modern BS with more tolerance than me, was found fast forwarding this annoyance multiple times."}, {"id": 30, "text": "Answer is: Most people already do. You wake up in the morning, go to a job, get back home, hang out with your family, maybe do something in between and go to sleep. Living one day over and over is one movie concept that gets used every once in a while, and usually those movies are very enjoyable to watch. Why? It's a mix of how are they going to get out of this, character development and finding new ways to enjoy life. Palm Springs is similar to Groundhog Day because of the repeating days concept, but they don't have much else in common. If you like movies like About Time, Groundhog Day or even Edge Of Tomorrow, this is a movie for you. It is really a great combination of romance, comedy and sci-fi and if you like a good laugh and a good romantic story, I would definitely recommend it. Really well done by Hulu, everything from acting to directing was done professionally and superbly. Netflix/Hulu movies have not been famous so far for their cinematic/entertainment quality so I was really surprised by Palm Springs."}, {"id": 31, "text": "I honestly thought this would be just another Groundhog Day ripoff, but it ended up being considerably more. The acting was well done, the casting was on point, and it was funnier than I had even hoped it would be. Very happy I decided to see it."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Palm Springs is a fresh take on an established concept. Inspired from Groundhog Day, it's one of those infinite time-loop situations you would've heard about. A very fun movie that's perfect when you want to unwind and just chill. Grab your snacks and enjoy this movie!"}, {"id": 33, "text": "After watching the trailer, I thought it'll be the same time travelling thing again like GroundHog Day or any other time loop movies but this was much more.Even the feels and how I felt that it's more than a venue but a comfort zone and what do you do with it.By the end, I was smiling so wide due to everything that happened and what the characters represented."}, {"id": 34, "text": "If you are not familiar; with the concept; basically a person keeps living the same day again and again until finding a way to get out of the loop. Basically is that happens to Sarah (an outstanding and lovable Cristin Milioti) when by accident gets trapped in the same time loop with Nyles (Adam Samberg ) and Roy (J.K. Simmons). The movie portraits three depressed, frustrated and immature in funny and sweet way making really care for the lot. Giving too much will be to spoil the surprise; but let's just say that the movie is able to be sweet, entertaining but with a very deep message about what we make of our lives and understand for happiness. In brief; it is really worth seeing it."}, {"id": 35, "text": "Well I love samberg,love their chemistry and like the Groundhog Day happy death day premise as I find it interesting in terms of things you'd do as your technically invincible and immortal. This film explored bits of it.He met her a lot so I get the love for her, her reciprocating felt more forced but needed I guess, wasn't a fan of her sleeping with the sisters fella as no matter what the narrative says she's pretty damn horrible. The goat killing and learning physics to that level to the dinosaurs seemed a bit mental to meI think I enjoyed it until, I thought too much about it if you try and explain it or pick it apart it feels bad"}, {"id": 36, "text": "Surprisingly good! May even watch again. Samburg is hilarious, the leads chemistry is good, and the movie was altogether engaging and heart-felt. Ending was a little lackluster, but I still came away from the movie with a smile on my face."}, {"id": 37, "text": "This very funny movie involves two people eternally reliving someone's wedding day.From the trailer I expected a level of wackiness commensurate with that of co-star Andy Samberg's Brooklyn-99 series, but while this is often very silly and very thoughtful, it's also existential, thoughtful, and increasingly romantic. Cristin Milioti is great as the one who can't adjust to her strange reality, and she and Samberg have great chemistry as they flirt and fight under extraordinary circumstances.This is just really fun and you should definitely watch it."}, {"id": 38, "text": "For a time looping movie, Palm Springs came out tops! Fun, funny, smart and a fresh take on the tired worn out start your day over and over again concept.Some very decent writing, acting and directing takes this film to a high level that lately many other films fail to reach.A must watch - a good laugh and an ending that works!This film scores a very well deserved looping 8 out of 10."}, {"id": 39, "text": "I watched this because I love Andy Samberg, and I genuinely thought it would be a mindless rom com that was must meh, but boy was I wrong! This is such a fun modern day take on the Groundhog Day, time warp plot. I was actually on the edge of the couch most of the movie. Full of laughs, plot twists and genuine moments. So glad I found this gem."}, {"id": 40, "text": "At the beginning of the movie, I had a feeling I'll enjoy this one a lot. Really had a promising start. Actors are fine, color is fine, setup is good. Then the next morning came. I've recently finished the superb third season of Dark and after I noticed Groundhog day style trick, honestly I felt it's going to be a bad rip off. Yet surprisingly it turned out pretty good. At least until up to a moment that the girl realized about that bad morning she wakes.It's totally understandable she wakes up on a terrible mistake and can't take it anymore. But taking it out on the guy just didn't make sense. At first, movie tried to lean on the idea of we're here because we've done a mistake in our lives and we should fix it. Once this higher purpose idea didn't work out, she comes up with the ridiculous idea ever to get out : exploding yourself with a c4 in that special place (I won't even ask how did she found c4 since this is a romcom). The worst part was she didn't even care about the guy, she just wanted to end it. Basically her own personal mistake or dilemma has become his problem. All that chemistry (if ever there was) was gone afterwards. I don't know if making a huge explosion would break a time loop but messing up the chemistry between main characters definitely breaks the consistency.Once that connection is lost, the rest wasn't funny, romantic or whatever you call it. If they would handle the second half more delicately, this could have been 8 even 8.5 easily. And it could have stand on its own instead of calling it a Groundhog day style movie and it means you can re-watch it countless times.In the end this is a nice flick.

The two leads are pleasant and I liked their chemistry but the movie was just not as well crafted as Groundhog Day which includes the attention to detail. Admittedly GD is one of my all time favorites so it's a high bar. The lead often doesn't act like a guy stuck in a loop for a long time.

The plot/story is a good one, and not one that I've EVER seen done before, which is great, since you see the same plot/story used OVER and OVER again so often, but this film's plot is truly original.Samberg and Cristin Milioti deliver good performances. The film is a little short though... I would have loved it if the film was about 20-30minutes longer, so that some time could be spent on showing the various 'loops' that the main characters have previously experienced. With a plot/story like this, you could have SO MUCH fun, with the various crazy and wacky things that the characters could be shown doing (like robbing a bank, jumping into a volcano, wrestling a bear, etc.) but alas this film's short runtime leaves very little time for such antics, and thus results in only a 7.5 film."}, {"id": 51, "text": "I planned to watch Gladiator tonight but I honestly couldn't be bothered as it's around 3 hours and quite heavy.

There are outliers a few times a year typically but the formula was incredibly overdone back in the 1990's-2000's, that I think we began to grow numb of what a great rom-com can actually be. Palm Springs is a GREAT rom-com and it's also one of the best films of 2020, if not the best. Not to mention how perfect it is for the summer season and current quarantine most of the world is stuck in. What better than a rom-com about two characters stuck in a time-loop of never ending death at the end of their day?

Simmons Directed: Max BarbakowThis may well be one of the most enjoyable movie watching experiences I have all year. Palm Springs is just simple and fun with its fresh approach to a time loop romantic comedy. This Hulu Original film produced by the one and only Lonely Island and helmed by first time director Max Barbakow definitely took a risk of falling into the standard formula or template films like these tend to fall into. Although it does become fairly predictable as we enter into the third act of the film (which honestly didn't bother me at all), I did appreciate how Barbakow told this story from many different perspectives. Editing in a smart way, and made sure to reveal shocking aspects of each characters arch perfectly as to make sure not to turn the screenplay in a repetitive and dull mess. You'll understand what I mean as each time the day repeats, we are shown that much more of each of our main characters that will have you being more and more invested.By far the best part of this film is the instant and palpitating chemistry between Nyles &amp; Sarah. Films like this sink and fall flat if the audience does not truly believe the genuine performances of the actors - this was absolutely not the case in Palm Springs. It was honestly such a treat to watch when they were both on screen together as they completely stole every scene - one in particular in the second act in a bar (you'll know!).Now, is this the funniest film I've ever seen (most definitely in 2020)...no. It's doesn't change the game with hilarious out loud laughter but it does have its moments. And we've established how amazing the film is having Andy and Christin occupy most its key scenes, BUT the supporting cast - most notably the presence of J.K. Simmons - is just icing on the cake. As I mentioned in one of my previous posts, J.K. Simmons is one of my favourite actors working today and if you don't agree, simply watch 2014's Oscar nominated Whiplash - it will change your opinion.One thing I should mention in case some of you may be thinking of watching this film with your younger children or even your parents - Palm Springs is a HARD R rating! And by no means is this a bad thing - look at some of Judd Apatow films - just wanted to give you all a heads up. Drug and alcohol abuse, and some heavy sexual content are present throughout - you'll see in the opening scene of the film. I believe this is done intentionally to let the audience know then tone of the film and nature of some of the humour and that it doesn't hold back any punches!As of right now, Palm Springs has easily cracked my top ten favourite films of 2020 and it is most definitely a must watch in my opinion. If you're not particularly fond of romantic comedies, you may miss why I love this film so much. But if you're like me, and can appreciate a light-hearted 90 minute time-loop journey to happy-town - you are going to enjoy this film as much as I did.Sorry, there are no cameos or performance from Loney Island - disappointing I know and a huge SPOILER ALERT!"}, {"id": 106, "text": "This is the kind of movie that just puts you in a good mood.

While full of comedy and laugh-out-loud moments, I found the romance and drama realistic and relatable. Some parts hit hard and made me feel extreme happiness or sadness.

Palm Springs and Groundhog Day share very little except for the core concept, and each are classics in their own way. Samberg and Milioti stuck in the loop together gives us laughs, great energy, and thought-provoking scenes, and while it's not the perfect movie, it's destined to be a repeat watch for fans of the genre.

She just behaves like she couldn't give a rat's about him.

Pain is real.Also, there is nothing worse than dying slowly in the ICU. I feel that message is not intended only for time-loopers.This film is so much fun on its face that it's easy to look no deeper, but if deeper you look, deeper you go.On second viewing, I became almost certain that there was a CRUCIAL plot-point that was never exposed. Ready? Sarah didn't just get caught in the loop. Nyles did that, very deliberately, although it's not entirely clear that he knows it.Watch the wedding toast, and tell me Nyles isn't saying every word for Sarah alone, to welcome her into his world where she (and Roy, I guess) will be the only other real person for Nyles. At a level so deep that the actual wedding is utterly trivial in comparison, Nyles and Sarah are entering a partnership that is more exclusive and more enduring than any marriage.And here's the kicker. When Nyles says to Sarah, Don't you kiss me! it's cute and playful, and he knows better than anyone that she's for sure going to kiss him as a result. But then five minutes later he's shouting to Sarah, Don't come in the cave! Again, she defiantly does the opposite. Is Nyles *actually* surprised by this? Is Nyles surprised by *anything*?There's room to read it either way, but that's some very convincing evidence."}, {"id": 143, "text": "I was hoping this was going to be good but was worried that Andy Samberg may have been one bad movie away from becoming thought of as another Adam Sandler. Luckily he's had the opportunity to consistently show his range on Brooklyn Nine-Nine since 2013 and completely delivered in this film. With a really effective opening showcasing the type of humor and emotional journey he would find himself on and a female lead who did a perfect job showcasing the character's multidimensional and realistic personality. I was taken on an emotional journey with a familiar rom-com formula but fresh and enough character development to keep it interesting. I was also a fan of the shifting perspectives as it was not overdone and happened at the perfect times to give the characters time to breath and let us empathize and understand both.

Even there are theories of that Nani also being in the timeloop.I liked that they told the story from multiple perspective of similar situation.

It is impossible not to compare this with Groundhog Day as this movie completely plagiarized that now-classic film from 1993.There is nothing they could explain about a character to excuse the fact that she slept with her sister's husband-to-be the night before the marriage.

I was unaware that this was a time loop movie going into it. I was about to turn it off but something stopped me . It was when Adam Samberg seem to know every move of everyone else's actions before it happened. I thought to myself, wait a second,  is this a time loop movie?  So I stuck around. And it was definitely worth it. I laughed, I danced, I even shed a tear hear and there. I wish they would of spent a bit more time developing the characters as they did in Ground Hog Day. Or dug deeper into a back story of how this loop started in the first place. At least The Edge Of Tommorow had Alien spooge that creates a mysterious time continuum. I think Adam Samberg should've Sharpened his axe just like Bill Murray Learn to play the piano, learned how to dance, and improved his game. At least make a reference to G.H.D like for instance....We're not In Punxsutawney. All in all, it's a pretty good movie and I recommend it.

It's not completely the same story though. Palm Springs has a lot of good humorous scenes, and Andy Sambergs usual funny face and expressions are contributing to that. Since Brooklyn Nine-Nine I'm a fan of Andy Samberg, he has everything to become the new star comedian. And even if his previous movie Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping didn't leave me with a great impression this one is certainly a step forward. Palm Springs is for the fans of silly comedies, with a touch of romance, but it's not the typical romcom as for that the plot is also interesting to watch.

(Used in Edge of Tomorrow, Russian Doll etc.) This theme by its nature raises a number of interesting philosophical and existential questions. Palm Springs presupposes the viewer is already familiar with the formula and the main character is already well on his way into his groundhog journey. How many days exactly isn't quite clear at the start and the movie treats it as a bit of a joke and plot twist. But this sabotages viewer identification with Samberg's character, as it would make quite a difference in his attitude and degree of resignation, if it's his 1000th or 1000000th dayBy having the character already well on his way into his journey the movie skims over the by now familiar parts but it also robs the audience of a chance to grow together with the character's experiences.There is some innovation to the formula by adding more people to the loop, most significantly Cristin Milioti who almost saves the movie with her performance.At one point she uses her infinite time to learn quantum mechanics to attempt to break out of time loop. (Of course!) But the movie completely glosses over the complications that would arise by only having only a few hours each day to learn until it resets again.Another difference is that there's a way for other people to also get stuck in a loop. But wouldnt the ability of adding people to the loop, given infinite loops, eventually lead to everyone within 1 day traveling radius of the cave getting added to the loop. Thus negating one of the fundamentals of the loop? But this isn't really explored in any detail.Maybe I'm being too harsh since the opening half hour setting up the wedding day is pretty funny actually. You see Andy Samberg already operating at Bill Murray post-caring god-mode, unknown to the viewer at that time, owning at a wedding with a weird but charming impromptu speech.But the movie can't really make up it's mind between playing with groundhog days viewers expectations, or making a more sincere movie in the vein of it's precursor.

It wasn't hilarious like I thought it would be but I still enjoyed it. The narrative was fun, odd and it all clicked fantastically. I loved the scene where the lead male character did a calculated dance at the wedding to impress her, sadly there weren't enough scenes like that.

Its trailer advertises it as a comedy, and everyone on here calls it hilarious, but seriously I didn't even laugh once. It starts off as almost like a sci-fi horror movie ala You're Next meets Happy Death Day, but after those first 15 minutes, it becomes to drab and mundane.I really don't think I've seen more people cry in a supposed comedy. Every 5 minutes someone is either crying or teary-eyed. And there is no comedy at all to be found. It's not darkly funny, it's not silly funny, it's just overall not funny. At all. But it's also not sad either.It's not a total waste because it is beautifully shot and well acted, but those are about the only two good things I can say about this. I just don't get it.

It's got an anarchic anything goes vibe and a pair of vibrant actors, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who also happen to have a ton of chemistry together. It's a movie for our very troubled times and seems tailor made for a quarantined audience, where day bleeds into day and the repetition of the weekly grind is sending many of us to the loony bin. The sweet message at the center of this otherwise naughty film is that it's not the what we do that keeps us happy but rather the who we do it with. It's all about appreciating the little things that make life worth living moment to moment rather than focusing all of our energies on the big things that we chase at the risk of letting peace and contentment pass us right on by.This message is most effectively encapsulated in the character played by J.K. Simmons, who spends the first half of the movie trying to kill Andy Samberg and then has a great scene toward the end that makes the most mundane situation imaginable seem like a little piece of heaven. How I can relate to that right now.....Grade: A-"}, {"id": 329, "text": "Wow! This film was such a breath of fresh air. It's exactly the kind of film you need more of, during difficult times like these. The basic thread is borrowed from films such as Groundhog Day and Happy Death Day. However, thanks to the clever treatment of its core concept, the infectious chemistry between the leads Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, a solid supporting act from the ever-dependable J.K Simmons, and a brisk runtime of 90 minutes, Palm Springs is a winner all the way.Palm Springs will now be looked upon as one of the ingenious entries among films that deal with infinite time loops. More than being just a romantic comedy (which it is damn good at!), it also succeeds in putting forward relevant questions about life, relationships, routines, happy moments, and realizations. And most of them get answered too, within the film's context.Nyles (Samberg) and Sarah (Milioti) forge an unlikely connection on the latter's sister's wedding day. As Nyles and Sarah hook up, Roy (Simmons) shows up trying to murder Nyles and all 3 of them are drawn to a vortex that makes them relive the same day over and over. Palm Springs doesn't try to dig deep into the tedious scientific details of a time loop; writer Andy Siara and director Max Barbakow clearly know what they want to extract out of this idea.As a result, you get a rom-com that works well as a character study (Milioti is awesome; why don't we get to see her in more films?). Nyles has been in the loop longer and has grown to accept this repetition of events. Sarah, on the other hand, clearly was going through a lot (in terms of how she's perceived by her own family) and wants out of the loop. Roy is seen to be out occasionally seeking revenge against Nyles for bringing him into the loop. Do these characters attain closure the way they want? The film has some interesting tricks and laughs up its sleeve.Some of the humor stems from situations when the lead duo is trying to live it up while in time captivity but is not restricted to just that. Sarah is a well-written character as is Nyles, and the film benefits a lot from its quirky writing and energetic performances. Palm Springs is definitely a film that I'll watch again and I know I'll like it a lot more each time."}, {"id": 330, "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If you've been following me for a while, you know I'm not the biggest fan of rom-coms. It's not that I don't like the genre (I appreciate and enjoy every single one), but I find its movies tremendously difficult to *really* love. The massive majority follow the genre's formulas and cliches to such an extent that I rarely end up truly loving one of these films. Some are way too cheesy. Others are way too unrealistic and dream-like. But the aspect that throws me off the most is the lack of originality. I can't remember the last rom-com I watched that didn't borrow from countless other installments. I didn't know a thing about Palm Springs: no trailers, no knowledge of critics/audience's opinion, nothing... And I'm extremely happy about that!I usually watch the main trailer for every film I review *after* I've seen the actual movie. I ignore all other trailers, clips, images, and so on. I do this so I can have some sort of knowledge regarding how far I can take my spoiler-free reviews. This way, I'm sure that I don't write about something I shouldn't. The official trailer for this film doesn't ruin the experience in any way, but it does tell its viewers the most relevant aspect of its screenplay. So, I could address it in this review, but I won't... because I enjoyed this movie a lot more, not knowing a thing about it than if I knew how it developed its story.Therefore, I'll keep it really vague, and just write that Andy Siara's first feature-film screenplay can easily snatch a couple of nominations when the awards season comes around. This is a rom-com like no other due to its refreshingly unique concept. It's true that it's not an entirely new method of storytelling. Many other movies also employ this idea, but Siara holds so many surprises within his narrative and so few of the genre's common traits that the whole film is elevated by his outstanding writing.It's one of the most entertaining movies of the year. With a short runtime and a fast pace, Palm Springs is constantly being genuinely fun, engaging, and even mysteriously intriguing. Its original plot makes the viewer think and remember previous lines that take a whole different meaning a few minutes later. There are no predictably dumb narrative decisions, and its characters escape the cheesy and forced relationships that these films usually insert them in. The dialogues are hilariously captivating. Almost every single plot point packs an emotional punch, a jaw-dropping revelation that never crossed the viewer's mind.Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti share such great chemistry. Their characters are exceptionally developed, and their relationship feels incredibly real. I'm rarely that viewer who requires the main characters to be together, kiss, fall in love, and all that, but Nyles and Sarah are two wonderful protagonists I can definitely root for. Both carry an interesting baggage, which is also explored at a deep level. They deal very differently with the situation that the story puts them in, and it's so much fun to watch them go through it and evolve as characters. Oh, and J.K. Simmons (Roy)... this man doesn't know how not to be utterly remarkable!Max Barbakow (directorial debut) demonstrates his talents as well, by allowing Siara's screenplay to shine under impeccable direction. Tonally, it never loses its balance. It keeps its comedy pretty grounded, considering the craziness of its premise. It never relies on the genre's formulas, cliches, and cheesy outcomes. It really separates itself from the majority of modern rom-coms. I don't really have any flaws to point out... The ending does have a just accept it narrative component, and there are a couple of unnecessary scenes, but I'm nitpicking here.I can't believe I'm going to write this, but Palm Springs is not only one of the best rom-coms I've ever seen, but it's also one of the best (if not *the* best) movies of 2020, so far. With the help of their first-time director (Max Barbakow), Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti spread their extraordinary chemistry all over the innovative, original narrative, written by the also debutant, Andy Siara. The latter is undoubtedly the main responsible for such an entertaining film. Siara takes an imaginative concept and develops it in the most captivating, fun, hilarious, and even intriguing way possible. A surprising screenplay packed with emotionally impactful plot points, revelations, and twists that keep the enjoyment levels extremely high. The two protagonists are exceptionally developed, as well as their compelling relationship. With a fast pace and a perfect balance of its tone, Palm Springs sets itself apart from the other movies of the genre, staying away from all of the cliches, formulas, and stereotypes associated with it. J.K. Simmons also lends his awesomeness because why not? Whether you're a fan of rom-coms or not, I definitely suggest giving this one a look. You won't be disappointed!Rating: A"}, {"id": 331, "text": "I'm thankful to everyone for saying this was surprisingly good, because I don't think I would have given it a shot otherwise.Maybe the Groundhog Day formula will always be entertaining, because I'm yet to see a movie use the premise in a truly bad way (I'm sure there exist examples though). It's good enough that you almost wish it was longer, but I guess the 90-minute run time does help keep the movie fast and entertaining and never boring.I'm not sure it would exist without Groundhog Day, but it does a decent enough job at combining the premise with the genre of romantic comedy, leading to something that feels fresh enough.And it's just hugely entertaining to boot. If you sometimes have problems paying 100% attention to a movie you're watching at home (hate to admit it but that's me sometimes), then give this one a shot because it is super engaging.

The Brooklyn Nine-Nine star alongside Cristin Milioti (The Mother from HIMYM) dazzle as a pair of cynical wedding guests stuck in a time loop.Riding on the legendary coattails of Groundhog Day (1993), Director Max Barbakow still manages to surprise you with some amazing twists and dollops of laugh-out-loud moments, springing up at the places you least expect them to.Oscar-winner JK Simmons is brilliant as usual in a role that has very little screen time but makes a powerful impact.A perfect romantic comedy during these tough times. Highly recommended."}, {"id": 333, "text": "This movie was a fun and intriguing watch that was able to pull you in from the start. I've loved many of Andy Sambergs previous works, as well as Cristin Milioti, and the chemistry between them was undeniable.There were many things I loved such as the 80s themed music, beautiful cinematography, sarcastic comments between Samberg and Milioti, as well as the tender moments between the leads and the supporting cast. While this movie was great I did find certain scenes didn't flow as well, and there were a couple plot points that were easy to figure out early on, but I think those things are able to be overlooked with this type of movie.Overall, if you have Hulu (or even a drive in nearby that might be showing it) I highly recommend it. It has laughs, a likeable cast, and is a well done movie that should be watched during a year when movies have almost ceased to exist."}, {"id": 334, "text": "It's like I said, I love Groundhog Day (1993). I've seen it over a hundred times.... But, I enjoy time-travel movies in general, including the time-loop variety in the vein of that Bill Murray-Harold Ramis classic, such as Edge of Tomorrow (2014) and Netflix's Russian Doll series. Time travel is an inherently cinematic notion, of an art form that literally consists of moments in time--still images, shots and scenes--along a continuum--what used to be the film strip--that may be edited, rearranged and begun again, reviewed by the spectator ad infinitum. The main difference of Palm Springs, although it's partially a continuation of a thread from Russian Doll, is that it places multiple characters in the time loop instead of just the usual lone (and usually male) protagonist--to wake up in the same place on the same day every day, always at a wedding in Palm Springs. Thus, there are shifts in perspective running concurrent with the temporal repetition of events and place. Besides offering a greater gender balance to the rom-com formula, this opens up an array of possibilities in montage and storytelling.In this case, the bifurcated narrative is largely exploited for efficiency. I'd be fine lingering in such a scenario, a sense Murray gives us in Groundhog Day, with his various schemes and explorations of his situation. It's a fantasy that's well suited to the episodic format of Russian Doll. Unlike these prior efforts, however, Palm Springs rushes through and is able to do so because Andy Samberg's Nyles has been living this repeated plot for long before we caught up with him in the movie, and so he is able to quickly get Cristin Milioti's Sarah up to speed when she joins him in the repetition. Interestingly, the idea of beginning the picture with the male character having already re-lived the same day untold times was a feature of Danny Rubin's original screenplay for Groundhog Day, but Ramis altered this rather arthouse notion to an easier and more commercially-friendly beginning where we enter the time loop at the same moment with Murray. Palm Springs is able to have it both ways.Neither does Palm Spring afford much space to philosophical or religious musings. Indeed, Nyles declares on the first night we meet him that there's no god. Even the supposed quantum physics within the picture doesn't rise above the sophistication of an installment from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ultimately, Palm Springs is merely a place we're meant to inhabit fleetingly, for some laughs and the clich\u00e9 love story conquering all. Some critics are surely tempted to analogize this version with the unraveling of habit and structure making days seemingly run into each other--losing track of time--for many in the real world of 2020 by isolating themselves or otherwise limiting their activities due to the pandemic, but the timing here is as accidental as that for the characters within the movie. No, Palm Springs is a lovely fantasy, where death is a reset button and where one feels more freedom than ever without the threat of tomorrow, as well as to experience it safely with others. There's no meaning underlying this romp beyond the hackneyed wholesomeness of family life provided by J.K. Simmons's Roy and romantic coupling that's the foundation of the entire premise. That's fine; fun need not always be wrapped in layers of existential profundity--a shaggy dog story will do. Some days are well enough by just enjoying the slight variations to the same format. I'll see Palm Springs again."}, {"id": 335, "text": "I'm a sucker for time-loop / time-travel type movies, and so was always going to enjoy this.

The last thing I have to say is the exploitation of Simons' character as a man who is tired of living his life but at least has to raised? two little childs cause of one Mai Thai left condom. The relationship between Nyles and Roy could be the same Alan Parrish and Van Pelt in Jumanji (1995). Just because we don't know what happened between the last two.

When I started watching Palm Springs I didn't initially sense that it was that type of film but when it was I was hoping for something that would use the aforementioned formula will. With its twists and sharp writing, Palm Springs absolutely works and remains fresh the entire 90 minutes of its running length. The film is about a wedding and two guests of the wedding that find themselves in a magical cave, once they go near the light in the cave they are doomed to repeat the day over and over. Anyone who interacts with this cave find themselves knowing about their predicament. The pair find out secrets about themselves and have fun with their situation but ultimately need to find a way out of their repetitive situation. The film stars Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti. The film takes the Groundhog Day formula of the never ending day and twists it. Now instead of following one person who has to deal with being the only one who knows about what happens on the repetitive day, we have multiple characters. This brings a lot of fun and the script can have fun with this unique test on a tried formula. That's what makes it fun. There's enough light twists and turns that make it worthwhile and the chemistry of the leading pair really does help with the quality of the film. Palm Springs does a good job of taking something we know and changing it just enough to keep you guessing and having fun with itself and its characters. I like Andy Samberg as a lead in films, he has a humorous charm that can make a bad film worth watching. Palm Springs is a strong Hulu original film and the best one I've seen so far on this streaming platform. 7.5/10"}, {"id": 340, "text": "I'll be honest, I've been getting a little burned out on the resurgence of the Groundhog Day style movies. It's not that they're all bad, I've actually enjoyed a few of them but there's been such an influx of them lately I'm just... Not super into it. That said, really enjoy Samberg and the Lonely Island guys and Brooklyn 99, so I was a bit conflicted on this one.Absolutely surprised me with how good it was. It plays with hilarious comedy and moving somber notes so well throughout. It embraces and challenges the Groundhog Day theme wonderfully. Samberg even plays a more toned down character and it's still exceptional. Oh, and J.K. Simmons? Even more wonderful than usual.For me, the only down note is Cristin Milioti. I didn't feel like she struck the right balance with her character. With Samberg playing more reserved, I would have loved for her to be the crazy one or maybe even the super nice one, something to work with Samberg's performance and instead I feel like she lands right in the middle and... She's not bad but doesn't quite shine either. There's a possibility that she's just not for me though, because I didn't love her in How I Met Your Mother either.They were also clearly on a weird budget because some of the locations look pretty fancy, but the few special effects looked dreadful to me. I don't expect blockbuster effects from a movie like this but we've been doing CGI fire for a while now and I feel like it should be possible to make that look half-decent on a budget. Still, that's a small thing.This is an absolute recommend for me. This was a lot of fun and even my negatives aren't a huge detractor here. Throw in the fact that it's streaming right now on Hulu and this is a readily available movie that everyone should check out."}, {"id": 341, "text": "Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend, especially for fans of time shifting tropes.Time shifting is where your mind goes back in time, but not your body. Essentially everything resets like a save point, except your have all this knowledge.Time shifting was made popular by Groundhog's Day and there have been several movies that mainly consist of dying / sleeping and repeating like a video game, and this isn't THAT different with a few exceptions that make all the difference in the experience.Andy Samberg (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) finally steps up and shows everyone that he can do a somewhat serious role, and not just a straight man. Cristin Milioti (How I Met Your Mother) does an excellent job in her lead role, with a great supporting cast, to include J.K. Simmons (Cave Johnson) leading a wonderful supporting cast, except for Tyler Hoechlin (CW Superman: Supergirl, Flash, etc.), who I might just not like because he was Superman, but it's supposed to be an disliked character...so....good job?The medium of the transfer being shown is an interesting option as we saw in the Happy Death Day movies, but it does allow for a reasoning of how it works, can it be broken / manipulated as opposed to divine will. Most importantly, it allows for more than just one subject being affected, which is really where it gets set apart.The trope bleeds a little when you have multiple people trapped in the loop: you have multiple people trapped in a thing: you have multiple people trapped in a prison. When multiple people are trapped in a environment together, they tend to get a little strange, and we get that sort of thing a plenty. Because we have multiple story threads to follow, we're almost seeing 3 stories all overlapping, and the movie does a great job of showing those, whether or not their in chronological order, or happening at the same time.Whether you see it as a prison break movie, or a time loop movie, this movie has a lot of fun in it, along with deep metaphysical philosophy, so there is something for everyone."}, {"id": 342, "text": "The 'Groundhog Day' scenario is starting to be used in films more and more I've noticed. 'Happy Death Day' took a crack at - and it went extremely well. 'Before I Fall' also used it - with slightly less successful results. And now 'Palm Springs' has used it. Ironically the only one of those films I haven't seen is 'Groundhog Day'. I absolutely loved 'Palm Springs'. The concept worked perfectly here, and they worked the concept perfectly. It was funny, touching, thought-provoking and inventive. It never felt like it was stepping on anyone's toes either. It just worked.The cast are a big part of what made this so great. Andy Samberg for starters nailed the lead role. He was endlessly likeable, relatable and hilarious (without turning it into a full-blown comedy). It's hard to imagine many actors playing this role as well as he did. Also Cristin Milioti deserves almost an equal amount of credit. She had to make us fall in love with her (despite being quite a flawed character in a lot of ways) so that we would buy Samberg's character falling for her. And she pulled it off and then some. Finally, J.K. Simmons was a great addition to the film. He actually isn't given a whole lot to do, but what he is given to work with he utilises extremely well.I love that the film made you question yourself over whether the scenario would be good to have happen to you or not. Personally, I would absolutely love every minute of it. I could live the same day over and over for 1000 years quite happily. But I understand why a lot of people wouldn't like that too. 'Palm Springs' was an incredibly enjoyable film to watch and one I would highly recommend you check out if you haven't already."}, {"id": 343, "text": "That's it. I don't think there is a better complement to give here, is insane. They've managed to re shaped, and tell such a refreshing story, in a genre that can be so repetitive most of times. Don't get me wrong, some of my favorite movies of all time are rom-coms, but this is different from everything I have ever seen. A movie doesn't need to be completely different from everything that came before in order to be great, but when they are, it feels... fulfilling (if that makes sense).If you've seen the trailer for the movie, you know what the movie is about. Basically, two people, getting to know each other, in ridiculously stupid situations while stuck in a time loop (actually, it would be at least interesting the experience of seen this movie without any previous knowledge, just thinking is a regular romantic comedy).And well, they delivered, Andy Samberg is my man, I love the guy, I love Brooklyn 9-9, and I've been closely watching almost everything he does for the past few years, and he rocks, always funny, a great comedian and actor. Cristin Milioti is also great here, some of my biggest laughs in the film were on her scenes (like the first scene in the desert, when Nyles gets shot and she goes wtf?! wtf!?, is so genuine! J.K. Simmons, is also here, he isn't in the movie that much, but when he is, he's great, as always.Anyway, to sum up, the movie is great, is refreshing, is so damn funny, the story is great, the dialogue is great, the direction, everything about it is great. Sure, you could point out that their way out isn't that believable, but c'mon, they've earned cause of how innovative, and smart the whole storyline of the movie is. So, that's it, Palm Springs is an amazingly funny rom-com that takes place in a time loop, and that's a phrase I never thought I would say, but I'm glad I'm saying now.Before I forget: One other good thing I thought about it, is that I thought cause I already knew about the time loop thing, that the first third of the movie or something would be useless, and boring, but it wasn't!

While the film is built upon traditional romcom scaffolding its characters and their balancing of hilarious moments with honest and authentic underlying feelings of loneliness elevates the genre. Palm Springs is near perfect at accomplishing what it set out to be.Andy Samberg (Nyles) has been stuck in a repeating wedding day time loop for an eternity, when by chance, Cristin Milioti (Sarah) becomes unknowingly trapped with him. Samberg uses his comedic background as a well executed shield for Nyle's nihilism for the situation he has found himself in. Miloti faces her own challenges and plays off of Samberg's quirkiness acceptance of this bizarre situation fantastically. But Samberg and Milioti's back and forth is more than well executed hilarious moments, they punch upwards towards exploring our interconnections.While I did not care for how the time loop was addressed, Palm Springs is not a film about escaping a never ending repeating day. Palm Springs authentically addresses the feelings of loneliness in a world we sometimes feel we have no control over with leviety. One of the best films 0f 2020."}, {"id": 345, "text": "Palm Springs isn't the best film of 2020 so far, but it's one of the most purely entertaining experiences I have had in quite some time.It's labelled as a comedy, but one of my problems with the film is that it's not as consistently funny as I would have liked. There are some humorous moments, and most of them land, but there weren't as many gut-busters as a film like this could have done with.However, this didn't bother me too much because it was replaced with deep, complex questions, and a narrative that was far too clever than a film like this had any right to be.The script was sharp, and the characters were fleshed-out. Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, and J.K. Simmons were fantastic in their roles, and the film is carried on their shoulders and the predicaments they find themselves in.The pacing wasn't the strongest, which is a little concerning for a film which clocks in at less than 90 minutes, but there was a section in the middle which I could have done without. There was some nice development of the Roy character, but I still felt like everything else ground to a halt for a while.Fortunately, the film picked up again and the last act was incredible exciting. It challenges the audience with complex questions, whilst being entertaining and powerful at the same time.Although we have seen films using time-loop elements before, including classics such as Groundhog Day, I still felt like Palm Springs was an original take on this formula and it gets a strong recommendation from me.SCORE: 90%"}, {"id": 346, "text": "In the genre of rom-coms, Palm Springs stimulates an atypical arousal, satisfying even the most strongest skeptics. Andy Samberg, a national treasure, delightfully and whimsically whisks you away into a journey worth repeating.Most rom-coms have a familar recipe: boy and girl meet through a circumstance. Followed by a chase of sorts filled with infatuation, frustration, sadness, acceptance, and ultimately relief. Viewers pray and hope for a happy ending. There is nothing wrong with this recipe except for the torture of cheesy dialogue, lack of chemistry, and unfulfilling plotlines. Nyles (the boy) and Sarah (the girl) achieve remarkable chemistry; hilariously wrestling with the past, present, and future.For any couple struggling to find a Thursday night rom-com, we recommend Palm Springs, paired with a favorite offering of aged boxed wine and sliced American cheese. Cheers!"}, {"id": 347, "text": "Palm Springs is the typical romantic comedy meets Groundhog Day. The trailer is very indicative of the tone and style of the movie. Yet it is not overtly explicit and leaves out some nice surprises.It is hard not to love this movie. Not only because it is funny but also because it is sweet. The movie operates on a Groundhog Day(GD), time-loop, premise. Andy Samberg relives the same day over and over. Then, things become complicated when Cristin Milioti is dragged with him to live on the same day forever.It is interesting that GD has become the canon of time-loop movies. Not that it is a bad movie, but it feels very quaint. It works more as a modern day fairytale than anything. And it revolves entirely on Bill Murray and on his own desires and impulses. Bill Murray breaks the spell when he grows out of being a jerk. Obviously it is a movie from another decade, but you can see the same mechanics in Edge of Tomorrow.Palm Springs starts almost where GD ends. Andy Samberg has already mastered the world and himself too, to a certain extent. He starts with the nihilistic hedonistic worldview. This leads me to consider actually Milioti as the protagonist. This movie is GD from a woman's perspective. But not in a hacky Oceans Eight way. It takes the absurdity seriously, and builds on it to deliver a powerful story. I loved that the first thing she does is trying to get out of the situation. And later on her whole character arc is not dependent on the actions of someone else, but it her willpower to fix the situation herself. Her arc is that she actually does get out of the time-loop. It is refreshing to see that dynamic in these types of movies.Of course, for all the movie's psychological and meta-physical themes it does stay firmly in the rom-com genre, with a light emphasis on comedy. The topics of the purpose of life are secondary to the tropes: they meet, they fight, they go back together after having learned something. Yet, I don't necessarily hate that . It makes for a charming movie. My only complaint is that there is not enough JK Simmons. He ends up having a smaller role than the trailer suggested. But it is not all that bad, in return the movie focuses on the romance between the two leads.And I think that is the charm of the movie. It is smart, but it is not heavy. The story is character driven but it also allows for gags and funny setups. It is similar to Love Wedding Repeat, premise-wise. However, it left me with an even better feeling, which might be result of a more focused story, more out-loud comedic tone and some of the greatest comedy actors. Not that they had bad actors, but hey were mostly unknown and British. Here Samberg and Milioti carry the movie to the highest levels."}, {"id": 348, "text": "Once you've seen one time loop movie, in many ways you have seen them all but this years Sundance Film Festival hit Palm Springs, where the film was bought by streaming service Hulu for a mind-blowing 17,500 000 (a Sundance record), is an extremely enjoyable ride that makes a star out of its co-star Cristin Milioti in the process.Directed by debut feature film director Max Barbakow, Springs is a sun-soaked romantic comedy with a sci-fi/time loop twist as Andy Samberg's long-suffering and carefree Nyles finds himself living out a particular day in Palm Springs over and over, an experience that leads him to find solace in drink, the threat of being hunted by J.K Simmons jaded fellow loop sufferer Roy and most importantly the friendship he strikes up with Milioti's newly looped Sarah.There's lots of instances where Springs feels familiar and lots of beats it plays out that are to be expected from such an affair but Barbakow (working off a great script by Andy Siara) and his two lead performers inject a hearty dosage of soul and charm into much of the films elements ensuring that we as an audience are constantly given laughs and even in many ways emotionally resonate feelings as Nyles and Sarah's relationships grows.In what's by far his best lead turn in anything outside of the likes of the great but low-brow Lonely Island backed Hot Rod and Popstar and his work in TV hit Brooklyn 99, Samberg shows there is more to the man than objects in boxes and pants mishaps as he brings Nyles to life.The real joy however is his interplay with Milioti who shines as the flawed but affable Sarah.A long serving performer in TV and movie parts, Milioti is a revelation as Sarah. She shares great comedic timing with Samberg and as the two begin to explore their repetitive new lives and decide to live it up, the film really hits a strong groove that while culminating in a little bit of a so-so final stretch, is extremely entertaining while it lasts in the films particularly memorable middle section.There's no doubt that we will be seeing a lot of Milioti from now on in, with Hollywood sure to be knocking down her door.Final Say -It doesn't reinvent the time loop wheel and has moments where it coasts along but Palm Springs is a mightily enjoyable ride when everything clicks and will work wonders for the futures of its two on fire lead performers.3 1/2 dinosaurs out of 5"}, {"id": 349, "text": "In the times when there's a renewed wish to read Orwell's dystopian novel 1984, or watch that movie or other movies like clockwork orange that depict complete pandemonium (Infact whats also a part of sentiments these days are sci-fi movies on contagion), I chose to watch Palm Springs.

Two strangers Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) stuck in a time loop, repeating the wedding day over and over...Palm Springs is about this two strangers how they fall in love in this bizarre scenario and finding ways to escape the time loop. Will they succeed or they will be stuck for eternity?Review: Premise of palm springs is nothing new its  one of those infinite time loop situations you might have heard of and maybe you saw a couple of movies similar to it. Whats interesting in this movie is the two witty characters Nyles and Sarah, their absurd comedy, weird moments, and how they find joy rather than suffering on the wedding day that they both hate to live in, because of (Spoiler) past. And eventually they falls in love.Nyles is a carefree guy, he gave up escaping after many many time loops and then masters the several ways to entertain himself, enjoys his life like there is no tomorrow (literally for him there is no tomorrow, so he had no choice). On the other hand sarah, she is the sister of the bride and has some issues... somehow, when she dragged into the mess of this time loop, where the fun begins in the movie. She tries to escape this time loop numerous times, failing every time. Such as driving back to her hometown and still waking up in palm springs the same wedding day. Slowly she sees logic in nyles philosophy of enjoying life. And as seen in the trailer they party, dance, drinks tries all sorts of fun happy stuff. The bond and chemistry between Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti is really good, definitely carries this movie and makes a very watchable. Even with the little screen time J.K. Simmons stole scenes he in it, he was hilarious. progression of the story and the characterization through the same day makes us curious and interesting in every loop.Cons: The main problem i had is that it skips the pivotal moments like the character transformation and the resolution for change is not that believable. Palm springs plays in the safe side, it never takes risks, it never gets serious it sticks to the cheesy comedy (which is great in first 40 minutes, after that, it didn't work for me). the ending could have been better. And off course the horrible CGI.Verdict: With a low budget 5 million US dollars and with just 90 minutes of fast-paced comedy in the genre of the time loop that we all love about, i think its hard to hate Palm Springs its quite entertaining. I had a good time watching this movie. Don't expect too much just lay back and enjoy the movie. My Rating 6.5/10Other movie recommendations: If you liked this movie then definitely check Groundhog day (1993) movie, a classic which started this whole time loop genre. If you're into sci-fi action want to see some bullets , then Check Edge of Tomorrow (2014). or try experiment with your taste by Source Code (2011).

While that was partially correct, this movie proved to be so much more.First of all, the time loop shtick. I didn't know that was what was gonna happen, and I was slightly apprehensive at first, but it was great. After movies like Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow and Happy Death Day, you'd think this trope was played out, but far from it.This movie works extremely well, and I just have to repeat how much better it was than I expected. Samberg and Milioti work well off each other, and their comedic scenes are but one of the highlights in the movie. What impressed me the most, were the philosophical questions the movie threw in without expectation. In between the comedic scenes, acted out by two characters who literally live without consequences, there are deep questions about living, death, love and the very difficult matter of having to live in the same day on a loop...All in all, this movie is just so much more than what it appeared to be on its surface.

Nyles though is also an awesome drunk, an activity he indulges in marvellously and one that helps him meet Sarah (Cristin Milioti).

The guy with the bow is Roy (JK Simmons), a guy from Nyles' past who is not too pleased with him cursing him to a repetitive world reminiscent of Groundhog Day. See, not average. Y'see Nyles is trapped in a loop, living the same day over and over. He's done all the things Bill Murray did, but we're not witness to that and this film isn't really about redemption. This is about Nyles dragging Sarah into the loop. Now it's not super original, but it is fun and both Samberg and Milioti are great to watch. He's the old pro, she's the novice. It's largely stupid, switch your brain off stuff as the two find humourous and frivolous ways to pass the endless day(s), but there's an obvious event coming in their future. Falling for one another. Something that throws them both off what had become a comfortable path. It's still a bit derivative, but it's well constructed and despite a dodgy montage where Sarah learns quantum mechanics it's really quite engaging.

He should stick to being funny and not serious but I get he would want to show some range in acting. The rest of the cast is okay. Nothing special (except Simmons of course) and nothing memorable from the acting perspective.It's a perfect length at about 90 minutes. Unless it's a masterpiece, spending more than 90 minutes on a movie is hard to justify. It's about 1 hour 24 minutes or there abouts after the intro and end credits so it's not a lot of time invested.I would recommend watching it once just to say you watched and think of all the things they could have done in the movie. When I see a movie like this or Groundhog Day (with this one being rated R ) I imagine they could do far worse things with all the time they spend in the universe.

There are plenty of funny bits, including a brilliant sight gag in which Samberg's Nyles (boyfriend to a bridesmaid) threads his way across the dance floor to first approach Milioti's Sarah (the maid of honor), but where Palm Springs falls short is in the substance category.The two protagonists aren't particularly fleshed out - we never really learn if Nyles became disaffected before winding up in one of those infinite time loop situations you might have heard of or because of it - nevermind the rest of the characters, almost none of which I can remember with the clarity I can picture, say, Ned Ryerson from Groundhog Day. Samberg succeeds at making Nyles's go-with-the-flow nihilism charming; Milioti makes you feel Sarah's emotional baggage but also spends a lot of time just looking incredulous or overacting.The film falls short in the humanity department, which makes its saccharine ending feel particularly vacuous.

Instead, it becomes another victim of the Coronavirus outbreak and is demoted to the small screen streamed to subscribers who can view it repeatedly in their homes at their own enjoyment and pace. It is a delightful modern-day romp in any format.Having more than a passing acquittance to Howard Ramis' 1993 comedy classic, Groundhog Day, we first meet Nyles (Andy Samburg, channeling his best Bill Murray's cynicism). He has been caught in this time warp after being drawn into a cave's mysterious vortex that carries him into another time dimension in which he is doomed to repeat daily events. This quantum anomaly brings Nyles into a never-ending wedding setting that also introduces us to Sarah (a delightful Cristin Milioti), the maid-of-honor. Sarah is the always the unhappy bridesmaid type. She get entangled in the time fold as these two misfit strangers slowly become a couple. Trapped together, they unite to try to escape the drudgery of their frequent recurrences.Solidly directed by Max Barbakow, in an impressive debut, the film adeptly sets in motion a series of incidents that replay with some slight variations. The screenplay by Andy Siara gets a bit too existential in its philosophic debate about the meaningless of life and its little things that make up our days. Still the script is smart and more intelligent than your average rom/com as it plays with the high level concepts of quantum physics, time loops, and screwball comedy. One wishes the script had given the supporting characters more depth and interaction rather than only serving them up as plot devices to advance the central love story.Adding to the pleasure of this sweet story of two aimless people who suddenly discover a purpose in life are the film's two lead actors. They are totally charming and completely convincing in their funny roles. Mr. Samberg has played this man-child character before, but he has never been this endearing. He plays Nyles as an insufferable and sarcastic chump, a beer-guzzling and self-defeating dupe unaware of life's subtle lessons. Early on in the movie, there is a lovely well-stage dance number that clearly shows the endless repeats of his daily existence as he makes his way across the dance floor with a series of rote moves that quickly establishes his dilemma. His callous attitude counteracts with Sarah's bumbling disregard of her own self-worth. She is the black sheep of the family, more interested in surviving the hours than truly living them. Ms Milioti's is a delightful foil, generating charisma and star wattage in her role as the hapless loser.Mr. Barbakow has assembled a deft cast to tell his tale which includes such fine veteran performers as Peter Gallagher, Dale Dickey, and June Scribb, all who need more screen time with their under-developed characters. J. K. Simmons does become an interesting third-wheel as Roy, a resentful old codger who is also trapped in the loop, but again, his character remains too disposable and sketchy.Palm Springs celebrates the perfect and the imperfect things of life with gentle authority and a great deal of humor. How many films can serve up this much fun during these COVID days when we ourselves are destined to repeat our own daily actions as well?"}, {"id": 359, "text": "I have always been a sucker for infinite time loop movies such as Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow. So I was already thrilled to see this movie and it was getting a lot of praise from all the critics. There was just one problem I've had when thinking of watching this movie. I am not a big fan of romcoms...Let's start with some of the praises I have with this movie. Firstly, one of the important aspects of a romcom is the chemistry between the two leads. In this case, Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah Wilder (Cristin Millioti) have great chemistry that is charming and effective. There are so many great moments between the two and seeing both of them perform silly antics such as a well-choreographed dance number is funny yet heartwarming. There are also strong performances from the supporting cast who play annoying over the top people to the point you can sort of see where the main leads point come from. Roy (JK Simmons) is the most relevant supporting cast as he is the third time looper and it is great to see him give a more wacky performance but I do feel he is sort of underutilised. Although, the main focus is on the main leads and in that case the lack of focus on supporting characters works in the movie's favour.Another praise is that they found a unique way to tackle the time loop genre that differentiates itself from the other time loop comedy Groundhog Day. Right from the get-go, it is obvious to us the audience that Nyles (Andy Samberg) has been in a long time loop and we are not learning about the loop with him but from him. Additionally, having multiple individuals in the time loop together allows for it to go in a unique direction. The director and writers utilising the time loop to show the relationship between the main leads developing and growing as individuals is fun to watch and sincere. They also use the time loop to as a plot device for surprise twist and revelations and the film certainly has a lot of great twists.Now onto flaws of the movie and the first comes straight away in the first 10 minutes and it is how raunchy it is. The trailer for the movie made it seem like a sincere and heartwarming time loop romcom, which it is to be fair it is, but this movie is extremely R Rated with it's over the top sex scenes that made me question if I was even watching the movie that was advertised. It gives a wrong first impression of the movie and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if someone stopped watching after the first 5 minutes because of how stupid and unnecessary these scenes are. I finished the movie and I still didn't get what these added to the movie. The answer is that it didn't and I question why they thought it was a great idea.The second flaw I have got to say is that this movie is defined as a romantic comedy and there are a lot of great romantic moments but honestly no moments that made me laugh out loud. They do a fair amount of The Lonely Island raunchy sex jokes but even then I still didn't find it funny. I got a couple of chuckles in some moments but none stuck out as memorable in the comedy department.Overall, it is a surprisingly very good movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it but not to the extent of how everyone in the media felt about the movie. The most important aspect in a romance movie is to get the audience to root for the main couple and this movie succeeds in this case. The movie is a great time if you ignore the first 10 minutes and you will no doubt come out enjoying it."}, {"id": 360, "text": "Starts off strong and kinda works itself into a romcom corner that it never really pulls out of or makes proper use of.As weird and disjointed as the actual... backdrop for the whole thing is, they mostly make it work for them. It's fun. Loved the bit with the bomb and the cake and the bow and arrow...At some point it's like they decided, ok the story has gone on long enough, we've made our jokes and milked this goat, let's just paste together some kind of ending and walk away. 3.2 seconds whaaaaat?...Despite this, I still give it a relatively high rating of 7, and that's because well, great acting, a lot of the jokes are good, and there's even some wisdom at odd moments.Also, while the romantic component felt well forced to me, it was thankfully not dominant and once it really got going was quick to... conclude..."}, {"id": 361, "text": "It is hard to write about Palm Springs, without comparing it to the classic 1993 Harald Ramis film Groundhog Day. I don't think the comparison is unfair - I have no doubt that the Palm Springs script writers watched Groundhog Day and realized there was still a lot of unexplored potential in the main plot device. The characters are stuck in a time loop. Whatever they do, when they sleep or die they just wake up at the beginning of the same day.The main innovation in Palm Springs is that when Sarah (Cristin Milioti) gets trapped in the time loop, she has Nyles (Andy Samburg) to act as her guide. Nyles has been trapped in the loop for a long time, and he is able to show Sarah how to pleasurably frit away her unlimited time. Having two people in the loop allows for both new hijinx, hilarious banter, and more characters to development. In the time loop genre, only the characters who repeat days can really grow.Palm Springs succeeds as a fun, unassuming comedy film, but it doesn't have the lasting impact of Groundhog Day. What made Groundhog Day memorable was the growth of Bill Murray's character from a self-obsessed misanthrope into a generous community man. Groundhog Day is a funny movie, but the movie isn't really about the laughs.Palm Springs is the opposite. There is some character growth, some minor plot twists, and a Deus-ex-machina ending to tie things up. But the story is secondary to the comic set pieces. There are some great gags in Palm Springs. I laughed out loud several times. Both Samburg and Milioti shine during the zaniest moments. Both are natural comic actors, and both their acting and the script provide lots of entertainment.The humor is also much raunchier than in Groundhog Day. Sex and drugs are major elements, and the language is definitely adult. It was the perfect film for a date night with my wife. It was light and funny, and made for a fun end to our evening. Then we went home, and fell asleep, and in a year I'm sure we won't remember a thing about it."}, {"id": 362, "text": "I was worried this would be another oh no! This groundhog day syndrome is making me feel crazy movie. I'm happy to say that it's not. It still falls into a few of the same beats, however. The characters predict events and words before they happen and eventually want to find a way out of the loop. But the bulk of the movie feels fresh.It takes a spin on the concept by letting the characters mess with all other people at the wedding, which is hilarious. And by the end it seems to be even more thoughtful than most other movies with the same premise. It touches on hedonism and love as a life motivator in a way that may be fairly shallow, but is still sweet and appreciated.Andy Sandberg and Cristin Milioti are funny as hell and work well together as a comedy duo. They really pull the whole thing together. Without them this whole movie probably wouldn't have been as good. The way the film is shot is a little dull apart from a few interesting aerial shots and the cave scenes. What really kept me interested was the chemistry between the leads and the fun script."}, {"id": 363, "text": "This is legitimately one of the best comedies I've ever seen. Andy Samberg is always a favorite for me. I love Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I love Lonely Island, I loved his run on SNL. Still, I walked in with some skepticism. Groundhog Day is hardly the road less traveled, so I had modest hopes. I wasn't prepared.I'll start with this: chemistry. The one thing that will keep me interested when all else fails is the cast's chemistry. If I'm engrossed in two characters sitting and talking with naught else happening, there's something there.Also, the movie managed to get something fresh into the mix: multiple loopers. I'm not going to say it's never happened, but I haven't seen it yet. I liked it.I would throw some shade at the protagonists fight before the climax cliche, but... if I knocked points off for that, there'd only be three movies in the world.9.8/10"}, {"id": 364, "text": "HOLY CRAP DID I LOVE THIS MOVIE. That one sentenced was the only thing that was going through my head after I finished watching this movie tonight at my local drive in theater with a couple of friends. My excitement for this movie I would say was very high because of how original and fresh the concept looked, yes the time loop concept has been beat to death but I don't think I have ever seen a time loop love story before which was very unique. But the story isn't the only positive thing this movie has to offer. The whole cast is extremely good and funny, yes samberg is good as usual but the main standout here is cristian Milioti who steals every scene she is in. The movie is also extremely fun and had me laughing out loud many times and honestly had me close to tears. The music is also very good. The twist and turns this movie also takes are also very unpredictable and had me Quite shocked a couple times. I honestly have no cons with this movie at all. Overall, I loved Palm Springs and it's a movie I can see me watching again and again, if this movie looked at all interesting to you I would say for sure give it a try because it's for sure worth your time."}, {"id": 365, "text": "'Palm Springs' directed by Max Barbakow (incredibly at his first feature film) is for me the good surprise of the end of this strange cinematic year 2020. It is also a film that proves once again, if necessary, to skeptics and cynics that there are entertainment films and romantic comedies that do not insult the intelligence of viewers, and that 'feel good' movies can contain a dose of fantastic (and even references to quantum mechanics). The premiere of 'Palm Springs' took place at the Sundance Film Festival, after which the movie was supposed to be screened in theaters, but then the world froze and same as many other productions Barbakow's film had to find a streaming platform as its main broadcast channel. I'm so sorry for their missed opportunity, because this funny movie would have had good chances to be the big surprise and maybe even one of the blockbusters of the summer of 2020. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had other plans.The film begins with the awakening of Nyles (Andy Samberg), on a sunny morning in a resort in the middle of the desert, where he accompanies his (not very committed) girlfriend to the wedding where she is the bridesmaid. Nyles, a rather non-conformist guy, almost ruins the party with an impromptu speech influenced by intense drinking at the bar, and later in the nighr he he meets Sarah (Cristin Milioti), the bride's sister and the family's 'black sheep'. The two seem to have a 'click' that will take them to the desert at night where the beginning of a sexual encounter is interrupted by an event ... and here I stop telling more about the story so as to avoid falling into the sin of spoiling.What happens next is a combination of crazy and romantic, fantasy and clever comedy. Many comments on the film mention that the inspiration comes from 'Groundhog Day', a film I have not seen. What I can say is that I did not find any logical flaw in the script written by Andy Siara, who manages to give credibility to the pretext and substance of the characters, makes us viewers care about them, and even adds a touch of science with which the heroes will come out from a complicated situation. I didn't know the two lead actors or I don't remember them from other movies, but they both manage to win our empathy. J.K. Simmons, an actor we know from countless television series, is distributed here in a very different and original role. 'Palm Springs' is one of the best entertainments of the year, a kind and smart movie that I warmly recommend. It's fun."}, {"id": 366, "text": "I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedy genre, but Palm Springs is something extraordinary in this genre, especially because of implementation of ''soft'' sci-fi elements. I didn't expect that I will be so much impressed by this film. I thought it will be typical romantic comedy, with classic drama made by main characters, but I was positively surprised it wasn't something like that.Story is interesting right away from the start, and it keeps you interested until the end, which is quite rare for me to find in this genre. It doesn't use any clich\u00e9, and makes new, positive and funny elements into the story. All of actors deliver amazing performance and casting is very fitting to the roles. Setting and scenery is also good, I doubt it would have similiar impact if they changed it to some other location. Direction and pacing are well done, I never felt that movie looks weird or it is very fast or very slow.In conclusion, Palm Springs is a romantic comedy movie that you definitely should watch, it has everything that you need to enjoy: good story with refreshing elements added to it, beautiful setting, amazing actors, it keeps you interested and delivers fitting end, all of that with enjoyable pacing."}, {"id": 367, "text": "Time to come clean, I've never been an Andy Sanberg fan. Almost every time he's involved in something he's been unlikable in one way or another. Here though, he may be my favorite part. He gives a surprisingly restrained performance, only doing his normal loud guy schtick a few times. I like his character on the whole. The film is basically another ground hogs day where he is trapped in a time loop before another girl gets stuck with him. So he's incredibly jaded and nihilistic having spent an eternity in this time loop. Almost everything else though, is kinda blah. His love interest is, of course, the girl he gets stuck with, Sarah. Which is a stupid obvious plot point even if it's mostly well done. The worst part about this romance is, unfortunately, Sarah. Her character almost exclusively is a childish baby that can't deal with her problems. She's attractive but that's sorta it for her. However, there's another person stuck in this time loop, JK Simmons. Who wants to take revenge on Sandberg for trapping him in this loop. He isn't exactly a compelling character and only exists to have a nice little moment of clarity with Sandberg to explain the themes to him. Which encapsulates the story as whole honestly. It isn't breaking new ground or really trying anything new at all. The majority is just the romance plot until the inevitable, 3rd act low point that is meant to throw these characters apart. It really isn't that well developed and the twist that leads to it is painfully obvious. Then there's a whole plot that comes up directly at the end where the characters attempt to leave the time loop using science. It's just another thing that feels tacked onto this story. The humor too is something I can't say I liked. I got a few laughs from this, that's about it. The rest feels a bit low brow. I can't say I disliked this on the whole, but I enjoyed the character driven story. Especially the Sandberg character. Other then that I found it rather bland. It's not particularly well made or shot, in fact some parts are kinda ugly. I was constantly wishing for more out of the story and every plot point feels forced or obvious in one way or another. I didn't hate it, but ima forget it pretty soon. Better then that awful Marlon Waynes Naked movie everyone has already forgotten about."}, {"id": 368, "text": "This movie steals on a large scale from another movie called Happy Death Day 2U . It even without guilt relate the reason behind this time loop to the Quantum theory (Where Hollywood decided blaming every thing lately on it despite being irrelevant just because it's some vague theory and few people understand it) which is exactly what Happy Death Day 2U established to justify time loops .I could have marked dozens of other similarity but yet I like sticking to my format of reviews of minimal to no spoilers .As for the movie itself , the pace is not boring , it did not play on being repetitive as all time loops movies like to , but still , you do not get quite engaged enough nor care what happens next as a result of all characters being developed so you hate them .So bottom line if you haven't watched Happy Death Day 2U this one might seem okey , but if you did , then the value of entertainment this one gives becomes minimal .P.S Deus Ex Quantum is a claimed propitiatory by me , do not abuse it or else ."}, {"id": 369, "text": "I watched many stuff by Andy Samberg, and I personally think that through the years he was always able to bring on screen fresh and funny stuff on screen, Palm Springs is no exception, but in this case his role feel more complex and complete, compared to other characters that he played. Sure, there are funny moments and Andy will make you laugh with his typical comedy, but at the same time he will have some dramatic scenes, where he will be more serious. I really appreciated this and I liked how the movie developed the story. Palm Springs feel really balanced, there is always the right amount of comedy, and the right amount of drama. Special effects are well made and not too invasive. The result is a really enjoyable movie, it has the right length and it manages to be entertaining and engaging for the whole one hour and a half.Unfortunately, I cannot give more than six stars, because the plot is not original at all, and it is a movie that I will soon forget. It is a really nice flick if you just want to relax by watching a light-hearted comedy, but that's it. There is nothing peculiar that make this movie stand out from the genre. Even if the relationship between the two main characters is very solid, is not enough to create a memorable movie."}, {"id": 370, "text": "When you feel the editing is the best thing about a movie, something's gone wrong. The main problem here is the script, which fires out volleys of would-be wisecracks, one-liners and diversions, only to succumb to icky sentimentality. On the plus side, the obvious derivativeness of the piece is shamelessly displayed for all to see, so let's give it full marks for honesty, at least.The actors do what they can to keep us entertained. For my taste, Christin Milioti succeeds, Andy Samberg doesn't. The supporting cast includes a nice turn from Meredith Hagner, some welcome warmth from J.K. Simmonds, Peter Gallagher and, in a sweet cameo, June Squibb.Rom-coms are not my thing, I admit. This merry-mawkish offering goes a long way to explaining why.

But things get a lot more complicated, when Sarah wakes up in the same exact day again.Going into this picture I had high expectations, because people who saw it when it originally premiered at sundance back in January all loved it.Firstly I taught the chemistry between the two leads was great. I like how at first Nyles was a mentor to Sarah but they slowly start to grow a relationship with each other. I know that sounds really cliche, but the relationship is so well paced that it makes it work to a tee.I also liked how this film took inspresation from groundhog day but didn't overdo it and because of which, makes this film feel fresh.Also the preformances are great here. For the time he's in the movie Jk Simons is of cource as always is brilliant here and the exact same can be said for... and... honesty everyone is superb here.As far as complaints go I felt that Niels's wife was just there to cheat on him and also to be used as awful overused comic relief.Finally I didn't like the ending because it felt like if they cut it by fife minutes it just would have left the ending up for interpretation, which would have hit home the message better.Overall despite a few annoyances I taught Palm Springs was a great movie.

Jonah Jamieson as I believe it's his best role before his in Whiplash. If you as me today, deserves an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.It has the same premise as Groundhog Day with Bill Murray, but what I love about it is that there are hidden clues within the movie that gives more for you to think about. But what I think I would've liked to have seen get added within is more of a story as to why Andy Samberg's character of Nyles went into the cave in the first place, I have a strong and wise idea as to what lead him there."}, {"id": 373, "text": "There's a reason people don't copy Groundhog Day despite the premise being something so tempting to repeat; like time travel or body swapping. Groundhog Day is it's almost a perfect movie, to invite comparison is to risk being inferior. Edge of Tomorrow was the last quasi successful movie to try.Palm Springs is NOT a success. The setup is familiar. Niles is stuck in a single day loop and has already accepted his fate in a kind of nihilistic defeatism. That is until someone else is sucked into the loop with him. Now, this would be like being stranded on a deserted island and finding on day that someone else has washed ashore. It would literally be the most world changing event in your otherwise purgatorial existence. You would think finding a kindred spirit would give his life purpose, but the even is treat so blasse as if it's just another rerun for Niles.So if we're not supposed to take this seriously then it's just a big dumb romantic comedy without any of the existentialism or deeper meaning we get in Groundhog Day. Ok fine, Edge of Tomorrow pulled that off. But that mean it has to be funny. This is not. There's lots of yelling, swearing, ridiculous drug usage, constant drinking, and pithy one liners and quips. Turning the craziness up to 11 isn't going to work. It has none of the comedic timing of Bill Murray and certainly not the more natural character arc. The jokes all so obvious and so disappointing coming from Andy Sandberg's often brilliant Lonely Island.JK Simmons feels like a throwaway. His plot relevance could have been any other character spouting the same wisdom, but I guess that wasn't zany enough for the director. There's a brief moment in the middle where they try to get to something deeper but it doesn't amount to enough. That the movie starts and ends on bad wedding speeches may be the most fitting thing about the movie. It's derivative, tries to be funny and fails, is longer than it feels, and you really just want the whole thing to be over."}, {"id": 374, "text": "As many others have already pinpointed, this is literally the third millenium Groundhog Day.

They banter, do stupid stuff and bring us a lot of chuckes and laughs. What is inevitable though, is that they fall in love and suddenly we are drawn into the same old same old rom-com which we've seen a billion times before for the rest of the movie. I personally don't know how different I would write/make this film or which direction I would lead my story, but I found myself to be wanting more and more time loop, chit-chat and ridiculious nonsense and less and less rom-com, those old, cliched formulas too familiar and too tiresome to care about.Nevertheless, I've had a good time watching this, especially in the first half.
