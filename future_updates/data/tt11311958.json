But when you take on a topic, you better research on that topic properly and then make a movie about it. The movie projects a certain Hindu guru in bad light which is fine as there are unfortunately such elements in every culture and religion. But I wonder if these moviemakers target only them because they are soft targets and will not hit back. There was supposed to be a scene about another religion and was removed from the movie trailer and the movie itself. So, if one does not have guts to critcise something known to be a silly practice, why even take a movie about it?

God knows we've had to live through bad VFX with the goddesses performing paltry magic tricks, insanely loud laughter and pet snakes popping out of nowhere. Glad Tamil Nadu is catching on with the trend of OMG in Bollywood. The movie is highly relatable to urban and rural audience in one neat little package. Every RJ Balaji dialogue in the movie reflects the candor and naiveite of a common man. Urvashi killed it with her quick wit and uncanny performance. The sister asking for a day's leave would resonate with every household. Finally, the god herself, Nayanthara's expressions with the BGM would put all heroes of TN out of business. The subtle hit on Christian missionaries in the name of schools, hospitals and prayer centers could have been more of a loud bang. Overall, the movie does not have one dull moment.

The lines involve pongal and cashew nuts, rain and schooldays - I thought RJ Balaji, who has directed this film with NJ Saravanan, was venturing into a direction very different from where he went with his last outing, the blockbuster satire LKG. A card at the beginning quotes a number of inspirations: Bruce Almighty, Bedazzled, Groundhog Day, Wild Wild Country, The Story of God with Morgan Freeman, The Invention of Lying, Dogma, Oh My God, The Brand New Testament, and the filmography of directors Shankar and Rajkumar Hirani.

His emotions, His Suppressed Anger are all excellent for comic relief.The Baba Actor is the usual caricature mixture of Nithyananda and Ramdev. It is Urvashi who steals the show.

Others??"}, {"id": 111, "text": "Mookuthi Amman starts off with an alluring promise. Over 43 km of land is being bought by a so-called swami, much like Osho did in the US back in the 1970s. RJ Balaji plays a reporter named Engels (named after yes, Engels, co-writer of the Communist Manifesto). At this point, I thought we were off to a great start. Balaji's going to tackle both religion and snidely attack political ideologies. But, that's not where the rest of the movie goes.From the minute, the titular Mookuthi Amman arrives onscreen, the whole movie witnesses a tonal shift. Till the end, I never knew if they were still doing this with satire on their minds. By they and their, I refer to the makers. Whatever the case may be, I was not pleased with the post-production. The dubbing and lip-sync is terrible in a lot of places. Balaji's over-the-top comic-riddled performance didn't help either.There are some interesting things to talk about but the question remains is the movie any good? The answer, after a lot of hesitation, is no. Mookuthi Amman is largely a misfire. I assume this was because of a lack of focus. With LKG, they seemed to have a script that knew what it was talking about. Here, it feels like a hotchpotch of many ideas stuffed into a piggy bank made out of clay."}, {"id": 112, "text": "Positives : Social Impact / Aspect: A must watch and digest for all the communities, in Tamizh Nadu, India and the world at large.Every place where some god man is humiliated, it is substantiated with a perfect reason, a lesson and the way to move of it in a fine manner.Movie Making: Cast &amp; Crew : Selection of Oorvashi Mam, Nayanthara as Goddess(Start cast appeal), R J Balaji Anna, Mouli Sir, 3 sisters and the Crew WRT technicalities of the movie did a splendid job.Everyone in the movie (above mentioned) has did their role pitch perfect.Negatives: There was this 2 to 5 minute(s) in the entire movie where I could not stand the noise, that was very negligible. But, for the fact, that scene had to be shot that way to deliver the emotion it has to deliver (It was realistic, but noisy)"}, {"id": 113, "text": "Movie has many laughable moments and some point/realizations that they make are definitely true.Some stuff like fake Baba's and people blindly going behind them is well addressed in this. Fake Baba's are so obvious! When you know that they are business minded, why go behind them? Some other points like, god being angry because you prayed to one god instead of another is just absurd lol. There are so many faults in this one statement itself, but in short, just be faithful to the one god that you believe in (or don't, upto you). Do not believe everything that you see in this movie as it doesn't portray all necessary truths about the religion either.Just watch it as a normal movie and enjoy the comedies light heartedly. The jokes were pretty nice and the storyline was pretty nice too. A good family movie which can definitely be enjoyed by many."}], "reviews_amount": 114}
