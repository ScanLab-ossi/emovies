The people in the session I attended were laughing out loud. Don't expect Shakespeare, but relax and enjoy 90 minutes odd of happiness."}, {"id": 1, "text": "I almost didn't go see this movie because of the negative reviews but I am glad I did. This movie is good for what it is. The ending appears to be left open for a potential sequel which is why it ends as it does but people obviously didn't figure that out judging by reviews. Again I don't understand the bad reviews, maybe people expect every movie to be an Oscar winner or something? I recommend everyone to ignore the negative reviews if thats what is stopping you and go see this movie."}, {"id": 2, "text": "This was such a wonderful show! 5bof us went to watch it and we laughed so hard! Ages: 67, 38, 37, 9 and 7. The cast was fabulous, storyline was great and for once, it was ORIGINAL! I'm tired of remakes. This feel good, laugh out loud comedy was just what we needed. I can't wait to buy it."}, {"id": 3, "text": "A much needed good real laugh is needed once in a while and this movie delivered several good ones. Yea ok it is not an award winning movie and yes it is predictable at times but it made me and my family feel good and that is all it matters."}, {"id": 4, "text": "I haven't laughed so loudly in a long time! This is a pleasant action filled with a lot of laughter and creativity. The cast was also amazing! Robert De Niro and Oakes Fegley did not give up for a moment and played their roles perfectly. Robert De Niro is a person we are used to seeing in darker movies, but I dare say that his role here was a great hit! This is a film that deserves numerous awards for originality and cast. I highly recommend watching it if you want to laugh out loud! :D"}, {"id": 5, "text": "I love the story, and im enjoy the movie, I love Robert de niro acting \ud83d\ude0e. Recommended to watch with family"}, {"id": 6, "text": "Holy crap this movie was funny all the way through not since me myself and Irene have a laughed so much in a movie like this it's a feel good family film not complicated not swearing no blood or anything like that just fun and witty and Robert deniro really makes this film work and uma therman looks so hot for her age i almost turned this off but after i would say like 145 minutes it really gets going and I'm glad i stuck with it cause it was just fun and laughs for an hour and 37 minutes"}, {"id": 7, "text": "It is a very enjoyable watch for the whole family.

All around, w.r.t story, nostalgia, entertainment, CAST, FUN and the perfect culmination of the old school and the new generation!! Fun movie for all..! Definitely watchable when one's down and this movie will lift your mind off of things and put the mind in a good mood!!! A Big Ol' Thank you to everyone involved with this movie!!!! People who gave this movie a rating less than 8, does not know how to, for lack of a better phrasing, Get Entertained! Thank you for coming to my TED Talk!!"}, {"id": 10, "text": "While watching this movie, I was entertained the entire way through. The movie is full of things that will keep you laughing. The child and his Grandpa go to war by pranking each other. I enjoyed the representations of the characters in the movie. The older adults as energetic and full of life as the children. There are also great lessons to be learned from this movie."}, {"id": 11, "text": "Loved this movie, great cast in a gentle family adventure for all the generations."}, {"id": 12, "text": "Getting my family to agree on something is hard enough, getting them all to like the same thing? Hardly never happens. I can see how if you don't have kids, maybe you're a young couple, you may not appreciate the humour. I have a family of 4, whos dad actually lives with us and everyone from my 10 year old son up to my 80 year old dad spent the entire time howling with laughter!! Yes there was a moment where my son thought it looked like a fun idea, but was quickly corrected by his grandad that he took no prisoners and my son changed his mind but honestly, De Niro was his usual funny self. I'm not personally a fan of Uma, she was more grown up and relatable in this to me though, so if you loved her in some of her older stuff maybe don't watch this just to catch up on some Uma time. Slapstick humour, Cheech and Walken were the icing on the cake for us. We will be buying the DVD. Thanks for a successful family film night (for once)"}, {"id": 13, "text": "Best comedy I've seen in a long time. Don't know what all the bad reviews are about.

Quite a few good laughs in this movie and it kept me entertained until the end."}, {"id": 14, "text": "Really enjoyed this movie there is quite a few laugh out loud moments. It reminded me of an 80's / early 90s comedy that did exactly what it was supposed to do make you laugh. Not even close to the worse movie that someone posted. Anytime you can put Robert Deniro, christopher walken, and cheech marin facing kids in dodgeball you know its going to be fun. Sit back and enjoy the movie"}, {"id": 15, "text": "Not bad at all! It was fun and had lots of cute and funny scenes like the one when the tree felt on the house and Mia and Russell were....\ud83d\ude02let's not spoil it! What i am saying is it was a good comedy for a family and it definitely worth watching"}, {"id": 16, "text": "Not a lot to recommend here; it's your standard, predictable comedy with a dash of feel-good family vibes. A grandfather and his grandson (seen in the poster) indulge in a turf war for the possession of the latter's room in the house. The storyline itself is an excuse for an occasionally funny, mostly drab comedy aimed at family-friendly audiences. A few scenes did crack me up; that dodgeball sequence being one of them. Walken is a wise addition to have in films like these, while Thurman and Riggle turn out far less amusing than expected. If you've got 90 minutes to kill and you're stuck indoors like me, go for it."}, {"id": 17, "text": "Not only is this movie funny it's PG rated and shows kids how to get along with relatives that move in with them."}, {"id": 18, "text": "Im not sure if these people giving bad reviews are getting paid to write them, or what! Maybe this year really is just making some people mad enough to think so negative about everything!! Its a freaking pg silly comedy made for families to enjoy and laugh with each other lol damn I just realized I should have given it a 10. Plus man what a great cast Robert D, Umma,Riggles, and oh yea even Walkin and Cheech. If u watch this one and don't laugh then u maybe should keep being part of the meaningless cancel culture"}, {"id": 19, "text": "Ignore the haters here, they are clearly off track. This is a funny, warm, innocent family film. It's a comedy for parents to watch with their kids. There are lots of laughs, more so than any movie in recent years. De Niro is perfect, Uma is just fine. For those that don't like it go watch some cheap superhero movie filled with special effects and brainwashing messages."}, {"id": 20, "text": "Don't understand the bad reviews here, it is a classic comedy!

Our entire family enjoyed this simple and enjoyable story that had plenty of good jokes and pranks!"}, {"id": 25, "text": "Sometimes i felt uncomfortable with the fact the grandpa and grandson are acting in ways that can put both of them in to a Hospital very quickly, or even far worst. But, storyline and acting are great, and just to remind you, this is a Comedy after all, so if you wouldn't take the sadistic family play too seriously, you will enjoy it.All in all. A very fun Movie. They don't do much of that lately, especially with an A league actors.I wrote a review especially to highlight the fact that far worst Movies scored higher. So, it is a well made movie to it's genre."}, {"id": 26, "text": "This is so very funny. 10/10 I all watch it again."}, {"id": 27, "text": "Robert De Niro is like a fine wine, he gets better with age. To tell you the truth I was never a big fan of his more celebrated dramatic films, but I've become a big fan of his later comedy films, like this one. He handles the genre well, isn't afraid to play his age, and OK, they may not ever garner him another academy award, but they are fun, this movie is a good laugh, nothing tacky in it like most modern day 'comedies', just some good old fashioned slap stick laugh out loud humour, Christopher Walken was terrific, as was the entire cast. Don't analyse it, just sit back and enjoy, if you have a sense of humour you will!"}, {"id": 28, "text": "This movie was mainly for the kids, but it turned out to be hilarious. The kids love it and so did my mom, I really enjoyed it too. It's a great family movie to bring everyone together and laugh. Fun for all ages and generations. Great cast that did a wonderful job. Don't mind the bad ratings and reviews from Trumpers. They're just salty Robert DeNiro used his platform to stand up to Trump and the hate and racism he's spreading that is tearing apart and bringing this once great country to ruin. Do you really want to judge a movie on the actors politics? Or for that matter take reviews on a family movie from people with no morals or values? Watch the movie for yourself, I think you will find it enjoyable."}, {"id": 29, "text": "My wife and I actually enjoyed watching this movie and had a nice time.

Great actors, especially my all time favourite Robert De Niro, great clean fun. So glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews. So glad I have a sense of humour."}, {"id": 32, "text": "Yes it is predictable, yes the pranks are sometimes stupid etc. But do not tell me that you had high expectations for the plot? You knew this would be a simple and straightforward movie with an uncomplicated plot. You have a supercast, Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman, Rob Riggle, Jane Seymour and Christopher Walken. It is the same as going to see a LA Lakers game to see LeBron James playing. And at the same time you can enjoy watching the other superstars from the Lakers like Anthony Davis and Danny Green. This movie is very enjoyable to watch. Don\u00b4t have high expectations and you will be all right."}, {"id": 33, "text": "I haven't laughed so hard in a long time, specially these days.

The comedic devises of the dispute are slapstick. This film exists as family entertainment. A great cast serving us well in the comedic realm.

Don't believe the ones who gave this a 1 out of 10 or a very negative score. Last 4 years we not only learned that most of those are supporters of the US president. We all know why they hate good old Bob's movies and the man himself. They are very, very biased, full of hate and can't be trusted to write a good film review. With that said, this film is great fun, Deniro is great as is the whole superb cast. Its great to see deniro and walken again in the same film! It's famely slapstick for anyone who has still got humor left or isn't a supporter of a sertain semi dictator. It also got the heart in the right place. Kids are also acting great, a wonderful film and a good family comedy."}, {"id": 43, "text": "Can't understand the negative reviews, I really don't know what these people expected.

It was okay, one or twice I smiled and it was most of the time entertaining. unfortunately it was a dime a dozen. Like the acting of Robert DeNiro, Uma Thurman,and Christopher WalkenA family movie that I really enjoyed. I laughed more then I thought I would and it was fun. Some of the pranks were pretty solid, the end and scenario was very predictable as most of Hollywood movies, but it was not bad at all &amp; my family enjoyed it as well.I couldn't get past the memory that Robert DeNiro and Uma Thurman played love interests 27 years ago in Mad Dog and Glory and now were together again as father and daughter."}, {"id": 45, "text": "It isn't the best story in the world but the movie made me laugh several times.

It's a family film, kids will like it, but there are a lots of good jokes for grown-ups too, so its a perfect family movie, this is light entertainment for having a good time and you can get drunk and watch it. lol And it's kind of old school, reminded me of Home Alone and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation but with a new vibe.Actually a perfect movie to relax, that won't bore you.Your Experienced Movie Watcher"}, {"id": 48, "text": "A movie that will make the whole family laugh and tear up.

The war between the son and grandpa starts here. This is a very nice comedy. I enjoyed watching it. The story is happening in many different locations like home, school, etc. The acting crew was awesome. Robert De Niro was great like always. In my opinion, he is a living breathing book on how to act. Also, Uma Thurman was good in this movie. Oakes Fegley is very talented. We will hear more from him in the future. The story was well-directed. In summary, if you are a fan of comedy, this is a great pick for you."}, {"id": 52, "text": "There were a couple of things about the movie that I could understand why many people rate it lower but I ultimately enjoyed it. It's a cute family movie with just enough adult humor but the storyline had some unbelievable points where from a grown up perspective you think that without never happen. I thought this movie would be a great watch for my own parents and have already recommended they check it out at some point. If you want the movie to be an A+ then skip it but if you're down for some chuckles prepare yourself for imperfection and enjoyment."}, {"id": 53, "text": "It's a fun movie you know, it's entertaining, well nothing really special here but I think Robert De Niro doing a very well act here, the story is very unique, it's very enjoyable movie and a very proper family movie"}, {"id": 54, "text": "Great one for Christmas Holiday, to be seen with tje entire family!"}, {"id": 55, "text": "My expectations were not high for this one - a film shot three years ago that failed to get any kind of release, featuring some high profile names (Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken) and based on a huge-selling children's book.I was surprised to find myself smiling throughout, amused both by the pace of the film and its efforts to ensure that every scene had at least one solid laugh. Pitched towards a family audience My War with Grandpa is centred around an average family who invite an older relative to live with them. Due to knee difficulties he cannot easily manage stairs so his grandson is required to give up his bedroom in order for the grandfather to have somewhere to sleep. Banished to an attic bedroom the grandson declares formal war on his senior relative and an amusing battle of wits and practical gags follows.The cast are very game and embrace the silliness of the ever-escalating war and the story has enough of a touch of realism in its family dynamics to make it very relatable. De Niro is clearly willing to try anything despite his advancing years and he is given good support from contemporaries including a frail looking Walken, an enthusiastic Cheech Marin and the forever upbeat Jane Seymour. Uma Thurman has an amusing subplot as the unknowing middle generation between grandfather and grandchild and faces being the victim of circumstance in increasingly amusing encounters with a local police officer.Production values are generally high with some ambitious stuntwork and colourful settings. I was surprised thought that the credits for a simple comedy ran more than ten minutes, even with the inclusion of a few outtakes and behind the scenes footage the slow paced credits seem unnecessary.Overall this was hugely enjoyable and a film I think I will actively revisit until the time when I hopefully become the grumpy grandfather embedded unwanted in his descendant's household."}, {"id": 56, "text": "Just an extremely funny movie.

I mean really really bad! I'm shocked!"}, {"id": 61, "text": "I can normally sit through films like this as there are usually several funny bits that pull me through. This had nothing, not even one moment that made me laugh. Any jokes are just so extremely predictable they land completely flat.

It's the type of absurd slapstick comedy we don't get enough of in Hollywood anymore. Robert DeNiro as Grandpa is fantastic. He's both funny and heartwarming; the type of grandpa most kids want. Uma Thurman and Rob Riggle as the parents are also very funny and play off of DeNiro's character very well. The story follows a boy named Peter who's excited that his Grandpa is coming to live with his family...until he discovers that Grandpa is going to be staying in his room while he's moved up to the attic. This sets off a war of pranks and hijinks between Gramps and Peter as they try to one up each other. Overall, it's very good and will keep you entertained throughout. DeNiro, in particular, really shines. Gather the kids and give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed."}, {"id": 66, "text": "They don't do such good comedies anymore. I laughed out loud a lot in this one and I really enjoyed it. My husband did too and he doesn't laugh a lot in comedies because in most comedies you laugh with what they say and my husband's English language is not so good so he doesn't het the jokes most of the times.

His scenes are few but his talent still shines.Everything else about this movie is about as stupid &amp; unfunny as stupid &amp; unfunny can be.

I think you will feel much better mentally and emotionally.Ugh!"}, {"id": 74, "text": "Ridiculous, cringe-worthy and almost unwatchable; The War With Grandpa makes it hard to believe Robert De Niro would ever take part in a film like this.In this family comedy, upset that he has to share the room he loves with his grandfather, a young boy decides to declare war in an attempt to get it back.If you've ever hated your grandpa as much as the kid in this film, you should get help. You know that The War With Grandpa was clearly a filler film for both De Niro and co-star Chris Walken. How did these leading men ever get persuaded into making this film? Walken was the one actor who had one or two funny lines and that's it. A complete waste of talent in a more than basic, wannabe family film.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!"}, {"id": 75, "text": "Robert DeNiro continues to churn out horrible performances in quickie comedy movies that copy other comedy movies, and here he is at his worst. The War with Grandpa is a comedy that has no comedy moments.There is nothing funny about a kid who decides to get over on Grandpa by being at war with him. The humor is degrading and depressing, and there is no upside to any of this. No family values, no family love, nothing positive comes out of this movie. The message is sad and pathetic."}, {"id": 76, "text": "Bad acting, bad script, not funny, lacks humor, just plain dumb. As for De Niro, he has always been completely over-rated, mono-dimensional and always plays the same old same. He should retire with a little dignity.

This is a family film that is based on a children's book-by the same name-written by Robert Kimmel Smith. It's an average comedy with lots of telegraphed jokes and situations-you know what is going to happen before it happens. Robert plays the grandpa that-after the death of his wife-has to move in with his adult daughter Uma and her husband Rob and their 3 children. Oakes plays the 12 year old grandson that has to give up his room to Robert and he is not happy about it. Oakes has to move up to the attic so he declares war on grandpa Robert to get his room back. Each of them pull pranks on each other, hoping the other person will give in, but you know that that is not going to happen-at least not until the last 15 minutes of the movie, maybe. There are a few cameos of older actors, as friends of Robert; Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour &amp; Cheech Marin pop up. It's rated PG for rude humor and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 34 minutes.

Such awful writing for young teens. It's clear that the writers had no idea what interactions between young kids are actually like. You have the main characters (Oakes Fegley) surrounded by such flat, unfunny, one-dimensional characters that add no value to the story. One owns a snake? Another has a sister that likes to embarrass him for no reason (there's a scene where she meets him at the lunch area and tells his friends about his fungus problem) and there's a girl who seems to be there more so for gender diversity rather than anything else. Then there's the main character's parents, who are meant to be goofy and try to portray a more 'realistic' type parents, but try too hard to be as funny as the parents from Easy-A and yet they fail miserably. And then there's Robert De Niro, who has fallen under the trope of Old man played by famous actor from the 70's, now trying to understand how to use technology, because ha-ha, old famous man don't know how to turn on an iPhone. The plot revolves around Robert De Niro and Oakes Fegley. Robert De Niro's character, Ed, has supposedly lost the plot? Because he didn't know how to work a self-checkout machine at a Walmart. So he goes to move in with his daughter (played by Uma Thurman). The conflict is that Oakes Fegley's character, Peter, has to move his bedroom to the attic to cater to Ed on account of him being old and can't use stairs I guess? (Ignoring the fact that Ed has no issue playing game of dodgeball with his other 'old' pals at a trampoline park). So Peter decides to wage a war against Ed, for no other reason than to get his old room back. Ed doesn't really want to be involved. He just wants to go about his day in peace and fawn over the loss of his late wife (which I guess is supposed to add depth to his character, but, just like Peter's friends, the dead wife adds no value to the story, but more so a shrug-of-the-shoulder type plot device). This takes up most of the movie. Just a grandfather and his grandson playing pranks on each other, all over a bedroom. That's about it really. The pranks are supposed to add comedic value to the movie, but they're so predictable that you could smell it from a mile away. Pullings screws out of the furniture, setting alarms off at unexpected times, manipulating one another into doing something that turned out to be a trap. From this you can get a sense of where the story is going to go, and that's exactly where it goes. Ed and Peter develop a liking towards each other (because, you know, they're related after all) but the pranks become too much and people get hurt, and that's the climax of the story. Apologies are exchanged, feelings spill out. The end.It's a movie that has been done time and time again, and will most likely continue to be made till the end of time. It makes for a quick buck, put together under a huge Hollywood budget, you bring in a couple of famous actors (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman) and, hey, you have a movie! The humour is predictably slapstick when it comes to the pranks, and the interactions between the teens are too dry and are trying so hard to be relatable to the younger generation, but it fails to do so because the writers do not know how to accurately portray young teens in an authentic yet funny way. Its mindless storytelling is insulting to any viewer of any age, and it should not be viewed by anyone.

Neither Grandpa Ed nor Peter like the new living arrangement, because grandpa loses some of his independence and Peter loses his bedroom. A secret prank war ensues as Grandpa Ed and Peter try to outdo each other until someone gives up.This film is based on the best-selling book, The War with Grandpa, by Robert Kimmel Smith. Thanks to Tre Peart, the executive producer, this movie was made. When Tre was in the third grade, he came across the book and suggested to his parents that they should make a movie about it. And here it is! The script is hysterical and takes many lines directly from the book. Also, the amazing cast includes Robert De Niro (Grandpa Ed), who plays a terrific, immature, but loving father and grandfather. Uma Thurman plays a stern, but wonderfully caring mother (Sally), and Oakes Fegley plays Peter, an excellent prankster protagonist. The supporting cast consists of terrific A-list talent including Rob Riggle, playing a cool dad. Christopher Walken and Cheech Marin team up with Grandpa Ed to make him even more immature. My favorite part of the movie is all the creative ways Peter and Grandpa Ed find to prank each other, and sometimes other members of the family (sorry Sally).The messages of the movie are about the importance of communication within a family and respecting your elders.

The story revolves around a forgetful grandfather who is living alone since his wife passed away. His daughter insists that he comes living with her family. He is assigned to live in his grandson's room who himself has to live in the attic. The child isn't very happy about the situation and declares a war on his grandfather who gladly accepts. As the two family members secretely fight each other, they also start appreciating each other more.This movie for the whole family convinces on many levels. The actresses and actors are becoming one with their roles and are doing an excellent job. The characters are quite quirky, diversified and amusing. The movie has many funny side stories such as the grandfather's daredevil friends and the oldest daughter's boyfriend who doesn't get accepted by her mother. The movie has a strong message that family should always stick together in difficult situations.On the other side, the movie also has a few flaws. The story is very predictable. The ending is overloaded with happy stereotypes. The characters are often behaving extremely exaggeratedly which leaves an at times bitter aftertaste such as when the family offers the youngest daughter an over-the-top Christmas party in the middle of the summer.Despite some minor flaws, The War with Grandpa is a highly entertaining comedy movie for the whole family with a positive message that is best enjoyed at a birthday party or around Christmas."}, {"id": 140, "text": "I walked into this film expecting it to be bad, but surprisingly didn't hate this has much, still not saying it's a great movie.

The War with Grandpa was amusing, but nothing more, one time was enough for me."}, {"id": 141, "text": "Robert DeNiro's track record in comedies has been more erratic than with his esteemed career of dramatic outings. That differential is evident in the quality gap between his excellent pairing with Billy Crystal for Analyze This, and its unfortunate sequel three years later, Analyze That. The same can be said for the two Fockers comedies as textbook cases of large sequel dropoff. The low point was his role as Fearless Leader in the live-action tarnishing of a beloved cartoon series, The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle. This one splits the difference, leading to a reasonably entertaining mix of schmaltz and laughs.DeNiro is retired from his construction business, recently widowed and truly depressed. His daughter (Uma Thurman) persuades him to move in with her family rather than wallow in his sadness. Unfortunately, that's two parents with a son and two daughters in a three-bedroom house. The tweener son (Oakes Fegley) has to give up his room and move into the ratty unfinished attic. He loves granddad, but not enough to graciously cede his domain. DeNiro isn't happy about upsetting the lad, but sees no option and tries his best to blend in with the others.The plot is driven by the boy formally declaring war on Grandpa, leading to a mostly-funny escalating series of pranks and reprisals within agreed rules of engagement. Both are assisted by their respective trios of friends; DeNiro's surprisingly consists of Cheech Marin, Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour. Given their small amount of screen time, the three were obviously more motivated by the chance to work with a living legend than the juiciness of their roles. The script contains a few complementary subplots involving the rest of the family, as well.Some parents might question the rating, since the pranks raise the kids don't try this at home flag. If there's a demonic streak in any of your progeny, you might not want them to draw inspiration from these antics.

It is total trash."}, {"id": 145, "text": "It's a good movie, just don't pay to see it at the theater. At the end of my review I'll tell you what that scene was. It was the biggest part of the movie. This would have been a great movie if they didn't follow the normal practice that some BAD directors tend to do: Add a scene that is totally BS and unbelievable, simply for shock value and don't care about everybody spending their money at the movies hoping for something great! It was the biggest part of the movie. And it was doing great until the last couple seconds. They simply blew it. That scene lost them 2 stars. I CERTAINLY recommend the movie IF tickets are half off and you're allowed to bring your own food and drinks. Otherwise WAIT for it to show up on streaming media.Scene spoiler: I'm not going to mention everything that happened that led up to the disappointment, just the very last part, because I don't want to spoil it for you. Basically there was total chaos at the little girl's birthday party because of a booby trap the boy set up for his grandpa. I was loving this part of the movie UNTIL: something bumped into a tree and the whole tree was uprooted and fell against the house, tearing a huge hole into the side of the house. Yes a huge evergreen. Some of the action prior to this was already slightly unbelievable and this part 'sealed the deal of disappointment'."}, {"id": 146, "text": "I love movies of all kinds, for all moods, I think that mostly they all have a place, from parent trap to cheaper by the dozen, pacifier etc even the new movie sleepover had moments, I'm a fan of this genre as daft easy to watch films.This was easy to watch no doubt but it just wasn't enjoyable, I feel that's mainly down to two huge issues, cast and writing.I thought the parents were fine and youngest daughter was great but the kids friend were terrible especially the kid bullied by his sister it was just so forced and unfunny. Then the older sister just stunk, pretty girl but just acting that for me was not movie worthy, she was very poor but the main kid was rubbish, how he spoke, his facials and mannerisms were garbage, the line about curling up and dying... aged 12 was ridiculous, he wasn't likeable and that killed the film. He just seemed a brat who's pranks were just plain nasty rather that cute and funny.Robert deniro is class but just looked like he couldn't be bothered here, didn't seem to have chemistry with anyone except his friends who were all fine I guess, he just felt wrong in the part due to just phoning it in. Didn't feel like a deniro masterclassThe writing was bad, it felt nasty and just not fun, wasn't warm, not funny, nothing very new or clever and a host of bad performances made this one to miss or put on in background, even playing with fire is way better than this. The movie not actual fire.Real shame. Kid actors make or break these movies, Matilda wasn't particularly great but the girl was a star. Obviously didn't pan out growing up but as a kid she was, home alone, parent trap etc. Instant family was an example of good kid actors"}, {"id": 147, "text": "Ed (Robert De Niro); is a man at a turning point in his life. The retired builder and widower is forced to move in with his daughter Sally (Uma Thurman); following an incident at a local store.This new arrangement is accepted by the entire family with one exception; Peter (Oakes Fegley) who despises the idea of giving up his room to his Grandfather and having to take up residence in the attic. The fact that Peter is starting Middle School adds to the tension as he and his friends are now the target of bullies as well as his older sister whose disdain for him is evident.Desperate to get his room back; Peter declares war on his grandfather and enters into a series of events designed to harass him into giving up the room so Peter can reclaim what was his. Ed finds the entire thing amusing and his friends Danny (Cheech Marin), and Jerry (Christopher Walken); help him see the bigger picture and support him as Ed gives back even better than he gets. As the conflict escalates' the stakes become higher and the entire family gets caught up with The War With Grandpa.While it was nice to see such an All-Star cast on the screen they are not given a great deal to do in order to stand out as this is a film that is very much aimed at Middle Schoolers and kids in general. I found the humor more amusing than funny and what really bothered me most was the underlying message of the film. In an era of entitled kids who lack respect; the film basically says it is fine to harass your elders to get what you want and that your needs come before theirs. This could have been mitigated with some more balanced humor and perhaps a change of heart but as the film unfolds Peter shows just what a self-centered individual he is.While I wished I could have enjoyed this film more as the premise and cast were great, the lack of laughs and overall message of the film did not work for me making this one for the kids.2.5 stars out of 5"}, {"id": 148, "text": "Sometimes you have to make sacrifices in a family.What a top actor, Robert De Niro. Most of the films in which he played the lead, became film classics. Memorable roles that will still impress in decades to come. From Taxi Driver to Goodfellas. From The Deer Hunter to Casino. Unforgettable masterpieces. The only thing De Niro should have avoided in all these years is comedies. Besides Last Vegas there isn't a single comedy (at least of those I've seen) with De Niro that I thought was worth watching. Lame humor and an irritating storyline are usually the biggest annoyances about such films. Meet the Fockers, Analyze That, The Big Wedding, The Family and The Intern, just to name a few. Every time I felt vicariously ashamed. This is also the case with The war with GrandPa.Let's introduce grandfather Ed (Robert De Niro), who's hopelessly left behind after the death of his beloved wife. Next, there's the concerned daughter Sally (Uma Thurman) who wants her father to move in with her family, regardless of what the family members have to say about that. Husband Arthur (Rob Riggle) is again such a good-natured guy (and obviously Ed has nothing good to say about him) who looks at the whole thing with resignation and grudgingly agrees with the whole situation. Then there's son Peter (Oakes Fegley) who's screwed and reluctantly has to give up his beloved room. And this because grandfather's legs refuse to work properly and so grandpa takes up residence there. Peter has to move to the dusty attic with a roof that's not watertight and where unwanted pets run across the wooden truss. The eldest daughter Mia (Laura Marano) has the least problems since she's living in her own teenage world. And finally, there's the adorable daughter Jennifer (Poppy Gagnon). The only one who's extremely enthusiastic about the new housemate.You can already guess what's going to happen after reading the title of the film. Yes, grandson Peter declares war on Grandpa Ed. The stake is the bedroom he had to hand over. At first, Ed finds it all highly amusing. The written declaration of war slipped under his door is treated with derision. And Grandpa Ed is willfully playing the game. It seems so innocent to him. I don't think it's going to be a surprise when it turns out that things start to get out of hand.I thought it was quite astonishing that famous actors cooperated in this average family film. Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, and Jane Seymour. Admit it, they are not the least. I suppose these actors would also like to experience a pleasant film set with a less demanding, relaxing role instead of a physically hard, intense one. Just like me wanting to have a peaceful moment in the midst of all the horror violence stuff I watch most of the time. The main subject being the clash between youth and the elderly in this movie seemed rather obvious. Unfortunately, there are other storylines that were added and not further explored. Like the love-hate relationship between the mother and her future son-in-law. Or the work situation of father Arthur. The only sidetrack that is gratefully used is the bullying of Peter at school. That was rather funny.The rest of the film is a series of silly jokes those two arch-rivals are playing on each other. The pace at which these pranks follow each other is blisteringly fast. And they are of the level as the April Fools' Day jokes. Replacing shaving cream with quick-drying foam or replacing cookie filling with toothpaste. Well, the movie has its charms. It's a slightly corny comedy. A kind of mixture of Home Alone and Dennis the Menace. Obviously the film aims at a younger audience because my 8-year-old son next to me laughed a lot while watching. I'm afraid I'm not part of the target audience. I guess I belong to De Niro's age-group. But nobody will ever ask me to play such a part.More reviews here: movie-freak.be"}, {"id": 149, "text": "When newly widowed Grandpa Jack (Robert De Niro) moves in with his daughter's family. His grandson Peter (Oakes Fegley) is forced to give up his bedroom and move into the attic.Peter schemes to get his room back and declares war on his grandpa. However Jack is a war veteran and has a few tricks up his sleeve.I first thought this was a sequel to Dirty Grandpa. In fact this is a family friendly movie based on the book by children's author Robert Kimmel Smith.The pranks between Grandpa Jack and Peter are very much in the style of the Home Alone films.Kids would find this movie amusing. I thought it was uninspired, not very funny, ripping off too many other movies such as Dodgeball. It wastes actors such as Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken."}, {"id": 150, "text": "IN A NUTSHELL: Directed by Tim Hill, THE WAR WITH GRANDPA is finally in theaters, after several failed releases in 2017 and 2018 due to the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The family comedy features flying dentures, trash-talking kids, and is based on the children's book The War with Grandpa by Robert Kimmel Smith. In a time of chaos and uncertainty in the world today, it's nice to have a light-hearted, family-friendly film. Of course, it's predictable, but it's a feel-good fun time and we all need more of that. Some people will think it's hilarious; others will think it's silly nonsense and mean-spirited. The trailer shows exactly what you can expect. If you like what you see, go for it. If it looks dumb, skip it.TIPS FOR PARENTS: Some violence Bullying and name-calling There are some phrases I never allowed in my house, like Shut up or I hate you! They're allowed in this family's house. Some alcohol Talk and portrayal of men dressing up as Santa A teenage girl lies to her parents that she is going to study, but she really goes out with her boyfriend. You see an old man topless. There is an extremely extravagant birthday party your kids may want you to duplicate. Lots and lots of pranks. Some people get hurt. Some people break the law. 2 not fully enunciated F-bombs Anatomical terms in Spanish 2 Scatalogical terms 7 religious exclamations In case your child thinks going to war with a grandparent looks like great fun, talk to him/her about how people got hurt and a lot of things were damaged, requiring expensive repairs. Of course, teach your kids about respect.THEMES: Sometimes we have to make sacrifices for family. - Sally (Uma Thurman) War hurts. Lack of respect for people and property Selfishness Parenting kids, caring for aging parents Jealousy Death of loved ones FamilyTHINGS I LIKED: Academy Award winner Robert De Niro is great at both drama and comedy. Despite his controversial political statements in recent years, he's an excellent actor and a fan favorite. This is his second movie starring in a movie with the word Grandpa in it. Watch for the references to his other movies. I haven't seen Oscar nominee Uma Thurman in anything for a while. She's obviously had plastic surgery, but she looks great. The talented cast includes the lovely Jane Seymour, funnyman Cheech Marin, and the quirky, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken. Young Oakes Fegley does a great job and has a bright future in acting. I thought he was so sweet in Pete's Dragon. Good for the parents for having no boys in the house when no parents are at home rule. My parents had the same rule. It's cute how the pranks bring the grandfather and grandson together. There are some scenes that were pretty entertaining like the dodgeball scene, Laura Maran will be most familiar to young audiences from the Disney Channel show Austin &amp; Ally: Chasing The Beat, where she plays Ally Dawson. She sings one of the songs in the movie called Point of War. Keep watching after the first song during the closing credits for some outtakes. There are quite a few running gags throughout the movie. Some work. Others not so much. There are some sweet family moments and lessons learned.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: What a bratty attitude Peter has toward his grandfather. When his friend tells him to start a war and fight for what is rightfully his, Peter says, You're a bad friend. He's right. It's terrible advice, yet he decides to go to war, telling his grandfather, You took something of mine and I want it back! The movie trailer did a much better job showcasing the snake scene than the actual movie did. There's some real infantile humor that features Robert De Niro with his pants down twice. The moment when Uma Thurman goes nuclear fell flat for me. There was no epiphany in her eyes, only an instant change of attitude. One of the kids always says crude things. Not all of the humor lands. Some scenes last way too long like the Shhhh scene. I really like Rob Riggle and he does a good job with the material he is given. Unfortunately, as a father, he is emasculated and 100% useless in this movie. The ending was dumb.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!"}, {"id": 151, "text": "The War with Grandpa is a new comedy family movie directed by Tim Hill, the director of The SpongeBob movie: Sponge on the Run and Garfield 2.In the film, grandpa Ed (Robert De Niro) has to live with his daughter Sally (Uma Thurman) as a precaution. Here he gets the room from her son Peter (Oakes Fegley) and he has to move to the attic. Despite the fact that Peter loves his grandfather, he wants his own room back. With the help of his friends, Peter devises plans to expel his grandfather from his room. When Ed realizes what Peter is doing, he strikes back in his own irritating way. This creates a battle between grandfather and grandson, about who can irritate the other the first and thus claim the bedroom.Tim Miller is known as one of the creators of the animation series SpongeBob SquarePants and as a director of animation films. He also brings back the childish SpongeBob humor in this film. Many moments seem a bit unbelievable, but these moments still manage to provide entertaining scenes for younger viewers. If you are an older viewer going to this movie, you better not go there with too serious thoughts for a more entertaining time. If you are still a fan of the SpongeBob series or the kind of humor that occurs in the series, you can also laugh at certain comedy moments in this film, or at least appreciate them a little more.The acting is done nicely by the younger cast, but with some you can see that they are still starting actors. Younger audiences can enjoy themselves a bit more and relate to the young cast. From the young cast comes T.J. McGibbon, who plays a girlfriend of Peter's is the best forward. Still, the older cast provides the most comedic work in the film, especially older viewers. Robert De Niro has done better comedy acting in his other comedies, but with the help of actors like Cheech Marin and Christopher Walken, he ensures good comedy moments in the film. Rob Riggle, who is better known as a comedy actor, comes across less in this film together with Uma Thurman."}], "reviews_amount": 152}
