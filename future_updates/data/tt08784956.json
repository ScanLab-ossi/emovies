How hard it is to do an action film with famous actors. It's surely a huge hit.Little they know, the actor-writer is not a good writer and actor-producer is not good at reading scripts as he think he is. Because everyone is friends with everyone, nobody is honest. Hilarity ensues. Experience is tragic for the audience. Comedy for the Hollywood insiders."}, {"id": 2, "text": "SPOILER ALERT I dont understand why good actors like Jessica Chastain and Colin Farrell took part in this movie. There is no story at all. They fight for no reasons and the fighting scenes are not even enjoyable. 1. The alcoholic background is useless 2. The reason why Simon tries to kill ava is weak 3. The family issue only makes it more of a TV drama 4. Why does Simon kill Duke again? 5. What's the deal with Tony? 6. Why does Ava have to fight the whole club security just to pay Michael's debt? Why? 7. After resisting so hard on drinking alcohol, she finally did it. And what? Nothing happened? The whole movie makes it like something really bad going to happen if she drinks. Well...she drinks and what? She still fights Simon. 8. Simon and Ava fight. Just...wth happened? They just stop fighting? Seriously...Simon just stop trying to kill her and walk away and what? So Ava can have time to chase him with a gun? And why does Simon walk? Oh So he comes to the hotel walking? No car? 9. And for the love of God please stop with the hair! It's so tiring and frustrating to see Jessica Chastain struggle with the hair through the whole movie!"}, {"id": 3, "text": "I like Chastain as an actor bit this is not her genre. This film felt very cheap. The story dull, the direction amateur and the action scenes were really really bad. You could see the fight scenes coming from a mile away. The poor story telling was so bad that the excuses to have a fight we're incredibly lame.I can't explain why so many top actors took part in this cheese fest. I got goose bumps as they had to blurt out their awful lines. The whole thing just felt B-Roll amateur. Not recommended."}, {"id": 4, "text": "The first 30 minutes were really promising. Good action, suspenseful vibe, great acting... but as soon as one of the secondary character Michael appears, everything flops. Not only because of his insecure and awkwardly mediocre acting, which reminded me of some cheap drama or love story soap opera... but because he represents an entry point into Ava's past. A boring past which has nothing to add to the story or her character.So if we crop off all the family stuff and stick to the action... then it could be a solid 7. In stead it is a poor 6.Worth mentioning: Jessica Chastain and John Malkovich performances are great. Colin Farrell somehow sticks to his (good) average, but who really disappoints is Geena Davis. Her approach personally felt to me like Let's make it clear - I'll say some words, get the money and leave."}, {"id": 5, "text": "Jessica Chastain plays an international hit-woman. John Malkovich is her handler. It sounds like a Luc Besson thriller in the making. It's not.

A little non muscular woman overpowers dudes 2-3 times her weight with ease, breaks their bones with punches which even don't seem to tire her, snaps necks like it's nothing.

Either way, this movie is an assault on your intelligence at almost every step. Why do film makers think that the more people who get gunned down in an action scene, the better? An orgy of gunfire and murder are rarely called for, and this over-the-top school of storytelling takes away any sort of tension the scene may have had at one point.First of all, shoot a pistol inside of a car (with the window up!) and if you weren't deaf before, you will be, at least for a while.By my count, she killed 17 people at the hotel in Saudi Arabia, obviously up against The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. If she had killed two people who happened upon her, it could have been exciting...and believable. 17? Just completely stupid.The rapper guy may look the part, but he's no actor. Whatever, it was a stupid, thankless role. There was already enough drama in the story without adding her personal life, but that's the Hollywood formula machine grinding away.Puerile as the story was all along, the ending went even lower and dumber.Colin Farrell-whose character is a deadly assassin-gets his butt handed to him in hand-to-hand combat by an old man, and then a woman. I don't mean to be ageist or sexist, but have you ever seen a woman or a guy pushing 70 in the UFC? And then when he is in this desperate battle to the death with Ava, they both are sort of chuckling, like this is all good fun. Unless they are both psychopaths, it wouldn't be fun, not even a little.

However, as she relapses into alcoholism and a mental breakdown is on the way, the company deems her a liability and wants her gone. In sceneries reminescent of the John Wick movies, like hotel rooms, a flashy nightclub and abandoned church, she fights both physically and mentally to protect herself and the ones she loves.Or at least, that's the premise. In reality this straightforward storyline gets sidetracked a lot by Ava trying to reconcile with her family whom she abandoned, trying to save her ex-boyfriend from bad apples, and Ava's mentor trying to save her. It took the strength and pacing out of the story, and took precious screentime away which I feel could have been used for making Ava's mental breakdown seem more convincing. Technically, the movie had some flaws. Unfocused shots at times, the action scenes had an abundance of shaky cams and jump cuts (which I dislike), and digital zoom-ins made the editing just seem... off.However, Chastain was not a bad actress in this movie by any means. She was just one of the top actors in what turned out to be a bit of a B-film."}, {"id": 30, "text": "I can't understand all the negative reviews?!

That being said, the relationship between Ava and her family is a tough one to watch at first that slowly turns into a family story that makes this movie worth the watch. In addition to that, the relationship between Mentor and Mentee (Duke and Ava) brings a strong fatherly figure into the film that makes Ava's story a little less boring.

It was enjoyable with an all star cast. Yes, this story has been done before but this was in no way the worst movie I've seen. Watch it."}, {"id": 42, "text": "Thrillers involving spies and assassins have been popular for decades. Few these days could be asked who James Bond is and not know the answer to the question. But something new has been added to the genre in recent years that's been a long time coming and for the better. Women are now replacing men in lead roles in action films and they're holding their own. Last you're PEPPERMINT was proof of that. Now we have AVA.Jessica Chastain plays Ava, a killer for hire working for a non-descript group called the Organization. The film opens with her killing a member of the International Monetary Fund in France. Before killing him she makes the mistake of asking him what he's done wrong to deserve his death. He has no idea and she kills him anyway.Reporting in to her handler Duke (John Malkovich) she tells him she needs some time off to deal with family issues in Boston. Returning home she stops in to see her sister Judy (Jess Weixler) a local musician/singer. After her performance the pair are walking back to Judy's apartment and we learn more. Their father died months earlier, Judy has had to deal with taking care of the family, she's now involved with Ava's ex Michael (Common) and their mother Bobbi (Geena Davis) is in the hospital.Visiting her mother the next morning Ava is given the wandering child treatment. She left 8 years prior and has never returned, just placing phone calls every 6 months. There is a combative feeling between not just mother and daughter but between the two siblings as well, one having run from confrontation and the other having been forced to deal with the issues left behind.Ava is next seen at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Boston. We learn more about her, items hinted at in her discussions with Duke and in the opening credits. A former alcoholic and drug user Ava found her father in the arms of another woman. Forcing him to admit it to her mother he instead told Bobbi that Ava was stealing money from him and blackmailed him with the threat of a made up story. This is the issue that drove Ava from home, into the military and from there recruited into the life of a paid assassin. Sober for 8 years with one relapse she hides the fact of her profession from everyone.After her trips to Boston Ava is given a new target, a general located in Riyadh. Seducing him she is to make it look like he died of natural causes. A slip up in intel sends his men in to take her down and prevent his death but they are too late. A battle follows and Ava barely escapes with her life. When she contacts Duke about it he takes the fall for the faulty intel.But it turns out there was no mistake. The top man at the Organization, Simon (Colin Ferrell) was attempting to put an end to Ava and knew Duke would object. Now she has a target on her back and only Duke coming to her defense.At the same time she's trying to attend to lose ends at home. She helps Michael with gambling debts. She tries to make amends with her mother. She sets out to protect her family. And she waits for that final confrontation.AVA is a solid movie in that it takes a well-worn genre and gives it more depth than most. The character of Ava has issues deeper than a desire to kill or a worn out moral compass. She is troubled with her past and dealing with addiction on a daily basis. These would be flaws in most characters but in Ava we see her trying her best to deal with all of these issues, burying them at first and then rising to meet the challenges they provide.Chastain has always been a superior actress. It's nice to see her in a role that allows her dramatic prowess to be on display while at the same time giving her a more physical role than she's had in some time. She's proven she can handle both sides of that coin in the past and does so once again admirably. Malkovich is wonderful here as well with a bit of physicality he hasn't had to use in some time though a good guess would be he has great stuntmen in his corner. And Ferrell shows once again that he is an underused talent in search of the right project. Let's hope he finds one soon.In the end AVA is a thriller that delivers on all marks. Well-made with a great script, top directing, great performances and enough action to hold your interest till the credits roll. If you're looking for something to enjoy this week give AVA a try."}, {"id": 43, "text": "Ok, this is is not terrifically original, it's treading the same ground as the bourne trilogy, salt, atomic blonde etc. However the acting and cinematography are good.

She's also fighting her personal demons. She's into philosophy and the viewer also needs to see beyond the violence and ruthlessness to the subtle subtext. Ava is not a killing machine, she feels, she thinks, she struggles. Will she be victorious, or defeated? I disagree with those reviewers who only see the surface, the action and the battles, and are irritated by the gratuitous family scenes that don't seem to add to the story. Those scenes are the real story. Matthew Newton knows what he's writing about. The top-flight cast signed on because they saw what the story was really about, and chose to be part of it.

Great acting overall, but I have to say I thought Chastain was miscast.

In the second half it evolved into some more articulated fight scenes. However, there was way too much family drama. The sister was unbelievably annoying. The mom? Eh? Common? An actor with his chops and presence, should be given more to work with.I would say it was moderately entertaining, but not particularly convincing.

And she has daddy issues. But, get out of her way! There's nothing Jessica can't solve with her fists, her feet, a gun, harsh language and a full clip. Included is a John Wick nightclub moment.

By night, she might as well be known as Mrs. John Wick, due to the exuberant fight sequences that are part of her profession as a hired assassin.Jessica Chastain is outstanding in the role of the badass Ava. Her handler named Duke (John Malkovich) is disappointed in Ava's human concern about her victims because she is not supposed to know anything about their identities and their crimes.In a dynamic opening scene outside Le Bourget airport in Paris, Ava gets the job done on a corrupt financier. Her next assignment is in Riyadh, where she is to assassinate a German general and make it appear as though he died of natural causes. But she is being set up by her employer, Simon, who is the godfather of the Murder, Inc. enterprise.After Duke is brutally killed by Simon, Ava is on her own to deal with Simon and his family members. At the same time, Ava must protect her mother, Bobbi, and her sister, Jude, an expectant mother. A love interest in the film that was underdeveloped was between Ava and Michael, who linked up with Jude after Ava had left him years ago.The most touching scene in the film was between the mother and the daughter over a game of cards. Bobbi opens up to her daughter about how she had once betrayed her, choosing the word of her philandering husband over that of her daughter. The betrayal sent Ava into a bout of alcoholism and a long recovery period. The card game scene was beautifully performed by Chastain and Gena Davis as Bobbi.There were exciting location settings, as well as interesting camera angles on the part of the director. The screenplay included a group of colorful characters. One figure who may be important in the sequel is the daughter of Simon, who is last seen stalking Ava on the streets of Boston. But this film belongs to Chastain for her dynamic interpretation of Ava.The filmmakers wax philosophical in the ancient Greek tale of Croesus, who was told by Solon that of human happiness, Count no man happy until the end is known. In the film, the meaning was skewered by focusing on the last moments of one's life. But the actual theme is that the merits of one's life as a whole may not be judged until the very end when an entire set of choices in life may be added up.In the film, we don't yet know the final results of the life of Ava Falkner. The filmmakers clearly have a sequel in mind before arriving at the wisdom of Solon."}, {"id": 79, "text": "A bad review, this is a good film, perhaps there was some predictability, but overall I liked this movie, the end predicts a sequel and I hope there is, for me, the cast did good work in this film."}, {"id": 80, "text": "I enjoyed this movie, and Jessica Chastain was awesome! :DGood action flick.

Her file said she was a good soldier but also a liability because of her behavior and that explains why she was attacked. The Duke was killed in defense of his favorite protege. For Christ sake I can't believe I have to explain this to people-why some events happened in the movie. If one pays attention, you will realize that the intro gives all the background info there is to know about Ava and the actress did her best to portray these qualities. My point exactly is people perhaps didn't see that part of the movie and therefore couldn't appreciate it.

Jessica has mostly high profile targets-who would suspect a woman?-but she has a problem. She likes to talk to her victims before she kills them. Basically, she wants to know why they are being targeted for her skills and Colin-her boss-doesn't like that. He puts a termination protocol on her and that's when things get interesting. Geena plays Jessica's estranged mother. They have some unresolved issues. There is a lot of good action and fight scenes; Jeff Imada is the stunt choreographer and he was trained in Jeet Kune Do-among other fighting techniques-and has been in and choreographed a lot of movies you would know; Batman V Superman:Dawn of Justice, Fast &amp; Furious movies, Bourne movies, Big Trouble in Little China and They Live, just to name a few.

But that character simply couldn't be just forcefully inserted into this storyline, not just there's no chemistry between these two early love birds, even there's nothings existed between her sister and the black guy. They just looked like strangers to one another or to each other. It just looked so unnatural and so awkward to jam a character out of nowhere and to force that guy into the churning pot.The leading actress did a great job but not quite convincingly believable. The fighting scenes were more like those Kung Fu movies in 1960 to 1970 out of Hong Kong. Any guy who has watched UFC will not believe anything of it.

In fact, she gets thrown around a lot, which is a lot more realistic than the usual indestructible characters.

This will be her downfall...The chaos and secretive nature of her job is juxtaposed against her social life where she had had a troubled life with family before she joined this company. She is a recovering alcoholic and her sister is now dating her ex boyfriend. Cue the family conflict and tension &amp; also their mother has recently been hospitalised... Due to her work she managed to have disappeared from their lives for 8 months.Overall, the writers are trying to bring some added depth to the clich\u00e9d assassin character with some interesting family dynamics.

Geena Davis is having all the fun in this film, and John Malkovich is great as always. Personally, I think that Jessica Chastain is a little miscast for the role. If her character was more of a spy or a stealth assassin it would've been fine, but she's sort of both - a stealthy infiltrator and a commando-like mass murderer, and her build doesn't really indicate that she can throw trained men in gear the way she does.It would've been easier to appreciate the film if it was clear what was intentional and what wasn't. There are lots of inconsistencies in Ava's character. She does this weird asking questions thing probably to help herself with her conscience after killing the people who do bad things but she has no problem with killing armed forces that are just there to protect their superior commander, and they probably have families too you know. The ending was also a little confusing, for a second there I thought that Ava and Farrell's character had a minute where they've seen their similarities and probably the film would go for a more creative and weird ending (they probably did that intentionally), but he still killed her father-figure so that would've been a stretch. Instead, they just got tired I assume (like in Atomic Blonde). At some point, I thought the film would get darker and more desperate (I surely would've appreciated this) but no, it just ends with a sequel bait like in John Wick.Having this much dialogue and family drama is not even that bad, the problem is that this combination doesn't work the way they did it. This family is not interesting enough for you to get invested into old father-daughter problems, the love triangle, the gambling subplot, and more. It doesn't help that we did not see how Ava became what she is now, we get a brief slideshow that gives some facts, but that's about it.If it was just an action film, it would've been cliche but passable, I guess. The action is far away from Atomic Blonde levels, there were lots of cuts and obviously Malkovich can't really do this better due to his age. Ava looks scared in most of the action scenes as well. There are not that many action scenes and they are not interesting or pleasant to look at in any way.The addition of the family stuff just drags the film down, IMO.

This does not go down well with Simon (Farrell) who seemingly leads the shadowy organization of contract killers and is the protege of Duke (Malkovich) who is Ava's handler. Simon tries to have Ava killed by sabotaging one of her missions and fails. He then sends another assassin who also failed. Since Duke is in Simon's way, he dies. Then Simon goes after Ava, alone and out of practice, without back-up. And he fails to finish the job. Ava coolly chases him down and finishes him off as he attempts to limp away.

And not only a history, she has got a present, which means: real issues besides her current job. The viewer gets to know her problems and issues up close. The scenes and dialogues with her sister, her mother, her ex fianc\u00e9 are atmospherically dense and paint a really three-dimensionl picture of the main character and her social relations. Honorable mention: Who knew that Geena Davis could act like that!!?? For me, the best one-person killer movie since 'Leon: The professional', and nearly as good.

Yet, Ava's keen wit, skill as a martial artist, and help from her trainer (John Malkovich) keep her alive long enough to find closure and face all who want her dead.In as few words as I can describe Tate Taylor's latest spy film, Ava is an exercise in character creation only. It is baseless, without story, absent of strong acting, and wholly incomplete. While still better than the vast majority of today's straight to streaming movies, I judge Ava harder because I know the skill of the director, who previously directed The Help (2011), and the cast, known for such works as Interstellar (2014), Being John Malkovich (1999), Selma (2014), and The Lobster (2015).After the first 30 minutes of mostly coherent character introduction and world building, the movies slips into an odd commentary on family life and relationships that have been affected by Ava'sbehavior in a previous life. And for all the emotion and raw exposition, the audience does not feel a single bit of sadness or remorse on Ava's behalf. Instead, the audience is left questioning why it is so seemingly easy for Collin Farrell's character to undermine a full world of assassins and name himself leader. The audience is bored by long, winding takes of one-on-one dialogue that features a grand total of three tripod-based camera shots.Perhaps Ava was an attempt at creating a female John Wick. Had it succeeded through the use of clever writing and dynamic locations and color palette, Ava may have been the action film of the year.

Jessica Chastain's character is concerned with the morality of a kill (do they deserve it?), but we know nothing about whether her employer only accepts hits for bad people or if it's a pay-to-play situation. Who is Duke and what's the background between him and Ava? Who cares if Ava asks her targets what they did to bring an assassin to their doorstep, so to speak? If she makes her kills then why does corporate care if she asks the target's questions? Little reason behind the killing within the organizaation and why the heck would Simon kill Duke (his mentor) if he ultimately stops trying to kill Ava and tries to walkaway? It's asinine and the driving force that should have been there as a result of Duke's death is stollen when he does walkaway. The one good moment for me was Duke, who was lying there dying, telling Simon that he was disappointed that he wasn't going to be there to see Ava rip Simon's heart out. The fighting was mediocre and I didn't buy that Ava was beating up people left and right because it didn't look like the type of fighting required to accomplish that.Her family's story was the only real story we got and her mother was irritating. Her sister was mad she left, mad she showed up and she flip-flopped back and fourth with no depth so that it seemed like she was just mad no matter what.

In this type of movies, this makes sense, and the Malkovich character should understand it. He's trying to be rational in a non-rational world.We've seen it all before and normally done better.

There's a whole side plot that's not really fleshed out about how she used to date Mike, who is now engaged to her sister, but again there never seems to be any genuine feelings there that could make me care about the characters relationships. The strength comes in the action scenes, which are brilliant but the story and the characters needed to be more fleshed out. Why was Ava talking to subjects such a problem in the first place? Why is Simon in charge and Duke has lost his power? What's the back story with Simon and his daughter? Mike is mentioned to have a gambling problem but it's just thrown in there to give Ava a scene of beating people up rather than because it affects the story in any way.

I know I shouldn't have been surprised by the derivative nature of this, but Farrell has long since lost his on-screen charm; Malkovich adds surprisingly little and reformed alcoholic/druggie Ava has virtually no redeeming features to her character to make anyone care whether or not she lives/dies or just drinks herself into well deserved oblivion.

Why was ex alcoholic Ava able after a off the wagon drinking binge able to defeat fellow trained assassin Simon (Colin Farrell) and why did he just give up and walk away after fighting her for ten minutes only to be shot down in the street hobbling away? Why did Ava smoke so much in the first 10 minutes of the movie then nothing for the rest of the movie? Why does John Malkovich (Duke) sound the same every movie he makes? He is very monotone.

Problem (in my eyes) was the plot that did make this flick and all action thriller. Because the tears and the telenovela subplot deflate the excitement, preventing the film to reach an awesome peak that would have made it truly memorable.

I thought she brought a good performance to a character who, despite not being too developed, had enough to maintain my interest.The story felt very familiar. If you're into the action genre, you won't find anything ground breaking here. That's not to say it wasn't enjoyable. It was fun to watch, it just hasn't left a lasting impression on me.In terms of the action, once again it was exciting, but it wasn't anything new. There were some pretty decent set pieces and some good fight choreography, and the action was well paced throughout.Ultimately I'm happy I watched Ava.

Like my heading says, a 5th grader could've written (and directed) this better. I get that actor/trying-to-become-a-writer Matthew Newton is a newb, but to have such an all-star talent line-up, you'd think he would've at least had a seasoned writer proofread the script to avoid embarrassment. His screenplay was riddled with plot and technical issues, it was convoluted, and borderline laughable. Only in the last approx. 15 mins did it grab and hold my attention.To make matters worse, actor/trying-to-become-a-director Tate Taylor failed miserably in directing his cast, and certain scenes were horribly directed. Don't get me started on the lame action scenes. Right from the start, Jessica Chastain was unconvincing as an assassin, and I know in front of a seasoned director, she would've nailed it. Even A-list actors need direction in scenes. With Taylor, her fight scenes were phony, as was her character.I feel really bad for the A-listers having this mess on their resume. This type of filmmaking is more suited for the Steven Seagal and Bruce Willis has-been B-movie type actors. Now, watch seasoned filmmaker Luc Besson's Anna, who cast (as a lead!) never-heard-of amateur actress (in her first-ever acting role) Sasha Luss, and his writing, directing and action scenes will blow your mind, especially compared to this mess! The moral of this story here is, don't blow your money on A-list actors in hopes they will make your film a success; instead, put that money towards film school, then cast a Sasha Luss type newb actor, and you'll have a better chance for a successful film.

There are plenty of reviews already so I'll just add what I thought was refreshing about the film &amp; what I thought could've been better. Most films about assassins - Bourne, Wick, and Atomic Blonde come to mind - depict them as somewhat aloof and mysterious. This film grounds our assassin as someone closer to a real person. A human being with proper foibles who exists among other imperfect people.It's a smaller budget film but the cast is killer (pun intended). Seemed like it was shot fairly quickly but the actual performances are proper top shelf.Ideally the action needed to appear less choreographed. Just as it depicts Eve as a real person, the fights, too, should have been more warts n all.

We have seen lots of films about female assassins and surely there were many that were better than this. I must say though that this new interpretation by Tate Taylor was at least quite entertaining, even if it doesnt come close to justify the great talent involved with it. First of all we have Jessica Chastain and an exciting ass kicking role. She was really good in it, giving her character quite some edge and playing it off believably. Nice turn for Chastain who usually shines and those kind of roles. In the supporting cast we have Common who is rather underused. Joan Chen who really needed a better role, she was the most comic-like and an sbsolute stereotype. Colin Farrell was okay but that role did not really require an actor of his caliber as besides some good athletics, Farrell did not really have to show anything off here. Last but certainly not leased there was John Malkovich who made the role better than on the paper so that is at least something. Generally all of them were fine enough for an action film like that.

It would actually be a solution to the main adversity of the movie, but because the premise is that she drags her work home with her, it's all about survival.Jessica Chastain, Colin Ferrell, and (especially) John Malkovich do an amazing job on rather down to Earth (if a bit psychotic and brutal) action sequences.While there is a lot going on around the story, the real focus, and it's worth it, her just trying to live through the organization she joined which she knows has to end in either her or the company's death.I do feel like the worst of it is just that Diana Silvers sort of got sidelined, but I'm hoping that the sequel will focus on her quite a bit."}, {"id": 588, "text": "I do not understand some of the insensitive reviews given to this amazing movie.

The movie has none of those inspirational cringe songs which are played gloriously when the main character is beating the living heaven out of the bad guy (pun intended). The movie starts (kinda) with a scene of Ava quoting Solon, Count No Man Happy Until the End Is Known. And the movie ends with the same quote too, and not in a shabby or clumsy way that many other nth rated movies are choosing to adopt. The intense emotions between Ava and her mother and their past is absolutely nothing short of delicate. So stop wreaking havoc on this movie man.

No, but some of the fight scenes do have us questioning who will be the victor.I do hope that John Malkovich does more movies in any capacity.

Her past is said to be an unpleasant one but for a movie about an assassin, that's typical. The edits were all over the place, with many scenes feeling disjointed. A good chunk of the first hour is just Ava going through the motions - she conducts hits in different countries, her tendency to question the morals of her cases is highlighted, she goes for jogs, checks in to hotels, and takes messages from her superior Duke (John Malkovich, who has no business being in a movie like this, except for the paycheck). Nothing really sparks interest.And with the movie's progression, I wondered if it was this easy for Ava to switch between a stone-cold assassin and someone who wants to reconnect with her family; one that she left many years ago because of her heartless father. The whole thing feels tailor-made for viewers who seek quick resolutions and instant gratification in their films. The set-pieces aren't bad but nothing too great - the Riyadh one being the worst of the lot. What did surprise me was the short but all-out brawl between 66-year-old Malkovich and a suave-looking Colin Farrell.The film's connective tissue is supposed to be the father-daughter vibe shared between Ava and Duke but it doesn't hit the highs you expect. Part of the blame goes to the sloppy dialogues (the screenplay is by writer-actor Matthew Newton). The biggest problem with Ava is not that it's generic (Chastain is just having fun here), but the fact that we've seen this assassin-taking-revenge plot handled better in other films ('Salt', or even 'Colombiana'). We know how it'll all play out, we know who's getting written off.Farrell looks good but the characterization is so dull that you don't want to know more about him, or his daughter Camille (played by Diana Silvers). The pairing of rapper Common and Chastain doesn't work. The chemistry between the two is practically non-existent. When Ava refers to her mother as 'Ma' and not 'Mum', it felt like a subtle nod to the director Tate Taylor's previous film.

So I watched the whole film this time and decided to make things fair, and it should be 3 stars(or less) instead. 1st, john said '' Ava is the most gifted talent, but somehow she made silly mistakes on every single mission, I wondered how bad this organization was. 2nd, Ava was a drug addict 8 years ago, and her ex-boyfriend asked her to marry him 8 years ago, and now 8 years later the ex already proposed to Ava's sister, wat!??? 3rd, Colin killed John, the first thing Ava thought of was to run away with her ex, yes!!! thats her sister' fiance, then to pay off his debt in the most crowded public, then back to hotel got drunk, umm.... did she know she was going to chase by the organization? But anyway Collin couldnt kill drunk Ava anyway, or I should say refused to kill her and let her killed himself 5 mins later, wat!!!? 4th, there were no plot holes, just really stupid."}, {"id": 603, "text": "This film is centred on Ava Faulkner, an assassin with addiction problems and a desire to know why her victims are being targeted. This latter quirk bothers her employers. Duke, her direct superior and father figure wants to protect her but others, higher up, believe she is a liability. After an operation goes wrong due to faulty intelligence she suspects that her employers want her dead. Duke tries to persuade her that she is just being paranoid. If that weren't enough there are problems with her family; her ex-boyfriend Michael, who is now her sister's fianc\u00e9, has gambling problems which have led to large debts.I thought this started well and was intrigued by Ava's life as an assassin... I assumed that the plot would eventually lead to who her employers were and what their motives were. Instead it led to the unnecessary subplot involving Michael; this felt a distraction from the main story, as if the makers thought they had an hour's worth of material and needed to pad the film out to an hour and a half. It is a pity they didn't pad it with a bit more action connected to the main plot as what we got there was exciting and well-choreographed; the fights had an impressively physical feel to them. There are of course plenty of clich\u00e9s but that goes with the genre. Jessica Chastain gives an impressive performance as Ava and John Malkovich and Colin Farrell are solid as Duke and antagonist Simon respectively. Geena Davis is fun as Ava's mother, although her presence made me think of her lead in 'The Long Kiss Goodnight'; a superior female lead action film. Overall it passes the time well enough if you are a fan of the genre but is hardly a must see."}, {"id": 604, "text": "This rather high-powered star-driven movie comes across as a difficult to review, composite of attempts at a more nuanced, qualitative effort at the by now established Assassin movie genre (La Femme Nikita (1990); Point of No Return (1993); Leon: The Professional (1994); Enemy of the State (1998); Bourne Identity (2002); Elektra (2005); Shooter (2007)) . Starring Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, Colin Farrell along with Geena Davis and Joan Chen, this high-octane action thriller is infused with a stronger than usual relational family element along with the typical professional killer outline and the potentially personal flaws of the main character. All these themes result in a fusion of both a rather credible and off-kilter movie. The beginning action scenes while seemingly overdone and somewhat artificially created for exciting physical drama are in some ways relatable in a connected way by an explanation later in the movie. The struggle that Chastain's character has with a chemical dependency is both a stretch and an acceptable inclusion from a psychiatric standpoint. Her character's struggle with her mother's past history and her sister and her boyfriend are also fraught with incredulity and yet somehow passes the believability test. Colin Farrell as the antagonist and his climatic scene with Chastain isn't really well thought out and rather poorly constructed while the ending of the movie seems to be cut short and underdeveloped and rather disappointing. There are some moving scenes providing nicely choreographed martial arts fighting, some of the best in-depth, substantive rendition of an Assassin movie and yet taken all together, the movie underperforms and demonstrates that it hasn't reached the bar of completely succeeding in its intentions as a great new classic of professional killer movies (The Russia House (1990); Mission Impossible (1996); The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996); Spy Game (2001); The Job (2003); You Kill Me (2007); The Recruit (2003); Salt (2010); Jack Reacher (2012); The Numbers Station (2013); John Wick (2014); Hitman 47 (2015); Peppermint (2018); Killing Eve (2018))."}, {"id": 605, "text": "When i noticed the cast ensemble here, I was ready for something a bit more intense and structured. And with those exceptions at hand, it plays the opposite of that.The films hits as it was rushed, as the actors could not work long on their scenes, and the action scenes where limited by budget and time constraints. The editing also sometimes hurts, as some of the action scenes are messy and even normal conversations are thrown off by stressed cuts.There is so much room here for something amazing, a female jason bourne with a proper story and in-depth personality is probably some of the goals. But it plays of as one mixed the dish together a bit to fast, like someone kept telling them to hurry. Also there is a suspected unbalance of the budget, as it is used on all of its major actors present. And then the unbalance pushes the remaining film schedule into a stressful venture.Everyone in their leads play their scenes as good as they can, the support cast is not weak, they just lack a depth, the action scenes work sometimes but then fails on their next interconnected scene, when it just looks bad. Its like a roller coaster, fun sometimes, but way to long going upwards and then rushed into a short speedy downhill."}, {"id": 606, "text": "Much better than reviewed, this movie appears to suffer from severe critic-itis, where familiarity breeds contempt for narrative and entertainment value. I notice jaded, negative reviews from men, women and user-reviewers. The movie I saw had great humanity and said a lot about individuality. This is NOT a Michael Bay movie of cardboard cutouts. Other reviews complain of soap opera writing. I disagree. Every development of supporting characters bears on main character's development and arc. If soap operas were written this well, I'd be watching them.This is basically Atomic Blonde 2.0. Jessica Chastain watches Charlize Theron produce and star in Atomic Blonde. She says, I could do this; and maybe, do it better.I suspect the bad-ass female Bond-spy-assasain--done with any integrity--starts with Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita (1990), perhaps the most likely pop-culture origin of the Marvel movies Black Widow. Then we have Hanna (2011) and Atomic Blonde (2017) among a few others.Ava (2020) is in this line. It betters Atomic Blonde in its character development and sequel set-up. It falls short of Atomic Blonde in fight chereography. Jessica generously gives the best lines and good scenes to her supporting cast--not often done. Geena Davis has the most surprising character arc of the film.Jessica chose her scritpwriter with care, All Matthew Newton's scripts are about real people with real emotions--not Michael Bay cardboard cutouts. Ava is about people also, bettering Atomic blonde on this count also. Colin Farrel and John Malkovich are at their best, not phoning in their performances.Jessica is still beautiful to watch. Her final makeup, probably chosen from a dozen, sketches is very striking. The end allows Jessica an interesting feminine twist on Terminator unlike anything in recent memory and nothing like Cameron's female terminators. Nicely done I say. Good narrative set-up for a sequel."}, {"id": 607, "text": "Really good one .pace rhythm sustained throughout.redolent of Nikita (1990) or more distantly Colombiana (2011) .... so Besson-adjacent not as good but ...i do not understand the neg reviews .believable main actress .never seen her before.Geena Davis is a Goddess actress.The mother daughter talk is AWESOME best bit.Farrell ace.Malkovich the man with the most annoying voice in the known universe is very good here.Scene out of Le Bourget Airport farcical for anyone who has been to Paris even once; no they do not have tall American fir forests between Le Bourget and Paris but hey.Rhythm Beat is everything.This film has it.Female assassins genre still rocks.PS: Common looks like a young Richie Havens you expect Freedom any minute"}, {"id": 608, "text": "So this film suffered due to the Covid 19 pandemic but has now found its way to Netflix and it seems people are watching it, so I have watched it and here is my review for Ava. The premise of the film sees an assassin hunted down due to her interesting style of work.Main Character Jessica Chastain plays Ava here and she is completely functional in the role, Chastain is a great actress and she does an adequate job in the role. She is good in the action scenes and does a decent job as the mysterious assassin here. But there is nothing unique at all about her character and it is just eye rolling, you are given no reason to care about Ava and when they try and force you to care it fails and falls really flat on its face.Supporting Characters John Malkovich and Colin Farrell plays supporting roles here and they do well because they are good actors but it is just the shame that the same as Chastain there characters are paper thin and not given anything to work with. The rest of her family troupe are awful and I actually wanted to see them get killed, which doesn't happen too often, I thought Common was terrible and really miscast in the role that he was given.Story The story sucks, it is so clich\u00e9 it is unreal. Even now I am still not really sure why the bad guys are after Ava and I am not sure why I should care. This film offers nothing new in terms of storytelling and literally is a tick box of all the generic action stories and does them all really awfully despite a really strong opening 5 mins that is the clear highlight of the film.Script The script follows the story in being pretty terrible, there is no dialogue that is interesting and the story is written so poorly. It is like the writers for this film watched some mediocre action films and thought we can do that but worse and that is what you get with Ava.Style The style definitely has some decent action scenes, Farrell &amp; Chastain (and their stunt-doubles) all do a decent job in the action scenes to make it seem pretty intense and brutal when it needs to raise the stakes. But the film doesn't offer anything ground breaking and new, also some of the action scenes are filmed pretty poorly and that lets the overall film down, I just wish the film had continued the style from the first 5 mins as that is really good but it ends up feeling like an action film you have seen plenty of times before and done better.Overall Overall, this is a poor action film that offers absolutely nothing new to the genre and it is one of the laziest films you will see. Don't waste your time with this film and go and watch any of the John Wick films instead."}, {"id": 609, "text": "I guess there aren't many great actors who don't also do action movies anymore. Some of them are pretty good at it. Jessica Chastain had already played the baddie in one of the X-Men burgers, Dark Phoenix (2019), and here she is in one of those double-crossed hired-gun things, Ava. Lot of choppy cutting around punches and kicks and stuff. As strong as the 5'4 or so Chastain surely is, I started to have my doubts re in-the-realm-of-remotely-possible after she arm flipped the half-dozenth guy over in hand-to-hand combat. I don't know--I'd need to see her with a friend who turns into a giant green CGI Mr. Hyde every time he gets angry for me to fully suspend my disbelief on that one. But, if I'm not going to complain about her slipping around bullets in a floor-long dress, I should probably drop the matter.Lot of tough talk and dead stares in this one, too. Despite her character in this one getting into trouble for being too chatty, I'm thinking Chastain is the female equivalent of Ryan Gosling. The camera seems to love hanging on their silent, almost expressionless faces. The Tree of Life, Drive (both 2011), Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Blade Runner 2049 (2017). They seem like chill, quiet folks to me for being occasional action stars whose characters kill people. By the way, an internet search of the female equivalent of Gosling, as does Chastain and Gosling, turns up more than I would've thought.Come to think of it, big stars have long done blockbuster-type roles for paychecks, but it seems as though it used to be more so in supporting roles, to lend some prestige to such flicks. Think Marlon Brando in Superman (1978), say, or Helen Mirren in a Fast &amp; Furious installment. Here, there's also John Malkovich, Geena Davis and, to remind everyone of a better similar movie (In Bruges (2006)), Colin Farrell. Anyways, I mention all of this because there's not much to say about Ava; it's utterly forgettable.There's some melodrama regarding her alcoholism and a love triangle involving her sister's boyfriend, who also has a gambling problem. Oh, and the mom has obsessive-compulsive disorder, so, I guess that checks off the list of simple traits passed off as characters. One shouldn't expect more from a title and protagonist named Ava as a more complex form of Eve, who works for an organization referred to as Management, though. Chastain's character is contracted to murder 41 people--and she kills even more than that in the process--for reasons unknown, and it's not until she tries to steal her sister's boyfriend that she realizes she's a bad person. It doesn't take that long, however, to figure out this is a bad movie."}, {"id": 610, "text": "The lone redeemable quality of Ava is Ava aka Jessica Chastain herself.

Still far away from any appeasing outcome though.A slackened screenplay failing to deliver justice plotwise which was supposed to be a high octaned one.

When a job goes dangerously wrong she is forced to fight for her own survival.Pretty generic, right? There are only about a dozen films that I can think of off the top of my head that would fit this description. So...what separates this one to make it worth watching?Not much.Chastain stars as Ava, a deadly assassin who...oh, you get it. When the job goes dangerously wrong, she heads back to Boston and into the arms of her loving family - who want nothing to do with her.Chastain is good, but nothing special as Ava...she seems to be able to pull off the physicality of this role quite well (like Jennifer Lawrence in RED SPARROW or Charlize Theron in ATOMIC BLONDE). The head of the shadowy organization that Ava works, played by Collin Farrell, is generically shadowy and Farrell plays it professionally with a touch of over the top acting (but not too much). The great John Malkovich is a spark of energy in this film as Ava's mentor. Mr. Malkovich, as is his want to do, eats the scenery in every scene that he is in. Under normal circumstances, this would annoying, but in this film, it is welcome. Ioan Gruffudd and Joan Chen show up (briefly) as adversaries of Ava and all of these components makes the assassin side of this film work well enough.The family side' of this film just doesn't work - except for one scene.Common is just plain bad in the underwritten role of Ava's former lover who is now married to her sister. Jess Wexler is forgettable as Ava's sister (I even had to look her up on IMDB to remind me of who played this role) and Geena Davis - as Ava's estranged mother - looks like she is just there because she owed someone a favor.Except for one scene.And that's the interesting thing about this film. Right in the middle of this very generic, very ordinary film is a come to Jesus meeting between Ava (Chastain) and her mother (Davis). This scene was Oscar worthy with 2 very good actresses going back and forth with each other (with Davis dominating the scene). I gotta think that this scene was the only one Davis read when she agreed to do this film and was pouting during her other, generic scenes.Director Tate Taylor (who took over when the original Director was bounced when past sexual indiscretions were unearthed) and writer Matthew Newton bring nothing new to the genre. It is all very...generic. The action scenes are professionally done, but generic. The situations are contrived and...generic. The acting is...scenery chewing generic. The ending is predictably generic.All-in-all an entertaining enough generic action flick - except for that one scene (and maybe Malkovich's performance), they make it worthwhile.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10 - it really is a 5, but will add a point for Malkovich and another point for the mother daughter scene). - and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"}, {"id": 617, "text": "It's hard to say what this movie tries to be. An action movie? A spy thriller? A hired killer's psychogram? Jessica Chastain sees to it the latter works, but it doesn't seem to be the intended focus. The thriller aspects are rather bland and predictable. If we consider it decoration only, then one could say it is working in that modest fashion. It is however nowhere near a deep intrigue. The facade of a spygame may help to establish suspense of disbelief, if barely. Personally I found the few drawn out action scenes a bit misplaced, taking themselves too seriously to be a good Bond'ish super agent joyride, but still not realistic enough to hold my breath in suspense. Personally I like female action heroes, but if they take several punches from a trained man (be it just that cannon fodder soldier) w/o any visible effect I can no longer go along with that serious attitude. Not that a woman can't believably win - it's just that they should do so in a different fashion. Athletics, superior technical fighting skills, pain resistance, surprising a male opponent with unexpected ferocity: There's many things I can believe. This very feminine agent however should not be asked to pull off the toughness of a Brienne of Tarth. Not even once. That's just killing immersion. Also it is either unnecessary (for the spy game), or not enough (for an action flic). Overall nothing is really bad here, but nothing is outstanding either. There's several masterful actors here, starting with Jessica Chastain, but it's not the kind of film to really build on that either. Kind of a waste really. Everything is decent, some of it pretty good even, but... nothing is committed to. Ultimately I've enjoyed it and didn't spot any ourageous flaws, so the 6/10 can be called deserved.

Btw, that casting director should never work again. There was no reason for Common. That was a waste of budget. You had two interracial situations for zero reason. All it did was cause distraction. There was also noooo reason for Colin Farrell. He talked a big game, only to be kicked in the knee and shot in the head... and they're assassins? Omg. This movie couldn't get worse. I watched the whole thing to prove that to myself. The whole movie could be summed up by looking at Ava's hair... vapid and cheap. I'm not mad that you wasted money on that movie... I'm mad that I stood up past my bedtime to watch it and it was horrendous. There were levels to the story that was so unfitting, distracting and ill planned. The director needs to never work again. They allows that lack of quality to happen? Ugh. I can't."}, {"id": 619, "text": "Ava (2020) is about 75% chick flick, 20% action/thriller, and 5% what Roger Ebert would have termed a cigarette-smoking movie. The chick flick portions are a dreary mix of alcohol and substance abuse, sibling rivalries, family betrayal, domestic discord, and daddy issues. The daddy issues spill over into and often overshadow the action scenes, where the protagonist's mentor is a surrogate daddy figure confronting palace intrigue orchestrated by a pretender to the throne.The action scenes are well done with excellent fight choreography, but too few and too far between, and are nearly always confined - to a single room, the back seat of a SUV, a patio deck or a small section of a jogging path. They are often dimly lit, presumably to hide cables and the substitution of stunt performers.Political correctitude and inclusiveness often proves distracting in recent films, and Ava is no exception. However, the diverse pairings of combatants in Ava prove interesting, with women fighting each other and men, and an elderly man fighting a much younger one. But #MeToo seems to have trumped inclusion, as the assassination targets are overwhelmingly male.Ava is not a particularly likeable or sympathetic character. She has issues and insecurities, no love life, and tensions with her family, employer and ex- fianc\u00e9. People fear her and respect her reputation, but nobody much likes her. Jessica Chastain does as well as can be expected with the script she's given - a mishmash of familiar tropes hobbled by compulsory woke elements.Smoking seems problematic. Ava smokes constantly and seems to inhale more smoke than fresh air. The effects seem obvious on Chastain's face, as she looks closer to 53 than 43, but also on her physiology, as she seems perhaps ten kilos over fighting trim. Yet she is supposed to be a top assassin, capable of defeating multiple highly-trained opponents in armed and unarmed combat. The fight scenes are well choreographed and Chastain seems to do much, if not all, of her own work. But when the action slows to a crawl, she looks more like a middle-aged soccer mom than a finely-honed killing machine who jogs for exercise, holds her breath for an extended period, and engages in exhausting fights that last longer than professional boxing rounds.While Ava doesn't seem to have a love life, she navigates her way through two bedroom scenes, but without removing her clothing. Both scenes seem more perfunctory than impassioned.Motivations seem a bit murky in both the chick flick and action scenes. Characters act in manners designed to facilitate plot progression, not as one might expect rational characters to behave under such circumstances. In one scene, a character abandons several weapons and walks away unarmed after a particularly tenacious character threatens to kill him.Ava asks her victims if they know why they're targeted for assassination. She seems to have a deep-seated need to know and to justify her own actions, although she seems remorseless. Yet, the filmmakers never realize that the audience also needs to know in order decide where their sympathies lie.Production values are more than adequate, with credible performances by Chastain, Malkovich, Farrell, Common, and Davis. The action plot suffers from a lack of originality, a surfeit of emotional baggage, one-dimensional victims, a lack of credible response from law enforcement which can't seem to figure out that Ava was in each of forty-one exotic locations at the time of high-profile assassinations and also in several hotel rooms that were shot up, and a more credible protagonist who either doesn't smoke or is actually short of breath after intense exertion."}, {"id": 620, "text": "Ava follows, you guessed it, Ava. She's an ex-military assassin who has started asking questions into her chosen profession. Not crazy questions, mind you, just asking her targets what they think they did to deserve a hit. Apparently that's all that's needed to cause anxiety in upper management, enough to put out a hit on their own. Yes, we've seen this story a million times; assassin or spy who is the best at their job suddenly finds themselves on the wrong side of their own organisation and must fight off their own. Except Ava attempts to flesh this out with some pretty solid character building and backstory. The title credits is a montage of Ava's entire life history; from innocent child to rebellious teen, from alcoholic drug addict to black ops, to recruitment as an assassin and a hint of all her past work. But the movie makes a big point about her history before she joined the army. She's a recovering alcoholic who goes along to AA meetings, constantly has her past behaviours shoved in her face by her family, and attempts to make amends with everyone she used to know back home. It does add an extra layer to this typical kind of action thriller, by giving us a truly flawed protagonist who could relapse at any moment.The problem is this splits the movie fairly evenly down the middle, between the assassin conspiracy and action setpieces, to the family drama and character study of a broken woman. The two sides of the movie never meet. The stakes of one do not affect the stakes of the other in any way shape or form. We get an entire sub-plot about her ex-boyfriend, who is now shacked up with her sister, and his crippling gambling addiction. This works for the family drama as it adds extra avenues to explore different types of addiction. It turns half the movie into a story about addiction, the problems it can cause, and the struggles it takes to stay on top of it. But how does it factor into the assassin conspiracy? It doesn't. How does the assassin conspiracy factor into the family drama? We see her struggle with her alcoholism throughout, side-eyeing bottles of vodka throughout the movie, edging ever closer the more oppressive and stressful everything around her becomes. She advances to sniffing it, and then to downing half the mini-bar in her hotel room. And then...nothing. She continues to act perfectly normal like none of this had any effect on her at all. She takes on the gambling den and her oddly vengeful boss while under the influence, but seemingly not impairing her ability to do either in any way. Guess her addiction really wasn't that debilitating after all...?The action is, honestly, pretty dull. There's no hook to keep you coming back for more. There's no sense of storytelling in the fight choreography. It's just a series of cool moves vaguely strung together. Except the moves aren't all that cool either. They're the usual punches, kicks, jumps, and chokeholds we've seen a million times in a million other movies. The camera work for these fight scenes is terrible as well, throwing out all the innovation of recent greats like John Wick and Atomic Blonde, and instead opting to go back to the shaky-cam and quick cuts of the Bourne and Taken era, making them almost unintelligible to watch. The acting isn't too bad, all things considered, but that's hardly surprising with a cast like this. Jessica Chastain proves she's still a very talented actress who's just stuck doing lacklustre movies. She appears to do a bunch of her own stunts, while perfectly handling the harder-hitting emotional beats as well. She single-handedly makes the struggles of her character something we can sympathise with. John Malkovich and Colin Farrell play off each other really well, which is to be expected from actors of their level, while Geena Davis and Common just sort laze through it, delivering their lines without any sense of passion for the quick paycheck.Ava is one of those movies where, at every stage of the production everyone looked at what they achieved and said 'good enough'. The acting is good enough, the writing is good enough, the story is good enough. We'll throw in some neat backstory to make her flawed and relatable. That's good enough. We'll make the reason for her organisation turning on her the fact she asks too many questions. That's good enough. We'll write one musical theme and repeat it ad infinitum. That's good enough. We'll have some punching and some kicking and some shooting, and someone gets thrown on a table at some point. That's good enough. Well, in response to that, I give this movie a 5/10. It's an enjoyable enough waste of an hour and a half, and that's just good enough."}, {"id": 621, "text": "When the start credits role and they show news clips to dubstepish music showing Ava's life, a valedictorian a+ student who kills some friends drink driving (or seriously injures, honestly I don't recall), them joins Army and is recruited into a mysterious shadow organization, I was like damn that has potential.John Malkovich, Chastain, Farrell, Common, Chen... There's some big hitters here.Sadly, the movie turns into an episode of Intervention fairly quickly, and as others have mentioned it's about 20% action 80% Ava moaning about her life, demons and addictions. Honestly I don't care if her father cheated on her mother 8 years ago. This movie could have been so much more, easily, if they went in diff directions with a few simple plots.A drama that masked itself as an action... At 1h 30m still seemed about 30 mins too long."}, {"id": 622, "text": "Just like everyone else is saying, do not waste your time watching this movie. I'm normally not very critical of movies and take them as they are but this is just plain awful.Let's start out with the storyline... there isn't one. From beginning to end it's just non stop killing and fight scenes for no reason. I don't know why they put a hit out on Ava (Jessica) and then sent only one guy to do the job and he wasn't even good at it. I don't know why half of the people got killed in the first place.Her drinking problem had nothing to do with the story but they focused on that pretty heavily, which made no sense and the whole family thing was just really boring and had no plot either. Also, the ending made absolutely no sense, I won't spoil it for anyone who still decides to watch it but it was just plain stupid how that went down.Overall, I gave it two stars because Jessica was a pretty good actress but I have no idea why she would even want to be in this movie, I know I'd be ashamed. I wouldn't recommend this movie."}, {"id": 623, "text": "This recently dropped onto Netflix.The problems with this film in summary: A talented cast - wasted. A boring by the numbers story line. Miscast lead.On this last point. Jessica Chastain plays a lethal assassin, but it's not her type of role. She isn't beautiful, or charismatic enough, to convince you that she could seduce men at a whim.Geena Davis, who is also in this film, played this kind of role about 25 years ago and was way more convincing. As are/were Charlize Theron, or Jennifer Lawrence.The fight/action scenes are utterly ridiculous. There is absolutely no way you will believe she could best anyone in a physical confrontation.It isn't worth the time."}, {"id": 624, "text": "This movie could have been so so much better. It had the right actors(Jessica Chastain, John Malkovich, Colin Farrell &amp; Geena Davis), had some interesting hand-to-hand fight scenes and though cliched still effective emotionally flawed protagonist.But three really really big mistakes by the director/writer kept this move from being a highly rated action thriller.1. Way too much unnecessary melodrama. Her backstory was complicated enough but they add an additional complication which has no purpose in the film just to cast a well known actor. Several times the film came to a halt when this 'extra complication' was on the screen.2. Protagonist makes three decisions that an ordinary dumbest criminal would not make. It is so obviously badly written scenes that it makes movie almost laughable. This is a highly-trained international assassin that been able to be cloak and dagger for many years, please do the character justice and not have them so something on the intelligence level of a 14yr old junkie. Yes, the decisions are that bad.3. Motivation: I have very little reason why anyone is doing anything as there is not enough character backstory to make you care. You cannot appreciate or understand how things are if you never knew how they were. Characters appear, given a name and proceed with an action that you are unable to invest in.While this sounds bad, the acting(Chastain, Malkovich and especially Geena Davis) saves the moves and makes it somewhat watchable...for me. The 1 or 2 star reviews are just people being negative, this movie ranges between 4 star to 7 star depending on personality."}, {"id": 625, "text": "OK. I have never done this before. Reviewed a film whilst watching it.But Ava turned up on Netflix, today, and I already had thoughts on the film so why not.So I've currently paused it around the 14:45 mark.A few things occurred to me. Firstly, it lacks that Hollywood sheen you normally get with thrillers. It almost feels like they had some budgetary constraints. Secondly, It seems fairly straightforward so far. Thirdly, the direction seems a little off, as if this may be the director's first or second film. As an example, there is a singer on stage and everyone in the audience is dutifully lined up, no pockets of people, just uniformly spaced out people (both in the literal and metaphorical sense) just nodding their heads gently to a ballad. It's like the director said, right you lot, stand there look like you're nodding to the music. Anyway, initial thoughts. Back soon.Ok, back now (18:32). Just a quick note. The writer(s) has(have) added a few nods to us oldies (lines like Hey Jude or when Geena Davis is introduced they reference her disappearance from our screens of late and also a nod to the long kiss goodnight). Also, even the camera work looks amateurish. There is something TV movie about this (and I mean late 90s TV movie). Let us watch more.26:44 - So our introduction to John Malkovich....in Normandy France. Now I'm getting the impression someone has pulled strings to get some of these actors into this film because they took a crew to France (I honestly think they did) rather than have Malkovich travel (he is a French resident). Anyway, let's carry on. Surmising. None of that is true (probably). On a side note, you can tell two seasoned actors who know their craft when you see Malkovich and Chastain together.34:45 - I really wanted to know Tony's (the alcoholic) life story. Oh well. Back to the plot.44:30 - actions sequences are a bit meh (well you just have to look at the action stuff everyone else is coming up with to realise this is meh). In any case, I'm getting into it. The big name actors are definitely holding this film up.54:05 - Pffft. Pointless side story with pointless action sequence. I'm now getting sidetracked here. The script is a little bit here and little bit there. It's lacking I'll be honest. I'm really not caring about many of these characters. Still now I'm nearly an hour in, let's carry on. May be the third act improves. What is this film trying to be?67:23 - This film really doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a bit of this and a bit of that but nothing complete. It's got action sequences with moments of supposed pathos. Just isn't working and I am getting bored and uninterested. I can only guess (and hope) soon enough they're gonna throw in a mega action sequence.71:52 - there is a lot of buzzwords to do with spying, thrillers, espionage, assassination....code words, protocols and so on....like there is a big organisation which this film will never get into. Just talks the talk but does not walk the walk. At least when John Wick uses words like parabellum...you find Out all about it....this uses management and such....but who the hell are these guys? Banging my head here.75:14 - you know that scene in Austin Powers when a henchman gets killed and then there is this little side joke about no one really thinks about the henchmen's family, his dreams so on....well I'm beginning to feel sympathy for the henchmen in this film. She's been paid to kill 41 people...but absolutely zilch to kill the thousands of poor hard working henchmen. Honestly, a henchman in this film is turning out to be like a red shirt.86:55 - Ok decent fight sequence and unnecessary let's stop and chat a bit moment but ok that perked it up a bit. Now we are heading to the end. It doesn't make sense what just happened. If I was going to want someone dead, I wouldn't personally do it....if I was the part of an organisation that had lots of people to do it for me.89.59 - acting still good (ish) but simply put this film is frankly not worth wasting your time over....and it ends. Well at least one good thing came out of watching this....at least I can tell others not to bother. Bit of a snore fest TBH."}, {"id": 626, "text": "Initial Thoughts: The first thing that comes to mind upon finishing Ava is Wow... That was bad. This film was the longest hour and a half of horrible hand-to-hand combat sequences with a bunch of unrealistic gunfighting I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, there seemed to be no passion in how the fighting sequences played out and that was only part of the downfall to this film.Going further into passion, or in this case, emotion. There was none. From start to finish there was no true build-up that lead to a fight or an emotional family conversation. Everything felt so bland. None of it felt convincing enough to say, Yeah, I feel for them, or Heck yeah win this fight! The easiest way to describe this film is a cross between the Bourne and John Wick series, but with worse choreography.Possibly the only good part of the film was the story. I could feel where the director was coming from trying to make this a movie about a woman with hard pass who overcomes life's difficulties and becomes this killing machine. Unfortunately, the intention and execution are at opposite ends of the spectrum, and as stated above, causes this film to fail.Before I get to my overall portion I will say this. If you're looking for a film that offers a kick-ass female lead, with a great story, and worth your time. My recommendation would be to watch the film Anna (2019). I don't have a blogged review of the film, but I did rate it 7/10.Overall: Not a very engaging film. For all its many action sequences, this film falls through the cracks for me. Not emotional. Not long enough. And not even an ok execution of the story. This film I wouldn't recommend, but I would recommend Anna (2019) (7/10).Enjoy the show!"}, {"id": 627, "text": "Ava is the newest action picture starring Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark thirty, A History of Violence). Chastain is a very capable actress, especially in dramatic roles. Ava, however, is a role that doesn't suit her. It's a role that involves fighting and many cold looks and a certain amount of toughness (I am thinking about Charlize Theron in Atomic Blonde or the Old Guard) that Chastain simply doesn't have. Ava is an assassin that, we are told early in the movie, has battled with addiction to alcohol and pills. This backstory would be interesting if it had any impact on the movie's events. Let me give you a quick insight. The movie starts with Ava picking up a target and after having a friendly chat she climbs in the back seat and has a friendly conversation with him before she kills him. She asks him why someone wants him dead. This comes up a lot in the movie but it is never clear why Ava wants to know. The whole sequence takes about ten minutes and is extremely uncomfortable to watch. Mainly because Chastain doesn't look comfortable. She doesn't look cool and calculating and heartless but rather confused and a little unsure and trust me that's not the character. After Ava gets rid of the body she meets her handler Duke (John Malkovich, giving his best to a thankless and flat character). We can deduce that Duke and Ava have more than a professional relationship. They're more like father ran daughter. Duke gives Ava her next job where everything goes wrong and she has to run from the people hiring her. I will stop with the plot here but trust me it doesn't get better. Duke's boss Simon (Colin Farrell) is such a flat and unexciting character that I wonder how he made it so high in the organization. Farrell is a very capable actor and he tries to make the most of Simon's shallow character. I can't help but wonder if it would haven't have been a better movie with Farrell's and Malkovich's roles reversed. Over the course of the movie, Ava has many scenes with her family, and part of her backstory is revealed. But rather than doing this through flashbacks, there is a very boring monologue held by Chastain about what happened to her character. Even more confusing is that her ex-fiance is now engaged to Ava's sister. In fact there are so many issues Ava has to clear up with her family that it feels more like an episode of This is Us than a spy thriller. The whole first half of the movie has about one exciting scene, which in my opinion is way too short. It's a scene where Ava has to fight her way out of a hotel after she is being chased by a horde of bad guys. And while this is a very exciting scene and the fight scenes in general are the best part of the movie, we can see that they are staged. If you look closely you can see the actors react to a punch before it even happens and in instance, jumping out of the way, a long time before something is thrown at them. In a movie like this, I expected a big showdown or a big twist that changes the whole perspective. Something that would make the whole affair a little more exciting and at least give us a thrilling ending. Instead what we get is a boring and predictable finish, that makes the whole movie even worse. The only grace in the movie is John Malkovich. His usual calm and calculating demeanor is the best thing about the movie. His character, like all the others, is underwritten. Malkovich makes the best of it and he actually does a decent job. He has the rare talent to change his demeanor from sincere to threatening in a millisecond which really helps his character. All in all, I can say that Ava is a movie that boasts with it's star power and then lets them fall flat. I can only advise you that when the movie comes to theaters in September, save your money and go spent it on something nice or maybe another better movie."}, {"id": 628, "text": "The movie is worth the watch but frustratingly falls in many plot points and execution points that could have made it even greater, I think the makers of this movie literally said let us jump on the John Wick band wagon and make a similar movie that will be as successful because that was successful. But what they did was fail to tell their own story well. For one the movie centers around intelligent and skilled assassins and has all these ingredients for real intrigue but fizziles out with the antagonist and supposed assassin's boss running to a conviniently secluded spot that would facilitate killing him inconspicuous.Even the way the movie ends you can tell they are pandering almost off-puttingly to requests of a sequel, which a really good movie need not do.the even more frustrating thing because it had all the ingredients to be great (great cast, great premise, etc) but could have done better with unpacking the plot and making the fights more believable and compelling."}, {"id": 629, "text": "Bad editing and directing makes Jessica Chastain look ridiculous in the action scenes. Editing is choppy so, we can't clearly see who's hitting who from where and the fighting choreography is so unimaginative that it almost bores you to death with its mundaneness. There isn't a single scene where it makes the audience wow with excitement. It's that bland.On the other hand, the actors' performances shine through the well written drama scenes. That's when you understand why the producers preferred this heavy hitter cast list instead of going with B names and saving some money.However, too much heavy drama causes the film's pace to suffer significantly. It's like we are watching two completely different films at the same time. At the end of the day, this was supposed to be an action movie so, unnecessary dramatic set pieces and monologues disappoints the action movie fans who were in their seats to see Jessica do some really bad stuff rather than seeing her cry in her luxurious hotel room.That's something I never understood either. I thought a black ops operative with a target on her back would rather pay cash to stay at a sleazy motel instead of checking into a five star fancy hotel.All in all, I suggest you skip this one and watch one of your favorite action movies instead.4/10 for bad action scenes, boring cliche plot, bland fighting choreography but decent dramatic performances."}, {"id": 630, "text": "Imagine a Doctor Phill episode in which people start throwing tables and chairs for reasons unrelated to the episode then you've described AVA in a nutshell.Films like this is going to be the reason I start handing out more 4 and 5's.

Because at some point my brain just checked out.A brain that is only paying attention to surface level detail may work fine in most films but in Draction films like this it doesn't work at all. I often found myself thinking about other things during dialog so I often didn't even remember what was just said.But yet, after missing half the dialog I didn't feel as though I missed anything by movies end.The acting is pretty decent except from common. For some reason his character stuck out like a sore thumb. I didn't get the impression he had any chemistry with anyone. He felt like a character they added during post production.For some strange reason I liked this film more than I disliked it so it get the bare minimum 6 out of 10."}, {"id": 631, "text": "Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is an assassin with The Company who has a tendency to talk to her targets before killing them. Because of this, she is seen as a liability by Company management but her handler/mentor Duke (John Malkovich) uses his influence to protect her. Duke arranges for Ava to have some leave, which she uses to return home to address the rift between her estranged sister and mother (Jess Weixler and Geena Davis respectively) but one of Duke's assets Simon (played by Colin Farrell) has plans to eliminate Ava.Ava from director Tate Taylor was a very trouble production, originally intended to be a directing vehicle for the film's screenwriter Matthew Newton, Newton was fired upon revelations of his history of domestic abuse. The movie was then changed from it's initial title of Eve to Ava with overdubing in post supposedly to avoid confusion with the assassin themed TV series Killing Eve. With all this working against it, one could be forgiven for expecting a trainwreck, but despite this Ava isn't bad, but it's not all that good either.The movie is an attempt to mix espionage tropes with the framework of a family drama (think Le Femme Nikita by way of much more watered down Ordinary People). While these two elements seem like a strange mix (at least played straight as this is typically used for comedic effect in films like Grosse Point Blank, True Lies, or Mr. and Mrs. Smith) it does try to create parallels between the family drama in Ava's personal life and her life as a professional killer, but the connective tissue is tenuous at best and the movie is so overstuffed with characters and subplots that it never feels like the drama or the espionage is given enough time to fully develop which leaves both sides rather underwhelming.There are a few good things in Ava. Chastain does a good job playing a damaged protagonist as we see her struggle with alcoholism and estrangement of her family (even if we never get a full picture as to why) and Geena Davis is actually really good playing Ava's estranged mother and his moments of cutting snark but also a very well done scene of emotional vulnerability that does give some level of emotional release to at least one plot thread from this movie. Other actors are a mixed bag, Common, playing Ava's former fiancee Michael I feel was miscast and his subplot involving gambling addiction and debt to a gambling den owner thanklessly played by Joan Chen is so divorced from the focal point of the movie that you could easily cut it out and lose nothing. The action scenes are competent if unspectacular, but they're clearly hindered by budget. This is evident in that the big climax of the movie takes place in a hotel room and feels like a lackluster payoff to the proceedings.Ava is middle of the road entertainment. It's not that bad, but also not that good. It features good actors doing mediocre things and will most likely be forgotten a day after watching it. I do give it credit for trying to approach the Spy/Assassin genre from a different angle, but it's never given the breathing room it needs and feels like two half developed concepts crudely stapled together."}, {"id": 632, "text": "The world of a hitman or in this case a hit lady consists of one thing i.e. to kill or be killed. We all know it is a matter of time before someone retires you but until then they do the retiring. Funny too because all killers do it for money? How much is enough in this high stakes game? Welcome to AVA who worked her way up into professional murder but I have to say for sheer facts she had too much help from Hollywood a bit. Even in the James Bond early movies, he gets caught and in later Bonds, he almost gets killed but you have to do it plausibly or you cheese it up and it becomes corny too. Here we have a sampling of pushing the limit on this genre. Look, hand to hand combat requires strength, agility and working out constantly or you lose the edge. Think: Navy Seals. They don't do what they do part time but all the time. When they do it, its deadly. Ava means well but her moves are too choregraphed for my tastes. C'mon, fighting 10 guys and winning? Training is one thing and luck another but when you longshot odds and become a type of terminator that cannot be stopped well the viewer starts rooting for the bad guys. This picture comes across as fast money to be made and in return the viewer gets some decent fight scenes and some tension however the viewer is asked to suspend belief too many times. I like Jessica Chastain, Colin and the action but keep it real if you want to keep me interested. You would think that star actors that have connections, experience, money and power would deliver Grade A product. For example, Sly Stallone's last Rambo product was a sell-out and one would wonder why? Maybe they all make these type of un-belief stretch movies for tax write-offs? Favors to friends?

It's lacking in flashy action photography for example. The soundtrack is annoying, because it is pumped up and loud constantly while there is no action to be seen in many scenes.
